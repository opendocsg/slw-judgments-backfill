Lee Seiu Kin J: 

1       On 11 September 2008, after hearing c ounsel for the plaintiff and the defendant (“the parties”) on the issues of division of matrimonial properties and maintenanc e, I made the following order (“the Order”): 

 (a) I award the plaintiff 35% of the matrimonial assets on a global basis, with distribution as follows: 

 (i) Matrimonial home to be sold in open market and proc eeds net of bank loan and c osts of sale to be divided in the ratio 35:65 to plaintiff and defendant, eac h party to be liable for his/her refund to the Central Provident Fund Board (“CPF”). 

 (ii) Apartment at X to be sold in open market and proc eeds net of c osts of sale to be divided in the ratio 35:65 to plaintiff and defendant. 

 (iii) Defendant to pay $923,000 to plaintiff. 

 (iv) Plaintiff to transfer her share, interest and title in the Housing Development Board (“HDB”) flat at Y to the defendant. 

 (v) Defendant to proc ure the assignment to the plaintiff of 35% of the debt owed to him by c ompany A (amount: $1,164,414.53). 

 (vi) Parties to keep for themselves the remaining matrimonial assets that are in their own names as follows: defendant’s shareholdings in c ompanies, defendant’s bank ac c ount, defendant’s CPF, defendant’s Central Depository Pte Ltd (“CDP”) shares, plaintiff’s bank ac c ount, plaintiff’s unit trusts, plaintiff’s CPF. 

 (b) I award maintenanc e of $1,500 per month on the basis of plaintiff’s $5,000 expenses but disallowing the $1,200 for endowment insuranc e and deduc ting her inc ome of $2,300. 

 (c ) Costs to the plaintiff to be paid by the defendant to be agreed or taxed. 


2       On 8 Oc tober 2008, the plaintiff, who is the wife, appealed against the part of the Order providing that “the matrimonial home be sold in open market and proc eeds net of bank loan and c osts of sale to be divided in the ratio of 35:65 to the plaintiff and defendant respec tively, and eac h party to be liable for his or her refund to CPF”. As this part of the dec ision has to be seen in the c ontext of the Order as a whole pertaining to the division of matrimonial assets, I shall give the grounds of dec ision for the entirety of that part of the Order. 

3       The plaintiff is 44 years of age and the defendant 53 years. They were married in 1989. They have three c hildren, who were born in 1991, 1993 and 1996. The plaintiff obtained interim judgment on an unc ontested basis to dissolve the marriage on in 2006, after nearly 17 years of marriage. Through mediation, the parties were able to agree as to c ustody, c are and c ontrol of the c hildren and to their maintenanc e. The parties have shared c ustody of the c hildren with the plaintiff having c are and c ontrol and the defendant entitled to liberal ac c ess. The defendant agreed to an order to pay $5,000 monthly towards the c hildren’s maintenanc e. The defendant would also c ontinue to pay the premiums on various insuranc e polic ies that had been taken out in respec t of eac h of the three c hildren prior to the divorc e. These premiums total $19,445 annually. 

4       The defendant is a direc tor of c ompany A, c ompany B and c ompany C. He rec eives inc ome from all three c ompanies whic h total about $16,000 per month. 

5       After she married, the plaintiff was employed in one of the defendant’s c ompanies, c ompany A, doing up its ac c ounts. In addition, the plaintiff was looking after the ac c ounts of c ompany B. The plaintiff was paid a monthly salary of $2,319 by c ompany A. She made use of her salary to pay for household expenses like groc eries and tuition fees for the c hildren. However the plaintiff’s expenses c harged to her c redit c ards are paid by the defendant. These average about $3,400 per month. 

6       In addition to working at c ompany A and c ompany B, the plaintiff had taken c are of the home and the needs of the c hildren. All three c hildren are on medic ation for Attention Defic it Hyperac tive Disorder and the plaintiff was the primary parent to them as the defendant was often absent. The plaintiff c ontinues to work in c ompany A, although on a part time basis from 2005 in order to better c are for the c hildren. The plaintiff stated that the main reason for breakdown of the marriage was the defendant’s assoc iation with another woman with whom he had a c hild. 

7       The first matrimonial home was an HDB flat at Y where the parties lived from 1990 to 2004. It is still owned by the parties and it is presently oc c upied by the defendant’s parents. It was paid for by the defendant in full. The sec ond matrimonial home was at Z whic h was purc hased in 2000 and into whic h they moved in 2004. The plaintiff c ontributed about $80,000 in c ash and drew down from her CPF ac c ount the sum of $108,000 to c ontribute towards the purc hase. The defendant c ontributed c ash of $22,500, drew down the sum of $555,000 from his CPF ac c ount and took out a housing loan for the remainder. To servic e the housing loan, eac h month the defendant drew down $2,000 from his CPF ac c ount and paid another $5,000 in c ash. 

8       The parties agree on the following valuations for the matrimonial assets sought to be divided: 

 Asset Market Value Remarks 

 Matrimonial home at Z $1.4m to $1.8m Outstanding loan $1m 


 HDB flat at Y $200, 

 Apartment at X $700,000 to $760, 

 Defendant’s shares in various private c ompanies 

## $1,300, 

 Defendant’s bank ac c ounts $1,010, 

 Defendant’s CPF $254, 

 Defendant’s CDP shares $159, 

 Debt owed to defendant by c ompany A $1,164,000 Defendant c ontends that this debt is loc ked up 

 Plaintiff’s bank ac c ounts $54, 

 Plaintiff’s unit trusts $15, 

 Plaintiff’s CPF $86, 

 Total Approx $5.6m net 

The parties agree that the plaintiff’s direc t c ontribution to the pool of matrimonial assets is about 6%. 

9       In my view, given the varied nature of the assets, the most expedient manner of division would be to make a single division of all the assets, and based on this, to divide eac h individual asset in the most c onvenient fashion. Under s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter Ac t (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed)(“the Ac t”), I must have regard to all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, inc luding the following matters: 

 (a) the extent of the c ontributions made by eac h party in money, property or work towards ac quiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets; 

 (b) any debt owing or obligation inc urred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any c hild of the marriage; 

 (c ) the needs of the c hildren (if any) of the marriage; 

 (d) the extent of the c ontributions made by eac h party to the welfare of the family, inc luding looking after the home or c aring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party; 

 (e) any agreement between the parties with respec t to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in c ontemplation of divorc e; 

 (f ) any period of rent-free oc c upation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial 


 home to the exc lusion of the other party; 

 (g) the giving of assistanc e or support by one party to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), inc luding the giving of assistanc e or support whic h aids the other party in the c arrying on of his or her oc c upation or business; and 

 (h) the matters referred to in s 114 (1) of the Ac t so far as they are relevant. 

10     In _Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye_ <span class="citation">[2007] 3 SLR 520</span> (“ _Lock Yeng Fun_ ”), the Court of Appeal awarded a 50:50 distribution of the matrimonial assets. The parties were married for almost 30 years and had two c hildren who were independent adults at the time of the divorc e. The wife had been a homemaker from the outset of the marriage (with a short stint of employment when the husband was retrenc hed in 1992) while the husband enjoyed a suc c essful c areer in banking until he was retrenc hed in 2000. During his employment, he was required to be based overseas for substantial periods of time and the wife had to look after the c hildren on her own. One unusual feature noted by the c ourt was that the wife never had the assistanc e of a domestic maid. By squirreling away her household allowanc e and investing it, the wife managed to amass a sum of about $528,000. The husband had investments worth about $230,000. The matrimonial assets c omprised these two sums as well as the matrimonial home, a house sold for $2.45m. The Court of Appeal ordered the matrimonial assets to be divided in equal shares. It should be noted that of the total matrimonial assets of $3,208,000, the wife’s direc t c ontribution was some 16.5%. Another point to be noted was that the Court of Appeal set aside a lump sum maintenanc e award of $60,000 given by the c ourt below in view of the division. 

11     The fac tors in _Lock Yeng Fun_ were stronger in favour of the wife than in the present c ase. The marriage there lasted 30 years, and the wife’s direc t c ontribution was 16.5%, c ompared to 17 years and 6% respec tively in the present c ase. Also there is an award of maintenanc e in the present c ase whereas the Court of Appeal had fac tored the maintenanc e provision in the division of the matrimonial assets in _Lock Yeng Fun_. I was therefore of the view that, in the c irc umstanc es of the present c ase and in view of the sc ale of the awards in other c omparable situations, the division of 35:65 to plaintiff and defendant would be just and equitable.
