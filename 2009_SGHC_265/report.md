**Kan Ting Chiu J:** 

1       The ac c used was prosec uted on two c harges of traffic king in c annabis and c annabis mixture that he: 

 1 st Charge on the 13th day of July 2006 at about 5.40 p.m., in a motorc ar bearing registration number SBR 4484S along Pioneer Road, Singapore, did traffic in a c ontrolled drug spec ified in Class “A” of the First Sc hedule to the Misuse of Drugs Ac t, Chapter 185, to wit, by having in [his] possession for the purpose of traffic king eight bloc ks c ontaining 5560.1 grams of vegetable matter whic h was analysed and found to be c annabis, without any authorisation under the said Ac t or the regulations made thereunder, and [he has] thereby c ommitted an offenc e under sec tion 5(1) (a) read with sec tion 5(2) and punishable under sec tion 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Ac t, Chapter 185. 

 2 nd Charge on the 13th day of July 2006 at about 5.40 p.m., in a motorc ar bearing registration number SBR 4484S along Pioneer Road, Singapore, did traffic in a c ontrolled drug spec ified in Class “A” of the First Sc hedule to the Misuse of Drugs Ac t, Chapter 185, to wit, by having in [his] possession for the purpose of traffic king eight bloc ks c ontaining 2078.3 grams of fragmented vegetable matter whic h was analysed and found to c ontain tetrahydroc annabinol and c annabinol, without any authorisation under the said Ac t or the regulations made thereunder, and [he has] thereby c ommitted an offenc e under sec tion 5(1)(a) read with sec tion 5(2) and punishable under sec tion 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Ac t, Chapter 185. 

2       The two c harges arose in the same transac tion. Eight bloc ks of vegetable material wrapped in aluminium foil were rec overed from the ac c used’s c ar when he was arrested. When the eight bloc ks were analysed, they were found to c ontain c annabis and c annabis mixture. This gave rise to two c harges bec ause c annabis and c annabis mixture are treated as distinc t drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Ac t (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”). 

3       Offic ers of the Central Narc otic s Bureau (“CNB”) had kept the ac c used on surveillanc e on the date of his arrest on 13 July 2006. He was observed to have driven his c ar SBR 4484 (“the c ar”) into 


the c ompound of Sri Arasakesari Sivan Temple (“the temple”) along Sungei Kadut Avenue at about 5.15 pm. The ac c used parked the c ar and went out of it. He then met up with another man, Sundar Arujunan (“Sundar”) in the c ompound. Sundar was c arrying a red and blue bag (“the bag”). Sundar plac ed the bag into the bac k seat of the c ar. The ac c used and Sundar then went into the c ar, with the ac c used driving and Sundar in the front passenger’s seat. He drove the c ar out of the temple c ompound and proc eeded to Woodlands Road where Sundar alighted, leaving the bag in the c ar. 

4       The CNB offic ers c ontinued to keep surveillanc e on the ac c used’s c ar. They trailed the c ar as it made its way to Kranji Expressway, Sungei Tengah Road, Bric klands Road, KJE, Pioneer Road North, Jurong West Streets 91, 92 and 93, Upper Jurong Road, Pioneer Road North, Pioneer Circ le and Pioneer Road where the journey ended with the arrest of the ac c used. 

5       The route taken by the ac c used showed that he was driving around in no partic ular direc tion. The offic ers noted in their poc ket books after the arrest that the ac c used was driving at a high 

speed, that he drove through two red traffic lights and made two turns around Pioneer Circ le[note: 1]. 

**The accused’s statements** 

6       After his arrest, several statements whic h were rec orded from the ac c used by different offic ers were admitted into evidenc e without objec tion. 

7       The first statement was rec orded by Senior Staff Sgt David Ng (“SSSgt Ng”) at about 6.20 pm on the day of the arrest, after the ac c used, the c ar and the bag were taken from the sc ene of arrest to a trailer park along Jurong Road. This statement was rec orded with another offic er, Sgt Chelliah Vijay, ac ting as Tamil interpreter. 

8       The ac c used did not dispute the admissibility of this statement[note: 2] whic h c onsisted of eight questions and answers: 

 Q1: The sport bag that found inside the c ar belong to who? 

 A1: My friend ‘Rajoo’. 

 Q2: What is inside the bag? 

 A2: Something inside. 

 Q3: What ‘something’ are you referring? 

 A3: I’m not very sure. 

 Q4: Why ‘Rajoo’ leave his bag inside your c ar when he alighted? 

 A4: ‘Rajoo’ said later, he will take his bag. 

 Q5: After opened the bag in front of you, do you know what is inside there? 

 A5: Yes. I know. 


 Q6: What is inside the bag? 

 A6: The ‘Grass’. 

 Q7: How do you know is the ‘Grass’ whereby I did not tear opened the aluminium wrapper? 

 A7: I knew it bec ause the offic ers said so. 

 Q8: What exac t words did the offic ers said? 

 A8: ‘Grass’. 

and the ac c used signed on every page of the poc ket book in whic h the statement was rec orded and also against the c orrec tions to the statement and also at the c onc luding portion that stated that the statement was interpreted to him and that he c onfirmed it to be true. 

9       The sec ond statement rec orded from the ac c used was his c autioned statement[note: 3] rec orded on 18 July 2006 by the investigating offic er of the c ase, DSP Sng Chern Hong with the assistanc e of a Tamil interpreter. In this statement where he responded to a c harge of traffic king the vegetable material in the bag, he stated: 

 Rajoo rang me at around two something to three and told me to c ome to Sivan Temple at Sungei Kadut Road to meet him at 3.30pm. At about 3.30 pm, I went to the temple and no one was around. The gate was c losed. He c alled me again and told me to go to a food c entre nearby and asked me to wait there. I parked my c ar near the food c entre and went inside the food c entre. I viewed the food stalls and then went to the toilet. I was in the toilet for about 7 minutes and then I c ame out. Ah Bang, who was a truc k driver I knew previously, c ame into the toilet and c onfronted me. Ah Bang asked me whether the book had arrived. I did not know what is the book he referred but whenever Rajoo brought in something, they would refer to as book. I told Ah Bang the book had not arrived. He then gave me $4000 and asked me to pass to Rajoo. I c alled Rajoo later and I went to a c offeeshop later at Choa Chu Kang. Rajoo rang me up on my phone and asked me to meet at the temple. At 5 something, I arrived at the temple. The gate was opened and I parked my c ar inside. Rajoo arrived then. He was c arrying a bag. Rajoo asked me to open up the boot but I had other things in the boot, so he opened up the rear passenger door to put the bag on the seat. Rajoo c ame and sat in the c ar. He told me to drive off. While driving along Bukit Timah Road towards c ity, suddenly Rajoo asked me to stop the c ar. He dropped off and told me either Ah Bang or himself would c all me later. I then drove off. Polic e arrested me later in the c ar. They asked me what was in the bag and I told them I don’t know. I did not c ommit the offenc e. I helped them bec ause I am obligated to them. They used me bec ause I am a soft man. I will fully c ooperate and tell all the truth. 

(The person referred to as ‘Rajoo’ is Sundar, as Sundar was known to the ac c used by that name, and the person referred to as “Ah Bang” is also referred to in other statements as “Abang”.) 

10     An investigation statement was rec orded from him by the investigating offic er, again with Tamil 

interpretation on 19 July 2006.[note: 4] In this statement, the ac c used mentioned two persons by the 


names Anand and Kumar, whom he had met in Malaysia, who had supplied workers for his projec ts in Malaysia. He bec ame friendly with them and had them in drinking sessions in Johor starting in April/May 2006. 

11     In paras 19 and 20 of the statement, he rec ounted that: 

 19 On one of the meetings, whic h was about one week after the drinking session, only ‘Anand’, ‘Kumar’ and myself were present. ‘Kumar’ spoke to me then and asked me to help him out. ‘Kumar’ told me that on three to four oc c asions, somebody had shitted on them (Rec order’s note: Ac c used meant that somebody had promised to perform a task for ‘Kumar’ but did not deliver as promised). He did not tell me spec ific ally what I was needed to do, just that I was to transport something for him. He further told me that it would not involve any heavy drugs or explosives. My understanding then of heavy drugs was c oc aine or heroin. 

 20 I agreed to help ‘Kumar’ then. In return, I did not expec t any reward from him. ‘Kumar’ and ‘Anand’ did treat me to girls and drinks before, and bec ause of that, I felt obligated to help them. I also made it c lear to them that I would help only if I c ould as I was busy with my own work. The meeting ended then. ‘Kumar’ did not tell me exac tly when he needed my help. 

12     He then went on to narrate two oc c asions on whic h he had helped Kumar. In para 21 of the statement, he rec alled that: 

 21 In around June 2006, I started helping ‘Kumar’ and ‘Anand’ to do the transportation. ‘Kumar’ had instruc ted me to park my c ar at the c arpark of a Sivan temple at Sungei Kadut (Rec order’s note: Ac c used was referring to Sri Arasakesari Temple loc ated at 25 Sungei Kadut Avenue). I was not to loc k my c ar. Someone would c ome and drop something in my c ar. Later, I was to transport the thing to a c anteen along Sungei Kadut, whic h was about 7 minutes drive from the temple. I c ould not remember the exac t address of the plac e. I would then park my c ar along the main road of the c anteen and go for c offee in the c anteen. I was to wait until the thing was c ollec ted before I c ould drive off. ‘Kumar’ also told me not to worry and everything would be alright. 

and when the rec ording of the statement resumed on the afternoon of 20 July 2006, he stated in the 

c ontinuing statement[note: 5] that: 


 23 Although ‘Kumar’ gave me the instruc tions for the job, he did not tell me when exac tly to do it for him. Altogether, I helped ‘Kumar’ twic e. The sec ond time being the one whereby I was arrested. 

 24 I c ould not remember exac tly when was the first time I helped ‘Kumar’. It should be sometime in June, July 2006. ‘Kumar’ c alled me on my Singapore handphone. ‘Kumar’s’ handphone number did not appear in my handphone then and the display on my phone showed “unknown”. ‘Kumar’ instruc ted me to go to the temple and I immediately knew then that he wanted me to help him transport something. ‘Kumar’ probably told me what time to go down but I c ould not remember. I told him that I would go down only if I was free. I also told ‘Kumar’ that I was doing this as a favour for him. 

 25 At around evening time, I drove down to the temple (Rec order’s note: Ac c used was referring to Sri Arasakesari Temple loc ated at 25 Sungei Kadut Avenue) and parked my c ar inside the c arpark of the temple. I alighted from my c ar, washed my feet, and went into the temple to pray. I did not loc k my c ar then. During this period, I did not rec eive anymore c alls from ‘Kumar’ or ‘Anand’. I prayed in the temple for about 20 minutes and c ame out to find a blue or green haversac k left on the left rear passenger’s seat. I did not touc h the haversac k or open it up. I also c ould not remember if the haversac k was loc ked, but I did not c onsider c hec king the c ontent of the haversac k as I did not want to know or have anything to do with it. I did not know what was in the haversac k, but I thought they may be testing me by asking me to deliver it. I did not suspec t then that it might c ontain drugs then. 

 26 I wished to add that the arrangement with ‘Kumar’ was that he would tell the other parties my c ar number and they would then put the thing or take the thing from my c ar ac c ordingly. I was not to loc k my c ar in order to fac ilitate these events. 

 27 I then drove down to a c anteen along Sungei Kadut and parked my c ar along the main road. I went inside the c anteen and had noodles and c offee. I was seated in a position where I was bloc ked by the MRT trac k pillars and c ould not see my c ar. I was in the c anteen for about 15 to 20 minutes and during this time, I did not see anybody going to my c ar. When I left the c anteen and went to my c ar, I found that the haversac k was gone. I then drove off. About half an hour later, while I was driving, I rec eived a c all from ‘Kumar’ and he told me that everything was okay. I knew then that he meant the haversac k had been c ollec ted. 

 28 For this oc c asion, I did not see anybody who left or c ollec t the haversac k from my c ar. After this inc ident, sometime later, ‘Kumar’ c alled me and asked me to c ome down to Johor Bahru, but I told him that I was not free and I did not meet up with him. 

13     He then went on to desc ribe the sec ond oc c asion on whic h Kumar sought his assistanc e: 


 29 On 13/07/06, in the afternoon, at about 2pm, ‘Kumar’ rang me up and told me to be at the temple at 3.30pm. I again knew that he wanted me to help him transport something. I was at a sc rap yard in Sungei Kadut when ‘Kumar’ c alled, as I had wanted to buy a filter c over for a c ompressor. I searc hed around for the filter c over at 2 to 3 sc rap yards until around 3.30pm, when I drove to the temple. Upon reac hing the temple, I found that the gate was c losed. Just about then, I rec eived another c all from an unknown person who told me to go to the c anteen to have a drink and wait for a while. He said he would arrive in about 15 to 20 minutes. I did not know the c aller but he did not sound like ‘Kumar’. The display on my handphone showed “unknown” for this c all. 

 30 I arrived at the c anteen at about 3.45pm. I parked my c ar at the same spot near the MRT trac k pillar, along the main road in front of the c anteen. I viewed the food stalls in the c anteen and then went to the toilet. I went into the c ubic le for about 5 to 7 minutes and then c ame out to wash my hand. While I was washing my hand, a male Indian approac hed me in the toilet. I wish to say that I c ould not rec ognize him. He addressed me ‘Abang’ (Rec order’s note: ‘Abang’ is a term for elder brother) and asked me if the “books” had not arrived. As a c ommon greeting, I also c alled him ‘Abang’, even though I did not rec ognize him, and told him “no”, implying that the “books” had not arrived. 

 31 I wished to add that this was the first time I heard of the term “books” and I believed that it was a c ode but I did not know what it referred to. I believed that ‘Abang’ might have been waiting around and saw me arriving in my c ar. He had probably gone to my c ar then and saw that there was nothing inside. So he c ame to me and asked me about the “books”. 

 32 ‘Abang’ then gave me a stac k of folded money. He did not tell me how muc h it was but he told me that it was workman’s money and I was to give it to whoever that c omes. By that, I understood that I was to give the money to the person who would be giving me the “books”. After this, ‘Abang’ left. I went bac k to the c ubic le again and c ounted the money. I c ounted a total of about S$4000. I then kept the money in my right pants’ poc ket and left the toilet. I c ounted the money bec ause I was afraid that they might ac c use me of taking the money. 

 33 ‘Abang’ is a male Indian about 39 years old. He is about 5 feet 5 inc hes tall. He is slim with a dark normal length hair whic h was not properly c ombed. He has a straight fac e. I did not notic e any tattoos or if he wears glasses. He was in a white and blue t-shirt. 

14     His narration c arried on with the c ontinuation of the statement in the evening[note: 6] where he added: 

 35 I c ame out of the c anteen, with a c an of green tea drink and smoked a c igarette while I waited for another 10 to 15 minutes. I was waiting for the c all to go down to the temple. As I did not rec eive any c all, I boarded my c ar and drove off, with the intention to go bac k to my workplac e. While I was driving, I rec eived a c all from an unknown person. I did not know who the c aller was. It c ould have been the same unknown c aller who c alled me earlier or the ‘Abang’ whom I met in the toilet of the c anteen. This unknown c aller told me to wait for another 15 minutes, as he was on the way. I did not want to go to the temple then and I would have just gone bac k to my workplac e if not for the money whic h ‘Abang’ had given me. 


36     I am now shown my handphone and a phone rec ord for “Answered” phone c all. I wished to say that when I rec eived the phone c all, I saved the number under ‘Tabi’ (Rec order’s note: Ac c used was shown his handphone, and the rec ord made on 13/07/06 at 5.22pm belonging to one ‘Tabi’. The phone number of ‘Tabi’ is 93972437). I saved the number randomly under the name ‘Tabi’ with the intention to c all him later. In the event that I arrived at the temple and ‘Tabi’ was not present, I would then c all him and tell him that I would not be waiting anymore and would be going bac k to work. I did not know who ‘Tabi’ was then. 

37     As I was already in the vic inity of Choa Chu Kang when I rec eived the c all, I dec ided to have a c offee at a c offeeshop. After about 10 minutes, I left the c offeeshop and drove towards the temple. I arrived at the temple between 5pm and 6pm. The gate was opened and I drove into the temple c ompound and parked my c ar in the c arpark. I alighted from the c ar and as I was about to go into the temple, I saw a male Indian approac hing my c ar. I roughly have an idea of who he was. I remembered his name as ‘Rajoo’, or ‘Abang’. 

38     I believed I had seen ‘Rajoo’ before in Malaysia with ‘Kumar’ and ‘Anand’. However, I c ould not remember when or in what situation I met him. I c ould remember his name as ‘Rajoo’ bec ause during one of the drinking sessions with ‘Kumar’, he told me that somebody would c ome and bring something whic h he did not spec ify then. But he mentioned that this somebody c ould be ‘Rajoo’, ‘Anand’ or someone else. This is why I remembered the name ‘Rajoo’. 

39     While ‘Rajoo’ was approac hing my c ar, I saw him c arrying a bag ac ross his shoulder. From the way he c arried the bag, I c ould see that it was heavy. I am now shown a photo of a bag and I rec ognized it to be the bag that ‘Rajoo’ was c arrying (Rec order’s note: Ac c used was shown the photo with exhibit marked “A”. He c onfirmed that this was the said bag by appending his signature on the photo). ‘Rajoo’ c ame nearer to my c ar, approac hing the passenger side. I also went to the driver side of the c ar. He asked me whether he should leave the bag in the boot, but I told him to leave it in the bac kseat instead. As the c ar was not loc ked, he opened the rear left passenger’s door and plac ed the bag on the left passenger’s seat. 

40     While ‘Rajoo’ was putting the bag down, I boarded my c ar as well. I then told ‘Rajoo’ to c ome into the front passenger seat so that I c ould pass him the S$4000. As I did not want to stay in the temple c ompound, I started the c ar and drove off. I was going in the direc tion towards my workplac e in Jurong. While driving, I took out the money from my right pants poc ket and gave to ‘Rajoo’. I c ould not remember if he c ounted the money then, but I told him that it was workman’s money. ‘Rajoo’ then asked me where I was going and I told him that I was going to my workplac e. Suddenly, he told me to stop the c ar, whic h was just before the bus stop, along Bukit Timah Road, in the direc tion towards the c ity. ‘Rajoo’ then alighted from the c ar. 

41     I drove off and headed for Jurong with the intention to go to my workplac e then. Afterwhic h I would wait for ‘Abang’ to c all me and arrange for a meeting plac e to pic k up the bag. During this entire time, I did not touc h the bag at all. I did not notic e whether the bag was loc ked but I had no intention to see the c ontent inside. I did not want to c hec k the bag as I thought it was better not for me to see. I suspec ted that something was not right, and the bag might c ontain something illegal. I had this suspic ion bec ause if the c ontent was legal, they would not need to be so disc reet. Only then I realized that they were using me. 


 42 While travelling, I c ould not remember the exac t time then, I c ame to a stop at a traffic light along Pioneer Road, at the Esso Refinery and Petrol Kiosk. 3 c ars then c ame by. 1 c ar stopping in front of my c ar, 1 behind my c ar and 1 at the passenger’s side. I saw several men in plain c lothes c oming out of the c ar. They smashed my windsc reen and the side windows. They brought me out of the c ar and made me sit on the road. Afterwhic h, they then handc uffed me. I did not struggle during the arrest. 

15     In this statement, the ac c used also referred to the first statement rec orded from him on the day of arrest at the trailer park. He said: 

 44 The statement given by me at the c arpark on 13/07/06 at 6.20pm was read over to me in Tamil. I c onfirmed that it was mine, true and c orrec t. In the statement, I told the offic ers that ‘Rajoo’ would take the bag later. I wished to c larify that the bag was ac tually meant for ‘Abang’. I had mentioned ‘Rajoo’ instead bec ause I was in a c onfused state then, from all the earlier c ommotion. 

and then he went on to explain the presenc e of the word ‘grass’ in the statement: 

 45 When I was asked what was in the bag, I had replied that it was ‘grass’ bec ause I had overheard offic ers mentioning the term ‘glass’ or ‘grass’ earlier. I did not know the c ontext in whic h the term was used bec ause I did not hear the entire c onversation. I only heard the word ‘glass’ or ‘grass’. I had answered the offic ers that it was ‘grass’ in the bag bec ause I overhead the term earlier and I just replied as suc h. 

and then he amended that in his further statement of 7 August 2006[note: 7] and said: 

 58 I also wished to c larify that in paragraph 45, when the offic ers asked me about the c ontent in the bag, I replied in English ‘glass’ and not ‘grass’. At the time of my arrest and during the rec ording of the statement on 13/07/2006, the offic er did read over the statement to me. However, the word ‘glass’ was read over in English and not translated to me in Tamil. So I thought that the offic er said ‘glass’ and I did not c orrec t them. On 20/07/2006 when the same statement was read over to me, I did mention to the Tamil interpreter that I said ‘glass’ instead of ‘grass’ but he did not c larify with the rec order. The rec order also asked me several times on this, but as I was under medic ation, I was not in my best state and did not make further c larific ation. 

**The evidence of Sundar** 

16     The prosec utor wanted to rely on Sundar’s evidenc e to show that the ac c used knew what was in the bag. Sundar was a friend of the ac c used whom he c alled Ravi, and the ac c used knew him as Rajoo. 

17     Sundar was arrested by CNB offic ers after he parted c ompany with the ac c used. After his arrest, he was c harged with two c harges of traffic king in c annabis and c annabis mixture in the bag (both quantified at just below the threshold levels at whic h the death penalty applies). He pleaded guilty to both c harges and had been sentenc ed to c onc urrent sentenc es of twenty years imprisonment by the time he bec ame a witness in the ac c used’s trial. 

18     Statements were taken from him before and after his c onvic tion. His evidenc e c overed many areas, inc luding c ommon friend he had with the ac c used by the name “Sasi”, an oc c asion prior to 


13 July 2006 when he had handed a bag to the ac c used. However, it was his evidenc e on the ac c used’s knowledge of the c ontents of the bag he brought to the c ar on 13 July 2006 that was most important to the trial of the ac c used. 

19     The prosec utor questioned Sundar on the exc hange he had with the ac c used in the latter’s c ar after they left the temple and before he got off the c ar. The use of the term _kanja payal_ (spelt with some variations in the trial transc ripts), whic h means “miser” in Tamil c ame up for reasons that will be disc ussed later. Sundar’s evidenc e was that the ac c used had c alled him a _kanja payal_. Ac c ording to Sundar this happened when the ac c used offered to buy Sundar a meal, and when he did not ac c ept the offer, the ac c used asked Sundar to buy him a meal instead, but Sundar said that he did not have the money for that. 

20     During c ross-examination Sundar agreed with the prosec utor that: 

 Q [Y]ou told Mr Ravi that you don’t have money, to whic h he c alls you a kanja payal , a miser in an amusing way. And he laughed when he c alled you that. How did you reac t, Mr Sundar, when he c alls you a kanja payal? 

 A I too laughed. 

 Q Yes, you found it amusing? 

 A Yes.[note: 8] 

and it also transpired that that was not the first oc c asion the term was used, as the c ontinued examination went on to show: 

 Q And that remark “ kanja payal ”, whic h Mr Ravi made to you on the 13th of July 2006 is a very usual remark he makes whenever you dec lined to buy him a meal? 

 A Yes, he usually says this to me. 

### ... 

 Q There was no --was there anything different about Mr Ravi c alling you a kanja payal that day 13th July 2006 that you found it exc eptional? 

 A It was inside the c ar, the windows were down and it was very noisy bec ause of the traffic. Apart from that, I don’t know. 

 Q No, you don’t ---nothing exc eptional about Mr Ravi making the kanja payal remark, is it? 

 A Nothing different on that day.[note: 9] 

21     The prosec utor then reminded Sundar that he had made statements between 13 and 20 July 

2006\. Sundar c onfirmed that he was truthful when he made four statements.[note: 10] He was asked if the statements would help him rec all the c onversation he had with the ac c used in the c ar on 13 July 


2006\. When Sundar replied that the statements would help him remember,[note: 11] Sundar was referred to two of his statements of 17 July 2006 and 20 July 2006, partic ularly to paras 37 and 52 of the respec tive statements in ac c ordanc e to s 161 of the Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97 Rev Ed 1997) (“Evidenc e Ac t”). However, after he was referred to the statements, Sundar’s evidenc e was that he 

and the ac c used did not have any c onversation about the c ontents of the bag.[note: 12] 

22     The prosec utor then took steps to prove that Sundar had given inc onsistent ac c ounts of the c onversation in his statements. He began by applying for leave under s 156 of the Evidenc e Ac t to c ross-examine Sundar and when leave was granted, he proc eeded to impeac h Sundar’s c redit on four statements Sundar made on 16, 17, 18 and 20 July 2006 and the statement of fac ts he admitted to when he pleaded guilty to the two c harges against him. 

23     The prosec utor’s intention was to show that there was a c onversation between the ac c used and Sundar in the c ar about the c ontents of the bag. However, of the four statements and the 

statement of fac ts, only the statements of 17 July 2006 and 20 July 2006 [note: 13] referred to a c onversation about the c ontents of the bag relating to the ac c used’s knowledge of the c ontents of the bag. The other statements showed inc onsistenc ies and c ontradic tions in Sundar’s evidenc e, but not on the ac c used’s knowledge of the c ontents of the bag. For this reason, I will refer to the two relevant statements and not the others. 

24     Sundar c onfirmed by his signature that the statements were given voluntarily and had been 

read bac k to him. In respec t to the statement of 17 July 2006[note: 14], Sundar’s attention was drawn to para 37 therein where he had stated: 

 We turned out from the c arpark into the main road. I was in a happy mood then, thinking that I would be getting my work permit. But after travelling for about 5 to 6 minutes, ‘Ravi’ suddenly asked if I knew what was inside the bag and I replied negatively. He then told me that it was ganja. I did not know whether he was telling the truth but I immediately told him that I want to get out of the c ar. ‘Ravi’ did not utter another word, he just stopped the c ar and let me alight. I wish to add that while I was in the c ar, I did not see ‘Ravi’ opening up the bag. 

25     When the prosec utor asked Sundar if he said this when he made that statement, he replied: 

 I did not say this. I only said using the word “ kanja payal ”. The --that’s what --that’s what Ravi said[note: 15] 

although he also c onfirmed that the statement was given by him voluntarily and was read bac k to him 

after it was rec orded.[note: 16] 

26     Sundar was then referred to his statement of 20 July 2006[note: 17] where he had stated in para 52: 

 The statement given by me on 13/07/2006 at 8.10pm in a polic e station was read bac k to me in Tamil and I c onfirmed it to be mine. I wished to add that I had told the polic e offic ers then that the bag c ontained ganja bec ause I was informed by ‘Ravi’, while I was in his c ar, that the bag c ontained ganja. I thought that the polic e offic ers c ouldn’t have arrested me without any reason and so I just repeated to them that there was ganja in the bag. 


27     Sundar c onfirmed that in this statement he answered truthfully the questions he was 

asked[note: 18] and that it was read bac k to him, _except_ the part referring to the _ganja_ , and he 

maintained that he had _not_ mentioned _ganja_ .[note: 19] 

28     In the fac e of Sundar’s assertion that he had not mentioned _ganja_ in the statements of 17 and 

20 July 2006, the prosec utor referred to another statement whic h Sundar made on 17 July 2007[note: 20], after his own c onvic tion, in preparation for the present c ase against the ac c used. 

29     Sundar c onfirmed that he made the statement of 17 July 2007 voluntarily.[note: 21] In that statement, he referred to the c onversation he had in the c ar with the ac c used on 13 July 2006: 

11\. I mistaken “kanjappaya” as “ganja” bec ause bac k at CNB, the offic ers told me the bag c ontained “ganja”, I got the impression that Ravi has told me about the ganja. I am now saying its “kanjappaya” when Ravi told me this word in the c ar and not “ganja”. I was c onfused when I was arrested. Henc e, when the offic ers told me the bag c ontained “ganja”,     I thought Ravi said this word to me. But I now remember he said “kanjappaya” and not “ganja”.[note: 22] 

30     When it was pointed out to him that by his statement he had ac knowledged that he had mentioned _ganja_ , albeit by mistake bec ause he misheard _kanja payal_ for _ganja_ , he c onc eded: 

 I do not know whether he said kanja payal or ganja. Sinc e the offic ers said there were a lot of ganja in it, I c ould have told them this.[note: 23] 

and: 

 In the state of anxiety when he said kanja payal , I thought he said ganja.[note: 24] 

31     Counsel for the ac c used then c ross-examined Sundar, with the intention of getting his admission that he was not mistaken in his statement about the ac c used telling him that the bag c ontained _ganja_ , but was telling a deliberate lie. 

32     The exc hange started quite promisingly – 

 Q ... Now, Mr Sundar, the bottom line and I’m putting it to you is --is that your statements establishing Mr Ravi having allegedly told you about the c ontents of the bag being ganja is a lie. I’m putting that to you. 

 A I agree. 

### ... 

 Q I’m also putting it to you, Mr Sundar, that this was one way of saving yourself from fac ing the full effec t of a c apital c harge by stating that it was Ravi who had established knowledge of the c ontents of the bag and that prior to that, you had known nothing of the c ontents of the bag. So I’m putting it to you that you did this as an ac t of survival against a c apital c harge. 


 A I’m not sure if it was Ravi who told me the c ontents of the bag.[note: 25] 

### ... 

 Q Yes. Now on the 13th and 14th of July, in your statements P157 and 158, you had established the fac t in those statements that you had knowledge of what you were c arrying, that you were c arrying ganja, c orrec t? 

 A CNB offic ers said and then I agreed that it was ganja --that I agreed that what I c arried was ganja.[note: 26] 

33     But when c ounsel pressed on, Sundar began to disagree with him, as shown in the following questions and answers: 

 Q Mr Sundar, it’s my c lient’s instruc tions that no c onversation took plac e on the 13th of July 2006 in the c ar where my c lient has allegedly referred to you as a kanja payal. These are my instruc tions. You either agree or disagree. 

 A It is true that he c alled me kanja payal. 

 Q So you are disagreeing? 

 A That’s c orrec t.[note: 27] 

### ... 

 Q Your “ kanja payal ” c onc oc tion, and I’m saying that whole thing was a fabric ation, right, is an attempt to redeem yourself for the lies you had said in your statements that “Ravi informed you that the bag c ontained ganja”. 

 A It is true that he c alled me “ kanja payal ”.[note: 28] 

**The accused’s defence** 

34     He had only primary sc hool educ ation, but by his efforts he bec ame engaged in business in marine c onstruc tion and piling in Malaysia and also managed a pub in Singapore. In the c ourse of his work, he dealt with labour suppliers in Malaysia, inc luding two named Anand and Kumar. When he got to know Anand and Kumar better, they visited night c lubs together where they had drinks and the c ompany of ladies. 

35     In May or June 2006, Kumar asked him to help in transporting a bag from the Sri Arasakesari Sivan Temple to a c anteen in Sungei Kadut. Kumar assured him that there would be no drugs or explosives in the bag. 

36     He followed the instruc tions and drove his c ar to the temple and went for prayers. When he returned to his c ar, there was a bag there, and he drove his c ar and parked it outside a c anteen in Sungei Kadut, and went in for his meal. When he returned from his meal, the bag was removed from 


his c ar. Kumar telephoned him to assure him that the bag was c ollec ted, and told him that there were safety boots in the bag. 

37     Then the ac c used referred to the events of 13 July 2006. That morning Kumar’s foreman, Tamby telephoned him and informed him that Kumar or Rajoo (ie, Sundar, whom the ac c used knew as Rajoo) would be c alling him. Subsequently, Kumar c alled him and instruc ted him to be at the temple at 3.30pm. Ten minutes later, Sundar also c alled and c onfirmed that he would be at the temple at 3. pm. 

38     The ac c used went to the temple and found the gate c losed, and Sundar was not there. He telephoned Sundar, who told him to wait for him. After speaking to Sundar, the ac c used rec eived a c all from a person he was unable to identify at that time. (During c ross-examination, the ac c used 

identified Abang to be the person who telephoned him.[note: 29]) That person told him that he was to go to a c anteen at Sungei Kadut. He went to the c anteen (whic h was established at the trial to be the Hawkerway Food Court situated along Sungei Kadut Way). In the toilet of the food c ourt, he met a person he referred to as Abang. Abang asked him if the books had arrived, and he replied in the 

negative. Abang then handed to him a stac k of money[note: 30] and told him that it was workers’ money and that he was to give it to the person who would be bringing the book. 

39     After he rec eived the money from Abang, he rec eived a c all from Sundar that he would be at the temple after 5 o’c loc k. At about 5.00 pm. the ac c used returned to the temple. At this time, the gates were open and he drove his c ar into the temple c ompound. He parked his c ar and saw Sundar approac hing, c arrying a bag. Sundar went into the front passenger seat and plac ed the bag in the bac k seat. 

40     The ac c used did not know what was in the bag and thought that it may be some industrial artic les or a book. He also thought that Sundar was going with him to deliver the bag. He gave the money he rec eived from Abang to Sundar, and told him that it was money for workers, and then they drove out of the temple c ompound. When they were at Bukit Timah Road, Sundar suddenly asked him to stop at a bus stop. When he stopped there, Sundar got off, leaving the bag in the c ar. He asked 

Sundar about it, and Sundar told him that he or Abang will be c alling him.[note: 31] 

41     At that time, the ac c used realised that there was a c ar in front and another c ar at the rear of his c ar, and he was suspic ious about these c ars. He drove off and kept observation on them. He drove for about 20 minutes with the c ars trailing him. When he stopped at a traffic light junc tion along Pioneer Road, the other c ars bloc ked his c ar and persons (the CNB offic ers) went to his c ar and arrested him. 

42     After he was arrested, he was taken to a trailer park nearby, and was made to sit on the side of the road. He said that at the trailer park, he heard some CNB offic ers mention “grass” and “glass” 

in relation to the c ontents of the bag[note: 32] and he knew that “grass” referred to _ganja_ .[note: 33] 

43     The prosec utor c ross-examined the ac c used at some length. The ac c used c onfirmed that he had asked Sundar to buy him a meal, and had c alled Sundar a _kanjan_ or _kanjappaya_ (a miser) when 

Sundar dec lined. He had said that as a joke, and they would both laugh over it.[note: 34] 

44     The prosec utor also questioned him on the statement he made at the trailer park. The ac c used c larified that he heard the offic ers talking, “they were talking among themselves, and I overheard the 

word ‘grass’”,[note: 35] and when his statement was rec orded, he was asked in Tamil what the 


c ontent of the bag was and he replied that it was “grass”.[note: 36] 

**Evaluation of the evidence** 

45     At the c onc lusion of the trial, the evidenc e was : 

 (i) the ac c used knew that Sundar brought and left a bag in his c ar, and 

 (ii) when Sundar alighted from the c ar, the ac c used asked Sundar about the bag, and was told to wait for a c all from Sundar or Abang. 

46     The c ritic al issue of the c ase was whether the ac c used knew that the bag c ontained c annabis and c annabis mixture. 

47     The direc t evidenc e that the ac c used knew that the bag c ontained _ganja_ was that: 

 (i) at the trailer park after his arrest when he was questioned about the c ontents of the bag and he replied it was “grass”, and 

 (ii) when Sundar was in his c ar, he told Sundar that there was ganja in the bag. 

The evidenc e relating to both statements should be examined with c are to determine the weight to be plac ed on this evidenc e. 

**The accused’s statement that “grass” was inside the bag** 

48     The heart of the ac c used’s evidenc e in c ourt was that he did not know the c ontents of the eight wrapped bloc ks in the bag, and he said “grass” only bec ause he heard CNB offic ers say that. 

49     However, he also ac knowledged that in his investigation statements, he had alleged that he heard more than “grass”, and this has been quoted in para 15 of this judgment. In short, he had 

stated in para 45 of his statement of 20 July 2006[note: 37] that “... I had overheard the offic ers mentioning the term “glass” or “grass” earlier ... I only heard the word “glass” or “grass”. In his 

subsequent statement of 7 August 2006[note: 38] he went on to state at para 58 that “... when the offic ers asked me about the c ontent of the bag, I replied in English ‘glass’ and not ‘grass’.” 

50     Both the ac c used’s statements of 13 July and 20 July 2006 were rec orded in English with Tamil interpretations. The earlier statement was rec orded by SSSgt David Ng with Sgt Chelliah Vijay ac ting as English/Tamil interpreter. Their evidenc e was that when SSSgt Ng posed the questions to the ac c used in English, the questions were interpreted into Tamil by Sgt Chelliah. When the ac c used gave an answer, Sgt Chelliah translated the answer into English. It was also their evidenc e that when the statement was c ompleted it was read bac k to the ac c used in Tamil by Sgt Chelliah and he was given 

the opportunity to c orrec t it before he signed it.[note: 39] 

51     It is to be noted that the ac c used’s evidenc e on the word he used was inc onsistent. While he stated in para 58 of his statement of 7 August 2006 that he had said “glass” in English, he said during c ross-examination that he ac tually said “grass” –: 

 A ... he asked me in Tamil, I was asked in Tamil. 


 Q Yes. And your reply was “The grass”. 

 A I said “Grass”.[note: 40] 

52     SSSgt David Ng’s evidenc e was that during the rec ording of the statement, the ac c used spoke to the interpreter in Tamil, with only one exc eption. That was when the ac c used was asked “What is inside the bag?” he answered “The grass” in English. 

53     SSSgt Ng went on to say: 

 A I then asked Sgt Vijay to c onfirm with ac c used Ramalingam whether is it GRASS or G-L-A-S-S. 

 Q How did you go about telling Sgt Vijay whether it’s G-R-A-S-S or G-L-A-S-S? 

 A When Sgt Vijay answer me the grass, I want Sgt Vijay to c onfirm with Ramalingam whether is it G-R-A-S-S or G-L-A-S-S. 

 Q You are spelling it? 

 A Yes, your Honour. 

 Q So on that day you also spelt it? 

 A Yes, your Honour. 

 Q And what did Sgt Vijay do? 

 A I heard Sgt Vijay spell G-R-A-S-S or G-L-A-S-S to Ramalingam. 

 Q Did you rec all Mr Ramalingam’s response to that c larific ation sought by you? 

 A Yes, your Honour. 

 Q What was Mr Ramalingam’s response? 

 A He respond by spelling G-R-A-S-S, your Honour.[note: 41] 

54     After listening to SSSgt Ng’s evidenc e, c ounsel for the ac c used obtained a half hour adjournment to take the ac c used’s instruc tions on the rec ording of the statement. When the hearing resumed, c ounsel stated: 

 ... I have indeed taken instruc tions and we are not going to dispute the version of the events given by Offic er Ng in respec t of the rec ording of the statement but I have just got one question or a c ouple of questions on c larific ation.[note: 42] 

55     Counsel went on to ask SSSgt Ng: 


 Q ... Is there any reason why you have not rec orded in your statement, in your poc ket book entry and in your --and your statement the whole c larific ation exerc ise whic h inc luded the spelling exerc ise that you indulged in with the ac c used person to ensure that the ac c used person meant “grass” as opposed to “glass”? Is there an explanation as to why it’s not here? 

 A Your Honour, there is no explanation for me.[note: 43] 

but it was not put to the witness that what he had desc ribed did not take plac e. 

56     The interpreter Sgt Chelliah Vijay is a CNB offic er and is not a c ertified interpreter. He has attained Tamil qualific ation up to the AO level, and had obtained a B3 grade. He c onfirmed that Tamil is his mother tongue, and he uses it at home. He had no problems c ommunic ating with the ac c used during the rec ording of the statement, and the ac c used had no trouble understanding him. He c onfirmed that when the ac c used was asked about the c ontents of the bag, he replied in English that 

it was grass[note: 44], and that SSSgt Ng had asked him to spell “glass” and “grass” to the ac c used 

for his verific ation and the ac c used c onfirmed it was “grass”, by spelling it.[note: 45] 

57     Defenc e c ounsel expressed some sc eptic ism over this part of his evidenc e, as shown in this exc hange in c ross-examination: 

 Q This is the first time this question was posed to you and you remember all these things happened that you had to spell the word “grass”, spell the word “glass”, explained to the ac c used person and so on and so forth? 

 A Yes, your Honour.[note: 46] 

As in the c ase of SSSgt Ng, it was not put it to him that his evidenc e was untruthful. 

58     When I review the evidenc e, I see no reason for rejec ting the evidenc e of SSSgt Ng and Sgt Chelliah. On the other hand, the ac c used’s evidenc e was less satisfac tory bec ause: 

 (i) he was inc onsistent over his reply on the c ontents in the bag. In para 58 of his statement of 7 August 2006[note: 47] that “I replied in English ‘glass’ and not ‘grass’.” In c ourt, however, he c ontradic ted that and c onfirmed that he had said “grass”.[note: 48] 

 (ii) the rec ording offic ers’ evidenc e that before the ac c used’s answer was rec orded, “glass” and “grass” were spelt out was not c hallenged and was not c ontradic ted by the ac c used when he gave evidenc e, 

 (iii) the evidenc e of the two offic ers that the statement was read bac k to the ac c used was not disputed. At that time, there c ould have been no room for c onfusion. If the word “grass” was read bac k in English, the distinc tion between ‘glass’ and ‘grass’ was already made c lear to him. If the word “grass” was read bac k in Tamil, it was not the ac c used’s c ase that he was c onfused bec ause “glass” and “grass” sound similar in Tamil, 


 (iv) the ac c used’s allegation in para 58 of his statement of 7 August 2006[note: 49] that “glass” was read bac k to him on 20 July 2006 was not repeated by the ac c used in his evidenc e in c ourt and was not put to the rec ording offic er DSP Sng Chern Hong or the interpreter Ramayah Palaya aka S R Bala, and 

 (v) the ac c used’s other allegation in para 58 of that statement that when his further statement was rec orded on 20 July 2006, he had informed the Tamil interpreter that he had said “glass” on 13 July 2006 was not repeated in his evidenc e in c ourt and was not put to the interpreter. 

59     The ac c used was trying hard to deny that he gave the answer rec orded. However, his ac c ount of the c irc umstanc es of the rec ording of the answer was undermined by the inc onsistenc ies, c ontradic tions and the lac k of following up that I have referred to in sub-paras (iv) and (v) above. I find as a fac t that the ac c used had answered “grass” in English (whic h he knew to refer to _ganja_ ) and that he had not said “glass”. 

**Whether the accused told Sundar that there was** **_ganja_** **in the bag** 

60     The evidenc e c ame out through a c irc uitous route. It started with the prosec utor asking Sundar about the c onversation between him and the ac c used when they were in the c ar. After a stage, the prosec utor applied for and obtained leave to c ross-examine Sundar on the basis that he was a hostile witness, and followed up by applying to impeac h his c redit. After the impeac hment exerc ise, Sundar c ontinued to give evidenc e on his c onversation. All this has been rec ounted under “The evidenc e of Sundar”, and I shall not repeat that. 

61     I rejec ted Sundar’s evidenc e that the ac c used had said _kanja payal_ to him rather than _ganja_ , and I impeac hed his c redit bec ause: 

 (i) by his own evidenc e, the ac c used had been c alling him a kanja payal or miser even before that day, and it was meant and taken as a joke, and they laughed over it. It is inc redible that Sundar mistook those words to refer to the c ontents of the bag, espec ially in view of his evidenc e that they were not talking about the bag at all, and 

 (ii) his explanation that he had misheard kanja payal for ganja is unac c eptable bec ause he maintained that he did not mention ganja at all when he gave the statement.[note: 50] 

62     Sundar’s evidenc e was c learly inc onsistent with and c ontradic tory to his statement of 17 July 

2006,[note: 51] and c onsequently, the statement c ame within the operation of s 147(3) of the Evidenc e Ac t that: 

 Where in any proc eedings a previous inc onsistent or c ontradic tory statement made by a person c alled as a witness in those proc eedings is proved by virtue of this sec tion, that statement shall by virtue of this subsec tion be admissible as evidenc e of any fac t stated therein of whic h direc t oral evidenc e by him would be admissible. 

and the statement was admissible evidenc e that the ac c used told him that there was _ganja_ in the bag in the way that direc t oral evidenc e by Sundar would be admissible. 


63     While s 147(3) renders the statement admissible in evidenc e, the weight to be ac c orded to the statement has to be determined. When para 17 of the statement of 17 July 2006 bec omes admissible as though it was the direc t oral evidenc e of Sundar, it does not mean that para 17 must be regarded as truthful. Admissibility of any evidenc e and the weight to be ac c orded to the evidenc e are separate issues. In a situation where s 147(3) operates, a c ourt must take into ac c ount the fac t that the witness’ statement is inc onsistent with or c ontradic ted by his oral evidenc e. In suc h a situation, it is open to the c ourt to find: 

 (i) that the oral evidenc e is to be ac c epted in preferenc e over the previous statement, 

 (ii) that the inc onsistenc ies/c ontradic tions c ast doubts over the verac ity of the oral evidenc e as well as the previous statement, or 

 (iii) that the previous statement is to be preferred over the oral evidenc e. 

64     I find that Sundar had said that the ac c used had told him that the bag c ontained _ganja_ , and that he was not mistaken or deliberately lying when he made the statement. Consequently, I find that Sundar’s statement that the ac c used told him the bag c ontained _ganja_ is admissible, and is truthful. 

**Conclusion** 

65     The ac c used was in possession of the bag c ontaining the c annabis and the c annabis mixture. The prosec ution had proved that after his arrest, he ac knowledged that the bag c ontained _ganja_ , and that he had also told Sundar that the bag c ontained _ganja_ , a term whic h c overs c annabis and c annabis mixture. 

66     The prosec utor argued that independently of the ac c used’s admission and Sundar’s evidenc e, the ac c used must be taken to have knowledge of the c ontents of the bag bec ause he had deliberately kept a blind eye to that, and that was the effec t of ac tual knowledge, as explained in _Tan Kiam Peng v PP_ <span class="citation">[2008] 1 SLR 1</span>. 

67     The prosec utor referred to para 41 of the ac c used’s statement of 20 July 2006[note: 52] where he stated: 

I drove off and headed for Jurong with the intention to go to my workplac e then. Afterwhic h I would wait for ‘Abang’ to c all me and arrange for a meeting plac e to pic k up the bag. During this entire time, I did not touc h the bag at all. I did not notic e whether the bag was loc ked but I had no intention to see the c ontent inside. I did not want to c hec k the bag as I thought it was better not for me to see. I suspec ted that something was not right, and the bag might c ontain something illegal. I had this suspic ion bec ause if the c ontent was legal, they would not need to be so disc reet. Only then I realized that they were using me. 

68     Although the ac c used said in c ourt that he had no opportunity to inspec t the bag as he was trying to flee from the suspec ted gangsters and thugs in the c ars whic h trailed him. I rejec t this explanation bec ause he had not mentioned in that statement. In addition to that, a further statement 

was rec orded from him on 7 August 2006[note: 53] after the statement of 20 July 2006 was read bac k and explained to him. In this later statement, he made two c larific ations to the statement of 20 July 2006, but he again did not mention that he c ould not examine the bag bec ause he was fleeing from those persons. 


69     I therefore find that even if the ac c used did not have ac tual knowledge of the c ontents of the bag, his wilful blindness has the same legal effec t as ac tual knowledge. 

70     In view of the quantities of c annabis and c annabis mixture in the bag (whic h were not disputed), a presumption arose under s 17 of the Ac t that the ac c used had those drugs for the purpose of traffic king, as “traffic ” being defined in s 2 to be: 

 (a) to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or 

 (b) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph ( a ), 

and the ac c used has not rebutted the presumption that the drugs were in his possession for the purpose of traffic king as his c ase is that he was keeping the bag for Sundar or Abang, ie, that he intended to send or deliver the bag to either of them. With those elements established, the ac c used had traffic ked in the drugs under s 5(2) of the Ac t: 

 a person c ommits the offenc e of traffic king in a c ontrolled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of traffic king. 

71     Consequently, I find the ac c used guilty and c onvic t him on the two c harges that he fac es, and I impose the death sentenc e on him for eac h c harge.
