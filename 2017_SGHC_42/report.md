**Aedit Abdullah JC:** 

1       This c ase c onc erned the nature and extent of the obligations of the Comptroller of Inc ome Tax (“the Comptroller”) in dealing with requests by foreign tax authorities for information under Singapore’s exc hange of information (“EOI”) regime. The applic ants (“the Applic ants”) sought leave to c ommenc e judic ial review of the Comptroller’s dec ision to issue notic es for information to various banks in Singapore in fulfilment of requests made by the National Tax Servic e of the Republic of Korea (”NTS”) under a bilateral c onvention. I c onc luded, having c onsidered the submissions of the parties, inc luding that of the AttorneyGeneral (“AG”) who had intervened, that the Applic ants failed to establish an arguable or _prima facie_ c ase of reasonable suspic ion that the Comptroller’s dec ision to issue the notic es was either illegal or irrational. The Applic ants, being dissatisfied with my dec ision, have appealed. 

**Background** 

2       These proc eedings arose out of tax investigations c onduc ted by NTS, the national tax administration agenc y of the Republic of Korea, in respec t of the Applic ants and related c ompanies. On 23 September 2013, as part of its investigation proc ess, NTS submitted a letter of request for information (“the Request”) to the Comptroller pursuant to Artic le 25(1) of the Convention between the Republic of Singapore and the Republic of Korea for the Avoidanc e of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fisc al Evasion with respec t to Taxes on Inc ome, whic h was c onc luded on 6 November 1969, as amended by the Protoc ol Amending the Convention whic h was signed on 24 May 2010 and took effec t on 28 June 2013 (“the Convention”). Artic le 25 of the Convention, whic h is c entral to this 


dispute, reads in full: 

1\. The c ompetent authorities of the Contrac ting States shall exc hange suc h information as is foreseeably relevant for c arrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforc ement of the domestic laws c onc erning taxes of every kind and desc ription imposed on behalf of the Contrac ting States, or of their politic al subdivisions or loc al authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not c ontrary to the Convention. The exc hange of information is not restric ted by Artic les 1 and 2. 

2\. Any information rec eived under paragraph 1 by a Contrac ting State shall be treated as sec ret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disc losed only to persons or authorities (inc luding c ourts and administrative bodies) c onc erned with the assessment or c ollec tion of, the enforc ement or prosec ution in respec t of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Suc h persons or authorities shall use the information only for suc h purposes. They may disc lose the information in public c ourt proc eedings or in judic ial dec isions. 

3\. In no c ase shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be c onstrued so as to impose on a Contrac ting State the obligation: 

 (a) to c arry out administrative measures at varianc e with the laws and administrative prac tic e of that or of the other Contrac ting State; 

 (b) to supply information whic h is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal c ourse of the administration of that or of the other Contrac ting State; 

 (c ) to supply information whic h would disc lose any trade, business, industrial, c ommerc ial or professional sec ret or trade proc ess, or information, the disc losure of whic h would be c ontrary to public polic y ( ordre public ). 

4\. If information is requested by a Contrac ting State in ac c ordanc e with this Artic le, the other     Contrac ting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need suc h information for its own tax purposes. The obligation c ontained in the prec eding sentenc e is subjec t to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no c ase shall suc h limitations be c onstrued to permit a Contrac ting State to dec line to supply information solely bec ause it has no domestic interest in suc h information. 

5\. In no c ase shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be c onstrued to permit a Contrac ting State to dec line to supply information solely bec ause the information is held by a bank, other financ ial institution, nominee or person ac ting in an agenc y or a fiduc iary c apac ity or bec ause it relates to ownership interests in a person. 

3       Artic le 25 of the Convention is inc orporated into domestic legislation through s 105D of the Inc ome Tax Ac t (Cap 134, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ITA”), whic h states: 

 Request for information 

 105D.—(1) The c ompetent authority under a presc ribed arrangement may make a request to the Comptroller for information c onc erning the tax position of any person in ac c ordanc e with — 

 ( a ) if it is an avoidanc e of double taxation arrangement, the EOI provision of that 


 arrangement; or 

 ( b ) if it is an EOI arrangement, the provisions of that arrangement. 

 (2) Unless the Comptroller otherwise permits, the request must set out the information presc ribed in the Eighth Sc hedule. 

 (3) Every request shall be subjec t to and dealt with in ac c ordanc e with the terms of the presc ribed arrangement. 

 (4) For the purposes of subsec tion (3), the terms of the presc ribed arrangement shall not be c onstrued in suc h a way as to prevent the Comptroller from c omplying with, or to permit him to dec line to c omply with, a request for information merely bec ause — 

 ( a ) Singapore does not need the information for its own tax purposes; or 

 ( b ) the information is held by a bank or other financ ial institution, a nominee or a person ac ting in an agenc y or a fiduc iary c apac ity, or it relates to the ownership interests in an entity. 

4       It was c ommon ground between the parties that the Convention is a “presc ribed arrangement” and that NTS is a “c ompetent authority” as defined in s 105A(1) of the ITA. 

5       The information sought by NTS in the Request c an broadly be c ategorised into two groups. First, NTS sought information regarding stipulated bank ac c ounts of 5 individuals, inc luding the 1st, 2nd and 4th Applic ants, and 11 c ompanies. For these ac c ounts, NTS provided the spec ific bank name, ac c ount number, and ac c ount holder details. Sec ond, NTS also sought information relating to unidentified bank ac c ounts of the 5 individuals and 51 c ompanies in the Singapore branc hes of Woori Bank (“Woori”) and the Union Bank of Switzerland Aktiengesellsc haft (“UBS AG”). The sc ope of information sought for both c ategories inc luded the following doc uments for the period between 1 January 2003 and the present: 

 (a) Periodic bank statements; 

 (b) Copies of the opening ac c ount c ontrac ts, signature c ards, and personal information of agents or c onsignees; 

 (c ) Copies of c anc elled c heques, deposit slips, wire transfers of other deposits or withdrawal doc uments for all transac tions; and 

 (d) Copies of c ertific ates of deposits, safe deposit box c ontrac ts, loan doc uments or any other doc uments evidenc ing transac tions whic h are reflec ted in the ac c ounts’ rec ords. 

6       On 7 November 2013, the Comptroller wrote to NTS seeking c larific ations regarding the Request. Amongst other things, the Comptroller sought information c onc erning the legality and tax implic ations of Korean taxpayers owning offshore c ompanies, explanations of the alleged tax evasion sc heme by the Korean taxpayers listed in the Request, and evidenc e to show that the c ompanies stated in the Request had been used to rec eive unreported inc ome. NTS replied on 16 Dec ember 

2013\. Based on the information provided by NTS, the Comptroller grouped the 51 c ompanies (of whic h bank ac c ount details were sought in the Request) into three groups and, on 17 January 2014, sent a sec ond letter to NTS requesting further evidenc e c hiefly in respec t of the c onnec tions between the 


1st Applic ant and the c ompanies in one of the groups (“the Sec ond Letter”). 

7       Thereafter, a meeting between staff members of the Comptroller and NTS was held in Korea on 21 and 22 January 2014. The agenda of the meeting was to disc uss various issues c onc erning the EOI regime, inc luding the Request. On the first day of the meeting ( _ie_ 21 January 2014), two material exc hanges between the authorities oc c urred. First, NTS made a spec ific request for information relating to a bank ac c ount of one of the c ompanies identified in the Request with OverseaChinese Banking Corporation Limited (“OCBC”). Sec ond, NTS provided doc uments seeking to address the Comptroller’s further queries raised in its Sec ond Letter. 

8       Subsequent to the exc hanges, the Comptroller issued notic es for the disc losure of banking ac tivity relating to the Applic ants in the exerc ise of its powers under ss 65B and 105F of the ITA. These notic es were issued on 21 January 2014 to Woori (“21 January Notic e”), and on 27 January 2014 to UBS AG and OCBC (“27 January Notic e”) (c ollec tively, “the Notic es”). 

9       On 11 February 2014, the Applic ants filed the present applic ation in Originating Summons No 106 of 2014 (“OS”) seeking, amongst others, a prohibitory order and a quashing order against the Comptroller and the Notic es. The Applic ants also sought stay of proc eedings pending determination of the Applic ants’ tax residenc y and/or tax liability in Korea by the National Tax Tribunal of the Republic of Korea (“NTT”). 

**The Applicant’s Case** 

10     The Applic ants submitted that the Comptroller ac ted illegally and/or irrationally in issuing the Notic es as it failed to make suffic ient prior inquiry into the c omplianc e of the Request with the Eighth Sc hedule of the ITA, and/or the requirement under Artic le 25 of the Convention that the requested information be “foreseeably relevant” to the administration of the Convention or the requesting state’s domestic tax laws. Spec ific ally, the Comptroller took into ac c ount irrelevant fac tors and failed to c onsider relevant ones suc h as the developments in Korea subsequent to the Request whic h rendered the basis of the Request questionable. The Applic ants also argued that the Comptroller breac hed its duty to ensure that the Request was “c lear, spec ific , and legitimate” before issuing the Notic es, and did not appropriately balanc e the Applic ants’ rights to privac y and c onfidentiality against the Comptroller’s desire to enhanc e international tax c ooperation through an effic ient EOI regime. These inadequac ies were partic ularly egregious bec ause of the sweeping sc ope of the information sought by NTS under the Request. Lastly, the Applic ants argued that the Comptroller improperly delegated its dec ision-making powers as it reproduc ed the Request in its entirety, and ac c eded to the Request without suffic ient inquiry. 

**The Respondent’s Case** 

11     The Comptroller ac c epted that an exerc ise of its statutory power to issue notic es for information under ss 65B and 105F of the ITA is susc eptible to judic ial review. However, the Comptroller maintained that the Applic ants failed to show a _prima facie_ c ase of reasonable suspic ion that its issuanc e of the Notic es was illegal, irrational, and/or an improper delegation of dec isionmaking powers. This was bec ause, based on the Comptroller’s enquiries and independent assessment, the information sought by NTS in its Request satisfied the requirements of the Eighth Sc hedule of the ITA and the threshold of foreseeable relevanc e in Artic le 25(1) of the Convention, both of whic h should be assessed exc lusively as at the date of the Request. Ac c ordingly, the Respondent was justified in issuing the Notic es under ss 65B and 105F of the ITA. There is no distinc t or additional legal requirement that requests for information must be “c lear, spec ific , and legitimate”. Nor is there a disc rete legal duty on the Comptroller to balanc e the rights of individuals against the desire to 


enhanc e international tax c ooperation in respec t of every partic ular request for information. 

12     In relation to the Applic ants’ prayer for stay of proc eedings pending tax litigation in Korea, the Comptroller argued that this prayer should be rejec ted as a matter of authority and polic y, and in any event there was no legal basis for suc h an order. 

**The AG’s Intervention** 

13     By letter dated 4 August 2016, the AG applied to intervene in this applic ation c iting the public interest in the c onstruc tion of Artic le 25 of the Convention and the newly-introduc ed ss 65B and 105D of the ITA. 

14     The AG’s submissions foc used on the issues of law and c onstruc tion under the ITA and Artic le 25 of the Convention, and were largely aligned with those of the Comptroller’s. In partic ular, the AG submitted that, on proper c onstruc tion of the Convention and the ITA, a request for information would be valid as a matter of law if it c omplied with the requirements under the Eighth Sc hedule of the ITA and if the Comptroller was satisfied that the requested information was “foreseeably relevant” to the administration of the Convention or domestic tax laws. This standard of foreseeable relevanc e is to be assessed as at the time of rec eipt of the request and is intended to be broad and readily satisfied, in order to fac ilitate EOI to the widest possible extent. Further, in light of legislative intent to streamline and expedite the EOI proc ess, the Comptroller does not have a duty to go behind the fac e of a request for information and examine the verac ity of statements provided by a requesting State. Neither the “c lear, spec ific and legitimate” request test, nor the balanc ing exerc ise between the rights of individuals and the need for an effec tive EOI regime, is an additional or distinc t requirement for the Comptroller to assess in respec t of eac h request for information. Lastly, the AG submitted that the mec hanism of judic ial review should not be so burdensome and time-c onsuming as to impede the EOI proc ess and frustrate foreign tax investigations. 

**The Decision** 

**_Exchange of Information Regime_** 

15     The EOI regime has been desc ribed as “a key aspec t of the global c ooperation in the fight against tax evasion and the protec tion of the integrity of tax systems” (per Edmund Leow JC in _AXY v Comptroller of Income Tax_ <span class="citation">[2016] 1 SLR 616</span> (“ _AXY v CIT_ ”) at [1]). The regime empowers the Comptroller to exerc ise its statutory powers under the ITA, on request by a foreign tax authority, to obtain and deliver information for the purpose of assisting that foreign tax authority in the administration of its tax treaty with Singapore, or its domestic tax laws. The inc reasing ac c eptanc e of this regime in jurisdic tions ac ross the world is an exc eption to the “age-old and universally rec ognised princ iple that one sovereign does not assist another in the c ollec tion of their taxes”, and is a response to the heightened impetus for tax authorities to c lamp down on evasive tax prac tic es that exploit the inc ongruities between tax laws and prac tic es ac ross jurisdic tions ( _AXY v CIT_ at [6]-[7]). Against this bac kdrop, our c ourts have rec ognised that an effic ient EOI regime is “c ruc ial in allowing c ountries to obtain the nec essary information on the offshore assets of their taxpayers to enable them to investigate possible allegations of tax evasion properly” ( _AXY v CIT_ at [7]). 

16     The history of the legislative framework for the EOI regime in Singapore has been set out by the Court of Appeal in _ABU v Comptroller of Income Tax_ <span class="citation">[2015] 2 SLR 420</span> (“ _ABU v CIT_ ”) at [23]-[32] and by Leow JC in _AXY v CIT_ at [1]-[15]. In brief, in 2009, Singapore endorsed Artic le 26 of the OECD Model Convention with respec t to Taxes on Inc ome and on Capital (“Model Convention”) following its adoption as an internationally agreed standard for EOI in 2008. Tax treaties between Singapore and 


her partners were amended to inc orporate Artic le 26 of the Model Convention. Ac c ordingly, in order to implement the new EOI regime and give effec t to Singapore’s obligations under the amended tax treaties, the Inc ome Tax (Amendment) (Exc hange of Information) Ac t 2009 (Ac t 24 of 2009) was enac ted (“the 2009 Amendments”). 

17     Under the 2009 Amendments, the most signific ant c hange was the removal of the “domestic interest” c ondition, under whic h the Comptroller c ould only gather and exc hange with treaty partners information that was protec ted by banking and trust c onfidentiality laws, if suc h information was c onc urrently relevant to the enforc ement of Singapore’s domestic tax laws. In its plac e, a new requirement was imposed – if the Comptroller was of the opinion that the requested information was protec ted under s 47 of the Banking Ac t (Cap 19, 2008 Rev Ed) or s 49 of the Trust Companies Ac t (Cap 336, 2006 Rev Ed), the Comptroller would be obliged to apply to the High Court for an order under the then-existing s 105J(2) of the Inc ome Tax Ac t (Cap 134, 2008 Rev Ed). Disc losure would only be permitted if the c ourt was satisfied that the stipulated legislative requirements in the ITA were met. 

18     In 2013, following a c omprehensive review, signific ant c hanges were again made to the ITA to broaden the powers of the Comptroller and streamline the EOI regime. By the Inc ome Tax (Amendment) Ac t 2013 (Ac t 19 of 2013), whic h repealed Part XXB of the ITA, the requirement that the Comptroller obtain an order of Court prior to ac c essing protec ted information from financ ial institutions was removed (“the 2013 Amendments”). The rationale for this amendment is apparent. As the Senior Minister of State for Financ e explained at the Sec ond Reading of the Inc ome Tax (Amendment) Bill 2013: “we will allow IRAS to obtain information protec ted under the Banking Ac t and Trust Companies Ac t for EOI purposes without having to seek a Court Order. This is aimed at streamlining EOI administration”. 

19     Taking the above together, the two signific ant amendments to the EOI regime c odified in the ITA are (1) the 2009 Amendments whic h removed the “domestic interest” c ondition; and (2) the 2013 Amendments whic h removed the requirement that the Comptroller obtain a c ourt order before ac c essing protec ted information from financ ial institutions pursuant to a request for information. These amendments had the overall effec t of vesting signific ant c ontrol over the enhanc ed EOI regime in the Comptroller. Notwithstanding these amendments, it was expressly c larified in Parliament in 2013 that, as a safeguard against any arbitrary exerc ise of powers by the Comptroller, in addition to the right to make representations to the Comptroller, “[t]axpayers still have ac c ess to the judic ial proc ess through a judic ial review” ( _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (21 Oc tober 2013) vol 90 (Josephine Teo, Senior Minister of State for Financ e) (“ _Debates 2013_ ”)). 

**_Judicial Review_** 

_Standard of Review in Leave Applications_ 

20     Leave may be granted for judic ial review if and only if, amongst others, the material before the c ourt disc loses an arguable or _prima facie_ c ase of reasonable suspic ion in favour of granting the remedies sought by the applic ant ( _Jeyaretnam Kenneth Andrew v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">[2014] 1 SLR 345</span> at [5]; _Muhammad Ridzuan bin Mohd Ali v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">[2015] 5 SLR 1222</span> at [32]). 

21     This standard for leave has been desc ribed as “a very low threshold” ( _Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for Information and the Arts_ <span class="citation">[1996] 1 SLR(R) 294</span> at [22]). It suffic es “if there appears to be a point whic h might, on further c onsideration, turn out to be an arguable c ase in favour of granting to the applic ant the relief c laimed” ( _Public Service Commission v Lai Swee Lin Linda_ <span class="citation">[2001] 1 SLR(R) 133</span> (“ _Linda Lai_ ”) at [22]). However, the fac t that this standard is easily satisfied does not mean that it is 


only a _pro forma_ requirement. The underlying purpose of the leave applic ation is “to be a means of filtering out groundless or hopeless c ases at an early stage, and its aim is to prevent a wasteful use of judic ial time and to protec t public bodies from harassment (whether intentional or otherwise) that might arise from a need to delay implementing dec isions, where the legality of suc h dec isions is being c hallenged” ( _Linda Lai_ at [23]). Loc al c ourts have thus not hesitated to strike out unmeritorious c ases, even at the leave stage, if it transpires that the applic ant has no reasonable prospec t of suc c ess (see _eg_ , _Kang Ngah Wei v Commander of Traffic Police_ <span class="citation">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 14</span>; _Pang Chen Suan v Commissioner for Labour_ <span class="citation">[2007] 4 SLR(R) 557</span>). 

_The Interface between Judicial Review and the EOI Regime_ 

22     In framing their arguments before me, there was some disagreement between the parties about the effec t of the 2013 Amendments on the c ourt’s and the Comptroller’s respec tive roles in the EOI regime. The Applic ants argued that the requisite legal tests in the ITA and the Convention for the disc losure of their protec ted information should bear a similar, if not stric ter, interpretation after the 2013 Amendments as the Comptroller has now bec ome the taxpayer’s only safeguard against wrongful disc losure of protec ted information. The Comptroller and the AG both submitted that the same obligations and c onsiderations that were previously applic able to the c ourt should now be applic able to the Comptroller. 

23     In my view, while the 2013 Amendments c hanged the identity of the authority assessing the EOI requests, the requirements have not been substantively altered. As earlier noted, the legislative purpose of the 2013 Amendments is to streamline the EOI proc ess by removing the need for c ourt orders, whic h has been desc ribed as “a somewhat c umbersome proc ess” ( _AXY v CIT_ at [11]). The Comptroller was intended to extend the same safeguards over taxpayers’ interest in c onfidentiality by subjec ting requests for information to the same substantive standards as had been the c ase prior to the 2013 Amendments. This was in rec ognition of the fac t that the Comptroller had “[i]n the last four years ... in fac t, gained valuable experienc e in EOI administration, and is now well-plac ed to evaluate and assist on requests in line with the internationally-agreed [standard for EOI c ontained in the Convention]” ( _Debates 2013_ ). Therefore, it is not c orrec t to argue that a stric ter (or looser) standard is applic able to the Comptroller. 

24     What has c hanged is the role of the c ourt. While the Comptroller’s approac h to assessing requests for information may be guided by the c ourt’s position vis-à-vis its own role prior to the 2013 Amendments (see _eg_ , _ABU v CIT_ ), the c ourt now has to examine the Comptroller’s dec isions through the lens of judic ial review, rather than substantively assess the basis for the request of information itself. This c hange in perspec tive is c ritic al. A c ourt exerc ising judic ial review generally examines the dec ision-making and not the substantive dec ision itself, and refrains from substituting the dec ision ac tually taken with its own view of how best to exerc ise a disc retion or power. As Andrew Ang J stated in _ACC v CIT_ <span class="citation">[2010] 1 SLR 273</span> (at [21]): 

 It is well established that in judic ial review, the c ourt is c onc erned not with the merits of the dec ision but the proc ess by whic h the dec ision has been made... This is bec ause judic ial review is not an appeal from a dec ision and the c ourt c annot substitute its disc retion for that of the public body nor c an it quash a dec ision on the basis that the c ourt would not have arrived at that dec ision or that some other dec ision would have been a better one. 

25     Ac c ordingly, the c entral issue in this applic ation was whether the Applic ants suc c eeded in showing an arguable or _prima facie_ c ase of reasonable suspic ion that the Comptroller’s issuanc e of the Notic es pursuant to the Request satisfied any ground for judic ial review. The determination as to whether suc h grounds were satisfied was in turn measured against the duties and obligations plac ed 


on the Comptroller, whic h was c odified in the ITA and the Convention as inc orporated into domestic law by s 105D of the ITA. Case law prior to the 2013 Amendments on the c ourts’ role in reviewing requests for information remained relevant in informing the Comptroller’s role under the present EOI regime, and therefore with nec essary modific ation, to the c ourts’ analysis in judic ial review. Bearing these in mind, it was c lear that the Comptroller had not ac ted, as the Applic ants c laimed, in breac h of the terms of the statutory powers c onferred upon it, without proper c onsideration of the fac ts, or in improper delegation of its statutory disc retion. 

**_Illegality_** 

26     Illegality in judic ial review is c onc erned with whether the Comptroller “has been guilty of an error of law” in issuing the Notic es (per Lord Roskill in _Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service_ [1985] AC 374 at 414F). The Applic ants argued that the Comptroller failed to properly evaluate and/or make suffic ient inquiry into whether the Request c omplied with (a) the Eighth Sc hedule of the ITA as required by s 105D(2) of the ITA, (b) the test of foreseeable relevanc e c ontained in Artic le 25 of the Convention read with s 105D(3) of the ITA, and (c ) the c ondition that the Request be “c lear, spec ific and legitimate” grounded in a Parliamentary debate. The Applic ants also argued that the Comptroller ought to have balanc ed their interests against its own desire for an effic ient EOI regime. They further alleged that the Comptroller improperly delegated its dec isionmaking powers to NTS. These arguments will be c onsidered in turn. 

_Requirements Prescribed by the Eighth Schedule of the ITA_ 

27     Under s 105D(2) of the ITA, the Comptroller is obliged to ensure that a request for information by a foreign tax authority c omplies with the Eight Sc hedule of the ITA unless the Comptroller otherwise permits. The Eighth Sc hedule, whic h sets out the nec essary information that is to be inc luded in a request for information, states: 

 EIGHTH SCHEDULE 

 Information to be inc luded in a request for information under Part XXA 

1\. The purpose of the request. 

2\. The identity of the c ompetent authority. 

3\. The identity of the person in relation to whom the information is requested. 

4\. A statement of the information requested for inc luding its nature, and the form in whic h the c ompetent authority wishes to rec eive the information from the Comptroller. 

5\. The grounds for believing that the information requested for is held by the Comptroller, the Comptroller of Goods and Servic es Tax, the Comptroller of Property Tax, the Chief Assessor or the Commissioner of Stamp Duties, or is in the possession or c ontrol of a person in Singapore. 

6\. To the extent known, the name and address of any person believed to have possession or c ontrol of the information requested for. 

7\. A statement that the request is in c onformity with the law and administrative prac tic es of the c ountry of the c ompetent authority, and that the c ompetent authority is authorised to obtain the information under the laws of that c ountry or in the normal c ourse of administrative prac tic e. 


8\. A statement that the c ountry has pursued all means available in its own territory to obtain the information exc ept those that would give rise to disproportionate diffic ulties. 

9\. [Deleted by S 595/2012] 

10\. Any other information required to be inc luded with the request under the presc ribed arrangement. 

11\. Any other information that may assist in giving effec t to the request. 

28     In determining whether the Eighth Sc hedule requirements have been satisfied, the parties’ main dispute was the extent to whic h the Comptroller was obliged to examine the verac ity and bases of the foreign tax authority’s statements as presc ribed by the Eighth Sc hedule. Unsurprisingly, the Applic ants argued that the Comptroller bore the onus to “go behind” the Request and “resolve doubts c onc erning the verac ity of the Request”, whereas the Comptroller argued that it was rightfully entitled to take NTS’s statements satisfying the Eighth Sc hedule at fac e value. 

29     In my judgment, the Comptroller is entitled under the present EOI regime to take NTS’s statements at fac e value in determining whether the Eighth Sc hedule requirements are satisfied, and is not obliged to go behind these statements and sec ond-guess their verac ity. This is c onsistent with the position vis-à-vis the c ourts prior to the 2013 Amendments, whic h ought to be the c ase as those amendments only c hanged the identity of the assessor but not the c ontent of the assessment (see above at [23]-[24]). To this end, the Court of Appeal’s statement in _ABU v CIT_ on the prior position of the c ourts is apposite: 

 [40] While we agree that s 105J requires the High Court to be independently satisfied as to the justific ation of a request, we do not think it follows from the Minister’s statements that Parliament had intended for the High Court to substantively review a request to the extent of inquiring into the truth of the fac tual assertions c ontained in it. Taking a purposive as well as a c ontextual interpretation of the statutory sc heme, it seems c lear to us that Parliament had intended for the validity of a request to be determined on its fac e... 

 ... 

 [42] In written submissions, Mr Sharma appeared to suggest that the Eighth Sc hedule requirements inherently c ontemplated that the c ourt would examine the verac ity of statements c ontained in a request. In our judgment, Mr Sharma’s c ontention is not borne out. It is manifestly c lear from a plain reading of the Eighth Sc hedule that it only requires a request to inc lude a statement to the effec t of paragraphs 4, 7 and 8 of the Eight Sc hedule... In short, onc e a “statement” to the requisite effec t has been made by the requesting authority, then it will have c omplied with those requirements of the Eighth Sc hedule. In keeping with the Minister’s explanation as to the rationale of the Eighth Sc hedule requirements... it seems to us that onc e the Eighth Sc hedule is c omplied with, the justific ation of a request in terms of its c onsistenc y with the EOI Standard will be determined without the c ourt going behind the statements made in it. 

30     Given Parliament’s intention to streamline the EOI regime and entrust greater responsibility to the Comptroller in 2013, it would be inc ongruous if the c ourt indirec tly engaged in an even more searc hing enquiry into the justific ations of requests by foreign tax authorities through the mac hinery of judic ial review, than it did prior to the 2013 Amendments when foreign authorities’ statements were taken at fac e value in direc t assessment by the c ourt. 


31     The Applic ants’ position would also not plac e any limit on the Comptroller’s duty to “resolve doubts” regarding the basis of every request for information. It is not diffic ult – and indeed, quite c onc eivable – for any taxpayer to raise some doubts about the justific ations for suc h requests when the related foreign investigations are pending or inc omplete, and are under regimes and laws that are not nec essarily familiar to the Comptroller. Prac tic al issues are also abound in teasing out the prec ise c ontent of any duty to resolve doubts. The Comptroller c annot be obliged in eac h and every instanc e to c all foreign witnesses and to resolve c omplex issues of foreign law. In this regard, guidanc e was given by the Court of Appeal in _ABU v CIT_ (at [43]): 

 If s 105J requires or permits the c ourt to go behind the Letter of Request, there is a real risk of applic ations made under s 105J of the ITA resulting in full trials c alling for the examination of witnesses and the determination of potentially diffic ult questions of foreign law... although the Minister alluded to the protec tion of taxpayer rights as being one of the aims of the statutory regime, he also emphasised that this had to be balanc ed against the need to ensure that the effic ac y of the exc hange of information mac hinery was not c ompromised... 

32     For these reasons, the Applic ants’ argument that there existed a broad duty to “resolve doubts” in statements by foreign tax authorities whic h at fac e value satisfy the Eighth Sc hedule was not sustainable. 

33     Aside from the law, I c ould not ac c ept the Applic ants’ arguments that the Eighth Sc hedule was not satisfied bec ause the Notic es were issued (a) without NTS having pursued all means available in Korea to obtain the same information, (b) even though the Request was not in c onformity with Korean law and prac tic es, and (c ) despite NTS’s assessments against the Applic ants being time barred under Korean law. All of these points c ompelled the Comptroller and, in turn, a c ourt in judic ial review, to engage in questions of domestic Korean law and potentially required the examination of foreign witnesses. This is imprac tic al and c ontrary to Parliament’s intent to “ensure that the effic ac y of the exc hange of information mac hinery [is] not c ompromised” ( _ABU v CIT_ at [43]). The proper applic ation of a requesting state’s tax law, and the exerc ise of powers of the requesting authority, are matters of domestic law to be dealt with by the domestic c ourts and authorities of the requesting state. It would be invidious to require loc al authorities and c ourts to delve into suc h matters, even if these matters are brought to their attention by the affec ted persons. 

34     This is not to say that the law _requires_ the Comptroller to rely solely on the statements provided by foreign authorities, or that the law _precludes_ the Comptroller from making any further 

inquiry to satisfy itself of doubts as to the basis of a request. [note: 1] In my view, although it is not for a c ourt exerc ising judic ial review jurisdic tion to require this, it remains open to the Comptroller to engage with a foreign tax authority regarding any request for information (see _ABU v CIT_ at [48]), in rec ognition of its “substantial experienc e in handling foreign requests and tax administration” ( _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (19 Oc tober 2009) vol 86 at c ol 1621 (Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Ac ting Minister for Financ e) (“ _Debates 2009_ ”)). 

_Requirement of Foreseeable Relevance_ 

35     Under s 105D(3) of the ITA, the Comptroller is obliged to deal with a request for information from a foreign tax authority “in ac c ordanc e with the terms of the presc ribed arrangement”, _ie_ in ac c ordanc e with the Convention. Artic le 25 of the Convention permits only the exc hange of information that is “foreseeably relevant” to the administration or enforc ement of the Convention or the requesting state’s tax laws. Ac c ordingly, the test of foreseeable relevanc e has been desc ribed as the “touc hstone” of the EOI regime ( _ABU v CIT_ at [26]). 


36     The Applic ants argued that the Comptroller, in assessing the foreseeable relevanc e of the information requested, failed to c onsider that (a) the sc ope of the Request was too sweeping, and (b) NTS provided less than “c lear and spec ific ” evidenc e to establish foreseeable relevanc e. The Comptroller wholly denied these allegations. 

37     Foreseeable relevanc e was, prior to the 2013 Amendments, part of the “single broad enquiry of whether the making of an order for produc tion was justified in the c irc umstanc es of the c ase” ( _ABU v CIT_ at [36], c iting _Comptroller of Income Tax v BJY_ <span class="citation">[2013] 4 SLR 801</span> (“ _CIT v BJY_ ”)). Given the 2013 Amendments, however, whic h abolished this justifiability inquiry under s 105J of the ITA, the test of foreseeable relevanc e appears now to stand as an independent requirement for the Comptroller’s c onsideration, inc orporated through s 105D(3) of the ITA read with the relevant provisions of the tax treaty c onc erned. 

38     Contrary to the Applic ants’ submission, the requisite standard of foreseeable relevanc e has not c hanged with the 2013 Amendments for the reasons I have stated above (at [23]-[24]). As regards the c ontent of this test, the Applic ants c ited _Comptroller of Income Tax v AZP_ <span class="citation">[2012] 3 SLR 690</span> for the proposition that foreseeable relevanc e requires some “c lear and spec ific evidenc e that there is a c onnec tion between the information requested and the enforc ement of the requesting state’s tax laws” (at [10]). In turn, the Comptroller relied on _CIT v BJY_ for the following passage (at [28]): 

 Sinc e the requested information need only be foreseeably relevant, the requesting State need not show that the requested information is demonstrably relevant for c arrying out the provisions of the [Tax Treaty] or to the administration or enforc ement of its domestic tax laws. However, it must at the very least explain why the partic ular information requested is thought to be possibly relevant. Naturally, spec ulative requests for information will not meet the standard of foreseeable relevanc e. 

39     To my mind, the phrase “foreseeable relevant” is suffic iently c lear in itself. In the c ontext of Artic le 25 of the Convention (whic h is modelled after Artic le 26 of the Model Convention), the test as fully stated is “suc h information as is foreseeably relevant for c arrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforc ement of the domestic laws c onc erning taxes of every kind and desc ription”. This is a low threshold. In prac tic e, it has been observed that “onc e the requesting State c an point to an ongoing investigation into the affairs of a partic ular taxpayer, that would in most c ases by itself dispel the notion of the request being random or spec ulative” (Update to Artic le 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention and its Commentary (17 July 2012) (“ _OECD Commentary_ ”) at p 3, para 5). 

40     I agree with the AG’s submissions that the assessment on foreseeable relevanc e should generally be made as at the time of the request. Subsequent oc c urrenc es affec ting the assessment of foreseeable relevanc e are immaterial, save perhaps in the most exc eptional of situations where suc h evidenc e is unc ontradic ted or unanswerable. The Comptroller is also not obliged to slow down or suspend its internal proc esses in expec tation of the taxpayer’s intended c hallenge to the relevanc e of the requested information. To expec t otherwise would c ontradic t c lear Parliamentary intention to streamline the EOI proc ess. It would likely also impose on the Comptroller an onerous burden of predic tive supervision over foreign proc eedings and unduly fetter its ability to respond expeditiously to requests for information sinc e, in the nature of things, there are bound to be c hallenges that c ould, and would, be made against an ongoing tax investigation. 

41     As a c orollary, the indeterminability of ac tual relevanc e of the requested information as at the time of request is no bar to the disc losure of suc h information by the Comptroller, sinc e ac tual relevanc e may only bec ome c lear upon rec eipt and assessment of suc h information by the foreign 


authority, or even later after the proper disposition of the entire tax investigation in the foreign jurisdic tion. Thus, as stated in the _OECD Commentary_ at p 3, para 5: 

 In the c ontext of information exc hange upon request, the standard [of foreseeable relevanc e] requires that at the time a request is made there is a reasonably possibility that the requested information will be relevant; whether the information, onc e provided, ac tually proves to be relevant is immaterial. A request may therefore not be dec lined in c ases where a definite assessment of the pertinenc e of the information to an ongoing investigation c an only be made following the rec eipt of the information 

42     Further, for the reasons I have indic ated above (at [29]-[32]), the assessment of relevanc e may be made on the fac e of the statements and information provided by the foreign tax authorities. This is c onsistent with the _OECD Commentary_ , whic h suggests that the requested State is obliged to ac c ept a requesting State’s explanation as to foreseeable relevanc e at fac e value ( _OECD Commentary_ at p 3, para 5): 

 The c ompetent authorities should c onsult in situations in whic h the c ontent of the request, the c irc umstanc es that led to the request, or the foreseeable relevanc e of requested information is not c lear to the requested State. However, onc e the requesting State has provided an explanation as to the foreseeable relevanc e of the requested information, the requested State may not dec line a request to withhold requested information bec ause it believes that the information lac ks relevanc e to the underlying investigation or examination 

43     This princ iple of restraint applies _a fortiori_ in relation to matters involving the foreign jurisdic tion’s domestic laws. It is neither prac tic al, nor appropriate, for the loc al c ourt or authority to assume the role of the foreign c ourt or authority in respec t of the proper c onstruc tion and applic ation of their domestic law. 

44     The Applic ants c ited the Jersey dec ision of _APEF Management Company Limited v The Comptroller of Taxes_ [2013] JRC 262 (“ _APEF Management_ ”) for the proposition that a c ourt should set aside a notic e for information if the taxpayer c ould bring to its attention “evidenc e ... whic h on its fac e wholly undermined the very foundations upon whic h the requests had been made”. In that c ase, the Royal Court of Jersey set aside the Jersey tax authority’s notic e for information on the basis that reliable and public ly available information in Franc e regarding the transac tion that was being investigated, whic h was brought to the c ourt’s attention by the taxpayer c onc erned, negated the whole basis of the Frenc h authority’s request for information. This was so dec ided even though on the fac e of the information provided by the Frenc h tax authority, the Jersey tax authority’s dec ision to issue the notic e was properly taken. 

45     I did not find the Jersey c ase persuasive or direc tly applic able to our fac ts. First, the Jersey dec ision was an appeal filed under the Taxation (Exc hange of Information with Third Countries) (Jersey) Regulations 2008 (“TIEA”) and not a c ase of judic ial review. The dec ision of _Volaw Trust v Office of the Comptroller of Taxes_ [2013] JCA 239 c ited by the Applic ants equated Jersey’s appeal with Jersey’s judic ial review (at [46]), but that did not mean that Jersey’s appeal regime c ould be equated to Singapore’s approac h to judic ial review. The permissible intensity of the c ourt’s sc rutiny may therefore be different there than in Singapore. Sec ond, muc h of the analysis in _APEF Management_ involved an examination of the legality of a transac tion in interest in a Frenc h c ompany, whic h transac tion was supervised by the Frenc h Competition Authority. Singapore c ourts appear to adopt a more deferential attitude in matters of foreign law and polic y than Jersey c ourts, taking into c onsideration our c onc ern for c omity and prac tic ality. Third, the polic y tensions and legal framework underlying the EOI regime are jurisdic tion-spec ific. Thus, jurisprudenc e on this area of law is not 


readily transposable without a full understanding of the history and c ontext of the EOI regime in eac h jurisdic tion. In fac t, the Jersey legislative provision governing suc h EOI appeals appear to have been tightened by amendments in late 2013, whic h _APEF Management_ did not have to c onsider. In any event , _APEF Management_ was fac tually distinguishable as the taxpayer there brought suffic ient evidenc e that allowed the c ourt to c onc lude that the “very foundations” of the Frenc h request were “wholly undermined”; this was not the situation in our c ase. 

46     In my view, a balanc e must be struc k between the Comptroller’s ability to respond to requests for information without undue haste and administrative burden, and the taxpayer’s legitimate interest in c ontesting an allegedly unauthorised release of his personal information. The diffic ulty in this exerc ise is exac erbated by the inevitable unc ertainty in investigative outc ome at the time of the request and the need for c omity between c ourts and authorities of different jurisdic tions. The applic ation of the above propositions would, therefore, depend heavily on the fac tual c ontext, with a margin of deferenc e ac c orded to the Comptroller in rec ognition of the fac t that, in the final analysis, the c onc ern is not with whether the Comptroller’s dec ision was c orrec t on its merits, but rather with whether that dec ision was illegally or irrational to the extent required by the law on judic ial review. 

47     In the present c ase, I found that the Comptroller had properly direc ted its mind to the issue of foreseeable relevanc e and c larified matters with NTS as was appropriate in the c irc umstanc es. 

48     The Applic ants also argued that the Comptroller erred in failing to c onsider that the information requested was extremely extensive and intrusive. I did not agree. The Comptroller had analysed the Request vis-à-vis the position of eac h of the objec ts in question, inc luding both the individuals and c ompanies, c rafted relatively defined queries to NTS on 7 November 2013, and subsequently, based on NTS’s responses, c lassified the c ompanies into three c ategories in preparation for further enquiry. 

49     I also ac c epted that the Comptroller had, after c lassific ation of the c ompanies, sought further information in relation to the c ompanies in one of the c ategories on 17 January 2014, and obtained an adequate reply on 21 January 2014, whic h was the first day of a meeting with NTS, before it exerc ised its disc retion to issue the Notic es later on 21 and 27 January 2014. The Applic ants invited me to infer that there were further disc ussions about the Request on 22 January 2014, the sec ond day of the meeting, based on meeting minutes appended to the Comptroller’s affidavit. This, they submitted, showed that the issuanc e of the 21 January Notic e was premature or pre-determined. I noted that the Comptroller did not deny disc ussing the Request on 22 January 2014 in absolute terms; it only c laimed that the disc ussion on 21 January 2014 took plac e only for a part of the day, that other matters not related to the Request were disc ussed during both days of the meeting, and that 

the 21 January Notic e was issued after full c onsideration of its merits. [note: 2] Nevertheless, even if the Request was indeed disc ussed again on 22 January (in addition to the exc hanges on 21 January), there was to my mind suffic ient c onsideration of the sc ope of the Request, and basis for ac c eding to the Request as framed, based on the Comptroller’s efforts prior to the 21 January Notic e. Further, the revised list of ac c ounts provided by NTS on 22 January was only a revision of a doc ument earlier exc hanged between the authorities; the Comptroller had in his possession the unrevised doc ument before issuing the Notic es, and his dec ision to do so c annot be impugned by virtue of hindsight. 

50     The Applic ants further argued that the Comptroller, in assessing foreseeable relevanc e, failed to c onsider that NTS’s tax assessments were by the time of the hearing before me time barred in Korea. [note: 3] I did not agree that this was relevant to the Comptroller’s dec ision, as NTS did not c onc ede 

this and it was c learly a matter of foreign law to be determined by foreign c ourts and authorities. Further, as I have stated, the determination of foreseeable relevanc e should be assessed as at the time of the request. While aggrieved taxpayers may legitimately seek judic ial review and other means to protec t their interest in the c onfidentiality of the requested information, they should not be able to 


rely on the time taken for suc h mec hanisms as itself a defenc e against disc losure. The distortive inc entives in holding otherwise are apparent and should be avoided. 

51     I also rejec ted the Applic ants’ argument that the Comptroller erred in law and/or ac ted irrationally as it relied on the mistaken fac t that the Applic ants were Korean tax residents, based merely on NTS’s assertion of the same, when the tax c ourts and tribunals in Korea seised of the 

matter had not yet so c onc luded. [note: 4] The premise of their argument was flawed. The Comptroller did not have to take into c onsideration matters going to the tax residenc y or liability of persons subjec t to a request for information, or other matters, whic h are questions of domestic Korean law. Further, the tax residenc y and liability of the Applic ants had not yet been finally dec ided by the Korean c ourts either way. In the tentative state of things, the Comptroller was entitled to rely on NTS’s statements as to the tax liability and/or residenc y of the Applic ants at fac e value. The Comptroller was also not obliged to hold its hand pending the outc ome of this issue in Korea. The ac tual relevanc e of the information requested, whatever the answer may be when the proc eedings in Korea c ome to a c lose, was also irrelevant (see above at [41]). 

52     Finally, the Applic ants raised several c laims alleging that the evidential basis for the Request was lac king, suc h that the information requested was not “foreseeably relevant” and the Comptroller’s failure to properly weigh suc h evidenc e (or lac k thereof ) rendered its dec ision to issue the Notic es illegal. Spec ific ally, the Applic ants argued that a doc ument on whic h the Request was based was 

outdated and known to be inc omplete, [note: 5] that a simple c ompany searc h would have revealed the inadequac ies of the Request, and that there was insuffic ient evidenc e of the requisite nexus between two of the three c ategories of c ompanies listed in the Request and the Korean tax 

investigations. [note: 6] 

53     In my view, these arguments bordered on a c onflation of judic ial review with a merits review; this Court is not c onc erned with the issue of whether the requested information was ac tually “foreseeably relevant” to the Korean tax law as suc h. The assessment as to the quality and suffic ienc y of evidenc e, in partic ular, is a matter in whic h our c ourts are slow to intervene, even if a different c onc lusion may be reac hed on a _de novo_ review of the matter. 

54     In any c ase, the Applic ants’ arguments were fac tually misc onc eived. As regards the outdated doc ument, that doc ument stated that it was “c orrec t as at 2004 and there c ould be more c ompanies now”, but that merely showed that more c ompanies c ould be involved of whic h NTS was unaware, and did not negate the quality of the evidenc e to the extent that the Comptroller’s relianc e thereon bec ame illegal or irrational. The EOI regime is often resorted to prec isely bec ause more and better evidenc e of tax violations are needed for tax enforc ement; to demand perfec tly c ontemporaneous and c omprehensive evidenc e to support every request for information is to ask for the impossible. As regards the c ompany searc h, that was neither here nor there as it revealed new information not c ontained in the “outdated” doc ument, but also surfac ed new evidenc e of nexus between the Applic ants and that c ompany. As regards the suffic ienc y of shareholding as a nexus to sustain the Request, the Comptroller c learly direc ted its mind to this issue as it was the one who made the c lassific ation of c ompanies and sought further information from NTS in respec t of one of the c lasses whose links to the Applic ants were weaker than the others. There was nothing improper in the Comptroller’s weighing of the evidenc e, and a mere differenc e in opinion between the Applic ants and the Comptroller as regards the final outc ome of that evaluative proc ess did not give rise to any viable c laim in judic ial review. 

_Requirement to Ensure Requests are “Clear, Specific and Legitimate”_ 


55     The Applic ants argued that, as a distinc t and spec ific requirement of law from those expressed in the Eighth Sc hedule, the Comptroller must ensure that a request for information is “c lear, spec ific and legitimate” before it c an issue the attendant notic es for information under the ITA. They c ite as sole authority the Parliamentary debates during the Sec ond Reading of the Inc ome Tax (Amendment) Bill 2013, where the Senior Minister of State for Financ e, in a bid to assuage c onc erns regarding the removal of the requirement for a c ourt order prior to disc losures of c onfidential information, stated as follows ( _Debates 2013_ ): 

 ... we will allow IRAS to obtain information protec ted under the Banking Ac t and Trust Companies Ac t for EOI purposes without having to seek a Court Order. This is aimed at streamlining EOI administration. 

 Members may be c onc erned that the removal of the need for IRAS to seek a c ourt order c ompromises safeguards that protec t the c onfidentiality of taxpayers’ information. Let me assure the House that eac h request for EOI assistanc e is c arefully c onsidered and not ac c eded to indisc riminately. Even though a c ourt order is not required, IRAS will render EOI assistanc e only for c lear, spec ific and legitimate requests. 

56     By the Applic ants’ reasoning, the Comptroller ac ted illegally and/or irrationally by issuing the Notic es whic h mirrored the Request that was too broad to qualify as “c lear, spec ific , and legitimate”. I noted that the phrase “c lear, spec ific and legitimate” was also used by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore on its website to desc ribe the administration of the EOI regime. 

57     Nonetheless, I c ould not ac c ept the Applic ants’ proposition of law. It was c lear in the c ontext of the Parliamentary debate c ited that the phrase “c lear, spec ific and legitimate” was not intended to operate as a distinc t or spec ific requirement to bind the Comptroller as a matter of law; it was merely an illustration of the standards that would be ac hieved upon satisfac tion of the requirements expressed in the Eighth Sc hedule of the ITA. I was buttressed in this view by the Parliamentary debate at the introduc tion of the Eighth Sc hedule, whic h explained that “[t]he new Eighth Sc hedule sets out the doc umentary requirements whic h a requesting jurisdic tion must fulfil for all requests. These requirements ensure that requests are justified, that is, c lear, spec ific , relevant, legitimate and c onsistent with the Standard” ( _Debates 2009_ at c ol 1607). Ac c ordingly, the phrase “c lear, spec ific and legitimate” merely expressed an outc ome in line with the satisfac tion of expressed requirements of the Eighth Sc hedule; it was not an addendum to the Sc hedule on its terms. 

58     Further, there was no authority c ited for the proposition that Parliamentary debates c ould in themselves ground requirements that bind the Comptroller as a matter of law, espec ially where there is no equivalent expression in the statute itself, _ie_ in the ITA or the Convention (as inc orporated domestic ally through statute). Indeed, I found it telling that Parliament c ould have, but did not, expressly inc orporate the requirement that requests for information be “c lear, spec ific and legitimate” in any part of the Eighth Sc hedule or the ITA, despite the c omments made on this point during the Sec ond Reading. There was also no guidanc e, whether in the ITA, the Convention, or the relevant Parliamentary debates, on the c ontent of this “c lear, spec ific and legitimate” test and how it differed from the expressed and established test of foreseeable relevanc e. In the c ontext of the c arefully c alibrated EOI regime, it was simply untenable that Parliament intended to bind the Comptroller without making c lear the existenc e and c ontent of its legal duties. The ability to refer to materials, inc luding Parliamentary Debates, to assist in the interpretation of statutory provisions c annot morph into a rewriting of the language of the enac tment that was passed into law. 

59     In any event, I found it c lear on the fac ts that the Comptroller had suffic iently evaluated, and made appropriate enquiries of NTS, to ensure that the Request was “c lear, spec ific and legitimate”. 


Clarific ations and evidenc e were sought, and there was nothing on the fac e of the Request as c larified that showed any impropriety. 

_Requirement to Balance Individual Rights against Policy of Efficient EOI Regime_ 

60     The Applic ants further argued that the Comptroller’s issuanc e of the Notic es would infringe the c onfidentiality and privac y rights of the Applic ants and of any independent shareholders of the c ompanies c overed by the Request. To the extent that they suggested a distinc t and spec ific requirement that the Comptroller must, in assessing eac h request for information under the EOI regime, balanc e the affec ted parties’ interests in c onfidentiality against the need for an effic ient EOI regime, this was not founded on the proper interpretation of the law. The appropriate balanc e of interests was provided by the legislative struc ture of the ITA read with Artic le 25 of the Convention. For instanc e, Artic le 25(3) of the Convention listed the exc eptions under whic h a requested State need not c omply with a request for information. Artic le 25(2) of the Convention also imposed stric t c onfidentiality obligations on the requesting State. As the c ourt rec ognised in _Comptroller of Income Tax v BKW_ <span class="citation">[2014] 1 SLR 13</span> in respec t of Artic le 28(2) of the SingaporeIndia Double Taxation Agreement (“SIDTA”) whic h is _in pari materia_ with Artic le 25(2) of the Convention, “the stric t c onfidentiality obligations plac ed on the Indian tax authorities under Art 28(2) of the [SIDTA] would serve to allay any c onc erns regarding prejudic e arising from the disc losure of information” (at [21]). This was the framework Singapore negotiated for, and whic h Parliament thought appropriate to balanc e the tension between effic ienc y and invasiveness. The Comptroller was therefore not obligated in law to c onduc t suc h balanc es again as a distinc t legal requirement in respec t of eac h partic ular request for information. 

_Improper delegation of discretion_ 

61     The Applic ants further argued that the Comptroller failed to independently exerc ise its disc retion to issue the Notic es and improperly delegated its dec ision-making power to NTS, as the Comptroller ac c eded to the Request prematurely, without suffic ient independent inquiry, and reproduc ed the sc ope of the Request in its entirety in the Notic es with minimal refinements. 

62     I ac c ept that as a general proposition, an authority must apply its own mind to the exerc ise of its statutory disc retion and c annot delegate its dec ision-making authority to another person or body, failing whic h its polic y of delegation, or the delegated dec ision itself, may be invalidated. The Court of Appeal has desc ribed this “general princ iple” as “unexc eptional” bec ause a “violation of this princ iple would amount to a failure by the [authority] to exerc ise the power vested in it” ( _Registrar of Vehicles v Komoco Motors Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2008] 3 SLR 340</span> at [31]). 

63     In _Lines International Holding (S) Pte Ltd v Singapore Tourist Promotion Board and another_ <span class="citation">[1997] 1 SLR(R) 52</span> (“ _Lines International_ ”), the High Court invalidated a general polic y stating that the Port of Singapore Authority (“PSA”) would refuse berth ac c ess to a vessel “if the Gambling Suppression Branc h, CID and Singapore Tourist Promotion Board so ( _sic_ ) determine that suc h ac tion is nec essary” (at [98]), on the ground that PSA had “the duty to exerc ise that disc retion itself after c onsidering various relevant fac tors [and] c annot abrogate this responsibility by taking orders from other statutory boards unless it is under a legal duty to do so” (at [99]). However, PSA’s dec ision to deny berth to a partic ular vessel was upheld as the learned Judge found that PSA had made its own dec ision in respec t of that vessel and had not simply relied on the impugned polic y ( _Lines International_ at [118]). 

64     In the present c ase, it was c lear that the Comptroller had direc ted its mind independently to the satisfac tion of Artic le 25 of the Convention and ss 105B and 105F of the ITA. The Comptroller 


independently analysed the Request, c ategorised the c ompanies referred therein, and made genuine inquiries of NTS in relation to the Request by way of letters dated 7 November 2013 and 17 January 

2014\. The subsequent dec ision to issue the Notic es was neither pre-determined nor premature (see above at [49]). The Applic ants c annot allege delegation of powers merely bec ause the Comptroller took a different view from them of what was nec essary to satisfy the legal requirements for the Notic e to be issued and henc e dec lined to narrow the sc ope of the Request. Ac c ordingly, the fac t that the Comptroller issued Notic es matc hing the language of the Request did not take the Applic ants very far: it is proper for the Comptroller to do so if it is so satisfied that this is appropriate; this is not nec essarily evidenc e of any failing. 

**_Irrationality_** 

65     The Applic ants also alleged that the Comptroller’s dec ision to issue the Notic es was irrational, relying c hiefly on the same arguments as those for illegality, inc luding that it was irrational to disregard ongoing Korean litigation about the Applic ants’ tax residenc y and to rely on an outdated doc ument. 

66     Generally, irrationality as a ground for judic ial review is satisfied if the authority c ame “to a c onc lusion so unreasonable that no reasonable authority c ould ever have c ome to it” ( _Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v Wednesbury Corporation_ [1948] 1 KB 223 at 234; see also _Lines International_ at [137]), or whic h is “so outrageous in its defianc e of logic or of ac c epted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be dec ided c ould have arrived at it” ( _Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs_ <span class="citation">[1988] 2 SLR(R) 525</span> at [119]). It is “hornbook law that the standard if unreasonableness is ... pragmatic ally fixed at a very high level” ( _Chee Siok Chin v Minister for Home Affairs_ <span class="citation">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 582</span> (“ _Chee Siok Chin_ ”) at [125]). This is bec ause “dec ision-makers c an in good faith arrive at quite different dec isions [suc h that]... there is an inherent measure of latitude” ( _Chee Siok Chin_ at [95]). 

67     In the present c ase, I found the Applic ants’ arguments on irrationality to be wholly untenable. For reasons I have earlier explained, it was not illegal or improper for the Comptroller to disregard matters of foreign law (suc h as the Korean proc eedings on tax residenc y status and whether NTS exhausted all means within Korea to obtain the information). The Comptroller was also entitled to c ome to a determination on the foreseeable relevanc e of information sought in the Request based on the fac e value of what NTS plac ed before it (inc luding the “outdated” doc ument). NTS had c learly explained, in c omplianc e with the ITA and the Convention, how the Applic ants and other c ompanies in the Request were thought to be related to the tax investigations in Korea. The 21 January Notic e also c annot be said to be premature given the inquiries made by the Comptroller prior to its issuanc e. Ac c ordingly, there was nothing on the fac e of the Request that seriously undermined or c ast doubts on its validity, and there was all the more no reason to hold that the Comptroller’s dec ision to issue the Notic es was irrational. 

**_Miscellaneous issues_** 

68     The above analysis makes c lear that the Applic ants’ arguments in illegality and irrationality were non-starters. For c ompleteness, a number of remaining issues are briefly addressed. 

69     First, there may be c onc erns regarding the _locus standi_ of the 3rd Applic ant in bringing this applic ation as he was not inc luded in the Request as one of the Korean taxpayers under investigation by NTS. As this argument was not pursued during the leave hearing, and was in any event not nec essary for the disposal of this applic ation, I dec lined to make a finding on this issue. 


70     Sec ond, the Applic ants sought in their originating summons a stay of proc eedings pending the final determination in Korea of the Applic ants’ tax residenc y status and tax liability. I c ould not ac c ept this as there was no basis for the c ourt to make suc h an order. The information requested by NTS c ould also go towards the establishment or otherwise of the tax residenc e and/or liability of the Applic ants; to hold them bac k pending determination of suc h residenc y and liability would be c ontrary to the purpose of the EOI regime. As the Court of Appeal stated in _ABU v CIT_ : 

 89 Finally, we note Mr Sharma’s alternative submission that even if we were not minded to disturb the order of c ourt made below we should grant a stay on its exec ution until the Japan Proc eedings were determined. In our judgment, this submission was misc onc eived. To begin with, Mr Sharma did not identify any basis, whether statutory or c ommon law, under whic h we had the power to make suc h an order whic h seems to us to be anomalous at first blush and c ontrary to the sc heme for the exc hange of information in this c ontext ... 

71     Lastly, it was argued by the Comptroller and the AG that too lenient a judic ial review mec hanism c ould delay the entire EOI proc ess and frustrate the purpose of the 2013 Amendments. Judic ial review may indeed c ause a delay in response to an EOI request; but if the grounds for judic ial review are made out then that indic ates the judic ial review mec hanism is working as intended, whatever the disc omfort this may c ause the agenc ies c onc erned. The EOI regime is not to be privileged with a spec ial judic ial review test as c ompared to other administrative ac tions or dec isions. It was noted that Leow JC stated in _AXY v CIT_ (at [16]): 

 Judic ial review in the c ontext as outlined above plays an important role in operating as a safeguard of the taxpayer's interest in an exc hange of information framework whic h is rapidly expanding in rec ent times, but should not be relied on to unnec essarily delay tax investigations c ommenc ed against the taxpayers, and must not result in the foreign state being hamstrung in its investigations as a result of the judic ial review applic ation in Singapore. It was c lear from the legislative history of the Inc ome Tax Ac t that the c ourt, in determining the sc ope of disc overy for a judic ial review applic ation, should c onsider the overriding princ iple that the gathering of information in a foreign state for tax investigation purposes must not be prejudic ed by c ourt proc eedings in Singapore, a c onsideration whic h is not usually present in judic ial review applic ations. 

Leow JC was c onc erned with the impac t of a disc overy applic ation and I did not read this statement as importing a different standard for judic ial review. 

72     There is a strong public interest in allowing taxpayers to have rec ourse to judic ial review to ensure the lawful release of their c onfidential information. Indeed, this was Parliament’s intent when it was assured during the passage of the 2013 Amendments that “[t]axpayers still have ac c ess to the judic ial proc ess through a judic ial review” ( _Debates 2013_ ) (see above at [19]). If delays are c aused as a result of the pursuit of a c laim in judic ial review, that is an unfortunate but nec essary c onsequenc e. After all, just as there is public interest identified by Parliament in enhanc ing international tax c ooperation through a robust and effic ient EOI regime, there is also public interest in ensuring that statutory powers are exerc ised lawfully: “This is the very objec t of judic ial review” ( _Manjit Singh s/o Kirpal Singh v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">[2013] 2 SLR 844</span> at [60]). There are proper mec hanisms to deal with the abuse of judic ial review, and indeed where the threshold is not made out, the c ourt will dismiss the applic ation at the leave stage. 

**Conclusion** 

73     In the final analysis, having read and heard parties’ submissions, I had no doubt that the 


Applic ants did not meet the standard of an arguable and _prima facie_ c ase of reasonable suspic ion. The Applic ants may disagree with the Comptroller’s dec ision to issue the Notic es, but mere disagreement does not provide suffic ient basis to ground an ac tion in judic ial review, even at the leave stage. Despite the plethora of arguments raised by the Applic ants, when the dust settled, it was c lear to me that there was no arguable basis in fac t or in law on whic h they c an suc c eed. For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the applic ation. 

74     In respec t of c osts, I ordered as follows: 

 (a) to the Respondent from the Applic ants: 

 (i) SUM 1700, 2201 of 2014: $9,000 plus reasonable disbursements 

 (ii) SUM 6214/2015: $4,000 plus reasonable disbursements 

 (iii) RA 236/2014: $3,000 plus reasonable disbursements 

 (iv) OS 106/2014: $12,000 plus reasonable disbursement 

 (v) Total: $28,000 plus reasonable disbursements 

 (b) to the Applic ants from the Respondent: 

 (i) SUM 4732/2014, RA 42/2015 and SUM 1002/2015: $7,000 plus reasonable disbursements 

 (c ) to AGC from the Applic ants: 

 (i) OS 106/2014: $3,500 plus reasonable disbursements. 

75     The c ost awards being c onveyed by letter to the parties on 10 November 2016, I also granted an extension of time for appeal to 2 weeks after the date of the said letter.
