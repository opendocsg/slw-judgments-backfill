**Introduction** 

1       The issue in this c ase is whether the plaintiff and the defendants had entered into an enforc eable c ontrac t for an option for the sale of property. 

2       The plaintiff, Ong Kok Ming @ Henardi Ong, is a businessman. Through a c ompany known as Tirta Sari Pte Ltd (“TSPL”), he owns and operates a c hain of restaurants. At all material times, TSPL was the tenant of three units in Luc ky Plaza, _viz_ , #01-45, #01-46 and #01-47. These units, together with the adjac ent units known as #01-42, #01-43 and #01-44, were at the material times jointly owned by the first defendant, Happy Valley Holdings Pte Ltd, and the sec ond defendant, Mr Peter Lok Chan. These six units (hereinafter c ollec tively c alled “the Property”) were the subjec t matter of the alleged agreement between the plaintiff and the defendants. 

3       In the negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants, the first defendant was represented by its direc tor, Susanna Kwan Ping Sum (“Ms Kwan”), and her husband, Aloysius Chu Fee Loong (“Mr Chu”). Ms Kwan also held a power of attorney with respec t to the Property granted by the sec ond defendant on 6 June 1996. The sec ond defendant is resident in Hong Kong and is Mr Chu’s brother-in-law. The plaintiff’s position is that Ms Kwan represented the sec ond defendant in the negotiations. The sec ond defendant, although served with the writ in this ac tion, did not enter an appearanc e and did not dispute this c ontention. The ac tion was defended by the first defendant alone. 

4       Another person who played a part in the negotiations regarding the sale of the Property was one Choo Kok Yin aka Frederic k Choo (“FC”). At the material time, he was a property agent and had been instrumental in introduc ing TSPL to the first defendant and obtaining a tenanc y of three units of the Property for TSPL. 

**The facts** 

5       In 2001, the Property was mortgaged to the Bank of East Asia Limited (“BEA”) as sec urity for banking fac ilities extended by BEA to a c ompany c alled Farquson Private Limited (“FPL”). Ms Kwan and 


Mr Chu were the direc tors and shareholders of FPL. At the beginning of 2009, the outstanding amount under the fac ilities sec ured by the mortgage to BEA was in exc ess of $23m and due to the 2008 financ ial c risis, the financ ial outlook was unc ertain. BEA therefore requested the first defendant to sell the Property in order to reduc e the amount of FPL’s indebtedness. 

6       Thereafter, Mr Chu took steps to obtain a valuation of the Property and also appointed a property agent to market it. In Marc h 2009, he was provided with a valuation report showing a total value of about $20m for the units c omprising the Property and a forc ed sale value of $16m. All six units of the Property were rented out. These tenants had been introduc ed to the first defendant by FC and therefore, sometime in April 2009, Mr Chu c ontac ted FC to see whether he had any c lients who might be interested in purc hasing the Property. Subsequently, FC informed him that the owner of TSPL was interested in ac quiring the Property. As a result a series of meetings took plac e between the plaintiff and the defendants’ representatives. 

7       The first meeting took plac e sometime in April/May 2009 and ended without any c onc lusion. In May/June 2009, BEA kept pressing the first defendant to sell the Property and indic ated it would prefer an owner’s sale rather than a forc ed sale. At about that time, BEA informed Mr Chu that it had rec eived offers to purc hase the Property at a pric e of about $12m. Mr Chu, sensing that BEA might want to sell the Property at that pric e, asked FC to c hec k with the plaintiff to see if he was still interested in ac quiring the Property. 

8       A lunc h meeting to disc uss the sale of the Property took plac e around the end of June 2009. It was attended by FC, the plaintiff and his daughter, Jessic a Ong, Mr Chu and Ms Kwan. No agreement was reac hed but Mr Chu informed the plaintiff that an ac c eptable pric e would have to be c lose to the forc ed sale value of $16m stated in the valuation report. A sec ond lunc h meeting between the same persons also ended without an agreement. 

9       Sometime after this sec ond meeting, BEA informed Mr Chu that it had a c lient who was willing to buy the Property at $13.5m. Mr Chu wanted a better pric e and therefore asked FC to arrange for a t hird meeting with the plaintiff. This meeting took plac e at the Pines Club on 31 August 2009 over lunc h. It was attended by the same persons as had gone to the first two meetings. 

10     Ac c ording to Mr Chu, at this third lunc h meeting, he told the plaintiff that there was a firm offer rec eived from a prospec tive purc haser but if the plaintiff was prepared to offer at least $14.5m, he would seriously c onsider that offer. The plaintiff mentioned that he had sold c ertain assets and was expec ting to rec eive his money. He showed Mr Chu some doc uments to prove that he had the money exc ept that it would take some time for it to c ome in. Mr Chu did not look at these doc uments c losely and did not pay them very muc h attention. In response, he told the plaintiff that time was not very important sinc e it would take about three months for the sale to be c ompleted anyway. He stressed that he c ould help the plaintiff arrange for financ ing if that was nec essary. In an effort to persuade the plaintiff, he even told him and FC that although FC was the plaintiff’s agent, the first defendant would pay the latter’s c ommission as well. However, the plaintiff was again non-c ommittal and said that he would talk to his wife about the matter. No mention was made about any option agreement to be issued and what the terms of any purc hase would be. 

11     The plaintiff’s version of what happened at this third lunc h meeting is very different. He firmly believes that the parties had reac hed an agreement for the Property to be sold to him at the pric e of $14.5m. The plaintiff said that during the meeting, he told Mr Chu and Ms Kwan that funds would be c oming his way at the end of Oc tober 2009 and that only then would he be in a position to pay the balanc e of the purc hase pric e. He said he would have insuffic ient funds to pay for the Property in September 2009. He showed Mr Chu and Ms Kwan his bank doc uments to prove this but when he 


presented these doc uments to Mr Chu, the latter replied with no hesitation at all, “money no problem”. Then the parties got down to the issue of the pric e and disc ussed various figures. Finally, near the c onc lusion of the lunc h, the pric e of $14.5m was agreed upon and a deal was reac hed. At the end of the meeting, the plaintiff told Mr Chu and Ms Kwan that he would pay the option money of one perc ent of the purc hase pric e ($145,000) immediately. He had brought along with him a single c heque leaf in order to make payment. Mr Chu, however, informed the plaintiff that he needed two c heques, one for $139,000 and the other for $6,000, and therefore the plaintiff was unable to pay the option money at the end of the meeting. Mr Chu told him to give the first defendant the c heques the next day. It should be noted that both Jessic a Ong and FC testified that an agreement for the sale of the Property was reac hed at the third lunc h meeting. 

12     On 1 September 2009, FC c ollec ted two c heques in favour of the first defendant from the plaintiff. These were drawn on the ac c ount of one of the plaintiff’s c ompanies, Megantara Indo Trading Private Limited (“Megantara”), and were for the sums of $139,000 and $6,000 respec tively. FC took the c heques to the first defendant’s offic e and handed them to Ms Kwan in the presenc e of Mr Chu. FC told them that the c heques were not to be presented for payment until he or the plaintiff c alled and said that this c ould be done. Ms Kwan then made a photoc opy of the two c heques and ac knowledged their rec eipt on the photoc opy. At this time, Mr Chu gave FC a doc ument c ontaining the format of the proposed option agreement to be issued by the defendants. This doc ument was referred to in evidenc e as the “draft option”. 

13     The plaintiff rec eived the draft option on 2 September 2009. He noted that one of the terms was wrong in that it stated the option had to be exerc ised in two weeks’ time, _ie_ , by 11 September 

2009\. The plaintiff thought that this was inc onsistent with the negotiations and he told FC to remind t he defendants that Mr Chu had agreed that there was no issue regarding the plaintiff’s funds being rec eived only in Oc tober as long as c ompletion of the purc hase took plac e by the end of the year. The other terms of the draft option c orrec tly stated the addresses of the Property, the names of the vendors, the pric e, and the name of the law firm authorised to represent the vendors. 

14     Subsequently, the plaintiff dec ided that it was better for him to ac quire the Property in his own name. He drew two c heques in favour of the first defendant on his personal bank ac c ount and gave them to FC to pass to the first defendant. On 8 September 2009, FC went to the first defendant’s offic e and wanted to hand over the plaintiff’s personal c heques to Ms Kwan in exc hange for the earlier Megantara c heques. Ms Kwan telephoned her husband and, after he himself spoke to FC, Mr Chu instruc ted her to ac c ept the two new c heques and return the Megantara c heques. Ms Kwan made a photoc opy of the new c heques and ac knowledged rec eipt of them on the bac k of the photoc opy. 

15     The next disputed area of evidenc e relates to a meeting that took plac e the next evening, 9 September 2009, in the first defendant’s offic e, between Mr Chu and FC. Ac c ording to Mr Chu, he told FC that even by that date, no spec ific terms had been agreed upon as FC had not signified that the terms of the draft option were ac c eptable to the purc haser. FC then said that the plaintiff had diffic ulty with the 14 days’ exerc ise period and required the date for exerc ise of the option to be towards the end of Oc tober 2009. Mr Chu alleged that he responded that “this suggestion was too far from the normal period of 14 days”. In any event, he said he would have to seek the approval of BEA and the sec ond defendant regarding any proposed sale and its terms espec ially in relation to the exerc ise date. He proposed that he would fly to Hong Kong at the earliest opportunity to get suc h approval. 

16     Ac c ording to Mr Chu, he then asked FC whether the plaintiff would agree to his c heques being presented for payment without obligation, pending Mr Chu’s visit to Hong Kong that weekend. In the event that Mr Chu was unable to obtain the approval of the sec ond defendant and BEA to the terms, 


then the sums paid into the first defendant’s ac c ount would be refunded to the plaintiff. FC replied that he would talk to the plaintiff and left the premises. Shortly thereafter, FC c alled Mr Chu on Ms Kwan’s mobile phone and said that it was all right to bank in the c heques on the proposed basis. On the next day, the first defendant presented the c heques for payment. 

17     FC’s evidenc e was that sometime after 2 September 2009, he had c alled Mr Chu to c onvey to him what the plaintiff had said about the erroneous option exerc ise date in the draft option. Mr Chu’s response was to ask when the plaintiff would be able to exerc ise the option. FC said that the plaintiff needed time until Oc tober. Mr Chu said “okay” but in the same breath he mentioned that he needed to disc uss the date with the sec ond defendant. Mr Chu did not, however, get bac k to FC on this matter. 

18     FC also said that he went to the first defendant’s offic e on 10 September 2009 at the request of Ms Kwan. When he arrived there, Mr Chu told him to sec ure a firm date from the plaintiff on when the latter c ould exerc ise the option. He telephoned the plaintiff immediately and was told that the middle of Oc tober was the firm date. This was c onveyed to Mr Chu and FC said that if 15 Oc tober w a s ac c eptable, the plaintiff’s c heques for a total of $145,000 c ould be banked in. The first defendant deposited the plaintiff’s c heques on 10 September 2009 and they were duly c leared. 

19     Ac c ording to Mr Chu, the next development was that on 11 September 2009, he was informed by BEA that it had a purc haser who would be prepared to pay $15.5m for the Property. Ac c ordingly, when he went to Hong Kong on 12 September 2009, it was for the purpose of c onfirming whether BEA would agree to a sale at this pric e notwithstanding that it was insuffic ient to c over Farquson’s indebtedness to BEA. In Hong Kong, Mr Chu met an offic er of BEA and tried to persuade him to delay the sale of the Property, an effort that was not suc c essful. Mr Chu also c alled his sister to mention that the Property would be sold for $15.5m. She said that she would inform the sec ond defendant of the same. 

20     On 15 September 2009, Ms Kwan and Mr Chu asked FC to go to their offic e. There, they told him that they had rec eived an offer of $15.5m for the Property and showed him an option to purc hase to be granted in favour of a purc haser named Geetex Pte Ltd (“Geetex”). They told FC to find out from the plaintiff if he was prepared to matc h the pric e of $15.5m and that if he c ould not, then the plaintiff’s option money would be returned to him. They also told FC that if the plaintiff was prepared to matc h this pric e, then the plaintiff would have to pay FC’s c ommission. Mr Chu himself said he spoke to the plaintiff on the telephone and told him he would have to exerc ise the option within the normal 14 day period and to c omplete the purc hase by 15 Dec ember 2009. The plaintiff then spoke to Mr Chu briefly and told him that the defendants would be hearing from the plaintiff’s lawyers. 

21     The plaintiff did not meet the pric e of $15.5m and the defendants thereafter issued an option to Geetex for sale of the Property at this pric e. The first defendant attempted to refund the sum of $145,000 to the plaintiff but the latter refused to ac c ept it. The sale of the Property to Geetex was c ompleted on 30 Oc tober 2009. 

**The action and the issues** 

22     The plaintiff c ommenc ed this ac tion on 11 Dec ember 2009. He c laims against the defendants for breac h of c ontrac t in respec t of the defendants’ failure to issue an option to the plaintiff to purc hase the Property. The plaintiff says that on 31 August 2009, he entered into an agreement with the defendants by whic h he agreed to purc hase the Property and the defendants agreed to issue him an option for suc h purc hase at a pric e of $14.5m. The defendants neglec ted, failed or refused to issue the option to the plaintiff and instead sold the Property to Geetex. The plaintiff seeks damages. 


23     The first defendant’s c ase is that there was no c onc luded agreement for the sale of the Property to the plaintiff. Further, even if there had been an oral agreement for the grant of an option t o the plaintiff, the requirements of s 6(d) of the Civil Law Ac t (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”) were not met and therefore the agreement is not valid and enforc eable. 

24     The following main issues arise out of the pleadings and the submissions: 

 (a) whether the defendants had entered into an agreement with the plaintiff to issue an option to the plaintiff in respec t of the purc hase of the Property; 

 (b) if so, whether the requirements of s 6(d) of the Ac t have been fulfilled; 

 (c ) in the alternative, if s 6(d) of the Ac t is not fulfilled, whether the agreement is nevertheless enforc eable by virtue of the doc trine of part performanc e; and 

 (d) if there was an agreement, what remedy the plaintiff c an c laim for its breac h. 

**Issues** 

**_Was there an agreement for an option to be issued to the plaintiff?_** 

25     The plaintiff’s c ase is that the parties reac hed an agreement at the c onc lusion of the meeting on 31 August 2009. The first defendant says that there was no agreement at all on that date bec ause: 

 (a) the pric e was not agreed upon; 

 (b) the plaintiff had told Mr Chu that he wanted to c hec k with his wife about the matter; 

 (c ) the terms of the option had not been agreed on, and in partic ular, the exerc ise and c ompletion dates had not been agreed on; 

 (d) the identity of the purc haser had not been disc losed; and 

 (e) the sec ond defendant’s agreement to the sale had not been obtained. 

26     I must now examine the evidenc e. The evidenc e of the plaintiff, his daughter and FC was that an agreement was indeed reac hed at the meeting on 31 August 2009 at the Pines. They agreed that t his agreement related to the purc hase of the Property at a pric e of $14.5m. Both Ms Kwan and Mr Chu denied vehemently that any agreement had been reac hed. Who was telling the truth? 

27     The first defendant was represented at the meeting by Mr Chu and Ms Kwan. There was no dispute that these persons had the authority to represent the defendants even though Mr Chu was not a direc tor of the first defendant or the donee of the power of attorney exec uted by the sec ond defendant. Ms Kwan who oc c upied both those positions testified that Mr Chu had handled all the disc ussions relating to the sale of the Property during the meetings with the plaintiff and that she herself, though present, had not partic ipated in the same. She did not suggest at any time that Mr Chu was not authorised to speak for either of the defendants. The very fac t that she took a bac k seat and let Mr Chu do all the talking indic ated the extent of his authority. Mr Chu himself agreed in c ourt that he was the driving forc e behind the sale of the Property. I think it is a fair inferenc e from the evidenc e that the first defendant was very keen to ac c omplish its own sale of the Property 


 Q And at all times, Frederic k Choo was your agent for selling the property, c orrec t? 

 A Sorry, sorry, er, may I beg your pardon? 

 Q At all times, Frederic k Choo was your agent for selling the property, c orrec t? A (Interpreted evidenc e resumed) Well, we only told him that we have a property for sale. 

 Court Was he your agent or not? (Witness speaks in English) 

 WitnessIf --if, er, he got the tenant --er, if --if --if, er, he got a interested buyer. 

 Court Then? 

 WitnessThen, er, if, er, he got a ten---genuine buyer, so we have the property for sales. So I c an say that he is the agent. 

instead of submitting to a mortgagee sale. 

28     Ms Kwan was not an impressive witness as she was evasive and c hanged her position from time to time during the c ourse of her testimony. A prime example of this related to the position of FC. The witness agreed that in Marc h 2009 when FPL rec eived a letter of demand from BEA, she was worried about how she was going to repay BEA. She further agreed that she then c ontac ted FC to put the Property on the market for sale and to approac h the sitting tenants, inc luding the plaintiff, to see if they were interested in buying the Property. She was then asked whether she agreed that FC was the first defendant’s agent for selling the Property. She prevaric ated for sometime before answering the question as this extrac t from the evidenc e shows: 

It appears to me from this evidenc e that even though c ommission was not disc ussed at this stage, FC was ac ting as the seller’s agent in this transac tion between the defendants and the plaintiff. There is not only Ms Kwan’s reluc tant admission that he would be their agent if he found a buyer but also Mr Chu’s statement in his affidavit (repeated at [6] above) that he too had c ontac ted FC to find out if the latter had any buyers for the Property. 

29     When it c ame to what happened on 31 August 2009, Ms Kwan’s affidavit was extremely brief. There, all she said about the 31 August meeting was that the plaintiff had mentioned that he was expec ting to rec eive his money from the sale of his properties but he did not say when and that Mr Chu had told the plaintiff that the sale pric e of the Property would have to be at least $14.5m. Under c ross-examination she stated that she was not sure whether the plaintiff had ac c epted the pric e of $14.5m. When it was put to her that the first defendant had ac c epted the plaintiff’s offer to purc hase the Property at this pric e, she at first said “I agree”. Subsequently, she was asked again whether the plaintiff had offered this amount and the first defendant had ac c epted it and this time she replied “at first I thought he ac c epted but before we go off ... he mentioned he would talk to the wife tonight”. 

30     Ms Kwan was evasive in relation to the signific anc e of the doc ument whic h the plaintiff had shown Mr Chu at the 31 August 2009 meeting. She was asked whether she remembered that the plaintiff had brought along a doc ument to show that he had funds c oming in to Singapore. Her response was that she knew he had brought “a piec e of paper” but she was not sure what that paper was. It was then put to her that the plaintiff had told her and Mr Chu that the funds for the purc hase of the Property, $14.5m, would be c oming in to Singapore at the end of Oc tober 2009. Her response was: 


## Q A Q A Q A Q A Q 

 I am not sure what is the arrangement bec ause, er, I just, er, attend the meeting but I’m not, er, er, really listen what they --the arrangement. 

I found that reply diffic ult to c redit and asked her whether she had listened to what was going on. She then answered: 

 Er, maybe I just sit beside the --I mean, attend the meeting but, er, what is the arrangement made between them, I’m not very sure. 

It is diffic ult to ac c ept as true this sort of evidenc e from a witness who was a direc tor of the first defendant and had a personal interest (as a guarantor of FPL’s indebtedness) in selling the Property and reduc ing the indebtedness to BEA as muc h as possible. It should also be noted that subsequently when the witness was asked several questions about the doc ument produc ed by the plaintiff, her initial response was to repeat that she did not know what that piec e of paper was for but eventually she replied: 

 I only know this piec e of paper, er, is about the fund but I’m not --I’m not sure what is arrangement. 

Ms Kwan therefore admitted that she knew that the doc ument related to the remittanc e of the plaintiff’s funds but she still attempted to maintain her alleged ignoranc e as to what had been agreed between Mr Chu and the plaintiff. 

31     At first blush Mr Chu appeared to be a more c redible witness. Examination of his testimony, however, revealed c rac ks. Some of these are detailed later in this judgment. 

32     In c ourt, Mr Chu attempted to qualify his evidenc e about what had happened at the meeting. He was asked whether the plaintiff had made an offer of $14.5m. He responded that the figure was raised by him and that he had told the plaintiff $14.5m was the lowest figure that the defendants would ac c ept. Mr Chu then said that “He [ _ie_ , the plaintiff ] did not at that time argue on the figure”. The exc hange following this answer is set out below: 

 Mr Chu, I’m instruc ted --that Mr Ong at that meeting, whic h was the fourth meeting, offered 14.5. What do you say to that? 

 The --the offer c ame from me. But, er, if you say that --I mean we --we --we agreed to the 14.5. 

 Yes. 

 There’s no argument on that. 

 Okay. And there was agreement on the pric e at 14.5? 

 I thought there was an agreement --

 Yes. 

 --during the meeting --

 Yes 


 A --until the end of the meeting when he told me that, “Oh, okay. Let me go bac k and talk to my wife this evening”. 

33     I do not ac c ept Mr Chu’s and Ms Kwan’s evidenc e that there was no agreement bec ause the plaintiff needed to go bac k to c onsult his wife. There are various reasons for this. First, as stated, I have doubts as to the c redibility of these witnesses. Sec ondly, the events that took plac e both before and after the 31 August 2009 meeting make the first defendant’s version muc h less probable than the plaintiff’s denial that any suc h thing oc c urred. The parties had met three times before over a period of a c ouple of months. The meeting on 31 August 2009 was planned and, by that time, the plaintiff had done his sums. He had also made arrangements to bring a bank doc ument to the meeting t o show to the first defendant as proof of his ability to pay for the Property. It was not as if there was going to be an impulse purc hase on the part of the plaintiff. Sinc e the plaintiff was willing to buy the Property at $14.5m, why would he first c onfirm that and then say that he needed to go bac k to c onsult his wife? The plaintiff had the funds, raised from the sale of other assets. His wife had not previously played any part at all in the negotiations, and no need for the plaintiff to c onsult his wife was demonstrated. 

34     The plaintiff submitted that the only “stic king point” at the meeting was whether the option period would be extended. He also pointed out that Mr Chu had c onfirmed in c ourt that he was eager to sell at the time of the meeting and that he was looking at all means possible to ac c ommodate the plaintiff in order to fac ilitate the sale. Mr Chu had gone so far as to promise the plaintiff to help him get bank fac ilities if these were required to c omplete the purc hase. The plaintiff therefore submitted that the extended option period was not a problem for the first defendant. 

35     I think it likely that the exerc ise date in respec t of the option was not spec ific ally mentioned at the meeting and that the parties were talking in more general terms. This, however, does not mean t hat the parties did not agree in a general way on an extended period for exerc ise of the option. It was the plaintiff’s evidenc e that when he explained that his funds would be c oming in in Oc tober, Mr Chu had said “money no problem”. Mr Chu denied this but the plaintiff’s evidenc e was supported by FC who added that Mr Chu had emphasised that he wanted the c ompletion date to be by the end of Oc tober 2009. At that stage, the best offer that the first defendant had was for $13.5m and it was Mr Chu who had initiated the meeting with the plaintiff in the hope of getting a figure that was c loser to his desired amount of $16m. It was also Mr Chu who brought the first defendant’s asking pric e down to $14.5m and thereby made the deal possible. Mr Chu had seen the plaintiff’s bank doc ument by then and must have been satisfied that the plaintiff was a genuine buyer. I hold that in these c irc umstanc es, the first defendant was willing not to insist on the exerc ise period for the option being the normal two weeks. 

36     The events that took plac e after 31 August 2009 support the plaintiff’s c ase that agreement on t he sale and the pric e was reac hed on that date. On 1 September 2009, Mr Chu ac c epted the two Megantara c heques and in return handed the draft option to FC for transmission to the plaintiff. Mr Chu testified that this draft option had been prepared several days earlier by his solic itor (after he had been told by BEA about the $13.5m offer) and that he had printed it out on 1 September 2009 after adding some details. The draft option c ontained all the material partic ulars inc luding the pric e of $14.5m and the c ompletion date of 30 November 2009 whic h was three months after 31 August 2009. Mr Chu c onfirmed in c ourt that this doc ument had been prepared _after_ the meeting on 31 August 2009: 

 ... if you say it --“prepare” means that the putting in of --the c ertain amount, the – the figures and so on, er yes, I don’t --er, I don’t disagree. 


As the plaintiff submitted, it is also telling that Mr Chu c ontradic ted himself at this junc ture. He had earlier testified that he thought that there was no agreement bec ause the plaintiff had said he needed to c hec k with his wife. Yet, when talking about the c ompletion date of 30 November 2009, he said: 

 --that I might have put in myself or I asked PK to put it in bec ause that --when I gave to, er, er, the --the agent, er, Mr Choo, we have already --I thought we have already got an agreement. So --so that is why that date was in. 

Mr Chu prepared the draft option by inserting the material partic ulars in the draft whic h his lawyer had given him after the meeting. Therefore, it would appear that on his own evidenc e, after the meeting Mr Chu believed that there was an agreement. Otherwise, he would not have prepared the draft option and would not have had it available to hand to FC when the latter arrived with the two c heques for $139,000 and $6,000 on 1 September 2009. 

37     The fac t that the plaintiff issued two c heques for a total of $145,000 is also evidenc e that an agreement existed. The figure of $145,000 was obviously derived as the standard one perc ent option fee based on the agreed sale pric e of $14.5m. The first defendant must have told the plaintiff to issue two c heques and what the fac e amounts of eac h c heque should be. Otherwise, the plaintiff would simply have issued one c heque as he testified he had been prepared to do at the c onc lusion of the 31 August 2009 meeting. 

38     I agree with the plaintiff that, on the evidenc e, the parties had gone to their meeting on 31 August 2009 with the expec tation that an agreement was possible. I hold that at the c onc lusion of the meeting, the parties reac hed an agreement for the defendants to sell the Property to the plaintiff for $14.5m and for the defendants to issue to the plaintiff the written option to purc hase the Property required by suc h agreement upon payment of the option fee. 

39     With referenc e to the points made by the first defendant as set out in [25] above, I find no merit in the same. First, the pric e was agreed and I have held that the plaintiff had not told Mr Chu that he needed to c hec k with his wife. Sec ond, the main terms of the option, _ie_ , pric e, parties and property had been agreed. There had been no disc ussion of any of the other terms apart from payment and as far as payment was c onc erned, the plaintiff had said that his money would be in by Oc tober 2009 and Mr Chu had indic ated that as long as c ompletion took plac e before the end of the year that was ac c eptable to him. There was no dispute about timelines and indeed, when the draft option was issued, the plaintiff had no quarrel with it apart from the spec ified option exerc ise date. I have found that although the exerc ise date had not been agreed spec ific ally, this was not a c onc ern to Mr Chu who was willing that the option to be exerc ised in Oc tober 2009 when the plaintiff’s money c ame in. As for the identity of the purc haser, it was c lear to all parties that the purc haser would be the plaintiff either direc tly or through a vehic le nominated by him. The final point about the sec ond defendant’s c onsent to the sale not having been obtained is of little moment. The sec ond defendant had given Ms Kwan a power of attorney whic h enabled her to sell the Property on his behalf and Ms Kwan had agreed to the sale. Mr Chu’s own evidenc e was that when he went to Hong Kong, he did not see or speak to the sec ond defendant at all, let alone ask for his c onsent to the sale, whether to the plaintiff or to Geetex. Mr Chu stated that he _told_ his sister about the impending sale of the Property and told her to inform her husband. He did not ask her to obtain the sec ond defendant’s c onsent. This evidenc e underlines the untruth of the first defendant’s assertion that Mr Chu needed to get the sec ond defendant’s c onsent to the sale before a c ontrac t c ould be c onc luded. 

**_Is there a sufficient memorandum in writing?_** 


40     Sec tion 6(d) of the Ac t provides as follows: 

 Contracts which must be evidenced in writing 

6\. No ac tion shall be brought against – 

 ... 

 (d) any person upon any c ontrac t for the sale or other disposition of immovable property, or any interest in suc h property ... 

 unless the promise or agreement upon whic h suc h ac tion is brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, is in writing and signed by the party to be c harged therewith or some other person lawfully authorised by him. 

It c an be seen that the sec tion has three requirements. The first is that there is some written evidenc e of the c ontrac t. The sec ond is that the material terms of the c ontrac t are inc luded in the writing. The third is that the writing is signed by the party to be c harged. 

41     It is c ommon ground that s 6(d) is applic able in the present c ase as an option for the purc hase of property c reates in favour of the option holder an equitable interest in the land be sold: see _Joseph Mathew v Singh Chiranjeev_ <span class="citation">[2010] 1 SLR(R) 338</span> (“ _Joseph Mathew_ ”). 

42     The plaintiff pleads at para 18 of the amended statement of c laim that s 6(d) is satisfied by a c ombination of the following memoranda: 

 (a) Ms Kwan’s ac knowledgement of rec eipt on 1 September 2009 on the photoc opy of the Megantara c heques; 

 (b) the draft option; and 

 (c ) Ms Kwan’s ac knowledgment of rec eipt on 9 September 2009 on the photoc opy of the plaintiff’s personal c heques. 

43     The first defendant argues that s 6(d) is not satisfied bec ause: 

 (a) the doc uments that the plaintiff relies on were all referable to ac ts or events whic h took plac e after the alleged agreement was reac hed on 31 August 2009 and were not c reated at the time of that agreement; 

 (b) the requisite three “Ps” of pric e, parties and property are not satisfied bec ause the doc uments do not identify the purc haser; 

 (c ) the ac knowledgements of rec eipt of c heques do not fulfil the requirement that the memorandum has to be signed by the party to be c harged; 

 (d) the first set of c heques ac knowledged was not to be presented for payment until rec eipt of c onfirmation from the plaintiff and this means that there was no payment by the plaintiff for the option; and 

 (e) it was the plaintiff’s evidenc e that he was not expec ting an option in return for his 


 payment of $145,000 and he expec ted to only rec eive the c ontrac t after he paid a further nine perc ent of the sale pric e. 

44     Considering the first defendant’s objec tions, I see no merit in the first point whic h is that the memorandum required by s 6(d) had to be c reated prior to or at the time of the oral agreement on the option. The sec tion does not spec ify any time within whic h the nec essary writing has to be c reated. The important point is that suc h writing must exist before the ac tion is started and is in referenc e to the oral agreement and not that it was made c ontemporaneously with the oral agreement. 

45     The next two points raised by the first defendant require a c onsideration of the doc uments relied on. First, it is undeniable that the draft option was not signed. If the requirement of signature of the party to be c harged is to be met, it c an only be met by relianc e on Ms Kwan’s signature on the photoc opies of the c heques presented by the plaintiff. The question is whether the draft option may be read jointly with the ac knowledgment of rec eipt followed by her signature. The issue of whether, and if so when, disparate doc uments may be joined was raised in _Joseph Mathew_. There, the Court of Appeal rec ognised at [27] that s 6(d) c an be satisfied by a joinder of several doc uments and went on 

to approve the observations made in GH Treitel, _The Law of Contract_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 7th Ed, 1987) (“ _Treitel_ ”) at p 142: 

 Where no single doc ument fully rec ords the transac tion it may be possible to produc e a suffic ient memorandum by joining together two or more doc uments. 

 Joinder is, in the first plac e, possible where one doc ument expressly or impliedly refers to another transac tion. If that transac tion is also rec orded in a doc ument, and that doc ument was in existenc e when the first was signed the two doc uments c an be joined. [emphasis added] 

 Even where the first doc ument c ontains no referenc e to the sec ond, the two c an be joined if, on plac ing them side by side, it bec omes obvious without the aid of oral evidenc e that they are c onnec ted. ... 

46     The issue of signature has been approac hed by the c ourts in a very flexible manner. This was rec ognised in _Joseph Mathew_ at [29] of the judgment: 

 Yet another requirement in s 6(d) is that the note or memorandum must be “ signed ”. In this regard, the observations by Prof Furmston, onc e again, are apposite (see Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston ([26] supra ) at p 273): 

 The word ‘signature’ has been very loosely interpreted. In the first plac e, it need not be a subsc ription; that is to say, it need not be at the foot of the memorandum, but may appear in any part of it, from the beginning to the end. In the second place, it need not, in the popular sense of the word, be a ‘signature’ at all. A printed slip may suffice, if it contains the name of the defendant. The relaxation of the statutory language was well established a hundred years ago and offers a striking instanc e of the way in whic h legislation may be overlaid by judic ial prec edent. [emphasis added] 

47     The draft option identifies the Property and also the nature of the c onsideration both for the option and for the purc hase and sale. The photoc opy of the sec ond set of c heques identifies the parties and c ontains the signature of Ms Kwan who was an authorised direc tor of the first defendant and the donee of the sec ond defendant’s power of attorney. Therefore her signature was that of the parties to be c harged in this c ase. The first defendant’s c ontention was that the photoc opy of the sec ond set of c heques should not serve as a memorandum of the agreement bec ause when Ms Kwan 


signed it she was merely ac knowledging rec eipt of the c heques. That c ontention is not sustainable. It is true that when she signed the photoc opy on 8 September 2009, the immediate purpose of her ac tion was to ac knowledge rec eipt of the c heques. However, she only rec eived the c heques bec ause she was aware of the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendants and knew that the c heques were handed to her in the c ourse of suc h agreement. She would not have ac c epted the c heques if the agreement had not been made. 

48     Turning to the question of whether the draft option may be joined to the sec ond set of c heques, joinder c an be effec ted, as stated by _Treitel_ , where if two doc uments are plac ed side by side, it is obvious they are c onnec ted, without rec ourse to oral evidenc e. This is satisfied on the fac ts of the present c ase. The draft option states as its first paragraph: 

 IN CONSIDERATION of the sum of Singapore Dollars One Hundred and FortyFive Thousand Only ... rec eived by HAPP Y VALLEY HOLDINGS PTE LTD ... from the Purc haser this day by way of option money, the Vendor hereby grants the Purc haser this Option to purc hase the above desc ribed property ... 

When this is juxtaposed with the photoc opy of the two c heques made out to “HAPP Y VALLEY HOLDINGS PTE LTD” for the sums of $139,000 and $6,000 whic h in total made $145,000, it is c lear that the two doc uments are c onnec ted and c an be joined as suffic ient memoranda of the oral agreement between parties. 

49     Between the two doc uments, the three “Ps” are satisfied as the property, pric e and purc haser are all c learly identified. The main terms are, with one exc eption, also c ontained in the draft option inc luding the c onsideration and the date of c ompletion. The exc eption is of c ourse the date for exerc ise of the option. The draft option states that it shall expire at 3pm on 11 September 2009. This term was not agreed. If the date for exerc ise of the option was a material term of the agreement between the parties, then there is a question as to whether the failure to agree on that date is fatal to the enforc ement of the c ontrac t. 

50     I have said at [35] above that it is likely that the parties were not bothered about an extended date for exerc ise of the option. Looking at their evidenc e again in this c ontext, it is c lear that the plaintiff and Mr Chu were during their negotiations more c onc erned about the date of the c ompletion of the sale and purc hase than about the date by whic h the option should be exerc ised. In the c irc umstanc es, I find that the date for the exerc ise of the option was not a material term and the fac t that there was an error in the date mentioned in the draft option is not fatal to the enforc ement of the c ontrac t. At the time of the 31 August 2009 meeting, Mr Chu was very keen to sell at a higher pric e than he c ould get from the purc haser put forward by BEA. As long as the plaintiff was willing to pay $14.5m and do so in the usual c ompletion period, he wanted to tie the plaintiff down and was not c onc erned that the plaintiff would not have all his funds in until midOc tober. I note in partic ular that Mr Chu in his evidenc e in c ourt testified in almost so many words that the date for exerc ising the option was never mentioned or disc ussed. He also agreed that as far as he was c onc erned, time was not important, in a loose sense, as long as the sale was c ompleted at the end of three months. 

51     I therefore hold that the draft option and the ac knowledgement of the plaintiff’s c heques together c onstitute a suffic ient memorandum of the option agreement to satisfy s 6(d). The first defendant’s further argument that it was not nec essary for the defendants to issue the option bec ause the plaintiff did not permit them to present the c heques c annot be ac c epted. The initial set of c heques c ould not be presented without c onfirmation from the plaintiff but he later agreed to the presentation of the sec ond set of c heques and these were duly presented and c leared. The plaintiff thereby provided c onsideration for the grant of the option and the written doc ument should have 


been issued forthwith. 

52     The first defendant did argue that the plaintiff had agreed to the c heques being banked in without obligation on the part of the defendants. Mr Chu’s evidenc e was that he had told FC that he was going to travel to Hong Kong to ask BEA and the sec ond defendant for their permission to sell the Property and asked that the plaintiff allow the c heques to be banked in pending suc h c onsent. He asserted that the plaintiff ac c epted this c ondition. The plaintiff denied it. I do not ac c ept Mr Chu’s version of events. There was no reason for the plaintiff to have allowed the first defendant to bank in c heques for a substantial sum of money on a “no obligation” basis. The plaintiff thought that the c ontrac t had been c onc luded and knew that he had to pay the option fee. That was why he agreed to the c heques being paid in. If he had known that the c ontrac t was subjec t to the c onsent of third parties, he might have refused to bank in the c heques bec ause it would be muc h easier to pay when agreement was reac hed rather than to pay first and then have to look to the first defendant for a refund if the c onsent of the third parties was refused. 

53     Mr Chu’s evidenc e is also inc redible bec ause he had not brought up the nec essity of getting c onsent from BEA and the sec ond defendant at any time during the negotiations before the pric e of $14.5m was ac c epted. It was Mr Chu’s evidenc e that he proposed this pric e. He did not testify that at that time he told the plaintiff that the pric e was subjec t to approval. Mr Chu was the one who c alled for the meeting to be held and at all times he had ac ted as if the dec ision on the pric e at whic h the Property should be sold was entirely within his hands. His evidenc e that he told FC that he had to get c onsent must have been an afterthought. Even if he had said it, it would not have been true sinc e on 10 September 2009 he knew the bank had brought in the lower offer of $13.5m whic h it was willing to ac c ept and the sec ond defendant had already given Ms Kwan the power to sell the Property. 

54     Finally, while it may have been the plaintiff’s evidenc e that he was not expec ting an option in return for his payment of the $145,000 that does not c hange the fac t that an agreement was entered into and that it is enforc eable bec ause the requirements of s 6(d) have been met. The plaintiff as a layman may not have known at that time exac tly what to expec t but he did know that he was paying for a c ontrac t that would allow him to purc hase the Property. 

55     As I have found that the provisions of s 6(d) have been satisfied, I do not have to go on to c onsider if there was part performanc e. 

_The plaintiff’s remedy_ 

56     My finding is that there was a c ontrac t between the parties whic h obliged the defendants to issue a formal option doc ument to the plaintiff c ontaining the c lause empowering the plaintiff to purc hase the Property for $14.5m by exerc ising the option in the spec ified manner. The defendants were not entitled to ask him to inc rease his offer to $15.5m to matc h that made by Geetex. By doing so and by going on to grant for the sale of the Property to Geetex at the higher pric e, the defendants were in breac h of their c ontrac tual obligations to the plaintiff. The next issue that arises is as to the remedy available to the plaintiff. 

57     In his original statement of c laim, the plaintiff c laimed an order for spec ific performanc e requiring the defendants to issue an option to him for the purc hase of the Property at $14.5m. In the alternative, he c laimed damages whic h he partic ularised as inc luding the loss of rental from the Property. The plaintiff amended his statement of c laim in January 2011 to remove the c laim for spec ific performanc e and to limit the relief sought to general and spec ial damages. No partic ulars of spec ial damages were pleaded, however, and therefore the plaintiff’s c laim must be only for general 


damages. 

58     In his c losing submissions, the plaintiff dropped his c ontention that the general damages payable to him inc luded loss of potential rental from the Property. This was a wise dec ision sinc e that was too spec ulative a c laim and not, as far as I am aware, a head of damages that is generally allowed in c ases suc h as the present. Instead, the plaintiff c laimed that the damages payable to him should be in the sum of $1m being the amount by whic h the defendants had profited by breac hing their c ontrac t with him. 

59     As stated in _Tan Sook Yee’s Principles of Singapore Land Law_ (3rd Ed LexisNexis 2009) at 16.122, the general measure of damages for the breac h of a c ontrac t for the sale of land is the differenc e between the market value of the property at the date of c ompletion and the c ontrac t pric e. The question is whether this measure should be applied here when the c ontrac t that was breac hed by the defendants was the option c ontrac t rather than the c ontrac t for sale. The first defendant submitted that in reality, the plaintiff’s c laim was for the loss of a c hanc e of owning the Property and that the plaintiff was not able to prove that the first defendant’s breac h of agreement had c aused him to lose this c hanc e bec ause: 

 (a) the plaintiff did not take any step to exerc ise the option whic h he said should have been issued to him; 

 (b) the plaintiff did not take any step to protec t his interest in the Property by lodging a c aveat; and 

 (c ) the plaintiff did not take any step by way of injunc tion or otherwise to prevent the sale to Geetex. 

60     With due respec t, I do not think that any of the above points affec t the plaintiff’s right to c laim damages. The plaintiff was not obliged to attempt to exerc ise the option he had when he knew that the defendants had dec lared unequivoc ally that they did not rec ognise it as a binding c ontrac t. The plaintiff was not obliged to lodge a c aveat or to try and prevent the sale to Geetex. The plaintiff had the option of c hoosing to c laim damages for breac h of c ontrac t instead of trying to enforc e the option. It is not for the defendants who are in breac h of c ontrac t to tell the plaintiff what remedy he should seek. 

61     The relevant question is whether, had the defendants issued the written option, the plaintiff would have wanted to and been able to exerc ise it and c omplete the purc hase of the Property. The first defendant has not c ontended that the plaintiff did not have suffic ient funds or was not in a position to obtain suc h funds to c omplete the purc hase. The evidenc e was that the plaintiff was extremely interested in the Property bec ause of its potential to earn rental inc ome. All six units were tenanted and three of the units were oc c upied by the plaintiff’s own c ompany TSPL and therefore the plaintiff must have thought that the rental prospec ts for all the units were good. Sec ondly, the plaintiff expressed his interest over a period of three months or so and kept meeting the defendants’ representatives to disc uss the purc hase. Thirdly, the plaintiff produc ed doc uments to the first defendant to prove that he had substantial moneys c oming in and would be able to c omplete the purc hase. Fourthly, it was Mr Chu’s own evidenc e that he had offered to assist the plaintiff to obtain banking fac ilities if the plaintiff’s own funds were insuffic ient to meet the full purc hase pric e. Mr Chu did not seem to think it would be a problem to obtain a mortgage loan for 80% of the purc hase pric e from BEA or for 70% of the purc hase pric e from another bank. In the light of all the evidenc e, I hold that had the written option been issued by the defendants, the plaintiff would have exerc ised it and would, in due c ourse, have c ompleted the purc hase of the Property. 


62     In the c irc umstanc es, the damages suffered by the plaintiff would be the differenc e between what he would have paid for the Property on c ompletion and its market value at the date of the defendants’ breac h. In this instanc e, the market value at the relevant time c an be gleaned from the fac t that Geetex paid $15.5m for the Property in Oc tober 2009 as against the plaintiff’s pric e of $14.5m. Therefore, I agree that the damages payable to the plaintiff should be the differenc e of $1m. 

63     The first defendant also floated an argument on damages on the basis that the plaintiff might suc c eed in his c laim due to the applic ation of the doc trine of part performanc e. If that happened, the first defendant argued, the plaintiff would not be entitled to c ommon law damages, and c ould not c laim damages in equity either, bec ause spec ific performanc e was impossible and damages in equity c ould not be awarded in lieu of spec ific performanc e. I have found that the plaintiff is entitled to c ommon law damages sounding in c ontrac t bec ause s 6(d) of the Ac t has been satisfied. Therefore, I do not have to deal with this alternative argument on damages being unavailable as a remedy. I should say, however, that I do not find any merit in it in the c irc umstanc es of this c ase. 

**Conclusion** 

64     In the result, there will be judgment for the plaintiff against both defendants (in the c ase of sec ond defendant, in default of appearanc e) in the sum of $1m and interest thereon from the date of the writ. The first defendant shall pay the plaintiff the c osts of this ac tion.
