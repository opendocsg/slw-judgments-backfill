**Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the court):** 

**Introduction** 

1       This is an appeal by BCH Retail Investment Pte Ltd (“the appellant”) against the dec ision of the trial judge (“the Judge”) holding, _inter alia_ , that the Chief Assessor of Property Tax (“the respondent”) had been entitled not to allow a “deduc tion” (the signific anc e of the use of this terminology would be apparent later) of all reasonable advertising and promotion (“A&P”) expenses inc urred in relation to the premises known as Parc o Bugis Junc tion (“the Property”) from the gross sums paid by the tenants of the Property when it assessed the Property’s annual value under s 2 of the Property Tax Ac t (Cap 254, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”) for the purposes of property tax payable by and due from the appellant (see _BCH Retail Investment Pte Ltd v Chief Assessor_ <span class="citation">[2006] 4 SLR 73</span>) (“the GD”). 

**The facts** 

2       The fac ts before us are unc omplic ated and engender no real dispute. The appellant is a Singapore-inc orporated c ompany whic h was, at all material times, the owner of the Property. The Property had, at the time, been sub-divided into various units and let to 173 tenants. All the tenants of the Property had entered into respec tive lease agreements with the appellant c ontrac ting to pay a monthly sum c omprising the following four c omponents: 

 (a) “Basic rent”, c omprising a fixed sum payable monthly and c omputed on the basis of the number of square metres taken up by the tenant; 

 (b) “Additional rent”, c omprising an agreed perc entage of the tenant’s gross sales; 

 (c ) “Tenant’s c ontribution”, whic h c omprised the tenant’s c ontribution towards the expenses for c leaning and maintenanc e; and 

 (d) “Advertising and Promotional Contribution” (“the tenants’ A&P c ontributions”), whic h was payable in relation to advertising and promotion expenses inc urred by the appellant. 


3       For the purposes of this judgment, the sum of the basic and additional rents ( _ie_ , (a) and (b) in [2] above) together with the tenants’ A&P c ontributions ( _ie_ , (d) in [2] above) shall be c ollec tively referred to as “gross rental”. 

4       The present appeal arose from the respondent’s dec ision to rejec t the appellant’s annual returns for assessment for Financ ial Year 2003, in partic ular, the appellant’s c alc ulation of the appropriate annual value of the Property for the purposes of property tax. In arriving at its c alc ulation of the annual value of the Property, the appellant had deduc ted its ac tual A&P expenditure, namely some $2,591,707 (“the ac tual expenditure”), from the gross rental. The respondent c ontended that the appellant was only entitled to deduc t the aggregate of the tenants’ A&P c ontributions, a sum of $591,677, and rendered an assessment of the tax payable on that basis. For c onvenienc e, we shall term the differenc e between the ac tual expenditure and the tenants’ A&P c ontributions c ollec ted as “the exc ess expenditure”. 

5       So as to put the c onsequent disc ussion in its appropriate c ontext, we pause briefly here to note that this represents the sec ond time that these parties have wound up in c ourt in relation to the appropriate methodology to be utilised in asc ertaining the annual value of the Property. In 2002, the parties had appeared before Lee Seiu Kin JC (as he then was) (“Lee JC”) who had to dec ide whether the appellant should be allowed to deduc t the tenants’ A&P c ontributions from the gross rental in assessing the annual value of the Property for the purpose of levying property tax. 

6       Lee JC noted that as the annual value of a property c onc erned the use and oc c upation of the heritable subjec t, a distinc tion should be made between _rent_ and the c ost of the provision of suc h amenities in the determination of annual value. Observing that the c ost of provision of servic es should not be inc luded in the annual value of a property, he then proc eeded to hold that the tenants’ A&P c ontributions, being analogous to payment for suc h essential servic es, should similarly not to be inc luded for the purposes of c omputing the annual value (see _BCH Retail Investments Pte Ltd v Chief Assessor_ <span class="citation">[2002] 4 SLR 844</span> (“ _BCH No 1_ ”)). As he reasoned (at [17]): 

 It is well known that in order for a shopping c entre to be suc c essful in these times it has to c ontinually maintain or even renew its image and attrac tions. This is ac hieved princ ipally through advertising in various media c ombined with the holding of a variety of promotions. This would implant in the mind of the public an awareness of the shopping c entre and attrac t shoppers to the premises. Suc h expenditure is usually of a c ontinuing nature, espec ially in view of the keen c ompetition between shopping c entres. The suc c essful implementation of A&P ac tivities c ould go a long way in attrac ting c ustom to the shops in the premises thus raising the profitability of those shops and in turn the rent that the landlord would be able to c harge upon the renewal of the leases. Therefore suc h servic es are probably as essential to the tenants as the traditional ones suc h as watc hing, c leaning and air-c onditioning. In my view the princ iples of valuation should take into ac c ount modern developments so as not to stifle business innovation and c reativity. 

7       Having found therefore that, in princ iple, suc h c ontributions should not be inc luded in any c omputation for the purpose of determining annual value, in addressing the Chief Assessor’s c ontention in that c ase that suc h deduc tions had to be based on _bona fide_ c ontributions, Lee JC proc eeded to observe as follows ([6] _supra_ at [18]): 

 The Chief Assessor raised the issue, if the A&P c ontributions were allowed to be deduc ted, of the evidenc e nec essary to show that these were bona fide A&P c ontributions. But that is a question of fac t, not princ iple. If the owner c an satisfy the Chief Assessor, in relation to the A&P c ontributions, that: (1) it was reasonable to provide those servic es; (2) the tenants had agreed 


 to pay for suc h servic es; (3) the servic es were in fac t provided; and (4) the c osts of providing them were reasonably inc urred, then he ought to deduc t suc h sums from the gross rent in arriving at the annual value. It is always open to the Chief Assessor to disallow anything that he deems to be unreasonably inc urred. This was done in the Chartered Bank c ase (supra) where the landlord made a c laim of a loading of 25% on the c osts of providing watc hmen, c leaning, lifts, airc onditioning, supervision, etc. The High Court held that it was proper and reasonable for the landlord to provide those servic es and want a return on his outlay, but ruled that the c laim of 25% was too high and allowed a loading of 15%. 

8       The matter before us therefore represents a sequel of sorts to the above dec ision, with the appellant now c ontending that above and beyond allowing a deduc tion for the tenants’ A&P c ontributions, it should be entitled to a deduc tion of _all reasonable_ A&P expenses inc urred from the gross rental paid by its tenants when the assessment of the Property’s annual value is made. 

9       Before the Valuation Review Board (“the Board”), the appellant had c ontended that the test as to whether the c ost of the servic es should be deduc tible from the gross rental was threefold, namely the four-stage test artic ulated by Lee JC (as reproduc ed at [7] above) _sans_ the sec ond c ondition, _viz_ , the tenants’ agreement to pay for suc h a servic e. We would hasten to add that before the Board, the position adopted by the appellant was that _all_ A&P expenses (whether reasonably inc urred or otherwise) should be deduc tible from the gross rental in asc ertaining the annual value of the Property. The respondent, in c ontrast, highlighted that the four-stage test was c umulative and that in the light of the appellant’s failure to satisfy the sec ond c ondition, it should not, in princ iple, be allowed to deduc t the ac tual expenditure from the gross rental in arriving at the annual value for the purposes of property tax. 

10     The Board agreed with the respondent and c onsequently dismissed the appeal. In its view (see _BCH Retail Investment Pte Ltd v Chief Assessor_ [2005] SGVRB 4, hereinafter referred to as “the Board’s GD”), the c ase before it was analogous to that dec ided by Lee JC in _BCH No 1_ ([6] _supra_ ) and, ac c ordingly, it would have been “ _per incuriam_ to ignore the four c onditions and pic k and c hoose only the three deemed to be ac c eptable by the appellant” (see the Board’s GD at [48]). Instead, applying the four c onditions to the A&P expenses inc urred by the appellant, the Board agreed with the respondent that suc h sum c ould not be deduc ted from the gross rental as the tenants had not agreed to pay the exc ess expenditure. 

11     This was not the only plank on whic h the Board justified its dec ision. In the alternative, the Board dismissed the appeal on the basis that the appellant’s method of c omputation had been erroneous. The tenants’ A&P c ontributions had been deduc ted only bec ause they had initially been added to the sum that c omprises the gross rental. In effec t, the prac tic al result of suc h aggregation and deduc tion would be to _exclude_ the A&P c ontributions. This was in stark c ontrast to the method of c omputation advoc ated by the appellant, in whic h there would be a deduc tion of the ac tual amount of A&P expenses without there having been an initial imputation of suc h amounts into the aggregate gross rental. In the Board’s view, the valuation mec hanism adopted by the appellant c ould not be c ountenanc ed for it would have depressed the annual value of the Property artific ially by fac toring in and deduc ting, without any c orresponding c redit, an extraneous amount of additional A&P expenses. 

12     Dissatisfied with the dec ision of the Board, the appellant appealed to the High Court. It should be noted that by the time the appeal c ame before the Judge, the appellant had abandoned the argument that _all_ A&P expenses should be deduc tible in asc ertaining the annual value of the Property. Instead, the appellant was c ontent to c anvass the argument that only A&P expenses that were _reasonably incurred_ should be deduc tible from the gross rental in asc ertaining suc h annual value. 


13     Notwithstanding the more moderate stanc e adopted by the appellant in the proc eedings in the c ourt below, the Judge upheld the dec ision of the Board, _albeit_ on slightly different grounds. In partic ular, the Judge disagreed that the princ iples enunc iated by Lee JC in _BCH No 1_ ([6] _supra_ ) were applic able in the present c ontext. Instead, as the issue in that c ase had been limited to that of whether the sums c ollec ted by the appellant from the tenants c ould be deduc ted from the gross rentals c ollec ted in the asc ertainment of annual value, it did not purport to make any determinative finding on the overarc hing c onsideration of whether any additional amounts expended by a landlord on A&P above and beyond a tenant’s c ontrac tual c ontributions c ould be deduc ted from gross rental in determining annual value. As suc h, in the light of their narrow import, the Judge felt that the princ iples enunc iated in _BCH No 1_ would not be helpful in resolving the broader question that was before him. 

14     Instead, the Judge reasoned that unlike the tenants’ A&P c ontributions whic h should never have been inc luded in the c omputation to asc ertain the annual value of the Property in the first plac e, the exc ess expenditure was never regarded as part of the gross rent. In that c onnec tion, he c onsidered that suc h expenses would be no more than business expenses that would only be relevant for the c omputation of inc ome tax, as opposed to property tax. The Judge also appeared to be partic ularly influenc ed by the fac t that if the exc ess expenditure c ould be deduc ted when asc ertaining the annual value, this c ould have the undesirable attendant effec t of allowing landlords to vary, without muc h diffic ulty, the annual values of their respec tive properties by manipulating their A&P expenditure. As the annual value of a property is predic ated upon the c onsideration underlying a _hypothetical_ tenanc y from year to year, allowing the deduc tion of the exc ess expenditure without c aveat would invariably result in the perversion of the entire c onc eptual basis of annual value. 

**The arguments before us** 

15     The arguments before us were, in essenc e, the same as those that had been c anvassed before the Board and before the Judge. At its c ore, c ounsel for the appellant, Mr Tan Kay Kheng, rested his c lient’s c ase essentially on the proposition that, as long as the A&P expenses had been _reasonably incurred_ , they should, as a matter of princ iple, be deduc ted from the gross rental rec eived when asc ertaining the appropriate annual value. In support of this proposition, Mr Tan plac ed relianc e on the English Court of Appeal dec ision of _Bell Property Trust Ltd v Assessment Committee for the Borough of Hampstead_ [1940] 2 KB 543 (“ _Bell Property Trust_ ”) and the loc al dec ision of _Chartered Bank v The City Council of Singapore_ (1959) SPTC 1 (“ _Chartered Bank_ ”). In the appellant’s view, these c ases stand for the proposition that the c ost of servic es must, as a matter of princ iple, be deduc ted from the gross rental before arriving at the annual value of the Property. Given that it was expressly highlighted in _BCH No 1_ ([6] _supra_ ) that servic es suc h as A&P would, in the modern c ontext, be as essential to the tenants as more traditional servic es (as reproduc ed at [6] above), there should be no bifurc ation between the treatment of A&P expenses and that of the more traditional expenses. The appellant c ontended that the four requirements enunc iated by Lee JC in _BCH No 1_ would not be applic able to the fac tual matrix before us as they were not _exhaustive_ c onditions, and that it c ould not be an immutable princ iple that the deduc tibility of a partic ular expense would be dependent on an agreement with tenants as to the quantum of suc h expenses to be borne by them. 

16     Counsel for the respondent, Ms Foo Hui Min, quite unsurprisingly adopted an altogether different tac k. In her view, there was no unfettered princ iple that all reasonable expenses inc urred by a landlord should be _deducted_ from the gross rental in asc ertaining the annual value of a property for the purposes of property tax. Referring to the c ases c ited by the appellant, Ms Foo sought to distinguish them by averring that they went to only support a more limited proposition: namely, that where a _gross sum_ had been paid to c over both the c ost of the oc c upation of the premises and the servic es that were provided by the landlord, a reasonable apportionment would be allowed. As a 


c orollary, Ms Foo c ontended that where there had already been a c lear apportionment of the gross rental into its respec tive c onstituents in the lease agreements between the tenants and the appellant, there c ould be no further justific ation to undertake any _further_ apportionment with respec t to the gross rental amount. 

17     Notwithstanding the diametric ally opposed stanc es adopted by both c ounsel in relation to the law’s c onsistenc y with their respec tive positions, we pause briefly here to emphasise that they were _ad idem_ on the legal issue that, in their opinion, arose under the present fac tual matrix and it is this: whether, as a matter of princ iple, all reasonable A&P expenses c an be _deducted_ from the gross sums paid by the tenants to arrive at the annual value. We stress this bec ause, as we shall see in a moment, the c rux of the issue in the present appeal should, in our opinion, be plac ed on a markedly different footing. 

**The relevant principles and their application in the context of the present proceedings** 

18     At the outset, we would stress that any meaningful analysis of the fac tual matrix in the present proc eedings must c ommenc e with c onc eptual and definitional c larity. In this regard, it would not be wrong to suggest that the c ruc ial issue in the present dec ision would turn on our understanding of the ambit of the c onc ept of “annual value”. The definition of “annual value” itself is to be found in s 2 of the Ac t, the material part of whic h reads as follows: 

 “annual value” — 

 ( a ) in relation to a house or building or land or tenement ... means the gross amount at whic h the same c an reasonably be expec ted to be let from year to year, the landlord paying the expenses of repair, insuranc e, maintenanc e or upkeep and all taxes (other than goods and servic es tax); ... 

 [emphasis added] 

19     It will be immediately seen that the definition of “annual value” foc uses on the element of rent or letting. Indeed, it is undisputed by either party that the annual value of any given property must inc lude _only_ elements of rent or letting. To this end, any expenses that are not related to elements of rent or letting ought _not_ to be taken into ac c ount in the c omputation of annual value. This is not only logic al and fair; it is also an elementary, albeit fundamental, starting-point. Indeed, in our view, this c onc ept is so vital that it c onstitutes the main c ompass guiding all our subsequent legal navigation. 

20     Before proc eeding to analyse the c ases c ited by c ounsel in support of their respec tive c ases (as highlighted at [15] above), given the imprec ise use of c onc epts and terminology inherent in the jurisprudenc e in this area, we are of the opinion that an introduc tory pronounc ement on the general legal position would be appropriate. In this regard, while we agree with the _practical_ import of the c ases c ited by c ounsel for both parties and the reasoning found therein, we would like to stress our disc omfort with the use of the terminology of _deduction_ that appears to be inherent in the c ase law hitherto surrounding this area. In our view, relianc e on suc h terminology gives rise to unnec essary c onfusion. Let us elaborate. 

21     The c onc ept of _deduction_ , traditionally used in the sphere of _income_ tax, has no plac e in the c ontext of _property_ tax. In other words, when, in _BCH No 1_ ([6] _supra_ ), the value of the tenants’ A&P c ontributions was exc luded from the gross rental, this was not a _deduction_ as suc h, exc ept as that c onc ept is utilised in its most literal sense (as a form of subtrac tion or, more ac c urately, 


_exclusion_ ). Conc eptually, the c orrec t approac h would be to view the tenants’ A&P c ontributions in that c ase as having had _nothing to do_ with rental or letting and, c onsequently, that suc h c ontributions ought _not_ to have been taken into ac c ount or inc luded in the c omputation of the annual value of the Property in the first instanc e. It was in that c ontext that Lee JC found that the value of suc h c ontributions was to be _deducted_ , so to speak, from the gross rental. That being the c ase, the c ourt in _BCH No 1_ was entirely c orrec t in _excluding_ the amount of suc h c ontributions from the c omputation of the annual value of the property. The c ourt, therefore, was _not_ , stric tly speaking, _deducting_ the value of the tenants’ A&P c ontributions from the gross rent as suc h, but _excluding_ it. We shall term this approac h “the princ iple of _exclusion_ ”. 

22     Suc h an approac h should be c ontrasted with the situation where expenses are deduc ted for the purposes of _income_ tax, an approac h that we shall term “the princ iple of _deduction_ ”. The princ iple of _deduction_ (put in its simplest terms and shorn of a detailed ac c ount of it in relation to the relevant provisions of the Inc ome Tax Ac t (Cap 134, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the Inc ome Tax Ac t”), as to whic h see, generally, _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 16(2) (LexisNexis, 2004) at p 96 ff ) allows all reasonable expenses to be _deducted_ from the gross inc ome rec eived in a partic ular year of assessment, with the remaining inc ome being rendered (in the absenc e of other allowanc es or c onc essions) liable to tax. It will be seen that the princ iple of _deduction_ is, in substanc e, an _inclusionary_ c onc ept. All reasonable expenses that pass muster under the Inc ome Tax Ac t c an be _included_ for the purpose of _reducing_ the gross inc ome rec eived when asc ertaining assessable inc ome under that Ac t. The rationale for allowing suc h deduc tions is, in essenc e, that suc h expenses were reasonably inc urred in the produc tion of the gross inc ome rec eived and therefore should not be taxable pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Inc ome Tax Ac t. Conc eptually, this c onstitutes, in _contrast to_ the princ iple of exc lusion, a quite different approac h with an equally different rationale. 

23     We would thus urge avoidanc e of the use of the c onc ept and terminology of _deduction_ in the c ontext of property tax in order to avoid the c onc omitant c onfusion that might otherwise ensue. The c orrec t c onc ept as well as terminology should, instead, c entre on that of _exclusion_. In other words, where elements or c omponents that have nothing to do with rent or letting are inc luded in the gross rent, they ought to be _excluded_. This is, we believe, the thrust of the approac h of the c ourt in _BCH No 1_ ([6] _supra_ ) in so far as the value of the A&P c ontributions was c onc erned. 

24     In a related vein, we should also, at this junc ture, emphasise the general princ iple that the gross rent of a given property should not be equated with its annual value. Instead, and neither party disputes this, it is c learly established that where (as is often the c ase) the gross rent adopted by the tax authorities is, in fac t, the _actual_ rent, that figure, whilst helpful, is by no means c onc lusive of the annual value of the property in question (see, for example, _Bell Property Trust_ ([15] _supra_ ) as well as Leung Yew Kwong and Mani Usilappan, _Property Tax in Singapore and Malaysia_ (Butterworths Asia, 2nd Ed, 1997) at pp 124–125). That this is not only a sensible but also a logic al approac h to adopt is prec isely bec ause the gross rent (whether ac tual or hypothetic al) might in fac t c ontain elements that have nothing to do with rent or letting, and whic h therefore ought to be _excluded_. That said, depending on the ac tual fac tual matrix, it c ould well be, as was the c ase in _Chartered Bank_ , that “the ac tual rents paid are the best evidenc e on whic h to arrive at the true annual values of [the] properties” ([15] _supra_ at 2). Certainly, whilst not nec essarily c onc lusive, we would highlight that the ac tual rent paid would often be an important fac tor and/or starting-point in the assessment of the annual value of the property c onc erned. 

25     Notwithstanding the nomenc lature employed, this was, for all prac tic al purposes, prec isely the approac h that Lee JC adopted in _BCH No 1_ ([6] _supra_ ). It was c lear to us that in that c ase, Lee JC rec ognised that the gross rent represented no more than a starting-point from whic h to asc ertain the annual value after any elements that had nothing to do with rent or letting had been 


_excluded_. To this end, sinc e the gross rent had inc orporated the value of the tenants’ A&P c ontributions whic h in reality had nothing to do with rent or letting, Lee JC sought to _exclude_ suc h value for the purposes of asc ertaining the annual value of the Property. 

26     Having regard to the analysis and (more importantly) general princ iples laid down above, the c orrec t approac h to adopt in the present proc eedings (as in _BCH No 1_ ([6] _supra_ )) would be to first asc ertain whether or not the gross rent adopted as a starting point inc ludes any elements that ought _not_ to be inc luded. If, in fac t, there are suc h elements, then their value ought to be _excluded_ for the purposes of c omputing the annual value. The c orollary of suc h an approac h is that where expenses have been inc urred, but whic h have had nothing to do with rent or letting and have not been inc luded in the gross rent, they are not to be c onsidered at all. 

27     Looked at in this light, it is of no utility in the c ontext of _property_ tax to distinguish between the tenants’ A&P c ontributions in _BCH No 1_ (whic h were c ontrac tual in nature) and the additional A&P expenses that c onstitute the subjec t matter of the present appeal. Both items are, stric tly speaking, irrelevant to the c omputation of annual value. It is therefore essential that they are _not included_ in (or are _excluded_ from, as the c ase may be) the c omputation of annual value. 

28     As we have already pointed out above (see [21] above), as the tenants’ A&P c ontributions in _BCH No 1_ ([6] _supra_ ) had already been inc luded in the gross rent, the c ourt there was, on the fac ts, c orrec t in _excluding_ them for the purposes of the c omputation of annual value. What, then, is the legal status of the _additional_ A&P expenses inc urred by the appellant and whic h, in fac t, c onstitute the subjec t matter of the present appeal? In our view, it was c lear that these expenses were never (unlike the c ontrac tual tenants’ A&P c ontributions in _BCH No 1_ ) inc luded in the gross rent in the first instanc e. Applying the above c onc eptual understanding, it would be both illogic al _and_ unprinc ipled to argue (as the appellant does) that they should now be _excluded_ from the gross rent simply bec ause they were never (and, in any event, ought not to have been), _ex hypothesi_ , inc luded in the gross rent to begin with. This line of reasoning would also suc c inc tly explain the distinc tion drawn by the Judge between the A&P c ontributions in _BCH No 1_ and the additional A&P expenses that are the subjec t matter of the present appeal (see the GD at [11]). 

29     In the interest of c ompleteness, we should add that we ac c ept that if, however, the appellant’s argument (based on the princ iple of _deduction_ ) was ac c epted, any distinc tion between the tenants’ A&P c ontributions and the additional A&P expenses would be artific ial bec ause there is no material or substantive differenc e, in princ iple, between these two amounts. In other words, if one c an be deduc ted, so (in princ iple) should the other. However, it bears repeating that we are _not_ c onc erned here with the princ iple of _deduction_ but, rather, with the princ iple of _exclusion_. For the purposes of the latter princ iple, the distinc tion between the two amounts is also immaterial (see [27] above) – but for another (and quite different) reason, namely, that any and all A&P c ontributions are wholly irrelevant to a c omputation of annual value and, to that extent, should be _excluded_ from the gross rent if they have been initially _included_ (the paradigm illustration is to be found with respec t to the A&P c ontributions in _BCH No 1_ ([6] _supra_ )) and should _not be included_ if they _have not already been included_ (the paradigm illustration is to be found in the c ontext of the additional A&P expenses in the c ontext of _the present appeal_ ). 

**The case law reconsidered** 

30     If the c rux of the present appeal relates to the appropriate applic ation of the princ iple of _exclusion_ , as opposed to the princ iple of _deduction_ , the pith of both c ounsels’ arguments before us (see [15] to [16] above), whic h had been wholly predic ated upon the (erroneous) assumption of the applic ability of the latter, would be of little assistanc e and need not be c onsidered in any great detail. 


In all fairness, however, it must be stated that suc h a misunderstanding c entring on the applic ability of the c onc ept and language of _deduction_ is, in the c irc umstanc es and for reasons already alluded to, wholly understandable. Indeed, the intensity of this diffic ulty was patently undersc ored by the prevalent – though we should add, erroneous – use of suc h nomenc lature embedded within the relevant jurisprudenc e. 

31     While it would be possible to dec ide the present c ase without being unduly hampered by the nomenc lature adopted in prior jurisprudenc e, in our opinion, it would be germane not to gloss over these diffic ulties but to c ritic ally analyse whether the apparently distinc t c onc eptual basis upon whic h we feel fit to dec ide this c ase (as opposed to the _apparently_ distinc t reasoning in the c ases c ited by both parties) hints of a broader issue as to whether the reasoning in those c ases ought to be rec onsidered or rejec ted. Nonetheless, as a c loser inspec tion of the c ases c onc erned will highlight, although the c onc ept and language of _deduction_ was utilised in eac h of the c ases relied on by the parties, an in-depth analysis as well as understanding of the reasoning (as opposed to the apparent nomenc lature) employed in eac h one of these c ases would demonstrate their c omplete c onc eptual symmetry with the princ iple of _exclusion_ , and, in this regard, show that they represent arc hetypic al examples of its operation. 

32     We begin our survey of the relevant c ase law with _BCH No 1_ ([6] _supra_ ). As we have already explained, the finding in that dec ision that the tenants’ A&P c ontributions that were c ontrac tually agreed between the landlord and the tenants ought to have been exc luded from the gross rent is entirely c onsistent with the princ iple of _exclusion_ inasmuc h as these tenants’ A&P c ontributions, having had nothing to do with rent or letting, ought never to have been inc luded in the gross rent in the first instanc e for the purposes of c omputing the annual value of the property c onc erned_._ 

33     Given the distinc t stanc es adopted by the Board and the Judge in relation to the applic ability of the four c onditions eluc idated upon by Lee JC in _BCH No 1_ (see [10] and [13] above), it may be of some utility for us to highlight, albeit briefly, our views _vis-à-vis_ that point. In our view, the four c onditions laid down by Lee JC were, looked at in the _context_ of the judgment as a whole, related to the issue of the _reasonableness_ of the _amount_ of A&P c ontributions sought to be exc luded. This must, _ex hypothesi_ , assume that the _principle_ that suc h c ontributions c ould be exc luded as a matter of law applied in the first instanc e. That this is so is evidenc ed by the fac t that Lee JC had already dealt with this partic ular issue of princ iple in the paragraph prec eding that in whic h the four c onditions just mentioned are found. Indeed, the main portion of that partic ular (prec eding) paragraph has already been quoted earlier (at [6]). It was only after having dealt with the _principle_ c onc erned, that Lee JC then proc eeded to eluc idate upon the four c onditions that would apply. 

34     Even a c ursory perusal of the passage in question (quoted at [7] above) would reveal that Lee JC was dealing with the issue of the _reasonableness_ of the _amount_ of tenants’ A&P c ontributions sought to be exc luded by the taxpayer (see, in partic ular, the phrase “if the A&P c ontributions were allowed to be deduc ted”). Indeed, Lee JC thought that the issue c onc erned “a question of fac t, not princ iple”. The four c onditions then followed. It is interesting, in this regard, to note that two of the c onditions ( _viz_ , (1) and (4)) deal direc tly with the issue of reasonableness. Condition (3) c onstitutes a fac tual pre-requisite. The remaining c ondition ((2)) is the one whic h engendered some legal c ontroversy in the c ontext of the present proc eedings in so far as it c onstituted one of the reasons given by the Board for its dismissal of the initial appeal (see [10] above). 

35     In our view, a c lose examination of c ondition (2) in the c ontext of the judgment as a whole and that paragraph of the judgment in partic ular reveals that it relates to the issue of reasonableness as well. Indeed, where the tenants have agreed – and are therefore legally obliged – to pay the landlord a pre-determined amount for the latter’s provision of A&P servic es, suc h agreement would 


probably c onstitute at least _prima facie_ evidenc e that the amount c onc erned was reasonable in quantum. The proposition that the four c onditions laid down in the above passage were c onc erned with the reasonableness of the amount of tenants’ A&P c ontributions only is c onfirmed by the learned judge’s referenc e to a c ase to be c onsidered shortly, _viz_ , _Chartered Bank_ ([15] _supra_ ). In partic ular, Lee JC referred to the fac t how, in so far as one partic ular item was c onc erned in _Chartered Bank_ , the c ourt _reduced_ the c laim from 25% to 15%. This is c learly a referenc e to reduc tion on the basis of reasonableness (or, more ac c urately, unreasonableness) in quantum. In light of that, we would respec tfully disagree with the findings of the Board that the four c onditions eluc idated upon by Lee JC in _BCH No 1_ ([6] _supra_ ) are applic able in the present c ontext. 

36     Another dec ision relied on heavily by c ounsel for the appellant, Mr Tan, was the High Court dec ision of _Chartered Bank_ ([15] _supra_ ). In that c ase, there was ( _unlike_ the situation in _BCH No 1_ ([6] _supra_ )), _no_ itemisation of the various c omponents of the gross rent as suc h. Nevertheless, the taxpayer proc eeded to list out spec ific items, whic h it argued merited exc lusion from the gross rent in the c ontext of the c omputation of the annual value of the property c onc erned. 

37     There were eight items _in toto_ involved in _Chartered Bank_ ([15] _supra_ ). Mr Tan pointed out that whilst the first five items c onstituted ac tual expenditure (for watc hmen and c leaning, lifts, air c onditioning, c ommon parts as well as c ost of supervision and servic es), the remaining three were not inasmuc h as they c onstituted notional expenditure only. Notwithstanding that, the c ourt held that all eight items c ould be exc luded from the gross rents of the properties in question. In a situation suc h as this, therefore, where (unlike that in _BCH No 1_ ([6] _supra_ )) the _components_ of the gross rental have not been spec ified, the c ourts have nevertheless been willing to exc lude items where the taxpayer has been able to demonstrate to the c ourts’ satisfac tion that the items c onc erned were indeed _unrelated_ to rental or letting. 

38     However, one would imagine that where (as in _BCH No 1_ ([6] _supra_ )) the c omponents of gross rental have in fac t been identified individually, the task of the c ourt is _facilitated_ inasmuc h as the items c onc erned have been struc turally isolated right from the outset (assuming, of c ourse, that suc h identific ation was not in the nature of a sham transac tion). Muc h would, of c ourse, still depend upon the prec ise nature of the item c onc erned. In _BCH No 1_ itself, for example, a threshold issue that arose c entred on whether or not the A&P expenses paid by the tenants to the landlord c ould, in _principle_ , be c lassified as an item that was _not_ related to renting or letting and whic h should therefore be exc luded from the c omputation of annual value. The c ourt held that suc h expenses did indeed c onstitute a servic e provided by the landlord to the tenants and therefore did not fall within the purview of the c onc ept of annual value. 

39     Returning to _Chartered Bank_ ([15] _supra_ ), it is c lear that that c ase is entirely c onsistent with the analysis set out above. Onc e again, the items c onc erned were held by the c ourt there to be unrelated to rental or letting, and the c ourt _excluded_ the value of these items from the gross rental in arriving at the final annual values for the properties c onc erned. While onc e more, the c onc ept as well as language of _deduction_ was, unfortunately in our view, utilised by the c ourt, a reasonable reading of the judgment indic ates that the c ourt was of the view that all expenses _vis-à-vis_ the items just mentioned would be borne out of the gross rentals (this is, _a fortiori_ , the c ase with respec t to the items of _notional_ expenditure). This suggests, in turn, that the gross rentals were formulated with these items in mind. In the c irc umstanc es, therefore, sinc e they were _not_ related to rental or letting, they ought _not_ to have been inc luded in the first instanc e: henc e, the _exclusion_ of the value of suc h items from the annual values of the respec tive properties. 

40     We should add that if, however, it is argued that one or more of these items had _not_ been inc luded within the c omputation of the gross rents in the first instanc e, then we would respec tfully 


disagree with the analysis of the learned judge in that c ase inasmuc h as he must then have been nec essarily (though erroneously) applying the princ iple of deduc tion as opposed to the princ iple of exc lusion. However, suc h an approac h does not, from a perusal of the judgment in _Chartered Bank_ ([15] _supra_ ) itself, c learly appear to have been taken and, indeed, we are of the view that a more persuasive interpretation of the reasoning underlying that dec ision is that the value of the items c onc erned had in fac t already been inc orporated within the gross rent right from the outset. 

41     Quite ingeniously, on the bac k of the fac tual matrix in _Chartered Bank_ ([15] _supra_ ), Mr Tan c ontended that if the dec ision of the c ourt below in the present proc eedings was upheld, this might lead to landlords not spec ifying the spec ific c omponents of gross rental and then attempting to exc lude their _entire_ A&P expenditure in the c omputation of annual value by c ontending that suc h c osts were not related to rental or letting. In suc h an instanc e, on the assumption the c ourt ac c epts that a partic ular item (in this c ase, A&P expenditure) ought to be exc luded from the c omputation of annual value, the quantum of the sum allowed to be exc luded would still be subjec t to the test of reasonableness. In this regard, in drawing an analogy to the fac ts before us, Mr Tan’s argument, in essenc e, was this: if the appellant had struc tured his affairs in the manner that the landlords in _Chartered Bank_ did, the respondent would have to assess the expenses inc urred and c onsider whether they had been inc urred reasonably in allowing for any deduc tion for the purposes of asc ertaining the annual value of the Property. In that sense, allowing this appeal would do no more than arrive at the same end goal: _ie_ , even if the additional A&P expenses were allowed in the present appeal, the prec ise quantum that would be allowed would still be subjec t to the test of reasonableness as applied by the respondent. 

42     That a landlord c ould struc ture his affairs to be c onsonant with the above analysis c annot be seriously disputed: _Chartered Bank_ ([15] _supra_ ), after all, does indeed illustrate that landlords c ould still tender spec ific items before the Chief Assessor and/or the c ourts, arguing that they were not related to rental or letting and should therefore be exc luded from the c omputation of the annual value of the property c onc erned. Be that as it may, we are not persuaded by the merits of suc h an argument. Though it would be the landlords’ prerogative to adopt suc h an approac h, assuming that they are able to do so without objec tions and/or c ounterproposals from ac tual or prospec tive tenants with respec t to spec ific items (of whic h A&P expenses spring readily to mind), we should also observe that, absent any finding of bad faith on the part of the landlord, the _express_ spec ific ation of the various c omponents of gross rent (as in this c ase) might _in fact_ tend to work in the landlord’s favour inasmuc h as it would be able to demonstrate to the satisfac tion of the Chief Assessor and/or the c ourt that not only were the items c onc erned arrived at in good faith but also (provided that there is a finding that these items were unrelated to rent or letting) that the values spec ified therein (being the produc t of an arm’s length transac tion) would be reasonable – at least on a _prima facie_ basis. 

43     This is to be c ontrasted with a situation where the landlord spec ifies only the gross rent and then attempts (as in _Chartered Bank_ ) to argue that c ertain items were in fac t not part of the gross rent and ought therefore to be exc luded from the c omputation of the annual value of the property c onc erned. One would have thought that the landlord would, in adopting suc h an approac h, have plac ed itself in at least no better a position than it would have been had it (as in _BCH No 1_ ) expressly spec ified the various c omponents of the gross rental. And it would have no _prima facie_ value that it c ould argue as a starting-point – not only from the perspec tive of assessment but also from the perspec tive of proving the reasonableness of that value. 

44     Finally, we turn to the English Court of Appeal dec ision of _Bell Property Trust_ ([15] _supra_ ), whic h was heavily relied upon by Lee JC in _BCH No 1_ ([6] _supra_ ) itself. In that c ase, the tenants c onc erned eac h paid a c omprehensive sum, desc ribed as rent, _both_ for the oc c upation of the flat _and_ for the benefit of _services and amenities_ provided by the landlord. The issue arose (as Goddard LJ (as 


he then was), reading the judgment of the c ourt, put it) “as to what portion of the gross sums payable by the tenants was ac tually for rents and how muc h was remuneration for servic es, or c onsideration for servic es and amenities provided for the tenants by the landlord” (see _id_ at 552). Indeed, as the learned judge noted, “it appears in the present c ase that the experienc ed surveyors who represented the respec tive parties agreed in princ iple that the proper method was to find out the value of the servic es and amenities offered, and to deduc t them from the gross sum whic h the tenant pays, leaving the balanc e to represent the true value of the flat” (see _id_ at 553). 

45     We note onc e again the c ourt’s utilisation of the c onc ept and language of deduc tion. Indeed, given that _Bell Property Trust_ was the first c ase in time to have been dec ided amongst the c ases that have been relied on by the parties, we would find it hardly surprising if the inappropriate use of nomenc lature there prec ipitated the use of suc h terminology in the subsequent dec isions. To reiterate, it would have been preferable if the c ourt there had utilised the c onc ept and language of _exclusion_ instead bec ause that is, in substanc e, what, with respec t, we think the c ourt in that c ase ac tually meant. However, and to return to the princ iple at hand, it is c lear that where sums payable by a tenant to the landlord have _nothing to do_ with rent or letting, they must be _excluded_ from the c omputation of the annual value of the property c onc erned. In _Bell Property Trust_ , the c ourt therefore held that the c ost to the landlord of providing the tenant with various servic es and amenities ought to be exc luded from the gross payments by the tenant before arriving at the “gross value” (the equivalent of “annual value” under the Ac t) to be inserted into the valuation list. Indeed, the c ourt even went so far as to permit an allowanc e for a reasonable profit to the landlord for the provision of the aforementioned servic es to be _excluded_. 

46     Taking the fac tual matrix of _Bell Property Trust_ ([15] _supra_ ) in the round, so to speak, it is c lear that the amounts whic h were “ _deducted_ ” from the gross amounts payable by the tenants to the landlord had _nothing to do_ with rent or letting. Applying the princ iple of _exclusion_ , suc h amounts _ought not to have been included in the first instance_ , and were therefore c orrec tly _excluded_ from the gross amounts payable by the tenants to the landlord. 

47     In summary, notwithstanding the inappropriate use of the terminology and c onc ept of deduc tion, it will be seen that the c ases relied on by the parties are, at the very least, c onc eptually c onsonant with the princ iple of _exclusion_ as understood in the present judgment. 

**Conclusion** 

48     In the premises, we dismiss the appeal with c osts, albeit for somewhat different reasons from those given in the c ourt below.
