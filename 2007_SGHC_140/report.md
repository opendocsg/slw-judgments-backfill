30 August 2007 

**Tay Yong Kwang J:** 

1       The appellant (“the wife”) is the respondent in Divorc e Petition No. 1063 of 2004 while the respondent here (“the husband”) is the petitioner in the said divorc e proc eedings. The parties were married on 10 July 1998. They have one c hild, a son, now 5 years old. On 29 Marc h 2004, the husband c ommenc ed divorc e proc eedings to dissolve the marriage on the ground of the wife’s unreasonable behaviour. A dec ree nisi was granted. 

2       On 24 January 2005, the husband obtained an order of c ourt from Distric t Judge Joc elyn Ong on the anc illary matters (“the anc illary order of 24 January 2005”). Besides providing for the sale of the matrimonial home, this order granted the husband (at paragraph 5(a) of the same): 

 “sole c ustody, c are and c ontrol of the c hild of the marriage, [JS] and the [wife] to surrender the c hild’s passport and birth c ertific ate to the [husband]. The [wife] shall be at liberty to apply for ac c ess.” 

3       The husband alleged that the wife had failed to c omply with the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 by not handing over c ustody of the c hild and by failing to surrender his passport and birth c ertific ate. The husband then applied for leave to proc eed against the wife for c ontempt of c ourt pursuant to O 52 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed). The Statement of Fac ts dated 28 April 2006, prepared pursuant to O 52 Rule 2(2), set out the following grounds for the applic ation: 

 (a) On 24th January 2005, the [husband] obtained an Order of Court. On 8th Marc h 2006, the said Order endorsed with the Penal Notic e was served personally on [the wife]. 

 (b) On 7th Marc h 2006, the [wife’s] applic ation to set aside the Order of Court dated 24th January 2005 was dismissed by the Honourable Distric t Judge Ms Carol Ling. On 21st Marc h 2006 the Honourable Distric t Judge Mr Jeffrey Sim granted the [wife’s] applic ation for a stay of the Order of Court dated 24th January 2005 pending the outc ome of the appeal. On 26th April 2006, 


 the Honourable Justic e Belinda Ang dismissed the [wife’s] appeal in RAS 25/2006. 

 (c ) The [wife] has failed to hand over the c hild of the marriage to the [husband] pursuant to the Order dated 24th January 2005 on 26th April 2006 after the appeal was dismissed. Further, the [wife] failed to surrender the c hild’s passport and birth c ertific ate to the [husband]. 

 (d) On 22nd August 2005, the Honourable Distric t Judge Ms Shobha Nair made, inter alia, interim orders in OSF 98/2005 that the [husband] has ac c ess to the c hild of the marriage from 7.00pm to 8.00pm daily and between 2.00pm to 6.00pm every Sunday. 

 (e) On 26th April 2006 and 27th April 2006, the [wife] failed to allow the [husband] to have ac c ess to the c hild of the marriage, JS. 

 4 [The wife] is therefore in c ontempt of paragraph 5(a) of the Order of Court dated 24th January 2005 and is in c ontempt of the orders for ac c ess given by the Honourable Distric t Judge Ms Shobha Nair. 

4       Leave was granted to the husband to proc eed with an applic ation for an order of c ommittal against the wife. 

5       The husband’s applic ation was heard before Distric t Judge Joc elyn Ong (“the DJ”) who found the wife guilty of c ontempt of c ourt as she had deliberately refused to c omply with the anc illary order of 24 January 2005. The DJ then imposed a fine of $1,000 on the wife and ordered her to pay the c osts of the c ommittal proc eedings fixed at $1,500. 

6       The wife appealed to the High Court against the DJ’s dec ision. I dismissed her appeal and ordered her to pay c osts of $3,000 whic h was to be paid out from the sec urity furnished by her for the appeal. She has now appealed to the Court of Appeal against my dec ision. 

**The applications in the Family Court** 

7       To fac ilitate a better understanding of the various applic ations before the Family Court, they are set out c hronologic ally below: 

 29 Marc h 2004 The husband filed Divorc e Petition No. 1063 of 2004 

 13 July 2004 Dec ree Nisi was granted 

 24 January 2005 The anc illary order of 24 January 2005 was made 

 19 April 2005 Dec ree Nisi was made Absolute 

 22 June 2005 The husband filed OSF No. 98 of 2005 to seek an order that the wife return the c hild to his lawful c ustody, c are and c ontrol pursuant to the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 


22 August 2005 DJ Shobha Nair adjourned OSF No. 98 of 2005 pending the outc ome of the wife’s applic ation to set aside the anc illary order of 24 January 2005, ordering the wife in the meantime to give the husband ac c ess to the c hild between 7pm and 8pm daily and from 2pm to 6pm on Sundays 

2 September 2005 The wife filed SIC No. 14083 of 2005 in the Divorc e Petition to set aside the Dec ree Nisi and Dec ree Absolute and the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 

23 January 2006 DJ Carol Ling started hearing the above SIC 

7       Marc h 2006 DJ Carol Ling dismissed the said SIC 

8       Marc h 2006 The husband took over c ustody, c are and c ontrol of the c hild 

9       Marc h 2006 The wife filed Summons No. 3432 of 2006 in OSF No. 98 of 2005 for interim c ustody, c are and c ontrol of the c hild. Deputy Registrar Regina Ow , at an interim pre-trial c onferenc e, ordered the husband to return the c hild to the wife and the ac c ess orders granted by DJ Shobha Nair on 22 August 2005 to c ontinue, pending c larific ation by the said DJ on her orders 

10     Marc h 2006 The wife appealed against DJ Carol Ling’s dec ision 

16     Marc h 2006 The wife filed Summons No. 3814 of 2006 for stay of the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 pending appeal 

21     Marc h 2006 DJ Shobha Nair c larified that the interim orders made by her on 22 August 2005 were to c ontinue until the outc ome of the wife’s applic ation to set aside the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 and not until the next hearing of OSF No. 98 of 2005. DJ Jeffrey Sim granted her the wife the stay sought by her 

26 April 2006 Belinda Ang J dismissed the wife’s appeal against DJ Carol Ling’s dec ision of 7 Marc h 2006 

28 April 2006 The husband filed Summons No. 6060 of 2006 for leave to apply for a c ommittal order. Leave was granted to him to do so in respec t of the alleged failure by the wife to c omply with the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 

2 May 2006 The husband next filed Summons No. 6204 of 2006 pursuant to the leave given above 


 10 May 2006 OSF No. 98 of 2005 was heard. Summons No. 3432 of 2006 was dismissed and the wife was ordered to return the c hild to the husband. 

**The DJ’s findings** 

8       The wife was c ross-examined at the hearing below. The DJ noted that the c ontempt proc eedings alleged non-c omplianc e with the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 after the appeal to Belinda Ang J was dismissed as well as the failure to c omply with DJ Shobha Nair’s order of 22 August 

2005\. Sinc e the leave granted to the husband to apply for an order of c ommittal was c onfined to the alleged breac h of the anc illary order of 24 January 2005, the DJ dec ided that the only ground that the husband c ould proc eed on was that alleged breac h. For this, she relied on O 52 r 5(3) of the Rules of Court whic h states: 

 Exc ept with the leave of the Court hearing an applic ation for an order of c ommittal, no grounds shall be relied upon at the hearing exc ept the grounds set out in the statement under Rule 2. 

9       The DJ disagreed with the wife’s argument that c ontempt proc eedings c ould apply only to orders that required the alleged c ontemnor to do a positive ac t within a spec ified period. It was submitted by the wife that the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 did not require suc h a positive ac t (suc h as returning the c hild to the husband) to be done and all that the said order stated was that c are and c ontrol was given to the husband. The DJ held that what was required to establish c ontempt was a deliberate ac t breac hing an order of c ourt (c iting _OCM Opportunities Fund II, LP and others v Burhan Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and others (No. 2)_ [2005] 3 SLR 60) and that the standard of proof in suc h proc eedings was proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, she held, the wife’s submissions ignored the fac t that the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 required her to surrender the c hild’s passport and birth c ertific ate to the husband. 

10     The DJ noted that the wife’s defenc e was her relianc e on the order of 9 Marc h 2006 made by Deputy Registrar Regina Ow, that pending the outc ome of Summons No. 3432 of 2006, the c hild was to be returned to the wife forthwith with ac c ess granted to the husband along the same terms as those set out by DJ Shobha Nair on 22 August 2005. The wife maintained that she had no intention of breac hing the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 as she believed or was told that she had c ustody, c are and c ontrol of the c hild by virtue of the order of 9 Marc h 2006. 

11     The DJ rejec ted the wife’s defenc e. She held that the order of 9 Marc h 2006 did not grant the wife c ustody, c are and c ontrol of the c hild as alleged and found the wife “c learly lying” during c rossexamination. At any rate, the DJ said, whatever misunderstanding that the wife had should have been dispelled by 21 Marc h 2006 when DJ Shobha Nair c larified her order at the request of the wife’s solic itors whic h arose in the following way. After the wife’s applic ation to set aside the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 was dismissed by DJ Carol Ling on 7 Marc h 2006, the husband’s solic itors wrote to the wife’s solic itors to make arrangements for the handover of the c hild and his doc uments. The wife’s solic itors disputed the interpretation of the order of 22 August 2005, holding the view that the said order granted interim ac c ess to the husband until the next hearing of OSF No. 98 of 2005. The wife’ solic itors therefore sought c larific ation from DJ Shobha Nair who c larified that the order made by her was to stand pending the outc ome of the wife’s applic ation to set aside the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 and not until the further hearing of said OSF. The DJ was therefore of the opinion that there c ould be no misunderstanding or misinterpretation after 21 Marc h 2006. The DJ further held that the order made on 9 Marc h 2006 c ould not override the anc illary order of 24 January 2005. 


12     The DJ was therefore of the view that when the wife’s appeal was dismissed by Belinda Ang J on 26 April 2006, the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 remained valid and effec tive and it was inc umbent on the wife to c omply with its terms. On 5 May 2006, the wife handed over the c hild’s passport to the husband. On 10 May 2006, she returned the c hild to him after the dismissal of Summons No. 3432 of 2006. At the time of the hearing of the c ontempt proc eedings on 16 May 2006, the wife had not handed over the birth c ertific ate. The birth c ertific ate was handed over to the husband only after the DJ had found the wife guilty of c ontempt of c ourt. 

13     The DJ was left with no doubt that the wife had deliberately refused to c omply with the anc illary order of 24 January 2005. She c onc luded her judgment as follows: 

 18 ... She did not like the Order and simply refused to obey it. After her appeal to set aside the Anc illary Order was dismissed on 26th April 2006, she c ontinued to disobey the Order notwithstanding the c larific ation by DJ Shobha Nair on 21st Marc h 2006, of whic h she was well aware. She stubbornly insisted on her own “interpretation” of the various orders even after it was made c lear to her that her interpretation was inc orrec t and she c ontinued to ac t in defianc e and c ontempt of the Anc illary Order. She c annot rely on a deliberate misinterpretation to exc use her breac h. 

 19 I thought a fine would be appropriate in this c ase and as it involved a c ustody issue, I imposed a fine of only $1,000. As c osts follow the event I also ordered the wife to pay c osts. The hearing took half a day. I noted the husband’s submission that the proc eedings c ould have been shortened had the wife admitted her c ontempt and I fixed c osts at $1,500. 

**The appeal in the High Court** 

14     The wife’s solic itors c ited _Lowe and Sufrin’s The Law of Contempt_ , 3rd edition, and submitted before me that a person may be punished for c ontempt of c ourt only if the terms of the order allegedly breac hed are c lear and unambiguous, the alleged c ontemnor had proper notic e of the terms and the breac h is proved beyond reasonable doubt. It was argued that the anc illary order of 24 January 2005, while c lear in requiring the wife to hand over the passport and the birth c ertific ate, did not spec ify a time within whic h this was to be done. The wife’s solic itors relied on O 45 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court whic h provides: 

 Where – 

 (a) a person required by a judgment or order to do an ac t within a time spec ified in the judgment or order refuses or neglec ts to do it within that time or, as the c ase may be, within that time as extended or abridged under Order 3, Rule 4; ... 

 then, subjec t to these Rules, the judgment or order may be enforc ed by one or more of the following means: 

 (i) with the leave of the Court, an order of c ommittal; ... 

It was thus submitted that as there was no time spec ified in the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 for the wife to perform the matters in issue, she c ould not possibly have ac ted in c ontempt of the order. 

15     In so far as handing over c ustody of the c hild was c onc erned, it was argued that the wife was 


not in breac h of the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 as there was in fac t a subsequent order made in OSF No. 98 of 2005 when the Family Court was aware that the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 had been obtained unilaterally. Onc e the said OSF and the applic ations therein were heard on 10 May 2006 and an order was made that the c hild be returned to the husband, the wife c omplied. If the wife, as found by the DJ, “did not like the Order and simply refused to obey it”, she would not have obeyed the order made on 10 May 2006 ordering her to hand over the c hild. 

16     The wife’s solic itors further argued that the c larific ation by DJ Shobha Nair on 21 Marc h 2006 was made immediately before the hearing of the wife’s applic ation for a stay of the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 and that DJ Shobha Nair did not indic ate that her c larific ation was to bind subsequent c ourts hearing the matter. 

17     The husband’s solic itors, on the other hand, argued that when an order of c ourt did not spec ify a time frame for the doing of c ertain things, the party in question must perform those things within a reasonable time. The wife c laimed before the DJ that she had sight of the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 sinc e August or September 2005. There was no stay of the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 until 21 Marc h 2006 and even this lapsed upon the dismissal of the wife’s appeal to the High Court on 26 April 2006. It followed that she had failed to c omply with the said order between September 2005 and 21 Marc h 2006 and again after 26 April 2006. On this point in the husband’s submissions, it must be borne in mind that the Statement of Fac ts filed for the purposes of obtaining leave to c ommenc e the c ontempt proc eedings relied only on the wife’s c onduc t post-26 April 2006 (see [3(c )] above). I therefore disregard the allegation of c ontempt prior to that date. 

18     On 2 May 2006, the wife’s solic itors wrote to the husband’s solic itors to say that: 

 1 ... 

 2 Our c lient is not agreeable to the handing over of the passport. Your c lient c an easily leave the c ountry with[JS]. 

 3 We suggest that the passport be held by us as stakeholders. 

This, the husband submitted, was nothing more than an exc use to avoid c omplying with the anc illary order of 24 January 2005. 

19     The husband further submitted that the order of 9 Marc h 2006 in OSF No. 98 of 2005 was, at the highest, dealing only with ac c ess rights pending the hearing of the wife’s applic ation. It did not grant the wife interim c are and c ontrol of the c hild. There was no order whic h superseded the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 whic h remained valid and enforc eable, partic ularly after 26 April 2006, and the wife offered no reason why she refused to hand over the c hild after that date. 

20     Sec tion 8 of the Subordinate Courts Ac t (Cap 321, 2007 Revised Edition) provides: 

 (1) The subordinate c ourts shall have power to punish for c ontempt of c ourt where the c ontempt is c ommitted – 

 (a) in the fac e of the c ourt; or 

 (b) in c onnec tion with any proc eedings in the subordinate c ourts. 

 (2) Where c ontempt of c ourt is c ommitted in the c irc umstanc es mentioned in subsec tion (1), 


 the c ourt may impose imprisonment for a term not exc eeding 6 months or a fine not exc eeding $2,000 or both. 

 ... 

21     I reiterate here the purpose and princ iples of c ontempt of c ourt proc eedings as enunc iated by the Court of Appeal in _Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd v Karaha Bodas_ [2007] 2 SLR 518: 

 22 It is imperative to note, at the outset, that the doc trine of c ontempt of c ourt is not intended, in any manner or fashion whatsoever, to protec t the dignity of the judges as suc h; its purpose is more objec tive and is (more importantly) rooted in the public interest. 

 ... 

 28 It should also be borne in mind that a c ourt will not make a finding of c ontempt of c ourt lightly. 

 ... 

 31 The law with respec t to this partic ular issue is now well-established: the standard of proof is the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt ... 

 ... 

 82 The following observations in a leading textbook are also apposite ... : 

 It is no defenc e to c ontempt proc eedings to allege that the order should not have been made, or has been disc harged. An order of the c ourt must be obeyed while it stands, and a breac h is still c ontempt even if, at a later stage, the order is in fac t disc harged. The same principle applies if the original order was wrongly made; the defendant’s remedy is to apply for its immediate discharge while keeping to its terms. 

22     More rec ently (after the hearing of the present appeal), V K Rajah JA in _You Xin v PP_ [2007] SGHC 120 at [14] said: 

 It is settled law that a single, paramount and broad princ iple underlines the law of c ontempt. It was noted by Sir John Donaldson MR in Attorney-General v Newspaper Publishing Plc [1988] Ch 333 ... that “[t]he law of c ontempt is based upon the broadest of princ iples, namely that the c ourts c annot and will not permit interferenc e with the due administration of justic e”. It is important to note that it is justic e itself that is flouted by c ontempt of c ourt, not the individual c ourt or judge who is attempting to administer it. The overriding objec t of c ontempt of c ourt is not merely to protec t the dignity of the c ourts but essentially to protec t the administration of justic e. To that extent the term c ontempt of c ourt is in reality a misnomer. 

23     I do not ac c ept the wife’s submissions relating to the absenc e of a time frame within whic h she was required by the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 to c omply with its terms. An order of c ourt takes effec t from the date it is pronounc ed unless the c ourt spec ifies otherwise in the said order or dec ides subsequently to stay the same. Although O 42 r 6(1) of the Rules of Court states that a judgment or order whic h requires a person to do an ac t must spec ify the time after servic e of the judgment or order, or some other time, within whic h the ac t is to be done, that is subjec t to O 42 


r 6(2) whic h exempts orders requiring payment of money, giving of possession of immovable property or delivery of movable property. The handing over of the c hild’s passport and birth c ertific ate would fall within the last c ategory of exempted orders and, by logic al extension, so c ould the c hild himself. Even if the c hild was exc luded from the exemptions, there was still no exc use for not handing over the doc uments timeously. 

24     O 45 r 5 of the Rules of Court does not mean that where a judgment or order does not spec ify a time frame, c ontempt proc eedings c an never be taken out. In suc h a situation, it behoves the applic ant in c ontempt proc eedings to prove that a reasonable time for c omplianc e had elapsed. Similarly, s 52 of the Interpretation Ac t (Cap 1, 2002 Revised Edition), whic h relates to the c onstruc tion and interpretation of written law, states: 

 Where no time is presc ribed or allowed within whic h anything shall be done, that thing shall be done with all convenient speed and as often as the presc ribed oc c asion arises. 

 (emphasis added) 

Alternatively, the applic ant c an apply under O 45 r 6(2) for the c ourt to fix a time within whic h an ac t is to be done but that is really quite unnec essary here bec ause c omplianc e required no more than bringing the c hild and the doc uments to the husband or asking him to go to her home to pic k him up together with the doc uments in issue. That c ould have been done on the day that Belinda Ang J dismissed the wife’s appeal if the wife had genuine regard for all orders of c ourt and not just those in her favour. If the wife’s submissions are c orrec t, it would mean that she c ould ignore with impunity the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 until the husband takes the further step of applying for a time frame for c omplianc e. In my view, that c annot be c orrec t. 

25     The wife ought to have c omplied with the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 after it was served on her or her solic itors. She c ertainly should have c omplied with it by the time her appeal was dismissed by the High Court. There c ould have been no ambiguity by 26 April 2006 (when Belinda Ang J dismissed the wife’s appeal) that “sole c ustody”, whic h was given to the husband, meant that it was inc umbent on her to hand over the c hild to the husband and that liberty for her to apply for ac c ess c ould only mean that the c hild was no longer to be in her c ustody. She was represented by solic itors. She has shown no impediment to suc h c omplianc e save for her own intransigenc e and purported misunderstanding of the orders of c ourt. It was c lear that the husband wanted the c hild and the doc uments handed over as ordered. It was equally c lear that the wife was determined not to do that. She had embarked on a series of exc uses and applic ations in order to justify her nonc omplianc e. Then she feigned misunderstanding of the various orders of c ourt generated by the applic ations. Her arguments about the absenc e of a time frame for c omplianc e were therefore disingenuous bec ause there c ould be no doubt that she would not have c omplied within any spec ified time even if it were printed in bold letters in the order of c ourt. Indeed, her main exc use for not c omplying was that there was a subsequent order of c ourt c ontradic ting the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 and not that she did not know when or what to do in order to c omply. I agree with the DJ that, in any event, any alleged misunderstanding ended when DJ Shobha Nair made the c larific ation sought. 

26     The DJ c ame to her c onc lusion that the wife deliberately flouted the anc illary order of 24 January 2005 after hearing her oral testimony in c ourt. She was c onsc ious of the standard of proof required in suc h proc eedings. It is established law that an appellate c ourt should defer to the trial judge’s findings in suc h a situation. No submissions were made before me regarding the amount of the fine ($1,000) imposed or the order made as to c osts of the c ontempt proc eedings. 


27     Ac c ordingly, I affirmed the dec ision of the DJ and dismissed the appeal with c osts fixed at $3,000 to be paid by the wife to the husband, suc h c osts to be paid by means of the sec urity deposit furnished by the wife for this appeal.
