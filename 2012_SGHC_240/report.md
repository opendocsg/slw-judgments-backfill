**Introduction** 

1       The plaintiff, Mr Tan Ec k Hong (“TEH”), and the defendant, Max Universal Development Group Private Limited (“MDG”), are shareholders of Treasure Resort Pte Ltd (“TR”) and their dispute c onc erns TR shares allegedly held by MDG on TEH’s behalf. 

2       TEH filed two suits against MDG. In the present suit, he sought spec ific performanc e of a shareholders’ agreement dated 11 May 2007 (“the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement”) that he c onc luded with MDG. Under this agreement, whic h was signed on MDG’s behalf by its then managing direc tor and c hief exec utive offic er, Mr Seeto Keong (“Seeto”), TEH was entitled to 13% of the shares in TR. On the day this agreement was c onc luded, Seeto exec uted a share transfer form for 581,000 TR shares in TEH’s favour. However, the 581,000 shares were not transferred to TEH as MDG’s position on TEH’s entitlement to TR’s shares c hanged after Seeto sold his interest in MDG to Rosc ent Group Ltd (“Rosc ent”), a c ompany c ontrolled by Mr Rodney Tan Boon Kian (“Rodney”). The new shareholder of MDG refused to rec ognise the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement as well as a number of earlier agreements c onc luded by MDG and TEH. 

3       TEH’s sec ond suit, namely Suit No 581 of 2007, c onc erns oppression of the minority under s 216 of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). This sec ond suit has not been heard. 

**Background** 

4       The dispute between TEH and MDG may be trac ed to the problems fac ed by another c ompany, Sijori Resort (Sentosa) Pte Ltd (“Sijori”), whic h leased a property (“the lease”) in Sentosa from Sentosa Development Corporation (“SDC”) and operated a hotel (“the hotel”) on the said property. 


5       By 2004, Sijori was in dire straits as it owed $12m to the Bank of China (“BOC”). Furthermore, in November 2005, SDC instituted legal proc eedings against Sijori to rec over more than $1m. There was a real risk that the lease would be forfeited by SDC. Sijori’s managing direc tor, Mr Lim Chong Poon, wanted an investor to take over the lease. In Marc h 2005, he had disc ussions with Seeto, who wanted to inc orporate a new c ompany, TR, with MDG as the majority shareholder, to take over the lease and the hotel with SDC’s c onsent. 

6       On 28 June 2005, TR was inc orporated and Seeto bec ame its c hairman and one of its two direc tors. The other direc tor was Mr Chiang Sing Jeong (“Chiang”), who operated a tourist attrac tion, Butterfly Park, near Sijori’s hotel in Sentosa. 

7       Before Sijori c ould transfer the lease and the hotel to TR, its massive debts to SDC, the BOC and other c reditors had to be settled. Seeto had grandiose plans but neither MDG nor TR had suffic ient funds to take over the lease and the hotel. As suc h, Seeto had to look for investors who were prepared to injec t money into TR. 

**_TEH is persuaded by Seeto to invest in TR_** 

8       TEH, who was then 28 years old, was persuaded by Seeto to invest in TR. On 19 September 2005, TEH and TR signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (“MOU”), whic h rec orded TEH’s intention to purc hase from Seeto “the shares of TR in the proportion of 8% (eight perc entile) at a pric e of $720,000 based on an estimated valuation of the lease of the property ... [at] $9,000,000”. It also provided for TR to pay TEH a yield of 8.5% per annum based on the sum of $720,000 and for the latter to have one seat on TR’s Board of Direc tors. 

9       At the material time, only 820,000 TR shares had been issued. On 27 Oc tober 2005, MDG transferred to TEH 8% of these shares, whic h amounted to 65,600 shares. However, there was more to this than meets the eye. Clause 6.1 of the MOU provided that TEH’s investment of $720,000 would be used for the “sole purpose of paying the purc hase pric e of the leasehold interest in the Sijori resort and for renovation, refurbishment and other operational expenses inc urred in respec t of the said resort” and on 29 September 2005, Seeto and TR’s CEO, Mr Gary Koh, wrote to assure TEH that his investment of $720,000 in TR “shall be duly used in ac c ordanc e [with] the [MOU] dated 19 September 2005”. Despite this, Seeto utilised TEH’s $720,000 to have TR issue 720,000 new shares to MDG. This meant that for the same $720,000 that TEH paid to TR, he rec eived 65,600 shares from Seeto while MDG obtained 720,000 TR shares. TEH alleged that this was a dec eption perpetrated on him by Seeto and MDG. 

**_TEH lends MDG $160,_** 

10     In early Dec ember 2005, MDG was so short of funds that Seeto had to ask TEH to lend $160,000 to MDG for just three weeks. TEH said that Seeto offered him 2% of TR’s shares in return for the said loan, whic h was to be repaid by 24 Dec ember 2005. Seeto handed over to TEH a handwritten note dated 7 Dec ember 2005 (“the Letter Agreement”), whic h stated as follows: 

 We hereby ac knowledge the rec eipt of SGD160,000 from Mr EH Tan on a loan basis whic h is to be returned by 24 Dec 2005. 

 As a gesture of goodwill, MDG will provide an additional 2 per c ent (2%) to his existing shareholding of 8 per c ent (8%) in Treasure Resort Pte Ltd. The share transfer shall be exerc ised after ... 7 Dec ember 2005. 


**_The FirstShareholders’ Agreement on 8 August 2006_** 

11     On 8 August 2006, Seeto, TEH and Chiang entered into a shareholders’ agreement (“the First Shareholders’ Agreement”). Although the MOU had rec orded that TEH intended to purc hase 8% of TR’s shares and Seeto had agreed that MDG would hand over 2% of TR’s shares in the Letter Agreement, the First Shareholders’ Agreement stated rather c uriously that TEH had only 1% of the shares of TR. 

12     Signific antly, the First Shareholders’ Agreement gave TEH a right to veto dec isions on a number of matters. Clause 5.3 of this agreement provided that the unanimous c onsent of all the shareholders was required for, among other things, an amendment to the Memorandum of Assoc iation or the Artic les of Assoc iation, any c hange in the shareholders of the Company or the appointment or removal of direc tors and on any matter referred by the direc tors to be approved by the shareholders. Clause 6 of the First Shareholders’ Agreement also gave TEH a veto on dec isions of the Board of Direc tors on a number of management matters, inc luding the payment of c ompensation for loss of offic e. 

**_The Call Option Agreement on 31 October 2006_** 

13     Although MDG promised to repay the loan of $160,000 by 24 Dec ember 2005, it did not do so and the loan remained unpaid more than 10 months later. TEH c laimed that when he threatened to sue MDG to rec over the loan, Seeto offered to transfer another 6% of TR’s shares to him in return for more time to repay the loan. This agreement was embodied in a “Call Option Agreement” dated 31 Oc tober 2006, whic h was signed by Seeto on MDG’s behalf. Under this agreement, TEH paid one c ent for an option to purc hase 6% of the shares in TR from MDG for another one c ent. 

**_The Supplemental Agreement to the First Shareholders’ Agreement_** 

14     On 5 Dec ember 2006, Seeto, Chiang and TEH entered into a Supplemental Agreement to the First Shareholders’ Agreement (“the Supplemental Agreement”). While the First Shareholders’ Agreement ac knowledged that TEH had 1% of TR’s shares, the Supplemental Agreement ac knowledged that TEH was entitled to 16% of TR’s shares on the basis of the MOU (8%), the Letter Agreement (2%) and the Call Option Agreement (6%). In the rest of this judgment, unless otherwise stated, the term “First Shareholders’ Agreement” will inc lude the Supplemental Agreement. There was some debate as to whether the First Shareholders’ Agreement gave TEH 16% or 17% of TR’s shares. During the trial, TEH agreed that the figure should be 17% but the differenc e is of no signific anc e as TEH’s c ase in these proc eedings was that he had agreed in the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement to reduc e his shares to 13% from whatever perc entage he was entitled to under the First Shareholders’ Agreement. 

**_TR acquires the lease_** 

15     On 14 November 2006, just before the Supplemental Agreement was exec uted, TR finally ac quired the lease and the hotel with the c onsent of Sijori and SDC. TR also entered into an agreement with SDC to lease a property adjoining the Sijori resort. It undertook to renovate the hotel and extend it with a new wing on the adjoining land (“the projec t”). 

**_TR’s financial woes and the entry of Rodney Tan_** 

16     After ac quiring the lease and the hotel, TR did not have funds to renovate the existing hotel or c ommenc e c onstruc tion work on the projec t. By May 2007, both TR and the projec t were on the 


verge of c ollapse. In view of this, Seeto needed investors to injec t funds into TR. 

17     Seeto invited Rodney to invest in TR. Rodney made it c lear that he would do so only if he had majority c ontrol of MDG and TR. Seeto offered to sell more than 50% of MDG’s shares to Rodney so as to give the latter majority c ontrol of both MDG and TR. 

18     Rodney instruc ted his solic itors, Stamford Law Corporation (“Stamford Law”), to c hec k whether MDG was indeed the legal owner of all the TR shares registered in its name. Stamford Law advised Rodney that the following two doc uments appeared to affec t MDG’s legal ownership of TR shares: 

 (i) the First Shareholders’ Agreement dated 8 August 2006 signed by TEH, Chiang and MDG; and 

 (ii) a Dec laration of Trust dated 10 August 2006 (“the Dec laration of Trust”) exec uted by MDG in favour of Chiang. TEH was neither a party to nor a benefic iary of this Dec laration of Trust. 

19     Rodney instruc ted Stamford Law to arrange for the termination of both the First Shareholders’ Agreement and the Dec laration of Trust. Seeto also made arrangements to terminate the MOU, the Letter Agreement and the Call Option Agreement. With respec t to the termination of the agreements that c onc erned him, TEH was represented by Ms Pebble Sia of Esquire Law Corporation, who liaised with MDG’s solic itor, Mr Allister Lim. 

**_Termination of the First Shareholders’ Agreement and execution of the Second Shareholders’ Agreement_** 

20     On 11 May 2007, MDG’s solic itor, Mr Allister Lim, had a meeting with Seeto, Chiang and TEH in a private room in a karaoke lounge. He brought along with him the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement as well as a number of deeds to terminate the First Shareholders’ Agreement, the other Historic al Doc uments and the MOU. He explained the c ontents of these doc uments to Seeto, Chiang and TEH, after whic h the doc uments were signed. _Notably, Rodney was present in the room when Mr Allister Lim explained the contents of these documents and when the said documents were signed by Seeto, Chiang and TEH._ Rodney c laimed that he did not pay attention to what Mr Allister Lim, Seeto, TEH and Chiang had said before they signed the doc uments. 

21     TEH explained that the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement was intended to regulate the position between him and MDG following the termination of the First Shareholders’ Agreement. Under the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement, TEH renounc ed his veto rights under c lauses 5.3 and 6 of the First Shareholders’ Agreement and agreed to reduc e his shareholding in TR to 13%, subjec t to a nondilution c lause requiring MDG to maintain his 13% shareholding in TR up to the point when TR’s issued c apital reac hed $6.2m. 

22     When the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement was signed by Seeto and TEH, TR had issued 4,820,001 shares with a par value of $1 eac h. If TEH was entitled to 13% of TR shares, he should have had 626,600 shares registered in his name. Notably, the deed of termination and release in relation to the MOU signed by TEH provided in its rec ital that MDG, the majority shareholder of TR, “has agreed to transfer 626,000 of its shares in TR to TEH”. As mentioned, if the 65,600 TR shares already registered in TEH’s name are taken into ac c ount, this meant that MDG had to transfer 561,000 shares to TEH. _Significantly, a share transfer form for 561,000 TR shares was executed by Seeto at the same time the Second Shareholders’ Agreement was signed on 11 May 2007. MDG’s corporate seal was affixed onto the share transfer form, which was witnessed by Mr Allister Lim._ Despite this, MDG’s new majority shareholder, Rosc ent, refused to honour Seeto’s promise and 


c ontended that TEH was not entitled to the 561,000 TR shares. 

23     After the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement was exec uted, TR’s issued share c apital was inc reased and it presently exc eeds $13m. Under the non-dilution c lause in the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement, TEH’s 13% of TR’s shares, c apped at $6.2m of issued c apital, amounted to 806,000 TR shares. As he had been allotted 65,600 TR shares in late 2005, TEH c ontended that MDG had to transfer 740,400 TR shares to him so that he would have a total of 806,000 TR shares. 

**Whether the Second Shareholders’ Agreement is enforceable** 

24     TEH’s c laim against MDG rests primarily on the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement. His c ounsel, Mr Alvin Tan, stated that TEH will rely on the Letter Agreement, the Call Option Agreement and the First Shareholders’ Agreement (“the Historic al Doc uments”) to prove his c laim against MDG only if the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement is found to be unenforc eable for any of the reasons advanc ed by MDG. 

25     In c ontrast, MDG asserted that the earlier agreements, namely the MOU and the Historic al Doc uments should be c onsidered first. MDG’s strategy was to prove that the First Shareholders’ Agreement was unenforc eable on the ground that it rested on allegedly unenforc eable agreements, namely the non-binding MOU, whic h was entered between TEH and TR, the Letter Agreement and the Call Option Agreement. 

26     A large part of TEH’s c ross-examination foc ussed on the alleged unenforc eability of the MOU and the Historic al Doc uments. However, as TEH advanc ed his c ase on the basis that the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement is valid, attention will be foc ussed on whether or not this agreement is valid. 

27     TEH’s c ase was that he agreed to give up his rights to the 16% or 17% of TR shares promised to him under the First Shareholders’ Agreement and the other Historic al Doc uments only bec ause he had agreed with Seeto that their rights would from henc eforth be governed by the terms of the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement. Notably, Rec itals C and D of the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement provided as follows: 

 (C) The shareholders of [TR] intend to terminate the [First Shareholders’ Agreement] with effec t from 11 May 2007. 

 (D) Contemporaneously with the termination of the [First Shareholders’ Agreement], the parties wish to enter into this Agreement to regulate their respec tive rights and obligations to eac h other in relation to their respec tive shareholding in the Company on the terms and subjec t to the c onditions set out in this Agreement. 

28     MDG c ontended that TEH c ould not rely on the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement for the following reasons: 

 (i) Seeto had no authority to c onc lude this agreement; 

 (ii) Seeto breac hed his fiduc iary duties to MDG by entering into the said agreement and TEH was aware of this; and 

 (iii) TEH did not furnish any c onsideration for the said agreement. 

**_Whether Seeto had authority to conclude the Second Shareholders’ Agreement_** 


29     MDG asserted that Seeto had no authority to c onc lude the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement bec ause there was no board resolution authorising him to do so. 

30     By virtue of the rule in _Royal British Bank v Turquand_ (1856) 6 El & Bl 327 (“the rule in _Turquand’s case_ ”), an outsider, suc h as TEH, may, without more, assume that indoor management rules have been observed by the party properly representing a c ompany. In that c ase, a c ompany asserted that it was not obliged to repay a loan to a bank on the ground that its board of direc tors did not have the power to borrow without the prior authorisation of the general meeting. It was held that while the bank was required to inspec t the c ompany’s c onstitution, it c ould assume that the general meeting had taken plac e. 

31     The rule in _Turquand’s case_ has been applied by our c ourts on innumerable oc c asions (see, for instanc e, the dec ision of the Court of Appeal in _Abdul Jalil bin Ahmad bin Talib and others v A Formation Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 592</span>). TEH was thus entitled to assume that Seeto had c omplied with MDG’s internal rules before the latter signed the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement on MDG’s behalf. 

32     Even if, as MDG alleged, Seeto had no ac tual authority to enter into the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement on behalf of MDG, he had apparent authority to do so. He was MDG’s managing direc tor and c hief exec utive offic er at all material times. Moreover, MDG was legally advised on the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement and its solic itor, Mr Allister Lim, had liaised with TEH’s solic itor, Ms Pebble Sia, on TEH’s requirements for the termination of the Historic al Doc uments and the MOU. It was Mr Allister Lim who brought all the relevant doc uments, inc luding the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement, to the meeting on 11 May 2007 for Seeto and TEH to sign. Following the signing of the said doc uments, Ms Pebble Sia wrote to Mr Allister Lim on 17 May 2007 as follows: 

 Thanks for your signed doc uments. Could I also trouble you to c onfirm: 

 1 My c lient’s appointment as direc tor of Treasure Resort Pte Ltd with effec t from 11 May 2007... 

 2 That the shares in question have been transferred to my client with effect from 11 May 2007 and c onsequently provide me with (i) the original share c ertific ate evidenc ing my c lient’s holdings of the new shares together with the c anc elled share c ertific ate of MDG ... 

 [emphasis added] 

33     In these c irc umstanc es, TEH had every reason to believe that all was in order. I thus find that it was not proven that Seeto had no authority to sign the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement. Furt hermore, at the very least, he had apparent authority to sign the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement on MDG’s behalf. 

**_Whether Seeto breached his fiduciary duties by signing the Second Shareholders’ Agreement_** 

34     A direc tor owes fiduc iary duties to his c ompany and must ac t in the c ompany’s best interests. In _Intraco Ltd v Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1064</span>, the Court of Appeal held **(** at [29]) that whether a direc tor has breac hed his fiduc iary duties to his c ompany depends on whether “an honest and intelligent man in the position of the direc tors, taking an objec tive view, c ould reasonably have c onc luded that the transac tions were in the interests of the [c ompany]”. 

35     It is for MDG to prove its assertion that the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement was c onc luded by 


Seeto in breac h of his fiduc iary duties to it and that TEH was aware of Seeto’s breac h or was put on inquiry. In regard to c onstruc tive knowledge of a direc tor’s breac h of fiduc iary duties, in _Cheong Kim Hock v Lin Securities (Pte) (in liquidation)_ <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR(R) 497</span>, the Court of Appeal explained (at [28]) that where a person who knows of c irc umstanc es suffic ient to put him on inquiry as to whether a breac h of trust or fiduc iary duty has oc c urred shuts his eyes to the obvious or fails to make suc h inquiries as an honest and reasonable man would make, the law fixes him with a c onstruc tive notic e of suc h breac h, and he is ac c ountable to the benefic iary for benefits obtained by him as a result of the breac h. 

36     There was no evidenc e that MDG had written to or taken any ac tion against Seeto regarding his alleged breac h of fiduc iary duties. Undoubtedly, Seeto should have been c alled to testify on why h e c onc luded the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement and his earlier agreements with TEH. Although Seeto was listed as MDG’s witness, MDG dec ided not to c all him to testify and invited the c ourt to hold that he had breac hed his fiduc iary duties on the basis that the terms of the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement and the Historic al Doc uments were not in its c ommerc ial interest. 

37     Considering the c omplexity of Seeto’s mac hinations on behalf of MDG and TR, it was regrettable that MDG c hose not to c all him as a witness, and espec ially so sinc e he had testified on MDG’s behalf in other c ases in the High Court on his agreements with other parties before Rodney c ame onto the sc ene. Not surprisingly, TEH rightly c ontended that an adverse inferenc e should be drawn against MDG for not c alling Seeto to testify in the present proc eedings and that it may be assumed that Seeto’s evidenc e, had it been given, would not have advanc ed MDG’s c ase on the alleged breac h of fiduc iary duties. On the other hand, MDG assumed inc orrec tly that it had established a _prima facie_ c ase that Seeto had breac hed his fiduc iary duties to it and invited the c ourt to draw an adverse inferenc e against TEH for not c alling Seeto as a witness to disprove the alleged _prima facie_ c ase. This c annot be c ountenanc ed. 

38     MDG c laimed that Seeto did not ac t in its interest by ac knowledging in the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement that TEH was entitled to 13% of TR’s shares bec ause he knew that Rodney would only invest in MDG and TR if MDG had full ownership of all the TR shares registered in its name and if all MDG’s past agreements with TEH and Chiang affec ting its rights were terminated. MDG’s position was put as follows (at para 354 of its c losing submissions): 

 [S]eeto c learly ac ted in breac h of his fiduc iary duties to MDG by going against the c onditions for investment of [Rodney] when it was in MDG’s c ommerc ial interests to sec ure [the latter’s] involvement in MDG. That it was a breac h of fiduc iary duty is indisputable. Seeto’s conduct exposed MDG to the risk that if [Rodney] found out what had happened, he could have refused to invest resulting in a total collapse of TR and consequently the value of MDG’s assets. 

 [emphasis added] 

39     The simple answer to MDG’s assertion is that the desire to have Rodney c ome on board did not entitle the c ompany to ignore the rights of other parties to whom it had already made c ommitments. Indeed, Seeto would _not_ have ac ted in MDG’s interests if he had disregarded these earlier c ommitments to other parties, inc luding TEH, as this might have exposed the c ompany to suits against it by the other parties. 

40     It c annot be overlooked that both MDG and TEH had the benefit of legal advic e in relation to the drafting and signing of the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement. By c ontending that Seeto breac hed his fiduc iary duties to MDG when he signed the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement, Rodney was in fac t suggesting that TEH, who had invested $720,000 in TR and had lent MDG $160,000, was prepared to 


terminate the First Shareholders’ Agreement, whic h gave him veto rights as well as 16% or 17% of T R’s shares, without any fresh agreement on his shareholding in TR. If this was true, TEH would be left with only the 65,600 TR shares allotted to him in late 2005, or 1.56% of TR’s shares. This is a totally unrealistic sc enario. 

41     It is far more likely than not that TEH had negotiated with Seeto before agreeing to give up his rights under the First Shareholders’ Agreement. That was why his solic itor, Ms Pebble Sia, represented him in the matter and liaised with MDG’s solic itor, Mr Allister Lim. TEH referred to an oral agreement (“the Oral Agreement”) with Seeto, under whic h his shareholding in TR would be reduc ed to 13%, subjec t to a non-dilution c lause requiring MDG to ensure that he remained a 13% shareholder of TR up to a c ap of $6.2m of issued c apital. MDG c laimed that the Oral Agreement was not proven and that the “entire agreement” c lause in the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement prec luded any attempt to rely on oral terms. However, TEH did not rely on the Oral Agreement to vary or c ontradic t the terms of the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement, on whic h he relied. His point was that the Oral Agreement was evidenc ed by the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement and that it plac ed all the doc uments signed on 11 May 2007 in the proper c ontext. In view of this, attention ought to be foc used on the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement rather than on whether or not there had been an Oral Agreement. 

42     I believe TEH’s assertion that Rodney was fully aware of the new arrangements following the termination of the First Shareholders’ Agreement. If Seeto had intended to “do a deal” with TEH behind Rodney’s bac k by signing the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement, it is inexplic able that this agreement and all the other deeds terminating the Historic al Doc uments and the MOU _were signed in Rodney’s presence_ on 11 May 2007_._ Admittedly, Rodney c laimed that he did not pay attention to what had been disc ussed about the deeds and the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement but if Seeto had wanted to do something surreptitious, he would not have done it when Rodney _could_ have heard what was being disc ussed about, _inter alia_ , the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement. 

43     The evidenc e was that after the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement was signed, Rodney c onduc ted MDG’s affairs on the basis that TEH had 13% of TR’s shares. Some three weeks after the said agreement was signed, Rodney, TEH, Chiang and Seeto met on 30 May 2007 to disc uss a further adjustment of their shareholdings in TR. The agreement between the parties on that day was that TEH was to transfer 1% of TR’s shares to Chiang. If, as MDG alleged, the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement is invalid and TEH’s shareholding of TR shares had been reduc ed to 65,600 shares or a mere 1.56% after the First Shareholders’ Agreement was terminated on 11 May 2007, it was most unlikely that TEH would have agreed to give up another 1% of TR’s shares to Chiang three weeks later as this would have reduc ed his shareholding of TR shares by two-thirds to a meagre 0.56%. 

44     In c ontrast, if, as TEH c ontended, the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement rec ognising his 13% of TR’s shares is valid, he would be left with 12% of TR’s shares after agreeing to give up 1% to Chiang. Interestingly, within two weeks after the 30 May 2007 agreement on realloc ation of shares in TR, Rodney referred to TEH’s 12% shareholding in an email on 11 June 2007, to, _inter alia_ , TEH’s solic itor, Ms Pebble Sia, Seeto and TR’s Gary Koh. Part of this email, whic h was sent to Ms Pebble Sia after she had been instruc ted to draft a letter to SDC on TR’s intended shareholding struc ture, stated as follows: 

 As per last meeting , the plan shareholders struc ture of TR will c hange a lot a slight adjustment among existing shareholders. Please inform no new shareholders expec ted: the structure will be MDG 86%, [TEH] 12%, Chiang 2%.... 

 [emphasis added] 


45     Although it was quite obvious that Rodney had ac ted as if TEH’s shareholding in TR was indeed 12%, he c laimed that the referenc e to TEH’s 12% in his email on 11 June 2007 c onc erned _plans to increase_ TEH’s shareholding in TR to 12% in the future. There was no evidenc e that plans to inc rease TEH’s shareholding in TR had been disc ussed at the “last meeting” referred to in the said email. Furthermore, Rodney would not have instruc ted Ms Pebble Sia to inform SDC that TEH’s shareholding will be 12% if this was based solely on TEH’s intention to purc hase TR’s shares from MDG at some time in the future. Apart from the fac t that Rodney’s explanation was not c redible, he subsequently sent the following rather telling text message to TEH on 2 August 2007: 

 Ec k Hong, Not this time. You should not appear now. Tomorrow is more on [SDC] like to find out who ac tually take the lead of [MDG] and all progress of renovation. At mean time, I do not want them to question your stake in [TR] to see we have so many changes cause they are sensitive of us always never ask their consent. We like them to forgive those previous breac hes and make sure all future include our transfer to you the shares we will ask for c onsent from them proper proc edure. 

 Dont worry as soon as we finished this meeting and the first loan is st art ed I will start the procedure to ask for [c onsent to] appoint you as direc tor and transfer share to you from Egm of Mdg and treasure resort. Thanks. 

 [emphasis added] 

46     When Rodney was c ross-examined on why he told TEH that he would _start the procedure to transfer shares_ “after this meeting and the first loan is starting”, he testified as follows: 

 Okay, when you talk about the transfer of shares, [TEH] starting c hasing me for the shares bec ause he c laimed that there was an agreement with MDG for the transfer of shares. I wanted to see proof but he c ould not produc e any. As this was a very sensitive issue, I told him, ‘give me some time, let me finish off with the major things first’. 

 Actually what I meant at that time was that if he could show me proof, I will transfer the shares but we must do it through the proper procedure. 

 [emphasis added] 

47     If, as alleged by Rodney, TEH was only entitled to 65,600 TR shares after the First Shareholders’ Agreement was terminated on 11 May 2007, he would not have had to “start the proc edure” to transfer TR shares to the latter bec ause the 65,600 TR shares had already been registered in TEH’s name. In any c ase, Rodney’s testimony that he wanted TEH to prove his c laim to TR shares c ontradic ted his explanation of his email of 11 June 2007, whic h was that his referenc e to TEH’s 12% of TR’s shares in that email c onc erned the latter’s intention to _purchase_ the said 12% _in the future_. TEH was either intending to purc hase 12% of TR’s shares from MDG, as alleged by Rodney in his testimony on his email of 11 June 2007, or c laiming that MDG held TR shares on his behalf, as alleged by Rodney in his testimony on his text message on 2 August 2007 to TEH. 

48     In my view, Rodney’s offer on 2 August 2007 to start the proc edure to transfer shares to TEH showed that he knew about the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement and ac knowledged TEH’s rights under it. 

49     For reasons that are unc lear, the share restruc turing agreement on 30 May 2007 was not implemented. TEH assumed that he was still entitled to 13% of TR’s shares. On 11 September 2007, 


he emailed Rodney about his entitlement as follows: 

 Under the agreement that MDG signed with me on 11 May, MDG needs to transfer TR shares to me to maintain my 13% up to $6,200,000 paid-up c apital. Based on my c urrent shareholding of 62,500, MDG needs to transfer another 743,000 TR shares to me..... 

 Also, I understand that my direc torship appointment needs SDC approval. Can you let me know when you expec t to get their approval. 

50     Rodney’s reply to TEH’s c laim for 13% of TR’s shares on 12 September 2007 c onsisted of only two words, namely, “As disc ussed”. A hint on what had been disc ussed appeared in TEH’s email to Rodney on the same day, whic h was as follows: 

 You mean as disc ussed as in I c an look at the unaudited ac c ounts but not get a c opy? Can you let Sebastian know then? 

 Also assuming that the c apitalisation of the loans is valid, c an I proc eed with buying the shares at the $1.00 c apitalisation pric e and set off the loan of $160,000 owing by MDG to me? 

 For the direc torship appointment, I understand that we are waiting for SDC’s approval for our Maybank loan, then we will seek approval for the appointment, Can I c onfirm that SDC will most likely approve the Maybank loan within these two weeks. 

51     It was rather telling that TEH did not refer to his c laim for 13% of TR’s shares in his reply to Rodney’s email on 12 September 2007. If Rodney had rejec ted his c laim to the said 13% during their disc ussions, TEH would surely have reiterated his c laim in his said reply. I thus find that Rodney did not c hallenge TEH’s c laim to 13% of TR’s shares during his disc ussions with the latter before he sent his email c ontaining the two words “As disc ussed” on 12 September 2007. 

52     Admittedly, TEH was battered during c ross-examination and he oc c asionally c ould not justify all that he said. However, I ac c ept that the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement was intended by MDG and TEH to regulate their rights following the termination of the First Shareholders’ Agreement and that Rodney was fully aware of the terms of the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement. I thus hold that MDG did not prove that Seeto breac hed his fiduc iary duties to the c ompany by signing the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement. 

**_Whether TEH furnished consideration for the Second Shareholders’ Agreement_** 

53     Consideration for a fresh promise c an take the form of a renunc iation of or a c ompromise on legal rights or c ommerc ial expec tations that may not be legally binding. 

54     TEH asserted that an inquiry into the enforc eability of the Historic al Doc uments is unnec essary bec ause even if they are unenforc eable, they gave rise to c ommerc ial expec tations on his part that the promises made therein by MDG will be kept. TEH rightly c ontended that a renunc iation of some of his c ommerc ial expec tations under the Historic al Doc uments may be regarded as the c onsideration offered by him for the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement that he sought to enforc e in the present proc eedings. In _Ong Chay Tong & Sons (Pte) Ltd v Ong Hoo Eng_ <span class="citation">[2009] 1 SLR(R) 305</span>, the Court of Appeal approved [at [30]) of the following passage from _Chitty on Contracts_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 29th Ed, 2004) at para 3-008A: 

 A person who makes a c ommerc ial promise expec ts to have to perform it (and is in fac t under 


 c onsiderable pressure to do so). Correspondingly, one who rec eives suc h a promise expec ts it to be kept. These expectations, which can exist even where the promise is not legally enforceable, are based on commercial morality, and can properly be called a detriment and a benefit; hence they satisfy the requirement of consideration in the case of mutual promises. 

 [emphasis added] 

55     It c annot be seriously doubted that TEH had a c ommerc ial expec tation that the TR shares promised to him by MDG under the Historic al Doc uments will be transferred to him. After all, on 11 May 2007, Seeto exec uted a share transfer form in TEH’s favour for 561,000 TR shares. I thus find that at the very least, TEH is entitled to say that he furnished c onsideration for the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement by renounc ing some of his c ommerc ial expec tations under the First Shareholders’ Agreement. 

56     TEH also submitted that apart from renounc ing some of his c ommerc ial expec tations, he furnished c onsideration for the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement by giving up important _legal_ rights ac c orded to him under the First Shareholders’ Agreement. He referred to his renunc iation of his veto rights and the reduc tion of his entitlement to TR’s shares from 17% or 16% to 13%. 

57     TEH testified that it appeared from his disc ussions with Rodney before the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement was signed that the latter had wanted a free hand to run TR. He added that while Rodney did not want him to have veto rights over important dec isions regarding TR’s affairs, the latter was not adverse to a new arrangement on his shareholding. I ac c ept that TEH furnished c onsideration for the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement by renounc ing his veto rights under the First Shareholders’ Agreement. 

58     TEH also c ontended that apart from veto rights, he had other legal rights under the Historic al Doc uments to renounc e. This was c ertainly true in the c ase of the Letter Agreement, under whic h Seeto agreed to give him 2% of TR’s shares in return for an interest-free loan of $160,000 for 17 days in Dec ember 2005. MDG asserted that the Letter Agreement was unenforc eable as it was made without any intention to c reate legal relations and Seeto had stated that the 2% of TR’s shares were given to TEH as “a gesture of goodwill”. TEH insisted that whatever Seeto may have written, he had agreed to lend MDG $160,000 in exc hange for 2% of TR’s shares. He testified that if Seeto had not offered him the 2%, he would not have lent MDG the $160,000. 

59     What MDG was suggesting to the c ourt was that TEH had agreed to lend MDG $160,000 for nothing in return. This is a most unrealistic reading of the situation. While parting with 2% of TR shares for a loan of $160,000 for 17 days may appear to be rather generous, the c ourt is, without more, not c onc erned with the adequac y of TEH’s c onsideration. Even so, it must be borne in mind that TR’s shares were then not worth as muc h as they are today. Furthermore, the financ ial position of TR was rather bleak in Dec ember 2005 as it required several million dollars to ac quire the lease and its major shareholder, MDG, was so short of funds that it needed a loan of $160,000 from TEH. In any c ase, this was not the only time Seeto had given away TR shares in exc hange for a very short term loan. In _Maxz Universal Development Group Pte Ltd v Shen Yixuan and Another Suit_ <span class="citation">[2009] SGHC 164</span>, Seeto offered a Mr Shen Yixuan 6% of TR’s shares, totalling 289,200 shares, for $1 in return for giving MDG an interest-free bridging loan of $500,000 for _only 1 2 days_ , from 8 November 2006 to 20 November 2006. Lee Seiu Kin J, who held that this agreement was binding, pointed out that Seeto was so desperately short of money at the material time that he would trade a kingdom for a horse. While that dec ision does not prove any of the issues in the present c ase, it showed that Seeto had parted with 6% of TR’s shares in exc hange for a loan for only 12 days. 


60     As for MDG’s assertion that Seeto had no intention to c reate legal relations when he promised TEH 2% of TR’s shares for the loan, in _Edwards v Skyways Ltd_ [1964] 1 WLR 349 (at 355), where an “ _ex gratia_ ” payment promised to redundant pilots of an airline c ompany was held to be enforc eable, Megaw J aptly pointed out that where business relations are c onc erned, “the onus is on the party who asserts that no legal effec t was intended, and the onus is a heavy one”. In the present c ase, MDG c ertainly did not prove its assertion. 

61     I thus find that TEH had legal rights under the Letter Agreement and by giving up those rights, whic h were rec ognised under the First Shareholders’ Agreement, he furnished c onsideration for the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement. 

62     TEH also pointed out that under the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement, he gave up his legal right to 8% of TR’s shares, whic h was rec ognised in the First Shareholders’ Agreement as having emanated from the MOU. It may be rec alled that the non-binding MOU between TEH and TR rec orded that he was to pay $720,000 for 8% of TR’s shares and he rec eived 65,600 shares in exc hange for his money. However, although the MOU stated that TEH’s $720,000 was to be used for solely for purc hasing the lease, renovating the hotel and other operational expenses, Seeto utilised TEH’s $720,000 to have 720,000 TR shares issued to MDG. MDG c ontended that as TEH had already rec eived 65,600 shares for his $720,000, he c ould not rely on past c onsideration to support his c laim for 8% of TR’s shares under the First Shareholders’ Agreement. TEH retorted that the question of past c onsideration did not arise bec ause the 8% promised to him under the First Shareholders’ Agreement was intended to address the wrongful utilisation by MDG of his investment of $720,000 to issue 720,000 TR shares to itself. MDG c hose not to c all Seeto to c ontradic t TEH and there was no c redible evidenc e to c ounter TEH’s version of events. I thus rejec t the argument that TEH had no legal rights to renounc e in relation to the said 8% of TR shares. 

63     As for MDG’s c ontention that the allegation of Seeto’s dec eption was not pleaded, the gist of the wrong done by Seeto when he used TEH’s $720,000 to ac quire 720,000 shares for MDG was pleaded in paras 13 to 14 of the Reply and Defenc e to Counterc laim as follows: 

 13 The Plaintiff and Defendants had rec ognised that the transfer of 65,600 shares to the Plaintiff, as evidenc ed by the transfer form dated 27 Oc tober 2005 did not reflec t the intention of t he parties nor the obligations of the Defendants to transfer to the Plaintiff 8% of the share c apital of Treasure Resort. 

 14 In the premises, the Plaintiff avers that the 1 st Shareholders’ Agreement was supported by valid c onsideration insofar as the 8% of the share capital of Treasure Resort promised to the Plaintiff thereunder derived from the S$720,000.00 payment from the Plaintiff which had been utilized by the Defendants to procure the allotment of shares of Treasure Resort to themselves. 

 [emphasis added] 

64     I thus rejec t MDG’s assertion that TEH had no legal right under the First Shareholders’ Agreement to the 8% of TR’s shares rec ognised in the said agreement as having emanated from the MOU. 

65     In relation to the termination of the Call Option Agreement, whic h gave 6% of TR shares whic h TEH was entitled to purc hase for one c ent, TEH explained that Seeto had promised him the said 6% in return for more time to repay the loan of $160,000. MDG queried why the deal was not rec orded in a simple agreement instead of a Call Option Agreement, whic h did not refer to any additional time given to MDG to repay the loan. TEH explained that he obtained a template on a Call Option Agreement and 


got Seeto to sign it after it bec ame evident to him that MDG was not in a position to repay the loan at the material time. Admittedly, when c ross-examined, TEH c ould not say how muc h additional time was given to MDG to repay the loan. However, it is noteworthy that it was not established that Seeto, who held the majority of the shares in MDG at the material time, had ac ted in breac h of his fiduc iary duties to his c ompany when he signed the Call Option Agreement. MDG c ould easily have c alled Seeto to explain why he signed the Call Option Agreement but it c hose not to do so. In these c irc umstanc es, and in the light of Seeto’s mac hinations in his desperate attempt to raise funds for TR to take over the lease and the hotel, it c annot be said that on a balanc e of probabilities, TEH had no legal rights at all to renounc e in relation to 8% of TR shares rec ognised in the First Shareholders’ Agreement as emanating from the Call Option Agreement. 

66     Finally, MDG’s assertion that TEH did not believe that he had legal rights to renounc e was not proven. TEH testified that his solic itor had advised him that his agreements with Seeto were “loose” and “not tight” but this did not mean that he believed that he had no valid c laims against MDG In regard to the Letter Agreement, TEH did not c laim the 2% of TR’s shares offered under this agreement when he initiated an ac tion for the return of the $160,000 loaned to MDG but he explained that as the said 2% had been ac knowledged as due to him in the Supplemental Agreement, he saw no urgenc y in suing for the shares whereas the $160,000 owed to him c ould have been invested or used to purc hase an asset that might apprec iate in value over time and that was why he sued to rec over the loan. 

67     For the reasons stated, MDG failed to prove that TEH had furnished no c onsideration for the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement. 

**_Conclusion on the validity of the Second Shareholders’ Agreement_** 

68     In the final analysis, it should not be overlooked that TEH c laimed to be entitled under the said agreement to only 806,000 TR shares. The number of TR shares c laimed by him is thus not muc h more than the 720,000 shares that Seeto obtained for MDG by misusing the $720,000 paid by TEH in 2005, whic h, ac c ording to the MOU, was intended to be used solely for the purc hase pric e of the lease, hotel renovation and operational expenses of the resort. Furthermore, TEH had lent MDG $160,000 at a c ruc ial time for MDG and this loan has not been repaid. 

69     I found TEH to be a quite a truthful witness. Although he was battered during c rossexamination, the essenc e of his evidenc e was believable, and espec ially so in the absenc e of any testimony from Seeto. The evidenc e c learly showed that Rodney knew about the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement, whic h was willingly entered into by Seeto to replac e the First Shareholders’ Agreement. I thus hold that the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement is valid and that MDG is bound by it. 

**_TEH’s statutory declaration_** 

70     MDG also asserted that even if TEH had rights under the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement, he waived his right to the 13% of TR’s shares c laimed by him when he swore in a statutory dec laration dated 19 February 2008 (“the statutory dec laration”) that he was the legal and benefic ial owner of only 65,600 TR shares. TEH did not mention his entitlement to TR’s shares under the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement in the statutory dec laration. 

71     TEH said, and I believe him, that Rodney had informed him that SDC required the statutory dec laration and that Rodney had asked him to state therein that he only owned 65,000 TR shares. TEH added that Rodney explained to him that SDC wanted to be kept informed of c hanges in the shareholding of TR and it was then not the right time to inform SDC about the c hanges in the 


shareholding of TR. Rodney promised that at an appropriate time in the future, MDG would transfer the TR shares c laimed by TEH. Rodney thus knew that TEH did not intend to waive his right to the 13% of TR’s shares promised to him under the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement by furnishing the statutory dec laration to SDC at his request. 

72     Undoubtedly, TEH should have stated the true position on his entitlement to TR shares in the statutory dec laration but it is c ruc ial to note that he is not relying on the statutory dec laration to mount his c laim against MDG for TR’s shares. As suc h, the question of the effec t of illegality on his c laim against MDG does not arise. What is c lear is that in the c irc umstanc es of this c ase, MDG c annot, in view of Rodney’s ac tions, be allowed to take advantage of the statutory dec laration to avoid its obligations to TEH under the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement. 

**Whether specific performance should be ordered** 

73     The next question is whether TEH is entitled to spec ific performanc e of the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement. The c ourt has a disc retion on whether or not to grant the remedy of spec ific performanc e although the disc retion must be exerc ised in ac c ordanc e with fixed rules and princ iples. 

74     It ought to be noted that Artic le 6.3 of the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement provides as follows: 

 Consent to Specific Performance 

 The parties hereby agree that it might be impossible to measure in money the damages whic h would ac c rue to a party by reason of failure to perform c ertain obligations hereunder. Any suc h party shall, therefore, be entitled to seek injunc tive relief, inc luding spec ific performanc e, to enforc e suc h obligation and if any action should be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, none of the parties hereto shall raise the defence that there is an adequate remedy at law. 

 [emphasis added] 

75     Leaving aside the above-mentioned c ontrac tual provision for the moment, TEH’s c ase merits an order of spec ific performanc e. In _Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor and others and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 537</span> (“ _Lee Chee Wei_ ”), the Court of Appeal pointed out (at [55]) that “the more pertinent issue in every c ase is whether spec ific performanc e c onstitutes the just and appropriate remedy in the c irc umstanc es”. In _Tito v Waddell_ [1977] Ch 106, 126, Megarry VC opined (at 322) that spec ific performanc e is ordered where this would do “more perfec t and c omplete justic e than an award of damages”. 

76     In the c ontext of a c laim for shares in a private c ompany suc h as TR, the Court of Appeal stated in _Lee Chee Wei_ (at [54]) as follows: 

 While a c ontrac t to transfer shares in a publicly listed c ompany will generally not be spec ific ally enforc ed, a c ontrac t to transfer shares in an unlisted c ompany on the other hand c an be spec ific ally enforc ed at the suit of either purc haser or vendor (see Jones & Goodhart at pp 161162). In Pamaron Holdings Sdn Bhd v Ganda Holdings Bhd [1988] 3 MLJ 346 , it was unequivoc ally held (at [16]), that "a seller of shares not freely saleable in the open market is entitled to spec ific performanc e". Similarly, in Duncuft v Albrecht (1841) 12 Sim 189, the c ourt dec reed spec ific performanc e for the sale of shares whic h were limited in number and not always available in the 


 open market. 

 [emphasis in original] 

77     TEH explained that spec ific performanc e of the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement was nec essary as the transfer by MDG of 740,400 TR shares to him would affec t the perc entage of his equity in TR if he suc c eeds in his c laim in another suit for the c anc ellation of some of the TR shares issued to MDG after Rosc ent took over Seeto’s stake in MDG. 

78     As for fac tors whic h might possibly persuade the c ourt not to grant an order of spec ific performanc e, it c annot be said that there was delay on TEH’s part in instituting the present proc eedings. Admittedly, the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement was c onc luded in May 2007 and the present ac tion was c ommenc ed in November 2008. However, Rodney had promised TEH that he would look into his c laim for 13% of TR’s shares as well as a plac e on the Board of Direc tors of TR and TEH sued as soon as it bec ame quite c lear that MDG was not going to honour its promises. TEH has performed his side of the bargain by observing the terms of the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement and MDG would not suffer any hardship if it was ordered to fulfil the terms of a bargain willingly entered into by Seeto on its behalf. As mentioned, MDG had legal advic e when the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement was exec uted on 11 May 2007. 

79     After taking all c irc umstanc es into ac c ount, I have no doubt that subjec t to what is stated below on the appointment of TEH as a direc tor of TR, an order for spec ific performanc e of the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement would be just and appropriate. Ac c ordingly, I grant this order. As suc h, MDG is required to transfer 740,400 TR shares to TEH. 

**Appointment of TEH as a director of TR** 

80     In his c losing submissions, TEH sought spec ific performanc e of c lause 2.1 of the Sec ond Shareholders’ Agreement, whic h relates to his right to appoint a direc tor to sit on the Board of TR and to MDG’s obligation to proc ure that TEH or his nominee be appointed as a direc tor of TR. However, TEH’s c ounsel had made it c lear during the trial that he was no longer pursuing this relief _in this action_. The relevant part of the proc eedings is as follows: 

 Although the Shareholders’ Agreement does c ontain a provision entitling him to be appointed to the Board of Treasure Resort Pte Ltd, given the c onc urrent c laim in Suit 581 of 2007, where we are asking for a buyout, that remedy is not being asked of your Honour in this action. 

 [emphasis added] 

81     MDG c onduc ted its c ase on the basis of TEH’s earlier dec ision not to proc eed in the present proc eedings with his c laim for a seat on the Board of TR. As suc h, the appointment of TEH as a direc tor of TR need not be further c onsidered at this junc ture. 

**The Counterclaim** 

82     In its c ounterc laim, MDG sought a dec laration that it is not bound by the Letter Agreement and the Call Option Agreement. In view of my findings in the earlier part of this judgment, MDG’s c ounterc laim is dismissed. 

**Costs**
