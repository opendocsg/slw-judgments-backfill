**Judith Prakash J:** 

1       This c ase involves a c ompany in liquidation and some of the various transac tions that it undertook before it was wound up. The plaintiffs, who are the liquidators of the c ompany, seek to rec over what they say is the c ompany’s money from the defendants who c omprise two former direc tors and shareholders of the c ompany and other firms who did business with the c ompany. 

**The parties** 

2       The c ompany in liquidation (“the Company”) is Woon Contrac tor Pte Ltd, a c ompany that was set up in 1995 as a suc c essor to a partnership, Woon Contrac tor, whic h c arried on business in the c onstruc tion industry. Woon Contrac tor was owned and run by the first defendant, Leow Boon Cher (“Mr Leow”), and his wife, Ong Chiew Ha (“Mdm Ong”), the sec ond defendant. On the inc orporation of the Company, Mr Leow and Mdm Ong bec ame its sole direc tors and shareholders and ran it the same way in whic h they had run Woon Contrac tor. Mr Leow was the man in the field, getting business and supervising the Company’s c onstruc tion ac tivities and its workers, whilst Mdm Ong was the bac k offic e woman, in c harge of administration and ac c ounts. From time to time I shall refer to Mr Leow and Mdm Ong jointly as “the Direc tors”. 

3       On 4 Marc h 2005, Mr Leow made a Dec laration that the Company was unable to c ontinue business by reason of its liabilities. A winding up order was made against the Company on 20 May 2005 and the plaintiffs were then appointed its joint liquidators. The first plaintiff, Mr Kon Yin Tong (“Mr Kon”), was the lead witness for the plaintiffs in the present proc eedings. 

4       The third defendant, Aim Top Enterprise Pte Ltd (“Aim Top”) was inc orporated on 9 September 

2003\. Aim Top has two direc tors who are also its sole shareholders. First, there is Mdm Chiew Kim Lian (who holds 99.99% of Aim Top’s shares). She is the mother of Mdm Ong. The other direc tor and shareholder is Mr Chiow Yit Wah; he was an employee of the Company from its inc orporation until 2003 and prior to 1995 had worked for Woon Contrac tor for several years. 


5       The fourth and fifth defendants, Mr Ong Key Young (“OKY”) and Mr Ong Eng Seng (“OES”), are the partners of a partnership firm c alled Antah Forwarders (“Antah”) whic h has the same registered address as Aim Top. OKY is Mdm Ong’s father while OES is Mdm Ong’s brother. OES is also the sixth defendant in the ac tion in his c apac ity as the sole proprietor of a business known as Western Express Resourc es Agenc y (“Wera”), another business sharing an address with Antah. 

6       The seventh and last defendant is Yew San Construc tion Pte Ltd (“Yew San”). This c ompany was inc orporated in 1996 and c arries on business as a general c ontrac tor in building c onstruc tion. Its direc tors and shareholders are not related to the other defendants. 

**The dispute** 

7       The plaintiffs’ position was that during their investigation of the affairs of the Company, they disc overed that the Company, ac ting at the behest of the Direc tors, had entered into a series of fraudulent and irregular transac tions in order to siphon off the money and assets of the Company and put the same out of the reac h of its c reditors. The allegation made was that the Direc tors did this bec ause they knew that the Company was insolvent. A summary of the spec ific allegations in the Statement of Claim (Amendment no 3) follows. 

8       The plaintiffs averred that the Company was insolvent as at 30 April 2003 as it was unable as of that date to pay its debts as and when they fell due and it c ontinued to be insolvent after that date. Further, the plaintiffs averred that the liabilities of the Company exc eeded its assets as at 31 August 2003 and the Company was therefore insolvent as at that date as well. The plaintiffs pleaded that the Direc tors had masterminded a sc heme to defraud the Company’s c reditors and, in the c ourse of the sc heme, had made the Company a party to a series of irregular and fraudulent transac tions whic h had the effec t of siphoning moneys out of or removing assets from the Company. The plaintiffs sought to rec over various payments made by the Company pursuant to suc h transac tions. The partic ulars of these are: 

 (a) a number of payments totalling $537,738 from 5 May 2003 to 6 August 2004, made to Mr Leow allegedly in repayment of loans that he had made to the Company; 

 (b) a sum of $39,394.78 paid to Aim Top allegedly for rental of lorry, labour, driver servic e and rental of exc avator, suc h payments being made between 17 February 2004 and 20 June 2004; 

 (c ) a sum of $41,000 paid to Antah for transportation servic es allegedly provided by Antah; 

 (d) payments totalling $13,500 purportedly paid to Wera as a sub-c ontrac tor even though Wera was not in the building and c onstruc tion business; and 

 (e) a sum of $13,111.35 paid to Yew San allegedly for exc avation work done at a worksite in Bendemeer. 

In addition, the plaintiffs c laimed that the Direc tors had ac ted in breac h of their fiduc iary duties by c ausing the Company to sell a used exc avator to a c ompany c alled Ban Guan & Co (“Ban Guan”) at an under value. It was also asserted that they had ac ted dishonestly, _mala fides_ and against the interests of the Company and its c reditors and, in the alternative, had given fraudulent preferenc e to c reditors of the Company who were c onnec ted to them. In relation to Mdm Ong, in the statement of c laim, the plaintiffs sought to rec over a sum of $6,000 paid to her on 27 August 2003 purportedly as a subsidiary for her private vehic le that was allegedly used in the c ourse of the Company’s business. In their c losing submissions, however, the plaintiffs did not deal with this c laim and therefore I will not 


c onsider it. 

9       In their defenc e, Mr Leow and Mdm Ong averred that the Company was not insolvent either as at 30 April 2003 or 31 August 2003. They asserted that they had undertaken to provide c ontinued financ ial support to the Company to meet its obligations as and when they fell due and that, over the years, they had provided financ ial support to the Company by injec ting c apital amounting to $828, into the Company. Mr Leow and Mdm Ong also asserted that all the transac tions referred to by the plaintiffs had been c arried out in good faith and/or with the knowledge and/or belief that the Company was not insolvent. The other defendants have c laimed that the various transac tions in whic h they were involved were made in good faith and for good c onsideration and that the plaintiffs had not been able to establish fraud on the part of Mr Leow and Mdm Ong. 

10     Arising from the pleadings, there are three main areas that have to be investigated and determined. The first relates to the solvenc y of the Company as at 30 April 2003 and/or 31 August 2003 and in relation to this situation, it is also important to establish the knowledge of the Direc tors regarding the Company’s financ ial position. The sec ond area relates to the payments made by the Company to the Direc tors and whether they or either of them has to ac c ount for any or all of suc h payments. The third area c overs the various transac tions between the Company and the third to seventh defendants. In this c onnec tion, eac h transac tion and relationship has to be examined to asc ertain whether the payments made were regular or were in pursuanc e of sham transac tions and/or were fraudulent preferenc es. My determination as to whether the Direc tors ac ted dishonestly or with intent to defraud the Company and/or the general body of its c reditors will play a part in determining their liability for a number of the c laims brought. This is an issue therefore to whic h muc h attention will have to be given. I will also have to examine whether in any of the impugned dealings the Direc tors were ac ting in breac h of their fiduc iary duties. 

**The plaintiffs’ narrative** 

11     It is important at this junc ture to set out the framework of the plaintiffs’ c ase before I go on to c onsider the individual allegations and transac tions. This framework provides the plaintiffs’ perspec tive on how the transac tions should be viewed and keeping it in mind also prevents one from failing to see the wood bec ause of the abundanc e of trees. It must, however, be remembered when the following paragraphs are read that they set out the story as the plaintiffs see it and what I have to do in this judgment is to determine whether or not the plaintiffs have mustered suffic ient evidenc e to prove that the story is fac t and not fic tion. 

12     The original business of Woon Contrac tor c ommenc ed in 1985. After its c onversion into a c ompany, the business was profitable for a few years but from 1999 onwards, losses were made every financ ial year (apart only from 2001) up to 2004. 

13     In January 2003, a c onstruc tion projec t referred to as the Fernvale Projec t was novated to the Company, as main c ontrac tor. The employer was the Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) and the works to be undertaken by the Company c omprised (a) major infrastruc tural c onstruc tion works and (b) earthworks. The lump sum pric e for the projec t was about $4,678,000 of whic h $1,622,800 related to the earthworks. The Company promptly sub-c ontrac ted the entire earthworks portion to another c ontrac tor c alled Soon Li Heng Civil Engineering Pte Ltd (“Soon Li Heng”) for a sum of $1,050,000. This sub-c ontrac t was on a bac k-to-bac k basis with the main c ontrac t. 

14     It is the plaintiffs’ c ase that the Company was insolvent by 30 April 2003 and that from 5 May 2003 until 6 August 2004, a series of unexplained payments were made by the Company to Mr Leow without any supporting doc umentation to justify the payment vouc hers whic h Mdm Ong prepared. 


Further, on 5 May 2003, the Company purportedly paid Wera $2,500 for its work as a “subc ontrac tor”. Wera, however, was not in the building and c onstruc tion business and the c heque was made payable to Mdm Ong instead of to Wera. 

15     By 3 July 2003, Soon Li Heng had c ompleted the earthworks under their sub-c ontrac t for the Fernvale Projec t. Prior to that date, the Company had made three progress payments to Soon Li Heng totalling $368,000. On 4 July 2003, the Company rec eived a c laim for some $630,000 (less the retention sum) from Soon Li Heng and this demand made Soon Li Heng the Company’s biggest c reditor. The HDB subsequently c ertified that the Fernvale Projec t had been suc c essfully c ompleted. 

16     In June and July 2003, the Company sold various piec es of c onstruc tion equipment to Wera. These vehic les were purportedly leased bac k by the Company for various periods beginning from January 2004. 

17     On 28 July 2003, the Company purportedly paid Wera another $10,000 for work as a “subc ontrac tor”. This time the c heque was made payable to Mr Leow and was deposited into Mr Leow’s bank ac c ount. 

18     On 30 July 2003, Soon Li Heng’s lawyers sent the Company a letter of demand in respec t of its c laim. The Company did not respond to this demand. 

19     On 31 July 2003, Antah invoic ed the Company for $35,000 in respec t of servic es that it had supposedly performed between January 2003 and June 2003. In the view of the plaintiffs, these invoic es were not supported by any c redible doc umentation. 

20     On 20 August 2003, a sum of $1,000 was purportedly paid to Wera. This time the c heque was made out in favour of Mr Leow’s Maybank c redit c ard ac c ount. 

21     On 25 August 2003, Soon Li Heng c ommenc ed legal ac tion against the Company in High Court Suit 863 of 2003 (“Suit 863”) for the sum of $682,000 whic h it asserted was due and payable under the sub-c ontrac t. The Company responded by filing a c ounterc laim for the sum of $537,681.25. It also ac c used Soon Li Heng of not having c ompleted the earthworks on time and asserted that it had not been able to c arry out its own work on the Fernvale Projec t bec ause of the ac tions of Soon Li Heng. In February 2005, judgment was delivered in the ac tion. Soon Li Heng was suc c essful in its c laim as the Company’s defenc e was found to be without merit. The Company’s c ounterc laim was also adjudged to be without foundation and was dismissed with c osts. 

22     In the meantime, on or about 24 August 2003, HDB had paid the Company a sum of approximately $550,000 for work done on the Fernvale Projec t. As a result, the balanc e in the Company’s bank ac c ount bec ame $641,456.99. Two days later, a c heque for $200,000 drawn from the Company’s bank ac c ount was deposited into Mr Leow’s personal bank ac c ount. Mr Leow stated in c ourt that approximately $100,000 out of this money was used to trade in the stoc k market. By the end of August 2003, the amount remaining in the Company’s bank ac c ount was $83,103.90. 

23     Aim Top was inc orporated on 9 September 2003 with Mdm Ong’s 63 year old mother and Mr Chiow, as its initial direc tors. It is the plaintiffs’ belief that Aim Top is in fac t owned and c ontrolled by the Direc tors and was formed by them so that they c ould have a new umbrella under whic h to c onduc t business when the Company failed. 

24     From 1 Oc tober 2003, the Company started selling c onstruc tion equipment to Aim Top. This inc luded a 10-tonne lorry whic h was leased bac k to the Company in November 2003. The lorry was 


sold for $37,440 but the rentals paid by the Company to Aim Top eventually amounted to $27,200. The plaintiffs said that this meant that Aim Top had rec eived the lorry at a heavily disc ounted pric e and that there was no c ommerc ial justific ation for the sale and the lease bac k. 

25     In Dec ember 2003, the Company purportedly leased an SK-200 exc avator-with-breaker from Aim Top at $7,000 per month. At about the same time, it leased to Aim Top a PC200/SK200 exc avator for $5,800 per month. The plaintiffs c ontended that there was no c ommerc ial justific ation for these transac tions. 

26     On 8 April 2004, the Company sold a used exc avator for $57,750 to Ban Guan. The plaintiffs found this sale suspic ious bec ause they had disc overed evidenc e whic h indic ated that Ban Guan had itself sold the same exc avator to a third party at the pric e of $88,200 several days before purc hasing the exc avator from the Company. 

27     On 15 June 2004, the Company paid a sum of $13,111.35 to Yew San for purported exc avation work. The plaintiffs said that there was no c redible evidenc e that this work was ac tually done by Yew San for the Company. 

28     Under the judgment delivered in Suit 863 a total sum of $773,058 was found to be due from the Company to Soon Li Heng. On 22 February 2005, Soon Li Heng sent a statutory demand to the Company for the judgment sum. Just about two weeks later, on 5 Marc h 2005, Mr Leow made the dec laration of the Company’s inability to c ontinue business by reason of its liabilities. 

**The law** 

**_Insolvency_** 

29     A c ompany is insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts. Sec tion 254(2) of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”) provides the definition of a c ompany’s inability to pay debts: 

 Definition of inability to pay debts 

 (2) A c ompany shall be deemed to be unable to pay its debts if — 

 (a) a c reditor by assignment or otherwise to whom the c ompany is indebted in a sum exc eeding $10,000 then due has served on the c ompany by leaving at the registered offic e a demand under his hand or under the hand of his agent thereunto lawfully authorised requiring the c ompany to pay the sum so due, and the c ompany has for 3 weeks thereafter neglec ted to pay the sum or to sec ure or c ompound for it to the reasonable satisfac tion of the c reditor; 

 (b) exec ution or other proc ess issued on a judgment, dec ree or order of any c ourt in favour of a c reditor of the c ompany is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part; or 

 (c ) it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the company is unable to pay its debts; and in determining whether a company is unable to pay its debts the Court shall take into account the contingent and prospective liabilities of the company. 

 [emphasis added] 

30     The c urrent position the c ourts are inc lined to adopt with regards to the definition of insolvenc y is enunc iated in the c ase of _Chip Thye Enterprises Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Phay Gi Mo & Ors_ <span class="citation">[2004] 1 SLR(R) 434</span> (“ _Chip Thye”_ ). In _Chip Thye_ , the suit was c ommenc ed by the liquidator against the 


direc tors of the c ompany whic h was a family-owned c ompany engaged in the building c onstruc tion business. Belinda Ang J held that one ought not to look for a single appropriate test for insolvenc y: 

 ... it is neither helpful nor nec essary to lean in favour of one or the other test. There is no single test for insolvenc y. 

31     Sec ondly, Ang J held that the answer to determining the solvenc y of a c ompany lies in sc rutinising all relevant evidenc e available: 

 Ultimately, as the c ases dec ided by the High Court sinc e Re Great Eastern Hotel illustrate, regard is given to all of the evidenc e that appears relevant to the question of insolvenc y. 

32     Thirdly, as the c ase is not one that c onc erns the determination on whether a winding-up petition should be granted, but a determination c onc erning transac tions entered into or made before liquidation, the learned Judge held that: 

 This approac h is all the more applic able to a c ompany (like the plaintiff ) that has already been wound up under s 254(1)(e) of the Ac t and the liquidator of the c ompany seeks to attac k various transac tions entered into or made before the liquidation but at the time the c ompany was insolvent or of doubtful solvenc y. 

33     Despite the fac t that no one single test is c onc lusive as a measure of solvenc y, it is c ommonly ac c epted that the two primary indic ia of a c ompany’s inability to pay debts are the c ash flow test and the balanc e sheet test. For most purposes, it is the present inability to pay debts that is the c ruc ial fac tor. 

34     It is important to bear in mind, however, that the determination of whether a c ompany is insolvent is essentially a question of fac t. This c an be seen from _Tong Tien See Construction Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Tong Tien See & Ors_ <span class="citation">[2002] 3 SLR 76</span>, where Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) held: 

 A c ompany is insolvent or unable to pay its debts when it is unable to meet c urrent demands, irrespec tive of whether the c ompany is possessed of assets whic h, if realised, would enable it to disc harge its liabilities in full. Insolvenc y in this c ommerc ial sense is princ ipally a question of fac t whic h may be established in a number of ways. However, proof that a c reditor’s debt has not been paid per se does not establish an inability to pay debts within the meaning of s 254(2)(c ) of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 1994 Ed). A temporary lac k of liquidity does [ sic ] not tantamount to insolvenc y. 

35     Generally, the burden of proof is borne by the party making the allegation of insolvenc y. However, s 100(3) of the Bankruptc y Ac t (Cap 20, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Bankruptc y Ac t”) provides for a presumption of insolvenc y in a situation where, as between the parties to the transac tion, one is an assoc iate of the other. This presumption may c ome into play in my c onsideration of the transac tions that took plac e between the Company and the third to seventh defendants. 

36     The c ash flow test deems a c ompany insolvent when it c annot meet its obligations as and when they fall due. The balanc e-sheet test, on the other hand, would deem a c ompany insolvent when the c urrent liabilities of the c ompany exc eed its assets. 

37     With respec t to the c ash flow test, the c ourt will look at the c ompany’s financ ial position taken as a whole. The relevant fac tors whic h c an be taken into c onsideration inc lude: 


 (a) all of the c ompany’s debts as at that time in order to determine when those debts were due and payable; 

 (b) all of the assets of the c ompany as at that time in order to determine the extent to whic h those assets were liquid or were realisable within a timeframe that would allow eac h of the debts to be paid as and when it bec ame payable; 

 (c ) the c ompany’s business as at that time in order to determine its expec ted net c ash flow from the business by deduc ting from projec ted future sales the c ash expenses whic h would be nec essary to generate those sales; and 

 (d) arrangements between the c ompany and prospec tive lenders, suc h as its bankers and shareholders, in order to determine whether any shortfall in liquid and realisable assets and c ash flow c ould be made up by borrowings whic h would be repayable at a time later than the debts. 

38     It should also be noted that the c ourt adopts a c ommerc ial rather than a tec hnic al view of insolvenc y. Thus, while the phrase “is unable” might be thought to refer to the inability at the relevant time to pay debts whic h have then fallen due, its c onjunc tion with the phrase “as they fall due” indic ates a c ontinuous suc c ession of debts rather than a c alc ulation of debts existing on any partic ular day. The essential question is whether the c ompany’s financ ial position is suc h that it c an c ontinue in business and still pay its way. The c ourt therefore has to c onsider whether any liquidity problem the c ompany may have is purely temporary and c an be c ured in the reasonably near future. Further, the c ourt may also have regard to c laims falling due _in the near future_ and to the likely availability of funds to meet suc h future c laims and the c ompany’s existing debts. 

39     On the other hand, the balanc e sheet test deems a c ompany insolvent if its assets are insuffic ient to meet its liabilities, inc luding c ontingent and prospec tive liabilities. It is thus a wider test than the “c ash flow” test whic h only takes into ac c ount debts. 

40     A “c ontingent liability” would refer to a liability or other loss whic h arises out of an existing legal obligation or state of affairs, but whic h is dependent on the happening of an event that may or may not oc c ur. “Prospec tive liability” however, has been judic ially defined as “a debt whic h will c ertainly bec ome due in the future, either on some date whic h has already been determined or on some date determinable by referenc e to future events”. It thus embrac es both future debts, in the sense of liquidated sums due, and non-liquidated c laims. 

**_Sham or fraudulent transactions_** 

41     The plaintiffs’ primary c ase c onc erns numerous sham transac tions allegedly c onc oc ted by the Direc tors to fraudulently siphon moneys away from the Company so that the c reditors would not be able to obtain the same. The law governing fraudulent trading is s 340 of the Ac t and is reproduc ed below: 

 Responsibility for fraudulent trading 

 340. —(1) If, in the c ourse of the winding up of a c ompany or in any proc eedings against a c ompany, it appears that any business of the c ompany has been c arried on with intent to defraud c reditors of the c ompany or c reditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the Court, on the applic ation of the liquidator or any c reditor or c ontributory of the c ompany, may, if it thinks proper to do so, dec lare that any person who was knowingly a party to the c arrying on of the business in that manner shall be personally responsible, without any limitation 


 of liability, for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the c ompany as the Court direc ts. 

42     It was said at first instanc e in _Tang Yoke Kheng v Lek Benedict_ <span class="citation">[2004] 4 SLR(R) 788</span> (“ _Tang Yoke Kheng_ ”), at [12] that in order to suc c eed under this sec tion, the plaintiff would have to prove two elements, namely: 

 (a) that the business of the c ompany has been c arried on with intent to defraud the c reditors of the c ompany or of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose; and 

 (b) that the defendants were knowingly parties to the c arrying on of the business in that manner. 

In addition, “defraud” and “fraudulent purpose” c onnote “ac tual dishonesty involving, ac c ording to c urrent notions of fair trading among c ommerc ial men, real moral blame” (see _In re Patrick and Lyon, Limited_ [1933] Ch 786 at 790). 

43     When the c ase went on appeal ( _Tang Yoke Kheng v Lek Benedict_ <span class="citation">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 263</span>), the Court of Appeal held: 

 In the c ontext of an allegation of fraud, the objec tive standard of what an honest person would have done in the c irc umstanc es c ould be a useful devic e to test the honest intention of the person c onc erned against all the other evidenc e available, inc luding, and espec ially, the explanation by that person of his deviation from what an honest person would have done in his c irc umstanc es. However, to rely on the objec tive standard as the sole test would be exc eptional as it would require the c ourt to be c onvinc ed that the negative answer given in the fac tual c irc umstanc es was suffic iently indic ative of fraud to warrant a finding of fraud. 

 The c ivil standard of proving on a balanc e of probabilities applied where fraud was the subjec t of a c ivil c laim, despite the infusion of a c riminal element (ie fraud). However, bec ause of the severity and potentially serious implic ations attac hing to a fraud, the c ourt’s expec tation of proof would be higher even in a c ivil trial. The more serious the allegation, the more the party on whom the burden of proof fell had to do in order to establish his c ase on a balanc e of probabilities. 

It is generally rec ognised, as enunc iated above, that in order to make a finding of fraud, the c ourt requires a greater degree of proof than it would when c oming to a finding on issues of fac t that do not involve fraud. 

44     Additionally, in _Liquidator of Leong Seng Hin Piling Pte Ltd v Chan Ah Lek and others_ <span class="citation">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 77</span>, it was held that the standard of honesty was not measured ac c ording to some private standard of a defendant or the objec tive standard of the reasonable man, although it may serve as a guide in the assessment of whether the defendant was dishonest. Rather, the subjec tive intention of the defendant that he had ac ted in good faith c onstituted evidenc e whic h the c ourt evaluated and tested against the weight of other objec tive fac ts available inc luding, if required, the objec tive standard of the reasonable man. 

**_The law on unfair preference and undervalue transactions_** 

45     It is helpful to also set out the law on unfair preferenc e and undervalue transac tions at this junc ture. The relevant statutory provisions are s 329 of the Ac t read with ss 98 – 102 of the Bankruptc y Ac t. Sec tion 329 of the Ac t is as follows: 


 Undue preference 

 329. —(1) Subjec t to this Ac t and suc h modific ations as may be presc ribed, any transfer, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, exec ution or other ac t relating to property made or done by or against a c ompany whic h, had it been made or done by or against an individual, would in his bankruptc y be void or voidable under sec tion 98, 99 or 103 of the Bankruptc y Ac t (Cap. 20) (read with sec tions 100, 101 and 102 thereof ) shall in the event of the c ompany being wound up be void or voidable in like manner. 

46     Sec tion 98(1) of the Bankruptc y Ac t provides that: 

 Transactions at an undervalue 

 98. —(1) Subjec t to this sec tion and sec tions 100 and 102, where an individual is adjudged bankrupt and he has at the relevant time (as defined in sec tion 100) entered into a transac tion with any person at an undervalue, the Offic ial Assignee may apply to the c ourt for an order under this sec tion. 

 (2) The c ourt shall, on suc h an applic ation, make suc h order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that individual had not entered into that transac tion. 

Further, an individual enters into a transac tion with a person at an undervalue if: 

 ... 

 (c ) he enters into a transac tion with that person for a c onsideration the value of whic h, in money or money's worth, is signific antly less than the value, in money or money's worth, of the c onsideration provided by the individual. 

47     Additionally, the relevant period in so far as it c onc erns a transac tion allegedly at an undervalue, is the period of five years prior to the presentation of the winding up proc eedings (s 100(1)(a) Bankruptc y Ac t). However, s 100(2) of the Bankruptc y Ac t requires that in order for the transac tion to be dec lared void, it must be shown that the c ompany under liquidation: 

 (a) was insolvent at that time; or 

 (b) bec ame insolvent in c onsequenc e of the transac tion. 

Under s 100(3) of the Bankruptc y Ac t there is a presumption of suc h insolvenc y where, as between the parties to the transac tion, one is an assoc iate of the other. 

48     Sec tion 101 of the Bankruptc y Ac t lays down the c riteria establishing when a person would be c onsidered to be an assoc iate of another person. More spec ific ally, s 101(2) states that a person is an assoc iate of an individual if he is the person’s spouse or relative. Regulation 3 of the Companies (Applic ation of Bankruptc y Ac t Provisions) Regulations (“CABAR”) provides that ss 98 103 of the Bankruptc y Ac t shall be read subjec t to “suc h textual and other modific ation as may be nec essary” for their applic ation to a c ompany being wound up. As suc h, when the situation relates to two c ompanies, the referenc e to ‘individual’ in the Bankruptc y Ac t must be read as referring to a c ompany as a nec essary modific ation c ontemplated by reg 3 (see: _Show Theatres Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Shaw Theatres Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2002] 4 SLR 145</span>). 


49     It should be noted however, that where the c laim is that of an undervalue transac tion, the party alleging that the transac tion was at an undervalue has to prove this to the c ourt. It is settled law that he who asserts must prove and the burden of proof, on a balanc e of probabilities, of suc h undervalue rests with the liquidators who assert that the transac tion was effec ted at an undervalue. There is no presumption provision as to undervalue as there is as to insolvenc y. 

**_Unfair preference transactions_** 

50     Similarly, s 99 of the Bankruptc y Ac t states the following: 

 Unfair preferences 

 99. —(1) Subjec t to this sec tion and sec tions 100 and 102, where an individual is adjudged bankrupt and he has, at the relevant time (as defined in sec tion 100), given an unfair preferenc e to any person, the Offic ial Assignee may apply to the c ourt for an order under this sec tion. 

 (2) The c ourt shall, on suc h an applic ation, make suc h order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that individual had not given that unfair preferenc e. 

 (3) For the purposes of this sec tion and sec tions 100 and 102, an individual gives an unfair preferenc e to a person if — 

 (a) that person is one of the individual’s c reditors or a surety or guarantor for any of his debts or other liabilities; and 

 (b) the individual does anything or suffers anything to be done whic h (in either c ase) has the effec t of putting that person into a position whic h, in the event of the individual’s bankruptc y, will be better than the position he would have been in if that thing had not been done. 

 (4) The c ourt shall not make an order under this sec tion in respec t of an unfair preferenc e given to any person unless the individual who gave the preferenc e was influenc ed in dec iding to give it by a desire to produc e in relation to that person the effec t mentioned in subsec tion (3)( b ). 

 (5) An individual who has given an unfair preferenc e to a person who, at the time the unfair preferenc e was given, was an assoc iate of his (otherwise than by reason only of being his employee) shall be presumed, unless the c ontrary is shown, to have been influenc ed in dec iding to give it by suc h a desire as is mentioned in subsec tion (4). 

51     The relevant period for an unfair preferenc e transac tion would be within two years of the presentation of the winding-up petition and it is for the assoc iate to rebut the presumption. It was also held in [35] of _Re Tiong Polestar Engineering Pte Ltd (formerly known as Polestar Engineering (S) Pte Ltd)_ <span class="citation">[2003] 4 SLR(R) 1</span>, that as long as there was an intention on the part of the c ompany to prefer the assoc iate, that would be suffic ient to c onstitute unfair preferenc e even if it was not the main intention of the c ompany. 

**Was the Company insolvent on either or both of the specified dates?** 

52     The plaintiffs took the position that the evidenc e showed that the Company was insolvent on 30 April 2003 and c ontinued to be thereafter. 

53     First, the bank rec onc iliation statement prepared by the Company showed that its c ash balanc e 


as of that date was $101,654.73. The plaintiffs c ompiled the invoic es due and payable by the Company as at 30 April 2003 and found that these totalled $314,584.84, a sum that was far in exc ess of the c ash balanc e. 

54     Additionally, there were other invoic es amounting to $51,548.72 whic h were payable by the Company but whic h were not dated. The plaintiffs c laimed that, assuming these invoic es were due for payment when presented to the Company, the total amount of debt due and payable by the Company on all the invoic es as at 30 April 2003 would have been $366,133.56. As suc h, applying the balanc e sheet test, the Company was c learly insolvent. 

55     The plaintiffs also asserted that on 30 August 2003, the liabilities of the Company had exc eeded its assets. The Company’s debts as at that date amounted to $274,764.34. Other invoic es issued and presented against the Company on or before 31 August 2003 for whic h payment terms were not stated amounted to $42,018.65. Assuming that these were due when issued and presented to the Company for payment, the total amount due and payable by it as at 31 August 2003 was $316,782.99. As against this amount, the Company’s available c ash on 31 August 2003 was, as shown by its financ ial statements for the year ended August 2003, only $176,841.00 and therefore it was not in a position to pay the liabilities. 

56     Additionally, by 31 August 2003, the c laim from Soon Li Heng for $629,550 had already been rec eived (4 July 2003). Soon Li Heng was pressing for payment and a demand letter for the amount had been sent out on 30 July 2003 when the Company failed to meet the c laim. Legal ac tion was, obviously, imminent even if the writ may not have been served by 31 August 2003. 

57     The Company’s financ ial statements did not disc lose Soon Li Heng’s c laim. It appeared from the evidenc e that the auditors were not informed of this c laim and this was probably the reason why it was not c aptured as a liability or a c ontingent liability in the 2003 financ ial statements. If this c laim were to be inc luded as part of the Company’s indebtedness as at 31 August 2003, then there would be no doubt as to the Company’s insolvent position on that date. 

58     The Direc tors submitted that the plaintiffs’ relianc e on the c ash flow and balanc e sheet tests to establish the Company’s insolvenc y was erroneous as these two tests are not determinative of insolvenc y. They relied on the evidenc e of their expert witness, Chee Yoh Chuang (“Mr Chee”), who was a partner of Stone Forest Corporate Advisory and had more than 20 years experienc e in insolvenc y related ac c ounting servic es, to state their position on the solvenc y of the Company as on 30 April 2003 and 31 August 2003. 

59     Mr Chee had relied on two tests for insolvenc y, namely a “net worth” test and a “liquidity” test. In the c ourse of c ross-examination, however, he agreed that these tests were in essenc e the “balanc e sheet” and “c ash flow” tests respec tively. Mr Chee also agreed that the net worth test operates by seeing “whether the book value of the c ompany is positive or negative from its balanc e sheet” – identic al to the balanc e sheet test, and that the liquidity test works by determining if the c urrent assets are less than c urrent liabilities identic al to the c ash flow test. As suc h both the plaintiffs and the defendants were relying on the same tests to determine the Company’s solvenc y. In addition, Mr Chee had relied on a third test, that of “whether the c ompany has enough money in hand to pay the liabilities that are due”. 

60     However, Mr Chee had reac hed the c onc lusion that the Company was solvent on 30 April 2003 and 31 August 2003 on the basis of the same tests whic h the plaintiffs had used – the c ash flow and balanc e sheet tests. As the plaintiffs submitted, however, during c ross-examination, it appeared that Mr Chee’s c onc lusions were flawed and he had to retrac t his position. 


### Q 

### A 

### Q 

### A 

61     The first problem was that when Mr Chee rec onstruc ted the Company’s balanc e sheet as at 30 April 2003 to show that its assets exc eeded its liabilities, he did not inc lude amounts owing to hire purc hase c reditors among the liabilities. When c ross examined, Mr Chee initially c laimed that he had lifted the c urrent liability figures from the plaintiffs’ statement of c laim and had assumed that this figure inc luded the hire purc hase c reditors. However, when fac ed with c ontradic tory evidenc e in his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief (“AEIC”), he agreed that what he had said in his AEIC was that he believed that the Company’s trade payables amounting to $366,134 were made up of c osts whic h were inc urred prior to 30 April 2003 on ongoing projec ts that the Company was working on. In fac t, no assumption ought to have been made that the figures in the statement of c laim inc luded the hire purc hase c reditors. On the sec ond day of c ross-examination, having c hec ked the audit working papers overnight, Mr Chee admitted that he had found that an amount of approximately $81, should have been inc luded under the Company’s c urrent liabilities as being due to hire purc hase c reditors and that this meant that the Company had a negative net worth of approximately $65, as at 30 April 2003, instead of the positive net worth that he had reported. 

62     Further, in the c ourse of c ross-examination, Mr Chee had c andidly agreed that he c ould have done a better job of assessing the Company’s financ ial statements: 

 I put it to you that this was slipshod work, Mr Chee. 

 Well, c ould well be at that point in time. 

 ... 

 And that if you had done your work with proper diligenc e, you would have advised her Honour more c arefully on what the real net worth of the c ompany was? 

 Granted. 

63     In addition, with regards to the liquidity test, Mr Chee had derived a positive c urrent ratio as at 30 April 2003 by matc hing the Company’s c urrent assets as at 30 April 2003 against the figure for c urrent liabilities that he had lifted from the statement of c laim. Mr Chee was aware that the plaintiffs’ figure for c urrent liabilities was derived from invoic es that were due and payable by the Company as of 30 April 2003, or from invoic es that were on c ash terms. However, he had not taken into ac c ount the fac t that the c urrent assets’ figure in the Company’s balanc e sheet might have inc luded amounts that the Company c ould not immediately use to pay off its c urrent liabilities. 

64     In partic ular, Mr Chee had not c hec ked the c redit terms of the Company’s invoic es that formed the basis for the “trade rec eivables” figure. This c ould possibly have led to him c omparing trade rec eivables that were not yet due against payments that were already due and owing by the Company as of 30 April 2003. He did not verify whether the trade rec eivables were indeed c ollec tible as of that date. Further, he had neglec ted to take into ac c ount the fac t that a performanc e bond of $40,000 that was only refundable to the Company after 18 June 2005 was inc luded as a c urrent asset under “other rec eivables and deposits”. Mr Chee admitted that suc h bond deposits whic h c ould not be c ollec ted immediately c ould not be used to pay off debts as of 30 April 2003. This greatly affec ted the ac c urac y of Mr Chee’s liquidity test results. 

65     Mr Chee had also failed to take into ac c ount amounts reflec ted as owing by the Company to the Direc tors as a c urrent liability. Mr Chee admitted that the Company would be c learly insolvent on his liquidity test if the amounts owing to the Direc tors were inc luded as c urrent liabilities as at 30 April 2003 as they had been by the Company’s auditors. However, he had c hosen to reflec t the amount 


owing to the Direc tors as a non-c urrent liability instead. Mr Chee stated that he c hose to treat these debts as “quasi-c apital”. Mr Chee justified the use of this term on the basis that the Direc tors c ould withhold demanding repayment of the amounts due to them as long as they wanted to and, therefore, advanc es made by them should not be treated in the same way as other indebtedness. When questioned, however, he readily admitted that “quasi-c apital” was a term he had c ome up with himself and that he had not c ome ac ross any previous situation in whic h this term had been used to desc ribe amounts owing to a direc tor and c aused the same to be removed from the c urrent liabilities. 

66     Mr Chee testified that he was unaware of Mr Leow’s position that the latter had borrowed large sums of money to fund the Company’s needs. Mr Chee agreed that the lenders to the Direc tors may have imposed repayment terms for those loans and that this c ould mean that the Direc tors would not be able to withhold demanding repayment from the Company. When he was shown the Direc tors’ testimony that they had used money repaid to them by the Company between 30 April 2003 and 31 August 2003 to repay some $120,000 worth of third party loans, Mr Chee agreed that this would mean that the amount owing to the Direc tors on 30 April 2003 had to be treated as a c urrent liability. As a result, applic ation of Mr Chee’s liquidity test meant that the Company was insolvent as at 30 April 2003. 

67     In addition, the applic ation of the third test was flawed bec ause Mr Chee had assumed that the Company c ould use its c ollec tions from invoic es issued after 30 April 2003 to pay debts that were already due as at that date. If this assumption is applied then, as Mr Chee agreed, a c ompany whic h has a c ash flow c ould only bec ome insolvent if its c reditors demanded payment. Suc h a position would not c omply with the well-established solvenc y princ iple that a solvent c ompany is one that is able to pay its debts as and when they fall due. More c ruc ially, Mr Chee failed to take into ac c ount new liabilities inc urred by the Company that would bec ome due and payable after 30 April 2003 and the impac t these would have on the Company’s c ash flow. Therefore, Mr Chee had c onsidered only a future in-flow of funds and ignored future out-flows. This omission skewed his analysis. 

68     Cruc ially, Mr Chee had admitted the following during c ross-examination: 

 Court: As of 30th April if you use the c ash flow test, would the c ompany be tec hnic ally insolvent? 

 A: Yes, your Honour. 

 ... 

 Q: So on all three test[s], tec hnic ally the c ompany is insolvent? 

 A: Tec hnic ally, yes. 

69     With respec t to the Company’s position at 31 August 2003, Mr Chee had c onc luded in his AEIC that the c ompany was tec hnic ally insolvent under both the net worth and liquidity tests, whic h suggested that the Company might not be able to settle its obligations as and when they fell due. However, Mr Chee had maintained that the Company would have a positive net-worth if the amount reflec ted as owing to the Direc tors was exc luded as a c urrent liability, and reflec ted as “quasic apital”. I find it diffic ult to ac c ept this bec ause, as mentioned earlier, this was an avant-garde and irregular method of ac c ounting. Further, Mr Chee had admitted that if this had been left as a liability and not revised, and the net worth test had then been applied properly, the Company would have had a negative net worth as of 31 August 2003. 

70     It also appeared that Mr Chee had not taken into ac c ount the debt owed by the Company to 


Soon Li Heng. Indeed, he had admitted when questioned, that if the auditors had been notified of the Soon Li Heng c laim, and a notional S$500,000 was put into the books as part of that c laim, the Company would have had a huge defic it in terms of its net worth. 

71     Lastly, Mr Chee had assumed that the Direc tors were able to fund the Company’s financ ial needs. In making this assumption, he had relied on letters of representation signed by Mr Leow and Mdm Ong, c onfirming that they would c ontinue to support and financ e the Company and would provide additional funds to meet its debts as and when they fell due. 

72     Upon questioning, Mr Chee admitted that the letter of representation was of limited value without a proper study of the Direc tors’ bank ac c ounts and other financ ial means and further admitted that he had not made suc h a study. In addition, he had erroneously c alc ulated Mr Leow’s c ontribution to the Company between September 2003 and August 2004 as being $255,955.23 instead of $176,564.93, thus c oming to the inac c urate c onc lusion that the Direc tors had the financ ial ability to make good the Company’s shortfall of $251,258. Further, Mr Chee admitted that it was “possible” that his assumption that the Direc tors c ould fund the Company was inac c urate bec ause he did not take into ac c ount new liabilities in the Financ ial Year 2003-2004 whic h the funds allegedly put into the Company by the direc tors might have been used to pay. 

73     I have c onc luded that bec ause of the diffic ulties in Mr Chee’s evidenc e that the Direc tors c annot rely on it to support their stand that the Company was financ ially solvent as at 30 April 2003 and 31 August 2005. 

74     The Direc tors also submitted that the c ash flow test was not, in and of itself, determinant of whether the Company was insolvent. They c laimed that the balanc e sheet test was also not determinative of insolvenc y. They relied on _Chip Thye -_ that all evidenc e must be taken into c onsideration in dec iding whether a c ompany was able to pay its debts as they fell due. 

75     In _Chip Thye_ , Belinda Ang J held that there was no single test for insolvenc y and that regard should be had to all of the evidenc e that appeared relevant to the question of insolvenc y. However, in determining if the c ompany in that c ase was insolvent, the learned judge had regard to the balanc e sheet test of insolvenc y whic h showed that the c ompany had a negative net worth during the relevant financ ial years. Further, she found that there were no c ash flow statements provided by the defendant to prove the c ompany’s c ash flow was healthy. The judge had also looked at the financ ial statements of the c ompany and found that turnover or sales had dec lined sharply over the relevant financ ial years and that there was no likely financ ial assistanc e forthc oming from financ ial institutions, investors or shareholders. As suc h, she held that the evidenc e over all established insolvenc y. From this short ac c ount of the c ase, it appears that the defendants have glossed over the importanc e of the c ash flow and balanc e sheet tests as the same were applied and were part of the reason for the c onc lusions arrived at in _Chip Thye_. 

76     While it is c ertainly true that a global c onsideration of all relevant fac tors is nec essary, it is equally true that the c ash flow and balanc e sheet tests are useful and ac c urate means of verifying the solvenc y of a c ompany. Indeed, as the plaintiffs have submitted, in _Chip Thye_ , the c ourt’s first port of c all was an examination of whether the Company was tec hnic ally insolvent. 

77     The plaintiffs also pointed out other fac tors whic h they said they had relied on in c oming to the c onc lusion that the Company was insolvent. These inc luded the value of the property, plant and equipment of the Company as at 30 April 2003; the quantum of trade rec eivables of the Company as at 30 April 2003 and 31 August 2003; and the financ ial support allegedly provided by the Direc tors. The plaintiffs submitted that these fac tors c ould not alter the c onc lusion that the Company was 


insolvent. 

78     The defendants made an argument that they had c ollec ted signific ant amounts from the Company’s trade rec eivables in the period after 30 April 2003 and that these amounts were used to pay off its debts as at April 2003. The Direc tors asserted that the liabilities inc urred by the Company after 30 April 2003 did not impac t on its solvenc y as at 30 April 2003 but only on its solvenc y after 30 April 2003. This argument, however, to my mind, flies in the fac e of the defendants’ assertions that the totality of the situation ought to be taken into ac c ount and that an overtly tec hnic al analysis should not be used. Should all relevant fac tors and evidenc e be taken into c onsideration, then the possibility that the Company would inc ur further liabilities after 30 April 2003 should impac t on its solvenc y as of that date. Otherwise, there will be a myopic and tec hnic al analysis of the Company’s financ ial health. Further, s 254(2) of the Ac t provides that both c ontingent _and_ prospec tive liabilities ought to be taken into ac c ount in dec iding if a c ompany is able to pay its debts as and when they fall due. 

79     In their submissions, the Direc tors emphasised that 100% of the Company’s debts as of 30 April 2003 and 94.3% of the debts as of 31 August 2003 were eventually paid off and this meant that the Company was not insolvent bec ause it was able to pay its debts. I do not ac c ept this submission. The fac t that all of the Company’s debts as of 30 April 2003 were eventually paid off is not determinative of whether on that date the Company was able to pay its debts as and when they fell due. In _Bank of Australasia v Hall_ (1907) 4 CLR 1514-1528, the c ourt distinguished between the position of a debtor who was able to pay all his debts as and when they bec ame due and that of a debtor who would only be able to pay debts presently due at some future time. The c ourt stated that only the first type of debtor c ould be said to be solvent. 

80     In the present c ase, the evidenc e of the Direc tors was that all the invoic es due as at 30 April 2003 were fully settled only by 8 June 2004, _ie_ , more than a year from the date on whic h these invoic es were due and payable. The Direc tors did not give evidenc e as to whether the Company was in a position to pay off all the debts it inc urred after 30 April 2003. The Company c ertainly c ould not pay off all of its debts as of 31 August 2003 sinc e only 93% of these were eventually paid. 

81     More importantly, the Direc tors c laimed that they were in a position to c ontribute their personal funds to stave off any c laims as at 30 April 2003. The Direc tors maintained that they had an amount of $50,425.64 in various bank ac c ounts under their names as at 30 April 2003 whic h was a reserve fund that c ould be used to pay off any urgent c laims. As the plaintiffs submitted, however, there is no evidenc e supporting the amount that the Direc tors c laimed to have c ontributed to the Company, apart from the Company’s rec ords, in partic ular the Direc tor’s Ac c ount in the General Ledger and the Cash Book. Neither Mr Leow nor Mdm Ong was able to explain how or where they were able to provide the funds rec orded as c ontributions from them in the Company’s ac c ounts nor why those ac c ounts should reflec t suc h amounts as owing to them. 

82     In the c ourse of c ross-examination, Mr Leow repeatedly gave evidenc e that Mdm Ong prepared the Company’s ac c ounts, inc luding payment vouc hers and c heques, on his instruc tions. He also admitted that she obtained the information regarding the ac c ounts from him. He went so far as to say that Mdm Ong would follow his instruc tions without question when she prepared the Company’s ac c ounts. 

83     Mdm Ong’s testimony c orroborated her husband’s evidenc e, as she also stated that she prepared the Company’s ac c ounts solely on Mr Leow’s instruc tions and would not question or verify what Mr Leow had told her. Further, if Mr Leow gave her money without stating spec ific ally that it was a payment from one of the Company’s debtors, she would simply rec ord it as a loan by Mr Leow 


### A 

to the Company. In the light of evidenc e suc h as this, I have c onsiderable doubts about the ac c urac y of the Company’s ac c ounting rec ords. 

84     Quite apart from the rec ords, the oral evidenc e of the Direc tors c ast doubts on the alleged loans that they had made to the Company. When questioned as to how he c ould have provided a $48,000.00 loan to the Company, as was rec orded in the Ledger, at a time when he only had $5, in the bank, Mr Leow’s reply was: 

 I c annot answer you. You have to c hec k with my wife. ... Too long ago. 

Further, an amount of $936.32 was rec eived by the Company and rec orded as a c heque deposit made by Mr Leow on 11 February 2003. However, there was no c orresponding withdrawal of the same amount from Mr Leow’s ac c ount on or around that date. Mr Leow c ould not explain how it was that this amount was rec orded as a c ontribution from him or why the amount was not rounded off to the nearest dollar. His reply was that the plaintiffs should “c hec k with [his] wife”. 

85     When Mdm Ong was c ross-examined on these rec ords, her only response was that she c ould not remember how the transac tions she was questioned about had c ome about. She admitted further that she would not be able to help the c ourt by explaining where the funds that the Direc tors had c ontributed to the Company had c ome from. 

86     The Direc tors submitted that they had further financ ial resourc es whic h they c ould have used to support the Company and therefore it c ould not be c onsidered insolvent. First, they asserted that there were signific ant amounts of c ash on the persons of both Mr Leow and Mdm Ong and in their home. They said that the Company’s bank statements showed that signific ant c ash deposits were made into the Company’s ac c ount. In order to have deposited the amounts (ranging between $9, and $65,000) in c ash, Mr Leow would have c arried them on his person or kept them at home at some point in time before he deposited them. The Direc tors’ assertion that they had signific ant amounts of c ash at all times was therefore not inherently inc redible. 

87     Whilst I ac c ept that the Direc tors may have c arried around substantial amounts of c ash from time to time, there is no evidenc e that this c ash belonged to them rather than to the Company. Mr Leow often c ollec ted payment in c ash from the Company’s debtors and he also c ashed c heques from the Company’s ac c ount. If the c ash in his possession was taken from his own bank ac c ount, then he c ould have produc ed evidenc e of this. There was no evidenc e of any other business that the Direc tors c arried on apart from that of the Company whic h c ould have generated the c ash in hand. I therefore have to infer that any c ash that did not c ome from the personal bank ac c ounts c ame from either the Company’s debtors or the Company’s bank ac c ount. Further, if the Direc tors did have suffic ient c ash with them to pay the Company’s debts as they fell due, the question arises as to why they did not and why it took a year before all the debts whic h were due as at 30 April 2003 were settled. 

88     The Direc tors also said that they were able to support the Company bec ause they c ould have borrowed sums of up to $200,000 from Mr Leow’s friends. However, any loan that Mr Leow took from his friends and then on-lent to the Company to settle the Company’s debts would itself have inc reased the Company’s indebtedness. I have rejec ted the Direc tors’ c ontention that direc tors’ loans were to be c onsidered as “quasi-c apital” instead of as normal loans. On that basis, the fac t that Mr Leow c ould have borrowed more and more money from his friends would not result in the Company being c onsidered solvent. 

89     On the totality of the evidenc e, I am satisfied that the Company was insolvent both on and 


after 30 April 2003 and was also insolvent on 31 August 2003. 

**_Did the Directors know that the Company was insolvent?_** 

90     The plaintiffs’ position is that the Direc tors were c learly aware of the Company’s insolvenc y on 30 April 2003 and thereafter. The plaintiffs submitted that the Direc tors were aware of the Company’s general financ ial position at all times and would have been aware by 30 April 2003 that the Company would have diffic ulty paying its debts as they fell due. In the alternative, the plaintiffs submitted that it must have been obvious to the Direc tors by 31 August 2003 that the Company c ould not pay its debts. 

91     Before I deal with the evidenc e, I would like to c omment on the quality of the testimony given by the Direc tors in relation to their dealings with the Company and its moneys. Neither Mr Leow nor Mdm Ong was a c onvinc ingly truthful witness in relation to many areas of their evidenc e. They were frequently evasive and avoided the questions that were being asked. Often too, their evidenc e was c ontradic tory and they had a tendenc y to c hange their stories as they were pressed during the c ross-examination. Some things that they said were inc onsistent with other parts of their evidenc e. I have mentioned portions of their testimony in earlier paragraphs of this judgment whic h illustrate the diffic ulty of ac c epting muc h of the same at fac e value. 

92     As mentioned above, Mr Leow maintained that his wife would be more familiar with the Company’s financ es as he did not go through the rec ords often. When c ross-examined, however, Mdm Ong’s testimony on this point was inc onsistent and c ontradic tory. When questioned as to whether she would be able to tell how muc h money the Company owed on any partic ular day, Mdm Ong had given a negative reply. She explained she would only c alc ulate all outstanding bills in the Company’s “Outstanding file” onc e a year, when the Company’s financ es were due for auditing. When questioned if she had “never c hec ked what was owing”, Mdm Ong c onfirmed that she “never c hec k[ed]”. 

93     The very next day, however, Mdm Ong testified that she prepared “purc hase journals” for the Company for eac h year. She said that these purc hase journals were prepared using Exc el spreadsheets programmed with formulae whic h would c alc ulate how muc h the Company owed to its c reditors for eac h of its projec ts whenever she entered figures for invoic es rec eived or sums paid out on those invoic es. When asked if, just by looking at the purc hase journal, she would automatic ally know how muc h was unpaid for eac h projec t the Company was involved in, Mdm Ong replied in the affirmative. This c ontradic ted her testimony of the previous day when she had c laimed that she would not have any idea as to how muc h the Company owed its c reditors. 

94     Further, c ontrary to her husband’s earlier evidenc e, Mdm Ong had testified that Mr Leow looked at the bills in the “Outstanding file” onc e every one or two months, and by looking at these bills “he should know” the amount of money he owed c reditors. This was in stark c ontrast to Mr Leow’s adamant insistenc e that he knew nothing about the ac c ounts. As suc h, it appears that both Mr Leow and Mdm Ong had knowledge of the ac c ounts of the Company, and their deliberate evasiveness was so as to c onc eal the fac t that they had known the Company c ould not pay its debts as they fell due as at 30 April 2003 and 31 August 2003. To believe the Direc tors’ assertions of ignoranc e would also be to believe that they were negligent and inc ompetent in their running of the Company’s affairs and, bearing in mind that this business had been c arried on by them for dec ades, that is a diffic ult belief to justify. 

95     In addition, the plaintiffs submitted that the Direc tors did not have a legitimate reason to avoid payment of the Soon Li Heng c laim nor did they have the nec essary means to pay it. The Direc tors’ response was that they held the view that they had a good c ase against Soon Li Heng as an 


 (a) 

 (b) 

 (c ) 

applic ation for summary judgment had been dismissed. They maintained that the c laim was disputed in good faith. The Direc tors therefore submitted that on 31 August 2003, it would have been premature to treat the Soon Li Heng c laim as a payable. However, the Direc tors admitted that their expert witness, Mr Chee, had ac c epted that the c laim ought to have been disc losed as a c ontingent liability at least. As noted previously, c ontingent liabilities are to be taken into c onsideration when determining a c ompany’s solvenc y. The Direc tors were also aware that Soon Li Heng had c ompleted the work and that on 24 August 2003 the Company had rec eived a substantial payment from the HDB for work done on the Fernvale projec t. Under the sub-c ontrac t, the Company had to pay Soon Li Heng within three to seven days of rec eipt of payment from the HDB. The Direc tors must have been aware from the HDB’s payment that it was generally satisfied with the work done and therefore that some amount of money at least was payable to Soon Li Heng in respec t of the projec t. The Company put a c ounterc laim and this was, in substanc e, its main defenc e to Soon Li Heng’s c laim. Given, however, that that c ounterc laim was subsequently found to be totally baseless, the Direc tors (or Mr Leow, at least, sinc e he was aware of what went on at the site) c ould not have reasonably believed that the c ounterc laim had muc h c hanc e of suc c ess. 

96     The Direc tors made the argument that the fac t that they c ontinued to run the Company as a going c onc ern from 30 April 2003 up to end 2004 showed that they were ignorant that the Company was insolvent from 30 April 2003 onwards. In this c onnec tion, the Direc tors c ontended that they c ontinued to provide the Company with financ ial support during this period as follows: 

 $45,000 was c ontributed as c apital c ontributions; 

 $498,856 was paid into the Company’s bank ac c ount as direc tors’ loans; and 

 Mr Leow bore c ash expenses totalling $336,197.83 on the Company’s behalf. 

Mr Kon agreed that ac c ording to the Company’s doc uments the Direc tors had provided the above financ ial support to the Company during the entire period during whic h the impugned transac tions were taking plac e. 

97     The important question here is whether the Company’s doc uments c an be relied on as ac c urately reflec ting the financ ial support given by the Direc tors. The rec ords relied on are the Direc tor’s Ac c ount in the Company’s General Ledger, where Mdm Ong rec orded amounts allegedly owed by the Company to her husband and the Company’s Cash Book, whic h reported c ash payments made by the Company from its c ash-in-hand. I have already referred to the way in whic h these ac c ounts were kept by Mdm Ong (see [83] above). That evidenc e did not give me c onfidenc e in the ac c urac y of the rec ord-keeping. I have also highlighted some of the evidenc e whic h showed the diffic ulty that the Direc tors had in explaining where the funds rec orded as c ontributions from them in the Company’s ac c ounts ac tually c ame from. Mr Kon’s position was that on the state of the doc uments, there was not enough doc umentary proof that the moneys had in fac t c ome from the Direc tors. His view was that these moneys c ould simply have emanated from third parties or been part of the Company’s trade rec eivables. The Plaintiffs submitted that Mr Leow c ould simply have told Mdm Ong that money that had been paid to the Company by third parties were loans from him and she would have rec orded the same as money owing to him on Mr Leow’s say-so without further c hec king or verific ation. Likewise, Mr Leow c ould have told her that he had made a payment on the Company’s behalf and she would rec ord this as more money owing to Mr Leow even if suc h payment 


had nothing to do with the Company. 

98     I agree that the evidenc e does not establish on a balanc e of probabilities that the Direc tors made the c ontributions to the Company that they asserted they did. 

99     The Direc tors also relied on the fac t that they had given written undertakings to support the Company financ ially. Two undertakings were signed by the Direc tors – the first was in relation to the Company’s financ ial statements for the financ ial year ended 31 August 2003, while the sec ond was in relation to the financ ial statements for the year ended 31 August 2004. These letters however did not really show that the Direc tors were prepared to support the Company bec ause the first letter was only signed by the Direc tors on 25 Oc tober 2004, more than a year after the c lose of the 2003 financ ial year, whilst the letter for the year ended 31 August 2004 was only signed on 25 April 2005. In fac t, the latter letter was issued after Mr Leow’s statutory dec laration on 4 Marc h 2005 stating that the Company c ould not c ontinue its business bec ause of its liabilities. 

100    Mr Leow’s c redibility was also sorely shaken when he was questioned on the topic of the letters of undertaking. In the span of five minutes, he c hanged his position on whether he understood the c ontents of the letter of undertaking no less than four times. He had first testified that he “roughly” understood the meaning of the letter, but then c hanged his position to say that he did not read the letter when he signed it. However, he then reverted to the stand that he “roughly” knew its meaning, and finally, when questioned by me, he affirmed that he did know the meaning of the letter. When asked to c onfirm his position at the start of the hearing on the next day, Mr Leow c hanged his testimony again, this time saying that the auditor did not explain the letters to him and that he was “not very c ertain” about their meaning. Overall, I c annot find that Mr Leow knew what he was signing and c ommitting himself to. This means that the letters really are valueless as evidenc e that the Direc tors ran the Company as a going c onc ern. 

101    The third fac tor raised by the Direc tors was that the Company had c ontinued tendering for projec ts from the HDB in 2003 and 2004. Unfortunately, the Company did not suc c eed in any of the tenders and they thus had no impac t on the Company’s financ ial position. In any event, the evidenc e of c ontinuing tendering is equivoc al – the Direc tors may have been trying to save the Company from its insolvent position. The fac t that tenders were sent out did not mean that the Direc tors were unaware that the Company was in a parlous financ ial position or that they thought the Company was solvent. The same thing goes for the Company’s ongoing subc ontrac ting works for China Construc tion. The fac t that there was suc h an ongoing c ontrac t did not mean that the Company was solvent. It made an overall loss in financ ial year 2003. Therefore whatever profits it made from its ongoing c ontrac ts that year did not, and c ould not, take it from an insolvent position to a solvent position. The Company was not a going c onc ern simply bec ause it was still doing some work. 

102    On a c onsideration of the evidenc e therefore, I do not ac c ept the Direc tors’ c ontentions that they were not aware of the Company’s financ ial diffic ulties or its insolvent position. In my judgment, both the Direc tors knew that the Company c ould not pay its debts as the same fell due and the ac tions that they took after 30 April 2003 must be c onsidered in the light of suc h knowledge. 

**Should the Directors be made to repay moneys taken from the Company?** 

103    The plaintiffs’ c ase was that during their investigations of the Company’s affairs, they found that the Direc tors had c aused the Company to make a number of payments to Mr Leow between May 2003 and August 2004. Ac c ording to the plaintiffs’ c losing submissions, these payments totalled $537,738. The plaintiffs also made referenc e to the statement of c laim (Amendment No 3) whic h inc luded a table giving me the partic ulars of the impugned payments. The payments in the table 


## S/No Date of Payment VoucherCheque No Amount (S$) 

 totalled $544,239.17. The differenc e between the two figures is the amount of $6,501.17 whic h was partic ularised in item 10 of the table as being a c ash amount paid out on 31 August 2003. In c ourt, Mr Kon c onfirmed that the plaintiffs were no longer c laiming reimbursement of that amount.

105    The plaintiffs’ c ase is that the Payments formed part of a series of irregular and fraudulent transac tions whic h had the effec t of siphoning moneys from the Company and out of the reac h of its c reditors. They submitted that the Direc tors had masterminded the sc heme to defraud the Company’s c reditors. The Payments were doc umented by way of payment vouc hers from the Company whic h were either made out in favour of Mr Leow or whic h were marked as “c ash payments”. 

106    In their defenc e, the Direc tors said that the Payments were made in good faith and/or in the knowledge that the Company was not insolvent and/or in the belief that the Company was not insolvent. I have found that the Direc tors knew that the Company was insolvent during the period when these Payments were made and therefore the onus must lie on the Direc tors to explain the reason for the Payments and why it was that they were eac h made in good faith for the Company’s business. 

107    The Payments were made to Mr Leow. When he was asked in c ourt to explain them, he maintained that he c ould not rec all anything about any of the Payments and repeatedly stated that his wife would be able to help the c ourt. In her AEIC, Mdm Ong attempted to explain the Payments. She did this by splitting the Payments into several overlapping c ategories as follows: 

 (a) the Direc tors would pay their employees’ salaries in c ash first and the Company would reimburse them later; 

 (b) the Direc tors may have withdrawn c ash from the Company whic h they had then used to pay the Company’s employees’ salaries; 

 (c ) Mr Leow may have borrowed money from his friends and/or other c ontrac tors and repaid them by way of c ash c heques; and 

 (d) some of the Payments involved c heques that were not issued by Mr Leow. 

108    It should be noted that not all the Payments made were explained by Mdm Ong as belonging to one or more of the c ategories set out above. Some Payments were not explained at all. Other Payments fell into more than one of her c ategories. For example, she said that Payment no 6 was meant as a repayment of a loan given by one Mr Piak Boon Seng (c ategory (c )) and also that the c ash c heque for this amount was not issued to Mr Leow (c ategory (d)). In c ourt, Mdm Ong was questioned extensively about the various Payments and she had quite a lot of diffic ulty in explaining them. 

109    In their submissions, the Direc tors relied heavily on the assertion that Mr Leow had c ontributed signific ant funds to the Company and these c ontributions were rec orded under the Direc tors’ ac c ount in the Company’s general ledger or in the c ash book. At the end of the financ ial year, after netting off the c ash payments to Mr Leow against the c ash payments made by him to the Company, the balanc e on the c ash book was c arried bac k to the Direc tors’ ac c ount under the general ledger as a pure ac c ounting operation and treated as a partial repayment of the Direc tors’ loans. The rec ords showed 


that the Payments were taken ac c ount of in the Direc tors’ ac c ount in the Company’s general ledger. They did not disappear off the radar and they were not off balanc e sheet items. The first plaintiff had c onc eded that all of the impugned Payments were openly rec orded in the Company’s doc uments. 

110    The Direc tors also submitted that the plaintiffs c ould not prove fraud by shifting the burden to the Direc tors to provide explanations for the Payments. They had to prove fraud by c onvinc ing evidenc e. Sec ondly, Mr Leow was legally entitled to repay himself the Direc tors’ loans bec ause these loans were, on the Company’s audited statements, stated to be “with no fixed terms of repayment” and were therefore repayable only on demand. In this regard, Mr Kon had agreed that the Direc tors c ould c hoose whether to postpone payment or to pay themselves in respec t of suc h loans. 

111    In my opinion, the fac t that the Payments were rec orded in the Company’s rec ords c ould not by itself mean that the Payments were used for the Company’s purposes. There had to be supporting doc uments to show what the Payments were for. The problem in this c ase was that there were insuffic ient ac c ompanying doc uments whic h established that the moneys were taken for the Company’s purposes and not for other uses. This is why the explanation of the Direc tors as to who were the persons who handled the funds was very important. If the Direc tors were able to explain what had happened to the various Payments and how they were used in the Company’s business, then there would be no reason to impugn these Payments. In the absenc e of satisfac tory explanation, however, the c ourt might have no option but to draw an adverse inferenc e. Whilst it is always preferable to have direc t evidenc e of fraud, sometimes fraud c an be established by inferenc e if the c irc umstanc es are strong enough. 

112    Dealing with Mdm Ong’s explanations, first, she said that Payments nos 8, 9, 13, 15, 25, 27 and 29 fell into two c ategories. They were either reimbursements to the Direc tors of employees’ wages whic h they had paid in c ash or they were c ash withdrawals whic h the Direc tors had taken from the Company in order to pay wages. In this regard, I note that the Company was a small family run business in the c ontrac ting industry and that it is not unc ommon in this industry to pay workers in c ash espec ially as many may be daily-rated workers. There must, however, surely be some rec ord of the wages paid and rec eipts for them signed by the workers. In any c ase, some of the sums taken seemed far too large to simply be moneys used to pay salaries. 

113    Looking at the table, Payment no 8 was by way of a c ash c heque for $200,000. I find it diffic ult to c onc eive that Mr Leow advanc ed $200,000 for salaries and had no doc umentation to support those payments. There is no evidenc e that the sum represented only one month’s wage bill and it is highly unlikely that Mr Leow paid several months’ wages from his own resourc es and only sought reimbursement when the figure reac hed $200,000. Mdm Ong’s explanation of this payment is therefore inc redible. This c heque was dated 25 August 2003. The next Payment, item no 9, was a c ash c heque for $5,000 dated 26 August 2003. There was no indic ation of what additional salaries Mr Leow had paid between 25 and 26 August 2003 to require him to be reimbursed with a further $5,000 just after he had rec eived $200,000. 

114    Payment no 13 was a c ash c heque for $37,000. This perhaps c ould have represented a payment for salary or overtime, but Mdm Ong did not point to her payroll to c ross-referenc e the wages due. Payment no 15 was a c ash c heque dated 5 Marc h 2004 for $10,000. There was the same lac k of evidenc e in relation to this as in relation to Payment no 13. The next Payment, no 25, was for $12,000 and again lac ked supporting evidenc e. Payments no 27 (5 July 2004) for $1,000 and Payment no 29 (6 August 2004) for $6,000 were for smaller sums but were still not supported by referenc e to the Company’s payroll. In all c ases there was a lac k of supporting doc umentation to show how Mr Leow was being reimbursed for payments he had made for the Company. 


115    Thus, while I ac c ept in princ iple that the Company c ould have advanc ed c ash to Mr Leow to pay wages, it is not possible for me to find that these advanc es were made for wage payments (either as reimbursement for past wages or for c urrent wages) bec ause of the lac k of c orrelation between the amounts taken and wages paid. In addition, it is entirely possible that whilst Mr Leow used some part of the funds for wages, the remainder thereof was applied for other uses whic h were not explained. In all these c irc umstanc es, I find that these Payments have not been substantiated as having been made _bona fide_ for the Company’s business and therefore Payments no 8, 9, 13, 15, 25, 27 and 29 must be repaid by Mr Leow. 

116    On the next set of transac tions, Payments 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 21, 22 and 24, Mdm Ong’s explanation was that these were repayments of loans given by third parties. She named the third parties as being Mr Tan Koon Lec k, Mr Piak Boon Seng and Mr Piak Beng Tec k. Mdm Ong agreed in c ross-examination, however, that there was no evidenc e apart from Mr Leow’s word that the Company had taken loans from these third parties through him. I will deal first with those Payments that were paid into third party ac c ounts. 

117    In respec t of Payment no 2, a c ash c heque for $30,000, the vouc her stated that the payee was Mr Leow and the partic ulars of the payment indic ated that it was “c ash loan return”. The c heque itself was paid into a bank ac c ount in the joint names of Piak Boon Seng and Piak Beng Tec k. Mdm Ong said this c heque was for “money borrowed from them previously and now returned to them”. Payment no 5 was a sum of $10,000 paid by c heque no 567964 on 25 June 2003. The vouc her desc ribed the payee as “c ash – Leow Boon Cher” and the partic ulars were simply “Cash loan return”. However, the bac k of the c heque shows that it was paid into the same ac c ount in the names of both Piak Boon Seng and Piak Beng Tec k as Payment no 2 had been. 

118    In respec t of Payment no 3, a c ash c heque for $30,000 dated 21 June 2003, the vouc her said “payee c ash – Leow Boon Cher” and the partic ulars in the vouc her stated “loan return c ash”. Mdm Ong said this was repayment of a loan extended by Tan Koon Lec k. The ac c ount the c heque was paid into was not an ac c ount belonging to either Direc tor. 

119    Payment no 6 was a c ash c heque for $80,000. The vouc her stated “Payee c ash” and gave no other details. Ac c ording to the bac k of the c heque, it was c ashed by Mr Piak Boon Seng on 20 August 

2003\. On 30 Marc h 2004, Mr Piak Boon Seng was paid $1,000 (Payment no 21) by way of a c ash c heque (no 568350) and on 5 April 2004, he rec eived another $1,000 (Payment no 22) by way of another c ash c heque (no 568354). 

120    In respec t of Payment no 4, a c heque was drawn in favour of Mdm Ong herself for $17,540 but the vouc her said that the payee was “c ash – Leow Boon Cher” and the partic ulars gave the same desc ription as for Payments 2 and 3. Mdm Ong was asked to explain this Payment and her reply was “When I entered them into the ac c ount, so when I – when the money c ame, I’ll put it under Leow Boon Cher, so when the money go out, I also take it from Leow Boon Cher”. She then c onfirmed that this was an instanc e when Mr Leow had borrowed money from her to pay the Company’s expenses and the payment vouc her represented his payment to her. I find this explanation diffic ult to ac c ept. It was open to Mdm Ong to lend money to the Company direc tly and doc umenting it properly would not have been diffic ult sinc e she was in c harge of the ac c ounts. Her explanation seemed c onvoluted and inc redible. 

121    Payment no 18 was a c ash c heque (no 568358) for $1,000. Under “Partic ulars” in the payment vouc her, Mr Leow’s name appeared. There is no indic ation at the bac k of the c heque where the money went so it was probably paid to him in c ash. 


122    There are two Payments whic h were alleged to be repayments of loans made by Aim Top. Payment no 24 was in the sum of $30,000 whic h was paid on 12 April 2004 by way of c heque no 

568359\. Mdm Ong testified that this sum represented a loan from Aim Top whic h was being repaid. However, the vouc her only noted Mr Leow’s name and the bac k of the c heque showed Mdm Ong’s name and NRIC no indic ating that she had c ashed the c heque. When asked to explain this, she said that $1,000 out of the $30,000 was taken by her for use as petty c ash on behalf of the Company and the remaining $29,000 was banked into Aim Top’s ac c ount. This explanation was unbelievable bec ause there was no reason for her to take her petty c ash out of a c ash c heque meant to repay Aim Top and no evidenc e that the money ac tually went to Aim Top. Nor was there any evidenc e of any loan taken from Aim Top notwithstanding that by April 2004, Mdm Ong was working for Aim Top herself. It would therefore have been easy for her to have prepared the nec essary doc umentation. 

123    The other Payment that was said to be repayment of a loan to Aim Top was Payment no 19 in the sum of $9,240 made on 28 Marc h 2004. The vouc her stated “Cash Leow” but the c heque itself was paid into Aim Top’s ac c ount. When Mdm Ong was asked in c ourt how she knew that this money paid to Aim Top was to repay a loan, her answer was “Based on my rec ord”. She then admitted it was a rec ord like the one that she normally wrote down on her draft doc uments and she also agreed that no c opy of that draft was in c ourt. When it was put to her that sinc e the doc ument was not available, there was no way to know that the payment was in respec t of a genuine loan, her answer was diffic ult to understand. She said “First, when it c ome in, it was entered as ‘Mr Leow’ and when it goes out, it’s also entered as ‘Mr Leow’”. It was then put to her that what c ould have happened was that Mr Leow took payment from the Company and used it to fund Aim Top. She did not agree and insisted that it was a repayment of a loan. 

124    I have c onsiderable diffic ulty with these transac tions involving Aim Top. I think, for reasons that are expressed below, that the Company’s transac tions with Aim Top were dubious and that there is no proof that there was any genuine loan that went from Aim Top to the Company. In any c ase, Aim Top was not an independent third party sinc e it was partly owned by Mdm Ong’s mother. I am not satisfied that Payment no 19 was a genuine loan repayment. 

125    In respec t of this set of Payments, I find that nos 4, 18, 19 and 24 have not been properly explained and it has not been established that they were _bona fide_ payments for the use of the Company or the return of moneys borrowed from the Direc tors by the Company. In any c ase, as I mention below, there is a problem of preferenc e in relation to repayment of loans to the Direc tors. These Payments must therefore be returned by the Direc tors. 

126    As regards Payments nos 2, 3, 5, 6, 21 and 22, however, I ac c ept that they were made to third parties. I also ac c ept that they were repayments of loans advanc ed by suc h third parties. The Company was in financ ial diffic ulties and the Direc tors did not have suffic ient resourc es to settle the Company’s debts on their own. The evidenc e showed that the Company did, however, c ontinue to pay its debts from time to time (albeit not all of them and not as they fell due) and in order to do so, it is probable that the Direc tors borrowed money from friendly third parties. Insofar as the evidenc e shows that moneys have been repaid to identified third parties, I am willing to give the Direc tors the benefit of the doubt and hold that suc h repayments were made for the benefit of the Company and in order to help the Direc tors c ontinue to have rec ourse to suc h sourc es of funding from time to time. 

127    The third set of Payments that I will deal with c omprises those that Mdm Ong identified as being c ash payments to sub-c ontrac tors. She stated that she and Mr Leow would pay c ash to the sub-c ontrac tors for work and servic es performed or as repayment of loans whic h they had advanc ed to the Company. She elaborated that this prac tic e of c ash payment had been in effec t sinc e the days of Woon Contrac tor. The Payments in question are nos 11, 17, 26 and 28. 


128    Payment no 11 was the sum of $13,958 paid by c ash c heque 568091 on 2 September 2003. Ac c ording to the bac k of the c heque, the money was rec eived in c ash by one Mr Ong Hoi Lian. The vouc her, however, only stated “Cash Leow”. In c ourt, Mdm Ong identified Mr Ong as a sub-c ontrac tor for the Company and said that she believed his work had “something to do with earth”. She was not able to explain how she knew that Mr Ong was a sub-c ontrac tor though she was quite c ertain that he was. She was not able to identify any invoic e issued by Mr Ong. 

129    Payment no 17 was the sum of $2,500 paid by c ash c heque no 568327 dated 9 Marc h 2004. Mdm Ong explained that she had taken this money bec ause she c ould have paid a portion of this amount for operating expenses of the Company and was reimbursed for suc h payment. This explanation was too vague to provide a c redible basis for holding that the money was spent for the Company’s purposes. 

130    Payment no 26 ($1,500 by c heque no 568462) was paid to Mdm Ong on 1 July 2004 while she rec eived Payment no 28 in the sum of $2,000 by way of c heque no 568475 on 1 August 2004. No explanation was provided for either of these Payments. 

131    I find that the Direc tors must repay Payments nos 17, 26 and 28. As for Payment no 11, I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that this was a _bona fide_ payment in the c ourse of the Company’s business to one of its sub-c ontrac tors. The amount of the Payment, not being a round figure as so many others were, is some indic ation that it was meant to settle an ac tual bill for work done or goods supplied. The rec ipient was not alleged to be one of Mdm Ong’s relatives and I ac c ept her evidenc e that he was a sub-c ontrac tor, although she found it diffic ult to explain how she knew that. Mdm Ong is not a very artic ulate woman but that does not mean that in this instanc e she was not telling the truth. 

132    In her affidavit, Mdm Ong did not offer any explanation for Payments nos 1, 7, 12, 14, 16, 20 and 23. In c ourt, she attempted to remedy the omission. Payment no 1 (vouc her dated 5 May 2003) was a c ash c heque for $8,000. She stated that this amount was paid to Mr Leow and that it was entered in the Direc tors’ ac c ount in the general ledger. That must mean that the Payment was intended as a loan or as a repayment of a previous loan made to the Company by Mr Leow. 

133    Payment no 7 evidenc ed by a vouc her dated 20 August 2003 was in the sum of $2,000 and was made out to UOB Card Centre. Mdm Ong admitted that it was paid to settle Mr Leow’s c redit c ard bill whic h he had inc urred for his personal expenditure. This amount was therefore another loan to Mr Leow. 

134    Payment no 12 was a c ash c heque for $1,500 dated 5 Dec ember 2003. Mdm Ong testified that she did not know into whose ac c ount the money had gone. She was therefore not able to explain this transac tion. It is noted from the vouc her however, that it was made out to Mr Leow, so in all probability the c heque was c ashed by him. In the c ase of Payment no 14, a c heque for $2,000 dated 22 February 2004 was made out in favour of Mr Leow. Mdm Ong said that she did not know what this payment was for. Mdm Ong was also unable to explain adequately Payment no 16 in the sum of $20,000 that was by way of a c heque dated 8 Marc h 2004 in favour of Mr Leow. Whilst Mdm Ong said that it was a reimbursement for her husband’s expenditure, she was unable to rec all what expenditure it related to. 

135    Payments no 20 and 23 were c ash c heques for $1,500 and $2,000 respec tively. They were paid in Marc h and April 2004. Mdm Ong c laimed that they were payments to one Mr Yeo Lai Hee, a c asual worker, meant as reimbursement for c ertain items that he had purc hased on behalf of the Company. She said that the usual proc edure followed in c ases like this would be for the worker to first take c ash 


from her, then use it to buy the items required by the Company and then he would c ome bac k to her with the c ash bills issued by the vendor. With the c ash bill she would issue a c ash vouc her and then enter the item in the c ash book. In this c ase, however, the c ash vouc hers made no referenc e to any item purc hased or any vendor’s bill. Also, the payment vouc hers were made out to Mr Leow and not in the name of Mr Yeo Lai Hee. I am not able to find that these transac tions were _bona fide_ transac tions for the Company. 

136    In the result, Payments nos 1, 7, 12, 14, 16, 20 and 23 must be repaid by the Direc tors. 

137    There is an additional justific ation for my order that the various Payments whic h I have not ac c epted as _bona fide_ must be repaid by the Direc tors. This is that even if the Direc tors had loaned money to the Company whic h the Company was liable to repay them, these Payments c learly c onstituted an unfair preferenc e pursuant to ss 98 – 101 of the Bankruptc y Ac t read with s 329 of the Ac t. The Payments were made during the period of two years between 30 April 2003 and 26 April 2005 when the Company was insolvent. As far as the Payments that I have not ac c epted as genuine are c onc erned, they were paid either to Mdm Ong or Mr Leow (in fac t the majority of them were paid to Mr Leow as Mdm Ong implic itly ac knowledged). Both Direc tors were c learly assoc iates of the Company pursuant to regs 2 and 4 of the CABAR. Further, as Mr Leow and his wife were the c ontrolling and direc ting minds of the Company, they were in a position to, and did, influenc e the Company to give them an unfair preferenc e to put them in a better position in the event of the Company being wound up subsequently. In the absenc e of c redible evidenc e explaining them, the Payments were irregular and c onstituted an unfair preferenc e. 

**Aim Top** 

**_Relationship between the Company, the Directors and Aim Top_** 

138    There were a number of transac tions between Aim Top and the Company that the plaintiffs sought to impugn. In c onnec tion with this overall intention, the plaintiffs made submissions on the relationship between Aim Top and the Company and I will c onsider this issue first before I go on to deal with the individual transac tions. 

139    The plaintiffs submitted that Aim Top was set up to be the Company’s suc c essor and to divert the Company’s business and assets away from the Company and out of the reac h of its c reditors. The Direc tors and Aim Top vehemently denied this allegation and c ontended that sinc e the plaintiffs had not pleaded this in the statement of c laim, they should not be able to rely on any suc h assertion. While it is true that the plaintiffs did not plead that Aim Top was set up to be the Company’s suc c essor, I ac c ept the plaintiffs’ submission that this was not a nec essary pleading as the statement of c laim c ontained many assertions of irregularity in the dealings between the Company and Aim Top and these irregularities were the foundation of the plaintiffs’ c laim that the transac tions between Aim Top and the Company should be set aside. The plaintiffs’ allegation that Aim Top was set up by the Direc tors would, if proved, establish the c ontext in whic h the _bona fides_ of transac tions between Aim Top and the Company have to be determined but does not in itself dic tate how the issue of whether eac h suc h transac tion was a genuine one must be resolved. 

140    As stated above, Aim Top was inc orporated on 9 September 2003, by whic h time the Company was c learly insolvent. The two persons responsible for the inc orporation of Aim Top were c losely c onnec ted with the Direc tors: to reiterate, Mdm Chiew is the mother of Mdm Ong and Mr Chiow had been the Company’s loyal employee for 13 years prior to the establishment of Aim Top. Mr Chiow was the only person from Aim Top who gave evidenc e as to the c irc umstanc es in whic h his c ompany was inc orporated and the way in whic h it had dealt with the Direc tors and the Company. 


141    Mr Chiow did not c ome ac ross as a c anny and experienc ed businessman. He testified that he had never inc orporated any c ompany before Aim Top and that his purpose in setting it up in September 2003 was so that he c ould “be a boss”. Mr Chiow further c laimed that Mdm Chiew had asked him to set up Aim Top with her for the benefit of her eldest son, Ong Eng Hian (“OEH”). When it was put to him that if OEH ran the c ompany, he would not be the boss, he replied rather philosophic ally that he was “still half a boss”. Further questioning elic ited that prior to the establishment of Aim Top Mr Chiow and OEH had never met, and that they only met twic e in the c ontext of setting up the c ompany. The evidenc e also showed that thereafter OEH had not worked for Aim Top at all despite apparently having been intended as the main benefic iary of that business. Mdm Ong herself testified that her brother OEH had never shown any interest in leaving his oc c upation as a stoc kbroker to enter the c onstruc tion industry. 

142    Mr Chiow was questioned extensively about his relationship with Mdm Chiew. At first, Mr Chiow c laimed that he had “known her for many years” prior to September 2003. However, when quizzed as to how he had c ome to know Mdm Chiew, Mr Chiow said he did not remember. When questioned as to how often he had met Mdm Chiew prior to starting Aim Top, his answer was that he did not remember this either, but it was probably onc e every few months or onc e a year. When c ounsel for the plaintiffs asked Mr Chiow when he would meet her, the reply was that it would be on his “rest day”. However, when pressed further as to whether he visited Mdm Chiew, he answered that he would “bump into her oc c asionally ... [but] won’t intentionally go visit her”. This evidenc e that he would only run into Mdm Chiew by c hanc e was c learly c ontradic tory to and inc onsistent with previous testimony as Mr Chiow had initially given the impression that he would meet up with Mdm Chiew on his off days. In fac t, Mr Chiow c laimed, rather inc redibly, that it was on an oc c asion when he ac c identally bumped into Mdm Chiew and they started talking that she broac hed the subjec t of the two of them starting a c ompany together. 

143    In his affidavit, Mr Chiow had said that one of the reasons he left the Company to set up Aim Top was that on a few oc c asions the Company had delayed paying his salary. When questioned as to how often the payment had been delayed, his initial reply was that it might have happened two or three times but that he c ould not remember c learly. Later, when he was asked why he had never brought this issue up to the Direc tors, he replied that he was used to suc h delays as they happened “all the time”. He then c hanged his testimony to say that he c ould not remember on how many oc c asions the Company had been late in paying his salary. Mr Chiow’s evidenc e on this point was not supported by the Company’s c ash book whic h indic ated that he was paid on time every month. When shown these entries, Mr Chiow c laimed that the rec ords in the c ash book were not c orrec t bec ause the Direc tors had forgotten to pay him and that he was used to getting his pay one week after the due date. He also asserted that he did not dare to c omplain about the late payment as suc h delays did not happen every year and sometimes the delays would be for only a few days. There is muc h substanc e in the plaintiffs’ submission that Mr Chiow’s c onfused and c onstantly c hanging testimony about the alleged delay in payment shows that he was not telling the truth about it. 

144    The plaintiffs also raised doubts about Mdm Chiew’s partic ipation in Aim Top. She was in her 60s when the c ompany was inc orporated and was a housewife. She had not had any formal educ ation, had never been in formal employment and c ould only read and write simple Chinese c harac ters. Her daughter testified that Mdm Chiew had never told her prior to September 2003 of any desire to go into the c onstruc tion business or to start a c ompany. It was odd that Mr Chiow who had never been in business for himself would want to start a new venture with someone even less experienc ed in business. Mr Chiow said he had got to know Mdm Chiew well when they were neighbours living in Old Tampines Road. The verac ity of this evidenc e was thrown into doubt subsequently when OES, another son of Mdm Chiew, testified that Mr Chiow had not been their neighbour when the family lived in Old Tampines Road. 


145    It is hard to understand why Mr Chiow and Mdm Chiew would go into business together in September 2003. Apart from the unlikelihood of their being good friends due to the differenc es in age and oc c upation, it is baffling that Mdm Chiew would suddenly approac h her daughter’s employee to s t a rt up a c ompany for her eldest son who was a stoc kbroker and showed no interest in the c onstruc tion business whatsoever. There was no hint that OEH had any financ ial or other reason to want to c hange his oc c upation and he himself did not c ome forward to c orroborate Mr Chiew’s assertions. 

146    There were other diffic ulties in ac c epting Aim Top as independent of the Direc tors. Firstly, as disc ussed above, Mr Chiew was unable to give a c oherent reason for leaving the Company and setting up his own business. Sec ondly, he had admitted that he did not know muc h about inc orporating a c ompany but c laimed that he had found an auditor who “someone” had rec ommended to him. Further questioning revealed that this “someone” was Mdm Ong. I find it diffic ult to believe that Mdm Ong would help an employee of hers leave her employ in order to set up a c ompany whic h would c ompete with the Company unless the Direc tors had something to gain from this endeavour. 

147    The third diffic ulty is that Mr Chiow admitted that he had “not c ome up with a single c ent” of Aim Top’s paid up c apital of $100,000 and that the entire sum had been paid by Mdm Chiew. The problem with this testimony is that there was no evidenc e that Mdm Chiew on her own had the resourc es to fund Aim Top to the tune of $100,000. Mdm Ong’s testimony was that her mother had never worked outside the home before Aim Top was inc orporated and that she had no sourc e of inc ome. In suc h a situation, any savings that Mdm Chiew had would be prec ious and it would be unlikely that she would spend a substantial sum on a c ompany that was going to be run by someone like Mr Chiow who had no trac k rec ord at all in the business. In any c ase, with a husband and another son already in business and familiar with the c onstruc tion industry, it is extremely odd that she would turn to an outsider for help. 

148    Fourthly, there was a very c lose manpower c onnec tion between Aim Top and the Company. Aim Top’s first employee was one Chng Nyee Ming, who had also worked for the Company prior to joining Aim Top. When asked if he thought poac hing employees from the Company would make the Direc tors unhappy, Mr Chiow replied that he did not c are. Subsequently, Mr Chiow employed other persons who had worked for the Company inc luding another brother of Mdm Ong. In 2006 to 2007, Aim Top formally employed Mr Leow and Mdm Ong themselves but even before then, the evidenc e showed that they had been working for Aim Top on a freelanc e basis. The plaintiffs argued that the movement of employees from the Company to Aim Top strongly supports the inferenc e that Aim Top was set up as a suc c essor to the Company. 

149    Mdm Ong c laimed that she only started formal employment with Aim Top in 2006. Mr Chiow, however, testified that Mdm Ong had applied for permits for foreign workers on Aim Top’s behalf. Although he did not say so, this must have been done long before 2006 as shortly after Aim Top was formed, it was awarded a c onstruc tion projec t and needed workers for that. Further, during c rossexamination, Mdm Ong admitted that she had advised Mr Chiow on an informal basis before 2006. She said that she had helped Aim Top with “administrative work” shortly after its inc orporation. She had also prepared c ash vouc hers for the payment of wages to Aim Top’s workers during “most months”. She also admitted that from the time of Aim Top’s inc orporation, she had prepared payment vouc hers for Aim Top’s payments to its sub-c ontrac tors. Whilst Mdm Ong herself denied doing the ac c ounts for Aim Top, Mr Chiow subsequently stated that Mdm Ong had handled at least some of Aim Top’s dayto-day ac c ounts from shortly after Aim Top was inc orporated. He c onfirmed that amongst other work, Mdm Ong would prepare Aim Top’s invoic es and rec eive a rec ord of Aim Top’s daily expenses onc e every two weeks. 


150    There was also evidenc e as to c ertain ac tivities that Mr Leow himself had undertaken on behalf of Aim Top after its inc orporation. His initial evidenc e was that he was only formally employed by Aim Top as a manager between September 2007 and about July 2009. However, Mr Chiow had said in an interview in June 2006 that Mr Leow was then helping Aim Top on a freelanc e basis. When Mr Leow was shown the transc ript of this interview, he c hanged his evidenc e and said that he had helped Mr Chiow to make submissions for payment on c onstruc tion projec ts and also to supervise sites when Mr Chiow lac ked manpower. Mr Chiow’s subsequent evidenc e in c ourt was that Mr Leow had been formally employed by Aim Top during two periods in 2006 and 2008 and that even before his first formal employment in 2006 he had prepared doc uments for Aim Top on freelanc e basis. The evidenc e therefore indic ates that Mr Leow did work for Aim Top from least 2006. 

151    The fifth indic ation that Aim Top was muc h more c losely c onnec ted to the Company and the Direc tors than they wanted to admit c onsisted of evidenc e that the Company made payments to subc ontrac tors on Aim Top’s behalf from shortly after its inc orporation. In or about February 2004, the Company paid Antah to deliver equipment to a site in St Mic hael’s Road. Both the Direc tors testified that the Company did not have a projec t there but Mr Chiow c onfirmed that Aim Top had rec eived delivery of equipment from Antah at its St Mic hael’s Road site. He explained that Mr Leow had borrowed some of this equipment for the Company’s own projec t at Punggol and had subsequently lent it to Aim Top. There was also some indic ation that the Company may have paid an entity known as Yong Kiat Heng (“YKH”) for transportation of earth from the St Mic hael’s Road site. Mr Chiow admitted that YKH had c arried out earth removal works for Aim Top at that site but he c ould not remember rec eiving any c laim for payment from YKH. The plaintiffs suggested that this indic ated that the Company had paid YKH. 

152    The plaintiffs also submitted that the evidenc e showed that Aim Top had taken over the Company’s last major sub-c ontrac t with China Construc tion (South Pac ific ) Development Co Pte Ltd (“China Construc tion”) in relation to a site known as MUP 17 in the Bendemeer Road area. It does appear to me that the c irc umstanc es in whic h Aim Top bec ame the sub-c ontrac tor for this projec t were suspec t. The c ontrac t between Aim Top and China Construc tion was dated 15 April 2004 but stated that the date of c ommenc ement of the works was 25 April 2003, a date four months before Aim Top was inc orporated. As an indic ation that the c ommenc ement date was not an error, the sc hedule of rates referred to in the c ontrac t was dated 15 April 2003. It is unlikely that the date would have been typed wrongly twic e though this was Mr Leow’s explanation for it. Mr Chiow when pressed on the doc ument said that he had signed a “brand new c ontrac t” but was forc ed to admit that “work for the projec t had c ommenc ed earlier”. The most plausible explanation for this disc repanc y would be that the Company was the initial c ounterparty to the c ontrac t with China Construc tion but that Aim Top took over from the Company in name only. Mr Leow admitted in c ourt that Aim Top had stepped into the shoes of the Company but maintained that China Construc tion was entitled to use its own disc retion to c hoose whic hever c ontrac tor it wanted to work with and was not restric ted to the Company. In April 2004, by whic h time the works would have been underway for at least a year, there was no reason for the Company whic h desperately needed work to voluntarily step aside and give up a good c ontrac t to Aim Top. It seems to me that the plaintiffs’ suspic ions were well plac ed. 

153    In view of all the evidenc e c onnec ting Aim Top and the Direc tors, I find on a balanc e of probability that the Direc tors did set up Aim Top with a view to it taking over the business and staff of the Company when the same was no longer able to c ontinue due to its indebtedness. This does not mean, however, that all the transac tions between Aim Top and the Company must nec essarily be set aside. As Aim Top’s solic itors pointed out, the transfer of assets from the Company to Aim Top c ould still have been legitimate as long as the Company rec eived good c onsideration for the transfer. I now turn to c onsider the individual transac tions whic h c omprise the following: 


### Q A Q A Q A Q A Q A 

 (a) the sale and lease-bac k of one 10-tonne lorry; 

 (b) the lease of exc avators; and 

 (c ) Payments totalling $4,888 made to Aim Top between 17 February 2004 and 20 June 2004. 

**_Sale and lease-back of the 10-tonne lorry_** 

154    The Company sold a 10-tonne lorry to Aim Top on 1 Oc tober 2003 at the pric e of $37,440. Thereafter, the Company leased the lorry bac k from Aim Top from November 2003 to April 2004. Over that period, a total sum of $27,200 was paid as rental to Aim Top. The plaintiffs c laimed that the sale and subsequent lease-bac k of the lorry were sham transac tions meant to plac e the lorry out of reac h of the Company’s c reditors and to enric h Aim Top and that the rental of $27,200 should be refunded. 

155    The Direc tors’ c ase was that they sold the lorry in Oc tober 2003 as the Company did not require the use of the lorry then, but that they had to subsequently lease it bac k when business pic ked up. 

156    It is undisputed that the Company owned only one 10-tonne lorry between April 2003 and April 

2004\. Ac c ording to Mr Leow, this lorry was leased to China Construc tion between June 2003 and September 2003. However, the invoic es issued by the Company to China Construc tion showed that the lease of the lorry to the latter c ontinued from Oc tober 2003 to April 2004 despite its sale to Aim Top. Thus, it appears that Mdm Ong’s assertion that the lorry was sold to Aim Top bec ause the Company did not require it was not true. 

157    Mr Leow’s evidenc e during c ross-examination did not serve to c larify matters. When asked to c larify the rationale for the sale of the lorry, this was what transpired: 

 Who dec ided to sell the lorry? 

 I dec ided. 

 So the reason for selling the lorry must be yours, not [Mdm Ong’s], c orrec t? 

 Yes. 

 So she would not know the reason unless you told her? 

 It’s suc h a long time ago, I c an’t remember whether I did tell her. 

 ... 

 The only way she c ould state a reason for wanting to sell the lorry is for her to have heard the reason from you. 

 I c annot answer your question. 

 You c annot or you do not want to? 

 Bec ause I don’t know how to answer you. ... I’m unable to answer you. 


### Q A Q A Q A Q A 

158    The fac t that Mr Leow c ould not answer a simple question honestly without wavering or being evasive, speaks volumes as to his lac k of c redibility as a witness. In addition, when asked as to where he obtained a lorry to lease to China Construc tion in Oc tober 2003, sinc e he had sold Woon Contrac tor’s lorry and had not leased it bac k then, Mr Leow replied: 

 You sold it on 1st Oc tober 03 and only leased it bac k for the month of November 03. But we know that you c ontinued to lease the lorry to China Con in the month of Oc tober. Where did you get the lorry from? 

 I don’t only lease my lorry from Aim Top. I [also] lease it from elsewhere. 

 From who? 

 Yew San, CK. 

 ... 

 ... I c an tell you that there’s absolutely no evidenc e in the c ompany’s ac c ounts that you rented a similar lorry from somebody else in Oc tober 03. 

 I did not say it was in Oc tober that month. It was so long ago. 

 ... 

 My question was: Who did you rent a lorry from in Oc tober 2003 in order to lease a lorry to China Construc tion for that month? 

 I did rent from Aim Top, if my memory serves me right. 

159    The c irc umstanc es of the sale and lease-bac k of the lorry bec ame even more suspic ious as Aim Top had also hired the lorry driver from the Company in November 2003. However, as the lorry was leased bac k to the Company that same month, Aim Top and the Company had a c onvoluted agreement under whic h the driver would be hired by Aim Top, but would, for all intents and purposes, be doing work for the Company. As events turned out, however, the driver was still paid by the Company until at least January 2004 despite his having been employed by Aim Top from November 2003. 

160    Further, the plaintiffs c laimed that Aim Top’s purc hase of the lorry was in essenc e funded by Mdm Ong. In Oc tober 2003, two large withdrawals from Mdm Ong’s bank ac c ount were made, totalling $37,000, leaving only $790 in the ac c ount. It is the plaintiffs’ c ase that this money was used to pay for the lorry. They thought it suspic ious that despite suc h a large amount of money being withdrawn from her ac c ount, Mdm Ong c laimed in c ourt to be unable to remember what it was for. 

161    In response, Aim Top and the Direc tors asserted that the equipment leases to Aim Top were not sham transac tions and were legitimate as the Company had rec eived good c onsideration for the transfer. They c laimed that there was no evidenc e of dishonesty or misrepresentation on the part of Mr Leow or Mdm Ong. Further, there were no personal advantages to be gained by the Direc tors from the transac tions. They also c laimed that the Direc tors had been providing financ ial support to the Company in amounts that far exc eeded the total amount of the impugned transac tions. As suc h, they submitted that it was illogic al to c ontend that the Direc tors would c onspire to defraud the Company. 


162    In addition, Aim Top argued that the sale of the 10-tonne lorry was justifiable as it improved the Company’s c ash flow. The Company obtained a good pric e from the sale of the lorry as it was sold at or above market pric e. Further, Aim Top c laimed that by selling the lorry, the Company had raised c ash to pay off its debts to other c reditors and to enable it to still fulfil its c ontrac tual obligations to China Construc tion by renting another lorry for that purpose. 

163    The diffic ulty with this argument, however, is that Mr Leow was unable to spec ify where he had obtained the additional lorry to fulfil the China Construc tion c ontrac t from. It did not assist matters that Mr Leow’s evidenc e was inc onsistent and wavering, as noted above. There is a c oinc idenc e between the amount of money withdrawn from Mdm Ong’s ac c ount ($37,000) on 2 Oc tober 2003 and the amount whic h Aim Top had paid the Company for the lorry ($37,440) the very next day. There was no evidenc e of any withdrawals of similar amounts from the ac c ounts of either Mr Chiow or Mdm Chiew. Mr Chiow c ontended that Aim Top had paid for the lorry using its paid-up c apital and borrowings from his friends. He had to c onc ede, however, that the paid-up c apital was insuffic ient to fund all Aim Top’s purc hases. As regards the alleged borrowings from his friends, these were bare assertions without any supporting evidenc e. 

164    I find it highly plausible that Mdm Ong had funded the purc hase of the lorry. In view of this and of the other suspic ious c irc umstanc es whic h I have listed above, the sale and lease-bac k of the 10tonne lorry was, in all probability, not a _bona fide_ transac tion but a fraudulent one designed to remove the lorry from the c lutc hes of the Company’s c reditors. Ac c ordingly, the sale and lease-bac k must be set aside and the sum of $27,200 repaid by Aim Top. 

**_Lease of PC200 excavator with breaker from Aim Top_** 

165    In Dec ember 2003, the Company leased a PC200 exc avator with breaker from Aim Top. Both the Company and Aim Top said that the Company required a PC200 with breaker whic h Aim Top owned but did not require. On the other hand, the Company possessed a PC200 exc avator without a breaker, whic h Aim Top needed. Thus there was an exc hange of the equipment, with eac h c ompany paying rent to the other. However, as the rental for the PC200 with breaker was higher, the Company paid Aim Top more money than it rec eived. The plaintiffs c laim repayment of $7,280. 

166    In c ourt, however, Mr Leow c ould not explain c oherently why he required the exc avator with a breaker. He gave general answers suc h as that he needed to use it for “defec t work” as well as for “tidying up” of the Fernvale Projec t. These seemed improbable as the Fernvale site was handed over to the HDB three months before the exc avator with a breaker was hired. In addition, Mr Chiow’s testimony on the exc hange of exc avators was c ontradic tory. He had, at first, admitted that one of the piec es of equipment he had purc hased from the Company was an exc avator with a breaker. However, when asked if this was the same exc avator with a breaker that he leased to the Company, he c laimed that it was a different one whic h he had purc hased. Shortly afterwards, Mr Chiow said that he had “rented the exc avator whic h [he] leased to Woon from someone else”. Later, Mr Chiow stated that he had only bought an exc avator without a breaker from Woon Contrac tor. However, when c onfronted with the invoic e from Woon Contrac tor that showed that Mr Chiow had purc hased an exc avator with a breaker for $62,400, Mr Chiow admitted that he “c an’t not ac c ept” this fac t and ac c epted it. He then stated that he had rented another exc avator with a breaker from a third party, but had no use for it, and therefore he leased it to the Company. Shortly after however, Mr Chiow c laimed that he had only rented a breaker, and not an exc avator with a breaker. 

167    The plaintiffs argued that the inability of Mr Chiow and Mr Leow to give c lear evidenc e on the exc avator issue was due to the fac t that they were trying to c over up this sham transac tion, and their lies c ould not add up. I agree. I find that the purported lease was a sham transac tion whic h was 


used to c hannel the Company’s funds to Aim Top and that the $7,280 paid must be refunded. 

168    A related transac tion between the Company and Aim Top that the plaintiffs sought to impugn was the payment by the Company of $312 for an exc avator operator that Aim Top had allegedly provided to the Company. This operator was provided to operate the exc avator with a breaker that the Company had purported leased from Aim Top. Sinc e I have held that the lease was a sham transac tion, the provision of the operator was equally fraudulent and the sum of $312 would have to be reimbursed to the Company. 

**_Payments totalling $4,888 made to Aim Top_** 

169    The plaintiffs sought to impugn payments made to Aim Top for the provision of the servic es of one Lailin Wissanu, a labourer ($26.78), and one Tee Chin Thian, a lorry driver ($4,576). Ac c ording to Aim Top’s invoic e, these amounts were c harged for the provision of the two men’s servic es in Dec ember 2003. The plaintiffs’ c ase was that both these men were still paid employees of the Company as of 4 January 2004 and this was admitted by both Mr Leow and Mdm Ong. Aim Top was not justified in c harging the Company for providing it with the servic es of the Company’s own employees. 

170    Neither Mr Leow nor Mdm Ong c ould explain why the Company had made these payments to Aim Top. It even took Mr Leow some minutes to c onfirm that Mr Wissanu had onc e been the Company’s employee and had later left it to join Aim Top. Mr Leow tried to distanc e himself from the transac tions, c laiming that Mdm Ong prepared the payment vouc hers. However, when c onfronted with the fac t that the payment vouc hers would only have been prepared upon his instruc tions as he was the person dealing with Aim Top, Mr Leow c onveniently c laimed that he c ould not rec all the matter. 

171    Aim Top argued that the provision of workers suc h as labourers, drivers and exc avator operators by the Company to Aim Top was done on an _ad hoc_ basis and was effec ted by oral agreements. The defendants argued that Mr Kon had c onc eded that small-sc ale sub-c ontrac tors were often not given to keeping and filing doc uments, and as suc h, there was nothing out of the ordinary in the informal way in whic h Aim Top had provided the Company with the servic es of its workers. In this c ase, however, Aim Top did not appear to be one of those c ompanies that hardly kept any doc uments sinc e it had produc ed a lot of doc uments in the c ourse of the proc eedings. These doc uments were all c ontrac tual doc uments. So I do not find muc h substanc e in Aim Top’s argument seeking to exc use the lac k of doc umentation for the transac tions c onc erned. 

172    Additionally, Aim Top alleged that the plaintiffs were wrong in asserting that Tee Chin Tian was an employee of the Company in Dec ember 2003 as it had been established by Mdm Ong’s evidenc e that he had left the employment of the Company after Oc tober 2003. It is diffic ult, however, to ac c ept Mdm Ong’s word for this sinc e her c redibility as a witness was shaken numerous times during the c ourse of the proc eedings. Further, when she was questioned by the c ourt as to why, if Tee Chin Tian was not employed by Woon Contrac tor in November 2003, he was being paid overtime by the Company in Dec ember 2003, Mdm Ong’s reply was “I don’t know”. Sinc e Mdm Ong was not able to provide a believable answer to that question, it is hard to ac c ept as true her evidenc e that Tee Chin Tian’s employment with the Company c eased at the end of Oc tober 2003. In any c ase, the reason why Tee Chin Tian’s servic es were allegedly being provided by Aim Top to the Company was in order that he c ould drive the lorry the Company had allegedly sold to Aim Top. Sinc e that sale was a sham, it is likely that no real transfer of Tee Chin Tian’s employment to Aim Top took plac e. 

173    On the whole of the evidenc e, I have c ome to the c onc lusion that these transac tions must be impugned and the sum of $4,888 should be repaid to the Company. 


174    Aim Top did make the argument that the liquidators c hose not to impugn c ertain other transac tions between the Company and Aim Top even though there were no formal doc uments supporting those transac tions. The implic ation was that sinc e the liquidators had ac c epted in relation to these unquestioned transac tions, that the absenc e of formal doc umentation did not affec t the genuine quality of the same, they should also ac c ept that the impugned transac tions were genuine. In relation to the impugned transac tions, this argument is not persuasive bec ause of the quantity of evidenc e c asting doubt on the authentic ity of the transac tions. 

**_Fraudulent preference_** 

175    The plaintiffs also mounted an alternative c laim for repayment from Aim Top on the basis that the amounts paid by the Company to Aim Top c onstituted an unfair preferenc e. The material fac ts they relied on were that the payments were made within the period of two years prior to the c ommenc ement of the winding up proc eedings and were made when the Company was insolvent. Further, Aim Top was an assoc iate of the Company bec ause of Mdm Ong’s relationship with Mdm Chiew. As suc h, the plaintiffs argued, there was a presumption that the Company was influenc ed to give Aim Top an unfair preferenc e to put it in a better position in the event the Company was wound up. I note that argument and must add that sinc e I have found that the Direc tors set up Aim Top with the intention of transferring the business of the Company to it, there is added weight to the presumption of undue influenc e. The c onnec tion between the Direc tors and Aim Top is even stronger for that purpose than the c onnec tion between Mdm Chiew and Mdm Ong. 

176    Aim Top argued that the unfair preferenc e allegation c ould not stand bec ause, _inter alia_ , the payments were made in the Company’s ordinary or established c ourse of business, the Company also made payments to other c reditors and in making payments to Aim Top, the Company was solely influenc ed by c ommerc ial c onsiderations in giving the preferenc e. 

177    I have to deal with this allegation on the basis that I was wrong in my finding that the transac tions were sham transac tions. If the transac tions were not sham transac tions, then I must ac c ept the evidenc e that the lorry, exc avator and employees were being provided by Aim Top to the Company so that the Company c ould c arry on business and meet its c ontrac tual obligations. What Aim Top wishes me to hold is that if the Company had failed to pay it the rentals and other hire c harges, then Aim Top would have withdrawn the servic es and the Company would not have been able to c arry out its work. Therefore, its argument was that the payments were not influenc ed by an intention to prefer Aim Top but instead, were payments made for c lear c ommerc ial c onsiderations. I think this argument must be rejec ted. Although Aim Top may have provided servic es that the Company needed for its business, the presumption that it rather than other c reditors was paid bec ause of the c onnec tion between it and the Direc tors c annot be so easily rebutted in the light of the ties between the two c ompanies. In paying Aim Top, the Direc tors were paying a business whic h was a front for them and whic h they wanted to establish as a firm in the c onstruc tion industry. It was in their own interests to employ Aim Top and to pay its bills promptly. I think, on the basis of all the evidenc e before me, I am entitled to hold that in fac t (and not only by way of presumption) there was an intention on the part of the Direc tors to put Aim Top in a better position than other c reditors. Therefore, the payments to Aim Top must be set aside on this ground too. 

**Antah** 

178    While Antah has the same registered address as Aim Top, it is a business that has been in existenc e for more than 30 years. It is a partnership firm in whic h the partners are Mdm Ong’s father and one of her brothers. It is in the business of supplying transportation servic es to c ompanies in the c onstruc tion industry. In the c ourse of proc eedings, Antah produc ed many invoic es for transportation 


servic es provided to the Company in 2001, 2003 and 2004. It also produc ed invoic es showing that it had c arried out similar jobs for other c ustomers. Antah did a great deal of work for the Company as reflec ted by the issue of 30 invoic es in 2003 and eight invoic es in the first quarter of 2004. 

179    The plaintiffs sought to impugn payments made by the Company to Antah in 2003 and 2004. They attac ked the payments in two ways. First, in respec t of two of the 2003 invoic es, the plaintiffs alleged that the transac tions those invoic es reflec ted were shams and had been used to siphon money away from the Company. Sec ond, the plaintiffs asserted that even if the invoic es were genuine, the payments made under them were fraudulent preferenc es and that the same was true for other payments totalling $3,540 between 7 Marc h 2003 and 24 August 2003 and totalling $3,160 between May 2004 and September 2004. 

180    The allegedly sham transac tions were reflec ted in two invoic es: 

 (a) Invoic e no. 30907 for the period Jan 2003 – June 2003 (dated 31 July 2003) for $35,000; and 

 (b) Invoic e no. 31061 for the period July – August 2003 (dated 31 August 2003) for $6,000. 

The invoic es stated that the amounts c harged were due for the “supply [of ] lorry, c rane, trailer, transport for working at various site[s]”. There was only one delivery order issued by Antah for the periods c overed by both invoic es. The plaintiffs alleged that these invoic es were entirely different from Antah’s regular billing prac tic es. To distinguish these invoic es from others, I will refer to them as “the lump-sum invoic es”. 

181    The plaintiffs had two major problems with the lump-sum invoic es. First, most of the invoic es that Antah rendered both to the Company and to other c ustomers were in respec t of the provision of transport servic es for individual and distinc t jobs. For example, under invoic e 31180 dated 29 September 2003, Antah billed the Company $60 for supplying a lorry c rane to lift “4 pc s U drain” at a site in Jalan Kayu and a further $60 to supply the lorry c rane to deliver equipment from Jalan Kayu site to Blk 36 Bendemeer Road. Suc h job desc riptions were typic al. The plaintiffs alleged that Antah was not in the prac tic e of billing its c ustomers a lump-sum amount at the end of a work period of several months duration. 

182    The Direc tors and OES, the fifth defendant and a partner of Antah, were asked on the stand to explain the differenc e between the lump-sum invoic es and other invoic es issued by Antah. Their response was that the differenc e c ould be explained as the invoic es issued for the other jobs were for transportation from one c onstruc tion site to another. The lump-sum invoic es were for transportation within a site when the lorry and other equipment had been provided on a daily basis and had stood by for several hours on site in order to provide servic es as and when required. When Mr Leow gave this evidenc e, he was shown other invoic es from Antah that indic ated that on other oc c asions, c harges were made on an hourly basis for transportation within a site. 

183    When asked why the amounts that the other invoic es were made out for were “figures of several hundred dollars at the most eac h time” but one of the lump-sum invoic es was for $35,000, Mr Leow c laimed that: 

 this one is meant for Fernvale as well as Seng Kang East and West projec t, so it’s a muc h larger site. So those [other] invoic es ... perhaps it’s only for a few days of work ... Antah may have made mistakes in respec t of the c laims. 


The plaintiffs argued that this evidenc e should not be ac c epted as it was hard to c onc eive that for the same servic e, Antah would c harge suc h varying fees for different c ompanies, even if there was a differenc e in the size of the site. They further argued that even if the differenc e in the size of the work site was a fac tor that c ontributed to the inc reased fees, the defendants ought to have produc ed evidenc e of the breakdown of Antah’s c harges, inc luding the number of hours during whic h Antah had provided servic es, and the exac t sizes of the Fernvale and Seng Kang sites. 

184    Mr Leow c laimed that the figure of $35,000 was obtained from the time c ards whic h were used to rec ord the number of hours during whic h work was performed by Antah on the Company’s sites. Mdm Ong testified that there was one time c ard for eac h month, making a total of six time c ards for the six months whic h the Company was billed for. Mdm Ong also testified that eac h vehic le would have its own time c ard. As suc h, there ought to have been one time c ard for eac h of the three vehic les, over a period of six months, whic h would result in 18 time c ards. During Mdm Ong’s c rossexamination, at first she c onfirmed that she had only c hec ked six c ards but subsequently she admitted that she had never c hec ked any c ard at all. When asked why she had given a different reply earlier, her response was that she c ould not rec all what had ac tually happened at that time. 

185    The evidenc e given by OES was slightly different. He admitted that Antah’s usual prac tic e for work done within a site was to bill for eac h day and that the billing was on a per-hour basis. He also admitted that in suc h c ases, Antah usually billed the c ustomer for eac h day of work and did not send it a lump sum bill at the end of the month. He agreed that the prac tic e of totalling up the number of days and c harging in one lump sum was a one-off prac tic e that was only c arried out for the Company. In addition, OES’s testimony as to the time c ards c ontradic ted that of Mdm Ong. Having admitted that it was easier if there was a time c ard for eac h vehic le, rather than one time c ard for four different vehic les, he said that it was only for this partic ular transac tion that Antah had used time c ards. Previously Antah had used delivery orders in relation to its transportation servic es. OES c ould not explain why he had used time c ards in this instanc e, saying he was “not very sure”. The plaintiffs suggested that OES had only testified that time c ards existed in this c ase in order to c orroborate his sister’s evidenc e. 

186    The sec ond suspic ious matter that the plaintiffs highlighted was that the lump-sum invoic es inc luded c harges for the provision of a trailer. They c onsidered that this was odd sinc e Antah did not own a trailer. OES testified that it was probably hired from a sub-c ontrac tor. The plaintiffs doubted the truth of this answer bec ause OES c ould not remember the amount of hire c harges and this was the first time Antah had supplied a trailer. Further, no doc umentary evidenc e was produc ed of the lease or the payments made for the trailer. 

187    On the other hand, Antah took the position that the lump-sum invoic es were entirely legitimate. These were not the only transportation servic es whic h Antah had provided to the Company during the period between January 2003 and August 2003 but only some of them. These were transportation servic es whic h took plac e internally within sites oc c upied by the Company whereas the other servic es whic h had not been questioned took plac e at the same time but related to transportation servic es whic h involved moving material out of or into a site. The lump-sum invoic es had been produc ed bec ause the internal site servic es provided had been separated from the external trips. 

188    Antah argued that what the plaintiffs were trying to do was to establish a quasi-c riminal c onspirac y between the Direc tors, OES and OKY to steal from the Company by fabric ating a c ommerc ial transac tion and c reating bonus doc umentation to c over their trac ks. This was a serious allegation of fraud and the c ourt should require a high standard of proof, in fac t it should demand that the plaintiffs produc e direc t evidenc e of the fabric ation. In this c ase, sinc e the transportation 


servic es took plac e at the c onstruc tion site, witnesses from the owner of the site or from one of the other sub-c ontrac tors or from the sec urity c ompany guarding the site c ould have been c alled to testify as to whether equipment belonging to Antah had been on site during that period or to state their rec ollec tion as to who was responsible for transportation within the site. Alternatively, the plaintiffs c ould have sought disc overy from the owners of the site of any rec ords they may have had of the vehic les present on the site during the material period. 

189    Antah pointed out that no suc h evidenc e had been tendered by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs had not even given positive c irc umstantial evidenc e of the alleged fabric ation, suc h as evidenc e that the lorry c rane was at the workshop or that the work site was c losed on the day when work was alleged to have been done by Antah. Instead, the plaintiffs’ c ase was entirely negative. It was premised on pointing out alleged inc onsistenc ies in the defendants’ explanations of the transport servic es and the supporting doc umentation. The plaintiffs appeared to believe that Antah must be regarded as guilty until it proved itself innoc ent. 

190    Further, it was rational for Antah to have two types of billing prac tic es to deal with the differenc e servic es it provided. Most of the bills related to spec ific transport jobs from a worksite to a spec ified external site and were c harged on a trip basis. This type of servic e was duly reflec ted in the c orresponding delivery order. On the other hand, the lump-sum invoic es were for jobs within a site in whic h Antah’s vehic les and drivers were simply left at the site for the day and would be at the disposal of the Company when it required to move things around the site. This servic e required a different system of billing. With a spec ified job to move something from point A to point B, billing would have to be c alc ulated based on distanc e and weight whereas for a general job to provide servic es within site, it was not possible to measure distanc e or weight, so an hourly or daily rate was proposed. Antah pointed out that during their c ross-examination, the plaintiffs did not c hallenge that it was rational to have a different system in this c ase. 

191    Antah did not agree that the oral evidenc e had been evasive and inc redible. First, as far as Mr Leow was c onc erned, it was not right to ask him to explain the differenc es in another c ompany’s billing prac tic es. His evidenc e on this was only spec ulation as indic ated by the words “I believe” in his answer. Therefore, inc onsistenc ies in his evidenc e would not mean that the lump-sum invoic es were fabric ated. Sec ondly, OES did not admit that lump-sum billing was only done vis-a-vis the Company. He had testified that he had billed other c ustomers in this way albeit for two or three months work only rather than for six months as in the c ase of the Company. OES had also explained why only one delivery order was issued for the jobs reflec ted in the lump-sum invoic es and this was: 

 Bec ause the lorry c rane, trailer and drivers were or should only be delivered or supplied onc e to the c onstruc tion site to c over the extended period. Therefore the said lorry c rane, trailer and drivers were to be stationed in the said site to perform or provide transportation servic es within the same site. 

192    Antah also took exc eption to being blamed for the pauc ity of evidenc e regarding the trailer. The plaintiffs had questioned why no other invoic es were produc ed by Antah showing the hire of a trailer. Antah explained that apart from the lump-sum invoic es, the invoic es produc ed by Antah were not related to the impugned transac tions and therefore were not disc overable. They were produc ed voluntarily bec ause Antah wished to prove the nature of its billing prac tic es. They were not selec ted to show the range of equipment Antah owned or to prove that Antah had owned or hired a trailer. Therefore, the non-mention of the trailer in the other invoic es proved nothing. 

193    With regards to the plaintiffs’ argument that there was no doc umentary evidenc e of the transac tions in question apart from the lump-sum invoic es and the delivery order, Antah asserted that 


not muc h c ould be made of that. It pointed out that although the plaintiffs had c ontrolled the Company sinc e 20 May 2005, it had only c ommenc ed the present ac tion in January 2009. Thus, five years and eight months had elapsed sinc e the transportation servic es had been provided by Antah. Sinc e Antah had no knowledge for suc h a long time that the suit was going to be c ommenc ed, it was not surprising that it had not preserved the doc uments relating to the transac tion. As for the Direc tors, they had not been in c ontrol of the Company for nearly four years so they would not have the relevant doc uments either. The Direc tors were not able to searc h the Company’s rec ords and had to rely on the plaintiffs to find the relevant doc uments. As for the c onflic ting evidenc e on the time c ards, Antah stated that the last time any of the witnesses had to address their minds to those doc uments was in August 2003, almost seven years before the c ase was started. Further, the issue of the time c ards had not been raised during pleadings or disc overy or in the affidavits of the plaintiffs’ witnesses and it was only during the trial that the Direc tors and OES were suddenly required to remember these details. It was not reasonable for the plaintiffs to expec t three separate witnesses to have suc h great powers of rec ollec tion that even without the assistanc e of written rec ords, they would still be able to rec all exac tly the same details about a transac tion that had taken plac e seven years earlier. 

194    Having c onsidered the arguments c arefully, I have c ome to the c onc lusion that there is insuffic ient evidenc e to hold, on a balanc e of probabilities, that the lump-sum invoic es were fraudulent and represented sham rather than genuine transac tions. There is ample evidenc e that, not only during the period c overed by the lump-sum invoic es but thereafter as well, Antah provided transportation servic es to the Company in the c ourse of Antah’s own business. Also, during that same period, the Company did have c onstruc tion work to c arry out at various sites. So, looking at the situation objec tively, it c ould very well have required Antah to provide transportation servic es within its sites and hired Antah’s equipment and personnel on a daily basis for that purpose. Whilst the Direc tors and OES were not very satisfac tory witnesses on the way in whic h the c harges had been derived, it was a valid point that they were only required to remember suc h details long after the events in question. Mdm Ong’s evidenc e on the time c ards was suspec t but the reason may be an innoc ent one – she may not have investigated the ac c urac y of the c harges very rigorously when the lump-sum invoic es were presented bec ause she relied on the honesty of her father and brother. However, when it c ame to c ourt, she may have thought she needed to justify those payments by referenc e to doc uments. In any c ase, it does not seem likely to me that the Direc tors would have involved OES and OKY in an elaborate fraud whic h required the fabric ation of doc uments just so that they c ould lay their hands on a total of $41,000 in mid to late 2003. At that time, the Direc tors were able to deal freely with the funds of the Company and, as the transac tions I have disc ussed above show, many payments were made to Mr Leow and Mdm Ong whic h were not supported by any doc umentation. There was therefore no reason for them to ask Antah to fabric ate doc uments in order to siphon moneys away from the Company. 

195    The alternative basis for the plaintiffs’ c laim that moneys paid to Antah in 2003 and 2004 (totalling $47,000) must be reimbursed was that these payments c onstituted a fraudulent preferenc e in favour of Antah. The plaintiffs submitted that bec ause of the relationship between Mdm Ong and OES and OKY, Antah was an assoc iate of the Company pursuant to reg 5 of the Regulations and therefore the presumption under s 99(5) of the Bankruptc y Ac t applied so that the Company was presumed to have given Antah an unfair preferenc e to put it into a better position in a winding up situation. The plaintiffs further submitted that the defendants had not rebutted this presumption bec ause they had not provided any c redible evidenc e to explain the payments and that the payments had no c ommerc ial justific ation. 

196    Antah submitted that of c ourse the payments had a c ommerc ial justific ation bec ause the transportation servic es had been provided by it. Further, Mr Leow was not influenc ed by any desire to 


improve Antah’s position but simply wished to pay Antah for its servic es and that had the side effec t of improving its position. It was insuffic ient to establish liability if Mr Leow only desired to pay Antah for its servic es and was aware that this might improve Antah’s position. Further, the evidenc e was against a finding that Mr Leow desired to improve Antah’s position bec ause as late as August 2004, the Company was still paying off its c reditors of whic h there were many. Indeed, looking at the list c ompiled by Mr Kon, by 8 June 2004, the Company had paid off 100% of the debts whic h had fallen due by 30 April 2003. This meant that Antah was simply one among many c ompanies whose invoic es were being honoured. The fac t of payment was not exc eptional. 

197    I find it diffic ult to ac c ept Antah’s arguments. I have found that the Direc tors knew that the Company was insolvent from as early as 30 April 2003 and they were also aware that it was insolvent on 31 August 2004. It is not in the Company’s favour that it took till 8 June 2004 to pay off all the debts whic h had fallen due by 30 April 2003. If the Company was not able to pay all those debts within a reasonable time of the due date, say 60 or 90 days at the most, then the fac t that it did pay Antah for the lump-sum invoic es before 8 June 2004 when the amounts payable under the lump-sum invoic es only fell due on 31 July 2003 and 31 August 2003 shows a preferenc e given to Antah. There is no indic ation in Mdm Ong’s affidavit as to when she ac tually made payment of these invoic es but some handwriting on the invoic e for $35,000 appears to indic ate that it was paid in c ash and therefore there may not be a rec ord of the payment. Mdm Ong herself stated that these lump-sum invoic es were “duly paid”. From that evidenc e, it is safe to infer that she did not wait more than a few months after their issue to settle them. The fac t that the Company most probably settled the lump-sum invoic es at a time when amounts whic h fell due on 30 April 2003 were still outstanding is to me an indic ation that there was an ac tual intention to prefer. In any c ase, I hold that in the c irc umstanc es, Antah has not been able to rebut the presumption. 

198    As for the sum of $3,540 paid to Antah, ac c ording to Mdm Ong, this total reflec ted 17 invoic es issued by Antah between 7 Marc h 2003 and 20 August 2003. Again, Mdm Ong says that these invoic es were “duly paid”. In this c onnec tion it should also be noted that of the debts owing as at 31 August 2003, only some 94% was eventually paid off. Here again, the Company c hose to pay Antah rather than other c reditors with amounts due as of 31 August 2003 and I hold that Antah has not been able to rebut the presumption. 

199    As for the final sum of $3,160, this represented the total amount paid in respec t of 19 invoic es whic h Antah issued to the Company between 6 September 2003 and 28 Marc h 2004. Ac c ording to Mdm Ong’s affidavit, $2,320 was paid by the Company in respec t of these invoic es on 10 May 2004 and the remaining $840 was paid on 28 September 2004. By then, the Company was hopelessly insolvent. I hold that Antah has not been able to rebut the presumption in respec t of this sum as well. 

200    I therefore c onc lude that the total sum of $47,000 has to be reimbursed as an undue preferenc e. 

**Wera** 

201    Wera, a sole proprietorship firm owned by OES, allegedly supplied labour to the Company in January, February, Marc h and April 2003 for whic h it billed the Company a total of $13,500. Its c harges were settled by way of three payments _viz_ $2,500 on 5 May 2003, $10,000 on 31 July 2003 and $1,000 on 21 August 2003. The plaintiffs sought to impugn these payments and also a transac tion between Wera and the Company in whic h Wera first purc hased c ertain equipment from the Company and subsequently leased it bac k to the Company. 

**_Claim for $13,500_** 


202    Dealing first with the payments to Wera for servic es provided, the plaintiffs sought to c ast doubt on the authentic ity of the transac tions. They alleged that Wera was not in the building and c onstruc tion business. Additionally, although the payment vouc hers stated that payment was being made to Wera, the c heques were put in the names of the Direc tors instead. The first c heque (no 567829) for $2,500 was made payable to Mdm Ong and was deposited into her bank ac c ount. The sec ond c heque (no 567969) for $10,000 was made payable to Mr Leow and was deposited into his ac c ount, whilst the third c heque (no 568039) for $1,000 was made payable to a Maybank c redit c ard ac c ount number belonging to Mr Leow and was paid to that ac c ount. 

203    OES asserted that Wera’s main business was the supply of labour. It also did some trading. Its main c ustomers were fac tories whic h it provided with workers on a daily or monthly basis. It transpired that the Company was the only c onstruc tion business that Wera had ever provided labour to. OES was not able to provide any doc umentary evidenc e in respec t of the workers that he had supplied to the Company. He had no written rec ord of how muc h he had paid them or when they had been paid. He said that for daily workers, he paid them $50 a day in c ash and would c harge his c ustomers $55 per worker. He found this was a simple transac tion and therefore usually he had not kept any rec ords of these transac tions. 

204    The Direc tors also gave evidenc e on these transac tions. They said that whenever the Company obtained labour from Wera, they would pay Wera’s c harges first and would subsequently reimburse themselves from the Company’s ac c ount. Mdm Ong’s original testimony was that if either she or Mr Leow made a payment on behalf of the Company, the same would be rec orded in the general ledger as a loan from them or it would be rec orded as c ash taken from the c ash book. In this c ase, however, the payments of $13,500 to Wera were not rec orded in either the general ledger or the c ash book. Mdm Ong was unable to explain the reason for the omission. She eventually admitted that there was no doc umentary evidenc e of the advanc es made by the Direc tors to Wera. The Direc tors maintained, however, that Wera’s payment arrangements were c ompletely legitimate sinc e servic es in the c onstruc tion industry were often supplied on a c ash basis. Further, Wera had admitted that it had rec eived the $13,500 from the Company for the supply of labour so there was no doubt that the funds had, in one way or another, made their way to Wera and had not been appropriated by the Direc tors. 

205    Wera asserted that the plaintiffs were being selec tive in their c laim bec ause although the Company’s rec ords showed that $29,150 had been paid to Wera for labour servic es, the plaintiffs were only seeking to impugn $13,500. Mr Kon had stated in evidenc e initially that he had not impugned the other transac tions as he c ould not find rec ords showing that these payments were made to Wera. He was then shown the evidenc e in the Company’s books of the other payments made. He then said that it was an oversight on his part not to have c hallenged the other payments as well. He also explained that he had made a distinc tion between transac tions that took plac e before April 2003 and those that took plac e after that date bec ause the plaintiffs had suspec ted fraudulent behaviour on the part of the Direc tors from April 2003 onwards. Wera c hallenged this as an artific ial distinc tion on the basis that if the plaintiffs c onsidered that payments amounting to $13,500 represented sham transac tions, then logic ally all payments to Wera also were in respec t of sham transac tions as they were made for the same purpose and took plac e in similar c irc umstanc es. 

206    Although there are some suspic ious aspec ts of the payments to Wera given the lac k of supporting doc umentation (in partic ular to show that the Direc tors had paid Wera in advanc e and had then c ollec ted payment from the Company), I find it diffic ult to hold that on a balanc e of probabilities the transac tions were sham. First, the plaintiffs failed to impugn the entire series of payments for this purpose. I do not find their justific ation for this omission to be persuasive. Sec ond, it is not farfetc hed for the Company to have obtained daily workers from Wera as and when they required extra 


labour. Although Wera generally supplied workers to fac tories, this did not mean that their workers c ould not c arry out labourers’ work on c onstruc tion sites and, bearing in mind the relationship between Mdm Ong and OES, it makes sense that he would have been willing to supply workers to the Company even though he did not generally supply them to firms in the c onstruc tion industry. Third, the servic es c harged for were supplied between January and April 2003 and this was a period when the Company was still ac tive in the c onstruc tion business and was working on many sites (as shown also by the various transportation servic es it had to hire Antah for) and therefore c ould have had a need for daily workers. 

207    The plaintiffs also c hallenged the $13,500 payment on the basis of unfair preferenc e. Sinc e the c heques in question were made out to the Direc tors in reimbursement of sums that they had advanc ed to Wera, there is no evidenc e as to when Wera was ac tually paid the various sums totalling $13,500. The servic es paid for were provided between January and April 2003 and there is no breakdown of the amount of c harges inc urred during eac h of those months. Ac c ordingly, it c ould very well be the c ase that Wera was paid most of the $13,500 before 30 April 2003 and that therefore those payments fell outside the two-year preferenc e period whic h has to be worked bac kward from 30 April 2005. Ac c ordingly, I am not able to hold that vis-a-vis Wera itself the payments c ould have c onstituted fraudulent preferenc es. On the other hand, the c heques show that the Direc tors reimbursed themselves between May and August 2003 _ie_ during the preferenc e period. The Direc tors, having advanc ed moneys to the Company by paying Wera, should not have repaid themselves when the Company was insolvent. It is therefore my judgment that the Direc tors have to repay what they rec eived and therefore Mr Leow has to repay $11,000 while Mdm Ong has to repay $2,500. 

**_The sale and lease back of construction equipment_** 

208    Around June or July 2003, the Company allegedly sold three piec es of c onstruc tion equipment to Wera. These were an SK 100 exc avator with breaker, an EX 30 mini-exc avator and an SK04 exc avator with breaker. Subsequently, in January, February, Marc h and August 2004, the Company leased the same equipment bac k from Wera. 

209    The plaintiffs alleged that these were sham transac tions meant to put the said c onstruc tion equipment out of the reac h of the Company’s c reditors and to transfer the Company’s funds to Wera. The plaintiffs c laimed that Wera had no reason to purc hase the c onstruc tion equipment in the first plac e as its business was the supply of labour and some trading. OES testified that the trading that Wera did was with regards to generators, c orporate gifts and grinding mac hinery for fac tories. Prior to the transac tions in question, Wera had never dealt in c onstruc tion equipment suc h as exc avators. 

210    Wera’s c ase was that one of Antah’s c ustomers, Joffren Omar Company Sdn Bhd (“JOC”) of Brunei, had wanted these spec ific piec es of equipment and had asked OES to sourc e for the same for it. When asked why the transac tion was done by Wera and not by Antah sinc e Antah was in the c onstruc tion business, OES replied that the dec ision was up to him as to whic h c ompany he would use. In any c ase, Antah had never sold c onstruc tion equipment previously either. 

211    Subsequently, OES disc overed that the Company had exac tly the equipment required and, c oinc identally, these items were available for sale. OES also testified that the Direc tors had known that he was purc hasing the equipment from the Company in order to trade the items for a profit. OES said that he had not thought about passing the c ontac t details of JOC to the Direc tors so that they c ould deal direc tly with the buyer. He said that he wanted to make a profit out of the transac tion. In the end, however, Wera had not been able to sell the exc avators to JOC, and was saddled with them. 

212    When c ross-examined as to how Wera had dealt with the equipment after the items were 


purc hased from the Company, OES appeared evasive. He initially stated that he kept them “at the site”, but when pressed as to whic h site it was, he was unable to give a definite answer. Finally, when asked where the equipment had been parked after Wera’s purc hase but before the Company had leased the items, OES c onfirmed that the equipment had, in fac t, never left the Company’s possession. 

213    In addition, there was doubt as to whether OES had genuinely attempted to sell the equipment to other c ompanies when the deal with JOC fell through. OES asserted that he had tried approac hing some people to buy it but when asked who these were, he c ould not remember. He also admitted that no potential purc haser had c ome to view the exc avators at all. When asked why he did not think of selling them to Aim Top, he replied that he did not know the “nature” of Aim Top’s business or whether they required the equipment or not. This was an inc redible answer as OES knew very well that he was sharing his offic e premises with Aim Top and must also have known that his mother, Mdm Chiew, was a shareholder and direc tor of Aim Top. He must have been fully aware of the nature of Aim Top’s business from the beginning. 

214    Further, Mr Leow’s evidenc e on the Company’s need to lease bac k the equipment was hard to believe. He said that at the time when the Company leased the equipment from Wera in Dec ember 2003, there were only two projec ts whic h the Company had with China Construc tion. These were MUP14 and MUP17 and, therefore these must have been the projec ts that the exc avators were needed for. One would therefore expec t that between June and Dec ember 2003 the Company had not been able to supply suc h equipment to the sites bec ause it had sold the same to Wera. However, the evidenc e showed that the Company had been able to lease equipment to China Construc tion from, at the latest, 30 April 2003. Further, the lease between the Company and China Construc tion was not affec ted by the purported sale of the equipment to Wera in June 2003. There was no interruption in the lease from then right up till April 2004. 

215    When pressed as to how he had been able to meet his obligations to China Construc tion when he had sold the equipment to Wera, Mr Leow at first c laimed he c ould not rec all bec ause “it’s too long ago”. Subsequently, however, he asserted that he had had other mini exc avators in his possession whic h he had been able to use to satisfy China Construc tion’s needs. When questioned as to why he needed to lease bac k the exc avators sold to Wera if the Company owned suffic ient equipment, Mr Leow deliberately skirted the question. His final rec ourse was to say that China Construc tion wanted more mac hines at the c onstruc tion site to “standby” in c ase of need. This c laim did not withstand c ross-examination as the evidenc e showed that the Company had ac tually c harged China Construc tion less in total in January and February 2004, when the additional vehic les were allegedly supplied, than in Dec ember 2003. Notwithstanding the situation disc losed by the doc uments, Mr Leow insisted that this was his position. It is not c redible that Mr Leow c ould remember exac tly whic h equipment was on standby at different times, when on many oc c asions throughout his testimony (and even in relation to the equipment itself as shown above), he was unable to remember other details and exc used himself by saying that the transac tions in question had oc c urred long ago. 

216    Additionally, the Company’s last major projec t as a main c ontrac tor was the Fernvale Projec t whic h ended on 30 September 2003. Mr Leow admitted that he would have required many vehic les before the c ompletion of that projec t, but that between June/July 2003 and 30 September 2003, he was able to survive without the equipment sold to Wera. Subsequently, Mr Leow c hanged his position, and c laimed that he was only doing “defec t work” at the Fernvale site, and thus did not require as muc h mac hinery. However, he also agreed that any defec t rec tific ation works would only have started after 30 September 2003, whic h was when the projec t was c ompleted. Finally, Mr Leow stated that the Fernvale site only required large mac hinery and equipment, while the China Construc tion site required the smaller equipment that he had sold to Wera. When asked why he did 


not give this answer at first, Mr Leow c laimed that it had never been put to him. On the whole, Mr Leow’s evidenc e on this issue was evasive and not c onvinc ing. 

217    Wera c laimed that the transac tions were c ompletely legitimate. It alleged that the rates at whic h the Company had leased the equipment to China Construc tion were higher than the rates at whic h Wera leased the same to the Company and therefore the Company had ac tually made a profit from this transac tion. Wera had also prepared a table showing the amount of money the Company would have earned from not selling and leasing bac k the equipment from Wera and c omparing this with the amount of money that the Company had ac tually earned from these transac tions. It was shown that the arrangement that the Company had with Wera had given it more earnings that if it had not sold the equipment. 

218    The defendants also submitted that Mr Kon had admitted in c ourt that the lease bac k was not a sham transac tion and that it was a genuine c ommerc ial transac tion whic h allowed the Company to benefit monetarily. When asked about this by the c ourt, however, Mr Kon insisted that the sale to Wera was still a sham transac tion. His reasons were that the Company had no need to sell the equipment, and it did not market the same, nor advertise or c ompare the quotations for the equipment with other firms. In addition, in re-examination, Mr Kon stated that although the defendants’ table showed that the Company had benefitted arithmetic ally, this benefit had not taken into ac c ount the future utility of the equipment sold to Wera. In fac t, the Company had lost the ability to profit for a longer period of time from the equipment. Therefore, while the lease bac k on its own c ould be justified c ommerc ially, when it was c oupled with the initial sale for whic h there was no c ommerc ial justific ation, the entire transac tion appeared to him to be a sham transac tion. 

219    Having c onsidered the evidenc e, I agree that the sale and lease bac k of the equipment in question was a sham and must be set aside. The plaintiffs, in the alternative, c hallenged the sale on the basis that the equipment was sold at an undervalue. In view of my finding as to the sham nature of the transac tion, I need not deal with the submission in detail. I would only say that the plaintiffs were not able to put forward c onvinc ing evidenc e of the ac tual market value of the equipment so as to show that the pric es at whic h the same was sold to Wera were below market levels. Their expert, Mr Robert Khan, produc ed a report whic h was lac king in details whic h would have substantiated his valuation of the equipment. In partic ular, he did not give partic ulars of the researc h c arried out with mac hinery dealers or indic ate in suffic ient detail what fac tors he had taken into ac c ount to c ome up with his valuation. His attitude seemed to be that the c ourt should take his word as to the ac c urac y of the valuation bec ause he had sworn to it. This is an unsatisfac tory position for any expert to take and c ounsel must be aware that to be of use to the c ourt, their experts must be able to explain with supporting data how they arrived at their various c onc lusions. 

**Yew San Construction Pte Ltd** 

220    The Company paid the seventh defendant, Yew San Construc tion Pte Ltd (“Yew San”) the sum of $13,111.35 on 15 June 2004 in settlement of an invoic e for “Exc avation works for Bendemeer” done in Marc h 2004. The plaintiffs alleged that that was a sham transac tion and should be set aside. Yew San itself urged the c ourt to bear in mind that it was not an assoc iate of the Company. It had been inc orporated in 1996 and had been in the c onstruc tion business for some time before the events c omplained of oc c urred. None of its direc tors or shareholders were relatives or employees of the Company. It c ontended that there was no apparent reason for the Company or the Direc tors to c onc oc t a fraudulent transac tion so that they c ould pay Yew San for doing nothing. 

221    The plaintiffs were suspic ious of the transac tion bec ause they c onsidered that the Company had no c ontrac t to c arry out exc avation work at the Bendemeer site. Based on the invoic es issued by 


the Company to China Construc tion whic h was the main c ontrac tor at the Bendemeer MUP17 site, the servic es provided by the Company were the supply of dump truc ks, the rental of equipment suc h as exc avators and the removal of earth. The plaintiffs did not find a doc ument whic h showed that the Company had agreed to c arry out exc avation works for China Construc tion. Further, they had not found any written c ontrac t between Yew San and the Company in respec t of this work nor had they loc ated any delivery order relating to the same. The plaintiffs did not ac c ept Yew San’s c laim that the work had been done on the basis of Mr Leow’s verbal instruc tions. Mr Leow himself had c onfirmed that there was an oral c ontrac t between the Company and Yew San but the plaintiffs doubted that. 

222    Leo Kim San, the manager of Yew San, gave evidenc e on its behalf. He stated that the Company did engage Yew San to provide exc avation work at a Bendemeer site. The exc avation works c ommenc ed sometime in Marc h 2004 and were c ompleted in April 2004. Upon c ompletion of the work, the Company was duly invoic ed and payment was rec eived by Yew San for the work done. He also stated that sinc e about 2002 there had been an established prac tic e between the Company and Yew San in relation to business between the two entities. Upon rec eipt of a verbal request from Mr Leow for Yew San’s servic es, the work would be performed as requested. Thereafter, an invoic e would be issued by Yew San and paid by the Company. There were no written c ontrac ts bec ause the jobs done by Yew San were mainly small jobs involving the sending of a lorry, and oc c asionally an exc avator as well, to remove earth. Yew San produc ed invoic es for servic es rendered in July 2003, August 2003, Oc tober 2003 and April 2004 whic h had been provided without any written c ontrac t having been c onc luded. 

223    In c ritic ising the defenc es put forward by the Company and Yew San, the plaintiffs laid emphasis on the poor quality of Mr Leo’s evidenc e. When Mr Leow was c ross-examined as to why the Company had had to hire Yew San when it had been doing earth removal work at the Bendemeer all along, he c laimed that there was earth at the site that was “dirty” but needed to be disposed of and that he had been unable to find a dumping ground and so needed Yew San’s servic es. Subsequently, he c larified that ‘good earth’ and ‘bad earth’, _ie_ , the dirty earth, would both be sent to the dumping ground. This c ontradic ted his earlier assertion that it was bec ause he c ould not find a dump site for the dirty earth that he had hired Yew San. The plaintiffs submitted that given that the Company had been providing earth removal servic es for China Construc tion for months prior to Marc h and April 2004, it was highly unlikely that it would be unable to deal with the new type of dirty earth that was dug up in the same area so forc ing it to hire Yew San. 

224    Most damagingly, the plaintiffs said, the invoic es issued by the Company showed that China Construc tion was not only billed for the removal of earth in Marc h and April 2004 when Yew San had been hired but also in January and February that year. When asked how it was that the Company had been able to deal with the earth before Marc h 2004, Mr Leow was c learly evasive. Ultimately he c ame up with the story that the Company had dug up the dirty earth prior to Marc h 2004, but had stoc kpiled it and then hired Yew San whic h used its own exc avator to remove this earth. However, the question remained why China Construc tion had ac c epted the Company’s invoic e for removal of earth when the earth had not been removed but only stoc kpiled. Mr Leow’s explanation was that he had c harged China Construc tion in advanc e of the removal of the earth. 

225    Further, the plaintiffs pointed to various disc repanc ies between the invoic es issued by Yew San to the Company and those from the Company to China Construc tion. Firstly, the invoic e whic h the Company issued desc ribed the work “disposal of earth at Bloc k 30 and Bloc k 34, Boon Keng”. However, Yew San’s invoic e stated that it was for “exc avation works in Bendemeer”. 

226    Sec ondly, the invoic es by the Company c harged ac c ording to the number of loads of earth moved. Yew San’s invoic e in c ontrast simply stated a lump sum c harge of $13,111.35. This was also 


different from earlier invoic es by Yew San to the Company for earthworks, whic h had also c harged on a per load basis. In his affidavit, Mr Leo had explained that when a job to be done was larger in sc ale and the earth to be removed was c onveniently piled together, Yew San had sometimes c harged on a lump sum basis. In suc h c ases, it would estimate how many loads the earth removal job would require and quote a fixed figure for the job. When asked how Yew San had arrived at a lump sum that was an odd figure ($12,487 (before GST)), Mr Leo attempted to explain the disc repanc y by saying that Yew San’s exc avator had happened to run out of diesel and they had taken diesel from the Company and therefore had to deduc t the c ost of the diesel from the final invoic e. I found this a very c reative explanation, c onsidering that it was given six years after the event and that there was nothing in the invoic e whic h hinted at it. 

227    More importantly, the plaintiffs said, Yew San had billed the Company a total of $24,703.35 for earth removal works in Marc h and April 2004. On the other hand, the Company only c harged China Construc tion $16,831.50 for the removal of earth during the same period whic h meant that it suffered a loss by hiring Yew San’s servic es. However, this higher figure c harged by the Company inc luded work done in another area _viz_ Boon Keng Bloc k 28. 

228    Whilst there were interesting stories and disc repanc ies in the stories told by the witnesses, I have to bear in mind that the events in question took plac e six years or more before the trial and that, espec ially from Yew San’s point of view, the servic es supplied were c arried out in the normal c ourse of its business with nothing oc c urring at that time that would have fixed the events in the memory. In this c onnec tion, I note from the invoic es produc ed that Yew San had c harged the Company a further $26,768.72 for similar servic es between July 2003 and 30 April 2004 but the plaintiffs had not sought to impugn all those transac tions as well. Of these bills, some $11,592 represented servic es rendered in April 2004 alone. The plaintiffs obviously had no diffic ulty ac c epting all those bills as representing genuine transac tions. When Mr Kon was asked why these payments were not impugned, he merely said that he c ould not remember and that he might not have seen those invoic es. This explanation does not help justify the c hallenge made to the invoic e for $13,111.35. It is diffic ult to see how the transac tion represented by that invoic e was a sham when other suc h invoic es were ac c epted as reflec ting genuine transac tions. At all times, the fac tual c ontext in whic h the invoic es were issued remained the same. 

229    In addition, I ac c ept Yew San’s assertions that there was nothing sinister in Yew San’s desc ription of the works as “exc avation works” in the invoic e, as the job required the use of Yew San’s lorry for the earth removal and disposal, and also the provision of an exc avator for removing the piles of earth from the site and lifting it onto the lorry. Further, Yew San had also desc ribed the work that it did for the Company as “removal of earth” in a letter to the plaintiffs prior to the c ommenc ement of the suit. Yew San argued, tellingly, that an inac c urac y in the desc ription of the work done in the invoic e should not be c onstrued as an indic ation that it had not been done at all. 

230    I agree that the Company’s c areless way of hiring and making payment to sub-c ontrac tors c annot mean, _ipso facto_ , that no work had been done for the Company and that a fraud had been perpetrated. Mr Leow was c onsistent in the main points of his testimony on this issue, whic h were that the Company required someone to remove and dump the “dirty” earth from his c onstruc tion site and to find a field site in whic h to dispose of this dirty earth. Additionally, I agree with the submission by Yew San that it was not partic ularly suspec t that the invoic es did not adequately desc ribe the work. It would be unrealistic to expec t small c onstruc tion c ompanies to produc e perfec tly worded invoic es. The invoic es were suffic ient to indic ate the type of work done and ought to be c onsidered suffic ient evidenc e that the work was in fac t done. This is partic ularly so sinc e there was no c onnec tion, exc ept a business one, between Yew San and the Company. There was no reason let alone a good reason suggested by the plaintiffs as to why the Direc tors would want to benefit Yew 


San by c onc oc ting a fake transac tion. Overall, therefore, I find that the plaintiffs have not been able to prove that the invoic e for $13,111.35 was in respec t of a sham transac tion. 

**Sale of excavator to Ban Guan & Co (“Ban Guan”)** 

231    On 8 April 2004, the Company sold Ban Guan a used exc avator for $55,000. The plaintiffs c ontended that this exc avator was sold at an undervalue. They said that the Direc tors did not take any steps to sell the exc avator at its fair market pric e, and that shortly afterwards the same exc avator was sold to one JPN Industrial Trading Pte Ltd (“JPN”) for $24,200 more than the pric e at whic h it was sold to Ban Guan. In addition, the sale to JPN oc c urred three days before the Company had invoic ed Ban Guan for the latter’s purc hase of the exc avator and that the Direc tors were unable to explain this. The plaintiffs c laimed that the Direc tors had ac ted in breac h of their duties in proc uring this transac tion. 

232    In order to establish this c laim, the plaintiffs had to show that the pric e at whic h the exc avator was sold was an undervalue. Their expert for this purpose was Robert Khan. His evidenc e on the valuation of the exc avator sold to Ban Guan suffers from the same defec ts as that given in respec t of the sale of the equipment to Wera. I c annot rely on this evidenc e. Therefore, there is no evidenc e before me that the pric e paid by JPN was the market pric e. I c annot assume that just bec ause JPN paid that pric e at about the same time as Ban Guan paid a lower pric e, the sum of $88,200 was the market pric e. There may have been partic ular reasons why JPN needed that partic ular exc avator. In any c ase, there was no reason for the Direc tors to sell the exc avator at less than the best possible pric e they c ould obtain. Ban Guan was not related to them and they had no reason (and none was suggested by the plaintiffs) for giving Ban Guan a bargain when the Company itself needed money so badly. There was no lease bac k in this c ase and, and on a balanc e of probabilities, I find that the sale was a genuine one. The Direc tors may not have spent enough time looking for the best possible pric e for the exc avator but this does not mean that they ac ted dishonestly in effec ting its sale to Ban Guan.
