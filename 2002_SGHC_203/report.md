### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

**_The Charge_** 

The appellant was c harged that he, together with nine others, on or about 2 September 2001, at about 4.00 am at barbec ue pit ‘O’, Pasir Ris Park, were members of an unlawful assembly whose c ommon objec t was to c ause hurt to the following four persons: 

 Syaiful Ridhuan Bin Wahid (‘Syaiful’), 17 year old male, 

 Mohamed Ridzuan Bin Abdul Talib (‘Ridzuan’), 16 year old male, 

 Toh Sunny Bin Faud (‘Sunny’), 17 year old male and 

 Muhammad Nursamfauzie Bin Samat (‘Fauzie’), 16 year old male 

, 

and in prosec ution of the c ommon objec t of suc h assembly, violenc e was used and he had thereby c ommitted the offenc e of rioting under s 146 of the Penal Code, Cap 224, ("PC"). Under s 147, the offender shall be punished with imprisonment for a term whic h may extend to five years and shall also be liable to c aning. 

2       The appellant was jointly tried with the following persons who were within the same unlawful 


assembly, namely, Mohamed Noor Bin Abdul Rahman (‘Mohd Noor’), Zulkeplee Bin Abdullah (‘Zulkeplee’), Mohd Hardian Bin Mohd Yassin (‘Mohd Hardian’). At the end of the trial, the appellant was c onvic ted and sentenc ed to 30 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the c ane. The appellant appealed only against c onvic tion and not against sentenc e. 

3       I heard his appeal on 13 August 2002 and dismissed it. I now give my reasons. 

**_Background facts_** 

_(a) The birthday party and the fight_ 

4       On 1 September 2001, Siti Noraini Bte Abdul Jalil invited several of her friends, inc luding the four vic tims in the present c ase, to her birthday party at barbec ue pit ‘N’, Pasir Ris Park. A lamppost illuminated eac h barbec ue pit. 

5       The four vic tims arrived at the above-mentioned pit at about 9.00 pm. At about 11.00 pm, they proc eeded to a neighbouring pit, pit ‘O’, to play c ards. Pit ‘N’ and pit ‘O’ are about ten metres apart. 

6       At about 3.00 am, while playing c ards at pit ‘O’, the vic tims notic ed a group of about 15male Malays walking briskly towards them. Ridzuan gave evidenc e that the appellant was part of the group and that he was holding a belt in his hand. As the group approac hed, Sunny stood up to asc ertain what they wanted. Ac c ording to the prosec ution witnesses, Mohd Noor c onfronted Sunny and asked him whic h sec ret soc iety he belonged to. Sunny denied any suc h involvement rudely after Mohd Noor asked him the same question repeatedly. Thereupon, Mohd Noor threw a bottle to the ground smashing it. Mohd Hardian then rushed forward and punc hed Sunny on the left jaw. Mohd Noor pushed Sunny and Zulkeplee punc hed Sunny on the forehead. 

7       A fight broke out and the remaining members of the group attac ked the four vic tims by punc hing and kic king them. During his examination-in-c hief, Ridzuan testified that the appellant had hit him on the bac k and on the c hest with a leather belt. 

_(b) The arrest_ 

8       The vic tims eventually managed to break away from their assailants and c alled the polic e. At about 4.12 am, Sergeant Mazli, of Bedok Polic e Division, arrived at the sc ene. Sergeant Mazli questioned the vic tims and upon being informed that the assailants were wearing dark c lothes and had fled in a blue lorry, informed his Operations Room of what he had learned and instruc tions were issued to look out for a group of Malay persons in a blue lorry. 

9       At about 5.00 am, a blue lorry was spotted at Pasir Ris Drive 6, in front of Bloc k 442. There were 15 male and 5 female persons inside the lorry. Corporal Patric k Lim stopped the lorry and detained the group. The appellant was among those detained. 

10     Sergeant Mazli, upon being informed of the detention, drove the four vic tims to the lorry and told them to identify members of the group who assaulted them. During the identific ation proc ess, the vic tims remained in the polic e c ar. Both Sunny and Ridzuan identified Mohd Noor. Syaiful pointed out Mohd Noor and Mohd Hardian. Ac c ording to Ridzuan, he did not identify the appellant then bec ause he c ould not see the appellant’s fac e c learly from the polic e c ar. 

_(c) The medical examination_ 


11     At about 5.59 am the same morning, the vic tims were medic ally examined by Dr Wang Shi Tah (‘Dr Wang’) at the Changi General Hospital. Ridzuan, upon c ross-examination, insisted that he did tell Dr Wang that someone had assaulted him with a belt. However, Dr Wang’s medic al report on Ridzuan indic ated that "no weapons were used". 

_(d) The identification parade_ 

12     Later on the same day between 1.00 pm and 1.30 pm at Bedok Polic e Station, an identific ation parade of 15 male Malays was c onduc ted for the four vic tims. It was not disputed that the identific ation parade was properly c onduc ted. During the parade, all four vic tims identified Mohd Noor. Sunny also identified both Zulkeplee and Mohd Hardian. Only Ridzuan identified the appellant. The vic tims were not spec ific ally asked what roles the identified persons had played in the group. 

**_The prosecution’s case_** 

13     The prosec ution’s c ase relied entirely on Ridzuan’s identific ation of the appellant. None of the other prosec ution witnesses identified the appellant as part of the group. Ridzuan testified as follows: 

 (i) The appellant was part of the group that approac hed the vic tims and was holding a belt in his hand. 

 (ii) Further, the appellant remained in the group when Mohd Noor c onfronted Sunny and when Mohd Hardian punc hed Sunny on the jaw. 

 (iii) Onc e the fight began, the appellant hit Ridzuan first on the bac k, and then on the c hest, with his belt. 

14     Based on Ridzuan’s testimony, the prosec ution submitted that on 2 September 2002 the appellant had been a member of an unlawful assembly with the c ommon objec t of c ausing hurt to the vic tims under s 141(c ) of the PC. Sinc e forc e or violenc e was used by the assembly or by any member thereof in prosec ution of their c ommon objec t, the appellant was guilty of the offenc e of rioting, as provided for under s 146 of the PC. 

**_The defence_** 

15     The appellant’s defenc e was that he never took part in the riot and was mistakenly identified by Ridzuan as being part of the group assaulting the vic tims that night. The appellant testified as follows: he had spent that evening in a pub at Boat Quay, together with his wife, Ridiawati Bte Mohd Reduan (‘Ridiawati’), at a party c elebrating the birthday of ‘Baby’, the wife of the third ac c used, Zulkeplee. The other three c o-ac c used were also present at the party. 

16     At about 3.00 am, the appellant and his wife left the party. They ac c epted one Abdul Faisal’s offer to take them home in his lorry. The sec ond ac c used Mohd Noor, the third ac c used Zulkeplee and his wife ‘Baby’, the fourth ac c used Mohd Hardian and his wife, were also in the same lorry. Besides the persons named above, there were also other persons in the lorry. 

17     The group dec ided to detour to Pasir Ris Park where Abdul Faisal parked the lorry at c ar park ‘E’, Pasir Ris Park. As ‘Baby’ wanted to vomit at that time, Ridiawati, Zulkeplee, the appellant and ‘two other c ouples’ took ‘Baby’ to a toilet loc ated beside the c ar park. When they reac hed the toilet, all the ladies used the toilet first, leaving ‘Baby’ seated outside on a benc h. Zulkeplee, the appellant and two other male persons attended to her. The ladies c ame out and took ‘Baby’ into the toilet. The 


appellant and the others then used the toilet. 

18     About ten minutes later, the appellant stated that he saw a group of Malay males running towards the c ar park. Someone shouted for everyone to board the lorry. The appellant and the others who were with him previously at the toilet c omplied. Abdul Faisal then drove off. Subsequently, a polic e c ar stopped the lorry and everyone onboard was taken to the polic e station. 

19     Henc e, the main plank of the appellant’s defenc e was that he had been at the toilet attending to ‘Baby’ when the inc idents took plac e. He had not been part of the group whic h approac hed and assaulted the vic tims. The testimonies of the appellant’s wife (Ridiawati) and two of the c o-ac c used (Zulkeplee and Mohd Hardian) supported this version of events. 

**_The decision below_** 

20     The trial judge disbelieved the appellant’s testimony that he was at the toilet when the inc ident s took plac e for two main reasons. First, there were material disc repanc ies between the appellant’s statement rec orded under s 122(6) of the Criminal Proc edure Code ("CPC’) and his long statement rec orded under s 121 of the CPC. In the appellant’s s 122(6) statement, he stated that he had been at the lorry; while in his long statement, he stated that he had ac c ompanied his wife to the toilet. 

21     Sec ondly, the testimonies of the defenc e witnesses were not c redible. Ridiawati, being the appellant’s wife, was an interested witness. Zulkeplee and Mohd Hardian, being jointly tried as c oac c used, also stood to gain by a unified defenc e of an alibi, namely, that they were not present during the riot but were at the toilet attending to ‘Baby’ at that time. In any c ase, Mohd Hardian’s evidenc e was also full of inc onsistenc ies. In one polic e statement, he stated that he never saw the fight. However, he testified subsequently in c ourt that he had gone to the sc ene and tried to stop the fight after Mohd Noor shouted for him. Lastly, Sunny, as a prosec ution witness, had also identified Mohd Hardian and Zulkeplee as being part of the group whic h approac hed the vic tims, thus bringing int o question the verac ity of their evidenc e that the appellant had been with them at the toilet. Sunny’s evidenc e here was entitled to signific ant weight bec ause he had a spec ial reason to remember Mohd Hardian and Zulkeplee, they being the ones who punc hed him on the left jaw and forehead. 

22     The trial judge further ac c epted Ridzuan’s testimony that the appellant was part of the group. However, given that Ridzuan had upon c ross-examination admitted that he c ould not see c learly the person who had assaulted him with a belt, it might be that the assailant was not the appellant. Nevertheless, he held that the appellant’s presenc e or ‘ac tive role’ in the group was suffic ient to render him a member of the unlawful assembly, whether or not he had ac tually assaulted Ridzuan with a belt. 

**_Issues arising on appeal_** 

23     Given that c onvic tion depended solely on Ridzuan’s identific ation of the appellant as a member of the group whic h had approac hed the vic tims, muc h of the appeal was foc used on attac king his testimony. The appellant appealed against his c onvic tion on two main grounds: 

 (i) The trial judge erred in law in c onsidering the appellant’s mere presenc e in the group as suffic ient to render him a member of an unlawful assembly. It must be shown that the appellant was an "ac tive partic ipant"; and 


 (ii) Even if mere presenc e was suffic ient to render the appellant a member of an unlawful assembly, the trial judge should not have found him to be present based solely on Ridzuan’s testimony for the following reasons: 

 (a) Ridzuan was not a c redible witness; 

 (b) Ridzuan’s evidenc e was inc onsistent with the evidenc e of the other prosec ution witnesses; 

 (c ) The quality of Ridzuan’s identific ation evidenc e was poor and should be rejec ted by the trial judge; and 

 (d) It was unsafe to c onvic t the appellant solely on the unc orroborated evidenc e of Ridzuan as he was a minor prone to giving ‘whimsic al evidenc e’. 

**_First ground of appeal: whether mere presence was sufficient to constitute membership of an unlawful assembly_** 

24     Unlawful assembly’ and ‘rioting’ are defined in s 141 and s 146 of the PC respec tively whic h provide as follows: 

141\. An assembly of 5 or more persons is designated an "unlawful assembly", if the c ommon objec t of the persons c omposing that assembly is — 

 ... 

 (c ) to c ommit any misc hief or c riminal trespass, or other offenc e; 

 ... 

146\. Whenever forc e or violenc e is used by an unlawful assembly **_o r by any member thereof_** , in prosec ution of the c ommon objec t of suc h assembly, **_every_** member of suc h assembly is guilty of the offenc e of rioting [Emphases added]. 

25     It was not in dispute that the group of 15-20 Malay males whic h approac hed the vic tims shared the c ommon objec t of c ausing hurt to the vic tims, henc e c onstituting an unlawful assembly under s 141(c ) of the PC. Further, sinc e violenc e was c learly used by some members of that assembly, in prosec ution of the c ommon objec t of suc h assembly, _every_ member of suc h assembly at the time when violenc e was used was guilty of rioting under s 146. The only issue in the present c ase was whether the appellant had been a member of that assembly when violenc e was used. 

26     The test of membership in an unlawful assembly is set out in s 142 of the PC whic h reads as follows: 

142\. Whoever, being aware of fac ts whic h render any assembly an unlawful assembly, **_intentionally joins that_** 


 assembly, or continues in it , is said to be a member of an unlawful assembly [Emphasis added]. 

Sec tion 142 emphasises the point that anyone who voluntarily assoc iates himself with an assembly after he is aware of fac ts rendering that assembly unlawful, is deemed to share the c ommon objec t of that assembly, and henc e bec omes a member of that assembly. This was c onfirmed by _Lim Thian Hor & Anor v PP_ <span class="citation">[1996] 2 SLR 258</span> where I stated the following opinion at p 264: 

 It is of c ourse well settled law that a mere presenc e in an assembly of persons did not make the ac c used a member of an unlawful assembly, unless there was direc t or c irc umstantial evidenc e to show that the ac c used shared the c ommon objec t of the assembly. In my opinion, however, a person present at the assembly can be said to be a member of the assembly even if no overt act is proved against him. Provided the circumstances are such as to justify an inference that he associated himself with the offending members, it may be inferred that he is a member of such an assembly. In every c ase, this question is one of fac t as to whether he happens to be innoc ent ly present at the plac e of oc c urrenc e or was ac tually a member of the unlawful assembly: see Bishambar v State of Bihar AIR 1971 SC 2381. [Emphasis added] 

Therefore, mere passive presenc e in an unlawful assembly _may or may not_ c onstitute membership of that assembly: it depends on whether in all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, the Court c an draw the inferenc e even from a person’s mere presenc e that he shared the c ommon objec t of that assembly. There is no rigid rule that mere presenc e c an never c onstitute membership of an unlawful assembly. Similarly, there is no requirement that a member of an unlawful assembly must be an ‘ac tive partic ipant’ or that some ‘overt ac t’ must be proven against him. 

27     On the fac ts of the present c ase, a group of 15-20 males walked towards and surrounded four greatly outnumbered vic tims in a public park at 4.00 am in the morning. One person within the group repeatedly asked Sunny threatening questions about whic h sec ret soc iety he belonged to. Someone then smashed a glass bottle and a fight broke out soon after. In suc h c irc umstanc es, it would have been c lear to the appellant that the c ommon objec t of the assembly was to c ause hurt to others, at least from the point when the threatening questions were asked. If he c hose to c ontinue to remain present in the assembly beyond that point, the inferenc e would be irresistible that he shared the c ommon objec t of that assembly, unless he c ould c onvinc e the c ourt that he had some spec ial reason for doing so. However, no suc h reason was tendered. Although the entire event happened in a matter of minutes, there was still suffic ient time for the appellant to dissoc iate himself from the group if he had wanted to do so. 

28     It was henc e c lear that, on the fac ts of the c ase, the trial judge was justified in holding that c ontinued presenc e by the appellant in the unlawful assembly when threatening questions were asked and when the fight broke out was suffic ient to render him a member of that assembly. Partic ularly, there was no need for the prosec ution to prove that the appellant had ac tually assaulted Ridzuan with a belt. It must be emphasised that I do not mean to say that presenc e in an unlawful assembly is always or usually suffic ient to c onstitute membership. Eac h c ase must be dec ided on its own fac ts. 

**_Second ground of appeal: whether the appellant was present in the unlawful assembly when_** 


**_the threatening questions were asked and when the fight broke out_** 

_(a) Ridzuan’s credibility_ 

29     The appellant tried to impeac h Ridzuan’s c redibility by pointing out numerous disc repanc ies in his evidenc e. Before I examine the alleged disc repanc ies, three general princ iples with respec t to impeac hing witnesses’ c redibility shall be reiterated. 

30     First, ‘innoc ent’ disc repanc ies must be distinguished from deliberate lies. I have expressed the following opinion in _Lewis Christina v PP_ <span class="citation">[2001] 3 SLR 165</span> at 170: 

 ... a flawed witness does not equate to an untruthful witness. The trial judge is entitled to determine whic h part of the witness’s testimony remains c redible despite its disc repanc ies. 

Therefore, if the disc repanc ies are innoc ent, the judge is entitled to rely on those parts of the evidenc e whic h are untainted by the disc repanc ies. However, if the witness has deliberately lied to the c ourt, it is c lear that he is not a reliable witness and as a matter of prudenc e the rest of his evidenc e must be sc rutinised with great c are and indeed with suspic ion. To say, however, that bec ause a witness has been proved a liar on one or two points then the whole of his evidenc e "must in law be rejec ted" is to go too far and is wrong: per Thomson CJ in _Khoo Chye Hin v PP_ [1961] MLJ 105 at 107. 

31     Sec ondly, the c redibility of a witness c annot be impeac hed unless there are serious disc repanc ies or material c ontradic tions in his evidenc e: _Mohammed Zairi bin Mohamad Mohtar v PP_ <span class="citation">[2002] 1 SLR 344</span> at 33. ‘Serious disc repanc ies’ or ‘material disc repanc ies’ are those that go to the c rux of the c harge against the appellant: _Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP_ <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 592</span> at 26. 

32     Thirdly, even if a witness’s c redit is impeac hed, it does not automatic ally lead to a total rejec tion of his evidenc e. The c ourt must c arefully sc rutinise the whole of the evidenc e to determine whic h aspec t might be true and whic h aspec t should be disregarded: _PP v Somwang Phatthanasaeng_ <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 138</span> at 148 _; Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP_ <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 592</span> at 24; and _Loganatha Venkatesan v PP_ <span class="citation">[2000] 3 SLR 677</span> at 56. 

33     I will now apply the foregoing princ iples to the fac ts of this c ase. The alleged disc repanc ies in this c ase were as follows: 

 (a) Ridzuan, under c ross-examination, stated that Sunny was wearing a long-sleeved dark-c oloured sweater throughout the inc ident. Upon further questioning, he said that Sunny was shirtless instead. 

 (b) Ridzuan stated in his examination-in-c hief that the appellant smac ked him with a belt but admitted under c ross-examination that he did not see his assailant c learly. 

 (c ) Ridzuan, under c ross-examination, stated that when the group approac hed barbec ue pit ‘O’, the appellant’s belt was untidily rolled up and he held it in his hands. Upon further questioning, Ridzuan said that the belt was ‘dangling’ 


 instead. 

 (d) Under c ross-examination, Ridzuan stated that he had told Dr Wang that he had been assaulted with a belt. However, Dr Wang’s medic al report indic ated that "no weapons were used". 

It was apparent that none of the alleged disc repanc ies were material bec ause they did not go to the c rux of the c harge against the appellant. As disc ussed in 26-28 above, the c rux of the c harge in this c ase was whether the appellant voluntarily remained as part of the group before and during the riot. Partic ularly, (b) and (d) were not c ruc ial to the appellant’s c harge bec ause in order to c onstitute rioting under s 146 of the PC, the prosec ution need not go further to prove that the appellant had ac tually assaulted Ridzuan with a belt. Henc e, Ridzuan’s c redibility as a witness was not suc c essfully impeac hed: _Mohammed Zairi bin Mohamad Mohtar v PP._ 

_(b) Inconsistencies between the evidence of Ridzuan and the other prosecution witnesses_ 

34     In _Ng Kwee Leong v PP_ <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 942</span>, inc onsistenc ies between the evidenc e of different witnesses were c lassified into three main c ategories: 

 (a) The first c ategory is where the disc repanc ies relied on are immaterial disc repanc ies, whic h have no direc t bearing on the fac ts in issue. In suc h instanc es, the trial judge should find that these disc repanc ies do not detrac t from the general verac ity of the witnesses on the material issues and ac c ept their evidenc e on those issues. 

 (b) The sec ond c ategory is where the disc repanc y, while not relating direc tly to the c rux of the prosec ution’s or defenc e’s c ase, as the c ase may be, may be viewed as deliberate c onc oc tion of the witness and affec t the c redibility of the witness. A c autionary note was sounded in that, even if a witness is found to have lied on a matter, it does not nec essarily affec t his c redibility as a whole. 

 (c ) The third c ategory c onc erns disc repanc ies where two persons give separate ac c ounts as to short periods of time. Adequate allowanc e must be given to human fallibility in the prec ise assessment of short spans of time. Ac c ordingly, disc repanc ies are to be expec ted where two persons give separate ac c ounts as to short passages of time. Ac c ordingly, the c ourt in weighing the testimony of witnesses must rec ognise human fallibility in observation, retention and rec ollec tion. 

35     The inc onsistenc y alleged in the present c ase related to the fac t that the prosec ution witnesses gave differing ac c ounts as to how Ridzuan c ame to be assaulted with a belt. Their c onflic ting evidenc e was as follows: 

 (i) Ridzuan testified that the appellant was holding a belt in his hand before the assault began and, when the 


 fight started, he hit Ridzuan with the belt. 

 (ii) Syarifa Farhana Bte Syed Hamdan (‘Syarifa’) testified that she saw a person pull a belt out of his trousers and begin to attac k Ridzuan. 

 (iii) Siti Nuraini Bte Abdul Jalil (‘Siti’) gave evidenc e that she never saw anyone using a belt as a weapon during the fight. 

 (iv) Nur Zakiah Bte Jafar (‘Zakiah’) gave evidenc e that the person who assaulted Ridzuan with a belt was wearing a baseball c ap. No evidenc e was led to the effec t that the appellant was wearing a c ap at the partic ular time. Defenc e witnesses also stated that the appellant was not wearing any headgear. 

36     Applying the c lassific ation adopted in _Ng Kwee Leong_ to the present c ase, there were two reasons why these inc onsistenc ies did not affec t the c harge against the appellant. First, these disc repanc ies were not material sinc e it was not nec essary for the prosec ution to prove that the appellant had ac tually used the belt to assault Ridzuan (see 26-28 and 33 above), henc e falling under the first c ategory. Sec ondly, the disc repanc ies might be due to people giving separate ac c ounts as to short periods of time, henc e falling under the third c ategory. There was only a two to three minute interval between the time when the group c onfronted the vic tims and when Ridzuan was assaulted with a belt. Given the c haotic situation at that time, it would not be unusual for witnesses to c ome up with different ac c ounts of the same event. Further, Syarifa, Siti and Zakiah were at another barbec ue pit ‘N’ whic h was some ten metres away from the c onfrontation and, given that the park was dimly lit, might have affec ted the ac c urac y of their observations _vis--vis_ Ridzuan’s observations. 

37     The trial judge was therefore entitled to prefer the testimonies of the prosec ution witnesses. It should also be highlighted at this point that failure by the other vic tims to identify the appellant was of little weight c onsidering that the group was very large and it was only inevitable that the vic tims remembered different persons in the group. 

_(c) The quality of Ridzuan’s identification evidence was poor and should be rejected by the trial judge_ 

38     The judge followed the guidelines laid down by the Court of Appeal in _Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP_ <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 465</span> in assessing the weight of identific ation evidenc e. Essentially, there are three stages to the test. 

39     The first stage involves the trial judge asking himself whether the c ase against the ac c used depends wholly or substantially on the c orrec tness of the identific ation evidenc e that is alleged by the defenc e as being mistaken. If the first stage is answered in the affirmative, the sec ond question should be whether the identific ation evidenc e is of good quality, taking into ac c ount the c irc umstanc es in whic h the identific ation was made. If the quality of the identific ation evidenc e is poor, the judge should go on to the third stage whic h involves the question of whether there is any other evidenc e that goes to support the c orrec tness of the identific ation. At the third stage, if the judge is unable to find other supporting evidenc e for the identific ation evidenc e, he should be mindful that a c onvic tion based on suc h poor evidenc e would be unsafe. 


40     It was not in dispute that the c onvic tion depended wholly on Ridzuan’s identific ation evidenc e. The appellant c ontended under the sec ond stage of the _Heng Aik Ren Thomas_ test that the identific ation evidenc e was of poor quality and the trial judge should have gone on to look for supporting evidenc e. However, on the fac ts of the c ase, the judge was c ertainly entitled to c onc lude that the identific ation evidenc e was of good quality, c onsidering that Ridzuan was able to observe the appellant at c lose range, the area around the barbec ue pit was illuminated by lamp-posts, no obstruc tion obsc ured Ridzuan’s observations, the identific ation parade was c onduc ted just eight hours after the inc ident and there was a spec ial reason for Ridzuan to remember the appellant bec ause the appellant was holding a belt in his hands when the assembly approac hed the vic tims. 

_(d) Whether Ridzuan’s evidence required corroboration_ 

41     There is no mandatory requirement of independent c orroborating evidenc e before a trial judge c an c onvic t an ac c used based solely on the testimony of a minor: _Lee Kwang Peng v PP_ <span class="citation">[1997] 3 SLR 278</span>. It is a matter for the disc retion of the judge as to whether a witness is mature and reliable enough suc h that his testimony is c onsidered reliable without the need for independent c orroborating evidenc e. 

42     A trial judge who has had the benefit of observing the demeanour and c onduc t of the c hild witness would be in a far better position to dec ide if c orroboration is required in the c irc umstanc es of the c ase. An appellate c ourt would not readily interfere with suc h a finding: _Chen Jian Wei v PP_ <span class="citation">[2002] 2 SLR 255</span> at 34. In the present c ase, the trial judge had spec ific ally c onsidered c arefully whether c orroboration evidenc e was required before c onc luding that none was required. At 60 of his judgment, he stated as follows: 

 ...Ridzuan is a student who had passed his ‘N’ levels and awaiting his ‘O’ level results...he was aware of the implic ations of giving evidenc e on oath. Having heard his testimony and observed his demeanour I was satisfied that he has given a truthful ac c ount of the events as they oc c urred. He was a vic tim of an assault and not a bystander who would have been able to [remember] everything that happened. There were no material disc repanc ies or whimsic al c hanges in his testimony indic ating that he was unaware of the implic ations and c onsequenc es of lying on oath...There was no need for c orroborative evidenc e in view of the totality of the evidenc e. 

43     In my opinion, there were no grounds to overturn the exerc ise of the judge’s disc retion. As disc ussed in 33 above, any disc repanc y in Ridzuan’s evidenc e was immaterial to the c harge. Ridzuan was c onsistent on the material point all throughout the trial, namely, that he saw the appellant, with a belt in his hand, walking towards barbec ue pit ‘O’ in a group and remaining there before and during the fight. This was in marked c ontrast to the c hild witness in _Chen Jian Wei v PP_ who c hanged his testimony on a most material point upon knowing that the ac c used was ac tually being c harged with a more serious offenc e. The witness in _Chen Jian Wei v PP_ was c learly not mature enough to understand t he solemnity of giving evidenc e in c ourt. Ridzuan’s evidenc e might have c ontained some immaterial disc repanc ies, but it would be going too far to say that he was a ‘whimsic al’ witness whose evidenc e c ould not be relied upon without independent c orroborating evidenc e. 

**_Conclusion_** 


44     In my opinion, both grounds of appeal were unsustainable. On the totality of the evidenc e, the prosec ution had proven its c ase beyond a reasonable doubt. For the foregoing reasons, I ordered the appeal to be dismissed.
