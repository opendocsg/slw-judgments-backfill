1       This was an appeal against the dec ision of the distric t judge when he c onvic ted the two appellants on two c ounts eac h for having exhibited ‘c onduc t to the prejudic e of good order and disc ipline’ as members of the CIAS Auxiliary Polic e. Suc h c onduc t is an offenc e under Regulation 6(c ) of the Auxiliary Polic e Regulations (Cap 235) and is punishable under Regulation 10 of the said Regulations. The appellants were eac h sentenc ed to two weeks’ imprisonment on eac h c harge and both sentenc es were ordered to run c onc urrently. The appeal was brought against c onvic tion and sentenc e. At the end of the hearing before me, I dismissed the appeals against c onvic tion and allowed the appeals against sentenc e. I now give my reasons.

**Background facts** 

3       The first appellant was Wong Tiew Yong (“Wong”), the Direc tor of CIAS Auxiliary Polic e Forc e (“CIAS Polic e”). The sec ond appellant was Karuppiah Subramaniam (“Subramaniam”), an Inspec tor and the Offic erInCharge (“OC”) of the Task Forc e of CIAS Polic e. In 1998, Wong made three unoffic ial trips to China. These trips were in February 1998 (“February trip”), from 30 June 1998 to 18 July 1998 (“June trip”) and from 30 July 1998 to 9 August 1998 (“July trip”). On eac h of these trips, Kong Keng Shiong (“Kong”), then a Malaysian polic e c onstable attac hed to the Task Forc e of CIAS Polic e, ac c ompanied Wong. 

4       Kong was on medic al leave from August 1997 to April 1998 when he went on the February trip. As for the June and July trips, Kong was supposed to have performed afternoon shift duty work at the CIAS Polic e. Instead, he went on the June and July trips without applying for leave of 14 days and seven days respec tively. As CIAS Polic e was unaware of Kong’s absenc e from work during the June and July trips, Kong was paid his full monthly salary of $1,118.34 in August and September 1998. 

5       At trial, the prosec ution c ontended that both Wong and Subramaniam had instruc ted Kong (i) to ac c ompany Wong on the June and July trips and (ii) to go on these trips without applying for 


leave. Additionally, the prosec ution c laimed that Subramaniam had separately told Kong to falsely rec ord in his poc ket book that he was working at CIAS Polic e during the period of the June and July trips. The prosec ution’s c ase relied heavily on Kong’s testimony. 

**Prosecution’s version of the facts** 

**_The February trip_** 

6       Kong testified that he first c ame to know about the February trip while on medic al leave in Malaysia. Goh Ban Peng (“Goh”), a task forc e c olleague, had phoned to inform him that Wong wanted Kong to ac c ompany him on a trip to China. Goh revealed that Wong was going to meet a girl c alled Qin Qin in China and wanted Kong to ac t as his bodyguard. It was Wong’s desire to show Qin Qin that he was an important person. When Kong expressed his unwillingness, Goh c onvinc ed him by stating that the arrangement was Wong’s idea. Goh added that if Kong were not to go, his c areer would be adversely affec ted. As suc h, Kong agreed to follow Wong on the February trip. 

7       Before Kong left for the trip, he informed Subramaniam that he was ac c ompanying Wong to China on an assignment at Wong’s request. During this c onversation, Kong did not reveal the purpose of the February trip, as he had been told by Wong to keep it c onfidential. Kong c omplied with Wong’s instruc tions bec ause Wong was the top man in CIAS Polic e. Kong was therefore afraid that any nonc omplianc e with Wong’s request would indeed adversely affec t his c areer. 

**_The June trip_** 

8       Wong informed Kong about the June trip while they were in a c ar. Wong told Kong that his girlfriend in China had c heated him. As suc h, Wong wanted to go to China to c larify the matter. Wong stated that he wanted Kong to ac c ompany him on this trip to ac t as his bodyguard in China. Wong also informed Kong that he was not required to apply for leave to go on this trip, adding that he would speak to Subramaniam about the matter. After this, Subramaniam c alled Kong to his offic e and told Kong that he was required to be Wong’s bodyguard during a China trip. Subramaniam also advised Kong that he should c omply with Wong’s instruc tions for the sake of his c areer. Subramaniam then informed Kong that he was not required to apply for leave to go on the trip, adding that Kong was required to update his poc ket book as though he was on duty for the relevant period. 

9       Shortly before the June trip, Subramaniam asked Kong about Wong’s purpose in going to China. Despite Wong’s earlier c aution to keep the purpose of the trip c onfidential, Kong told Subramaniam that Wong had some problems with a girl there. Kong testified that he assumed Subramaniam already knew of Wong’s problems with the Chinese girl, as some task forc e c olleagues and Subramaniam had gossiped and joked in the c anteen about Wong’s affair with the girl. Kong added that Subramaniam had also brought up the topic about the girl after the February trip. When Kong returned to Singapore after the June trip, Subramaniam reminded Kong to update his poc ket book to reflec t that he was at work with CIAS Polic e during the relevant period. Kong c omplied with Subramaniam’s instruc tions. 

**_The July trip_** 

10     After the June trip, Wong told Kong that he needed to return to China to look up some friends. He wanted Kong to ac c ompany him on the trip as a bodyguard. Wong again informed Kong that he was not required to apply for leave and that he would speak to Subramaniam about the matter. After this c onversation, Subramaniam informed Kong that Wong required his c ompany on a China trip. Subramaniam added that Kong was not required to apply for leave for the July trip and that 


he should update his poc ket book to reflec t that he was performing afternoon shift duty during the period he was in China. After returning to Singapore, Kong filled up his poc ket book in ac c ordanc e with Subramaniam’s instruc tions. 

11     Kong also testified that at the material times, neither Wong nor Subramaniam informed him whether the June and July trips were offic ial. Kong was only told that they were overseas assignments. Kong, however, knew that the trips were to attend to Wong’s private affairs. Kong admitted that he should have applied for leave to go on suc h trips but had failed to do so bec ause Wong and Subramaniam had given instruc tions to the c ontrary. Kong c ould also not fathom that what Wong had done was ‘illegal’, as he was given to understand that Wong was entitled to bring an orderly on his overseas trips bec ause of his status. 

**Appellants’ version of the facts** 

12     Both Wong and Subramaniam denied the prosec ution’s c ontentions. Wong c laimed that he brought Kong on the three China trips as a Mandarin interpreter and not a bodyguard. He testified that Kong knew that the trips were unoffic ial and that he had only brought Kong along bec ause Goh was not available. As for the June trip, Wong c laimed that Kong had represented that he was still on medic al leave at that time, but was nevertheless keen on going. Before the July trip, Wong c laimed that he bumped into Kong at the CIAS Polic e premises when the latter c ame to tender a medic al doc ument. Wong asc ertained that Kong was keen to follow him to China again and that Kong was on leave at the material period. 

13     Wong testified that he had informed Subramaniam that he was bringing Kong on the three trips to China bec ause it was only c ourteous to do so, as Subramaniam was Kong’s OC. Wong, however, denied telling Subramaniam that the June and July trips were offic ial. Further, Wong denied telling Kong that he was not required to apply for leave to go on the trips, or that he (Wong) would be speaking to Subramaniam about the matter. Wong, however, added that he neither c hec ked when Kong’s medic al leave would expire nor took any step to verify whether Kong was indeed on suc h leave. 

14     Subramaniam, on the other hand, c laimed that he did not know about the February trip. As for the June and July trips, Subramaniam alleged that Wong had led him to believe that these were offic ial trips. Subramaniam disputed that he had persuaded Kong to go on these trips for the sake of his c areer. He also disputed that he had told Kong that he was not required to apply for leave to go on the trips. Additionally, Subramaniam c laimed that he was not present at the c anteen when the task forc e offic ers joked about Wong’s relationship with a Chinese girl. He also c laimed that he did not even know that Wong had a relationship with a Chinese girl. 

15     Further, Subramaniam denied that he told Kong to falsely rec ord in his poc ket book that he was performing afternoon shift duties at CIAS Polic e for the periods he was in China. Ac c ording to Subramaniam, he had in fac t instruc ted Kong to rec ord his ac tivities in China in the poc ket book, as the trips were offic ial. Subramaniam also intimated that Kong had the motivation to frame him due to some past differenc es. 

**The decision of the district judge** 

16     The distric t judge noted that c ounsel for Wong and Subramaniam had expended c onsiderable effort in disc rediting Kong, c laiming that Kong had falsely portrayed himself as a hapless subordinate. Counsel had also c laimed that Kong’s evidenc e was inherently inc redible, self-serving and that Kong had an interest in fabric ating evidenc e against both Wong and Subramaniam in order to esc ape 


possible AWOL and c heating c harges, as well as breac hes of the Polic e General Orders. The distric t judge c onsidered these c ontentions and rejec ted them. 

17     The distric t judge stated that he found Kong’s evidenc e to be c ogent and inherently plausible. Kong was a subordinate of Wong and Subramaniam; Wong was the ‘number 1’ man in CIAS Polic e and Subramaniam was Kong’s OC. The instruc tions for Kong to go on the June and July trips and to falsify the poc ket book entries had c ome from both of these higher-ranking men. Under the c irc umstanc es, the distric t judge found it understandable that Kong might have felt c ompelled to adhere with his superior’s instruc tions in order to preserve his c areer prospec ts. 

18     The distric t judge also noted that Kong’s evidenc e c ould not have been fabric ated. In the distric t judge’s view, Kong c ould not have ac ted alone in going on the June and July trips without applying for leave and making the false entries in his poc ket book. Additionally, Kong had not done these ac ts surreptitiously, but had in fac t travelled to China with the full knowledge of Wong, Subramaniam and other task forc e c olleagues. As suc h, there was no reason why Kong would want to rec ord in his poc ket book that he was working at CIAS Polic e at the material periods when both Wong and Subramaniam knew that he was in China. 

19     The distric t judge stated that the only c onc eivable reason why Kong had made the false entries was bec ause he was ac ting pursuant to Subramaniam’s instruc tions. Also, Kong c ould not have lied to Wong and Subramaniam about his work or leave status, as both Wong and Subramaniam were separately responsible for Kong’s daily work deployment and leave approval. As suc h, any disc repanc ies would have been apparent. 

20     The distric t judge also noted that Kong’s evidenc e was not self-serving. In his grounds of dec ision, the distric t judge stated that Kong had fully implic ated himself in his testimony without seeking to magnify the involvement of both ac c used persons. Kong had admitted from the outset that (i) the three trips to China were unoffic ial, (ii) he went on these trips without leave, (iii) he should apply for leave when going on unoffic ial trips and (iv) he made false entries in his poc ket book. Additionally, Kong had volunteered further information that implic ated him in respec t of other ac ts of misc onduc t. The distric t judge noted that it would have been more c onvenient for Kong not to testify on these if he were as untruthful and self-serving as the defenc e had alleged. 

21     The distric t judge also disbelieved Subramaniam’s evidenc e that Wong had told him that the June and July trips were offic ial. Subramaniam’s position was materially c ontradic ted when c onsidered in light of all the evidenc e. For instanc e, Wong had denied informing Subramaniam that the trips were offic ial. Further, Kong’s evidenc e suggested that Subramaniam knew the true nature of the two trips. 

22     As for the false poc ket book entries, the distric t judge observed that Subramaniam did not dispute the fac t that he did inform Kong to update his movements during the June and July trips in his poc ket book. Kong had testified that Subramaniam reminded him to reflec t in his poc ket book that he was working on the afternoon shift during the relevant period. The distric t judge elec ted to believe Kong’s testimony in this regard and thus found Subramaniam’s instruc tions to be improper, given that Kong did not perform any duty at the CIAS Polic e at the material time. 

23     After arriving at the dec ision to c onvic t, the distric t judge then c onsidered the aggravating fac tors of the c ase in dec iding on sentenc ing. He noted that the ac c used persons’ misc onduc t fell within the higher end of the sc ale of disc iplinary misc onduc t envisaged in Regulation 10. Wong was also the most senior law enforc ement offic er at the CIAS Polic e. Subramaniam was an Inspec tor with more than 20 years of working experienc e at the CIAS Polic e. The distric t judge observed that these very senior offic ers had grossly abused their authority by instigating a c onstable to absent himself 


without offic ial leave so that he c ould be a personal attendant and esc ort during Wong’s personal trips. 

24     The distric t judge noted that suc h misc onduc t not only amounted to a misuse of funds and resourc es but had also tarnished the image of CIAS Polic e. The distric t judge also noted that the ac c used persons’ misc onduc t was not a one-off offenc e c ommitted on impulse, but was perpetrated on two separate oc c asions resulting in Kong being AWOL for a signific ant period of three weeks. Additionally, the distric t judge stated that c ounsel had not c ited anything exc eptional in mitigation. Under the c irc umstanc es, a c ustodial sentenc e would be more appropriate than a fine. As suc h, Wong and Subramaniam were sentenc ed to two weeks’ imprisonment on eac h c harge, the sentenc es to run c onc urrently. 

**Wong’s appeal against conviction** 

25     Counsel for the appellant, Wong, advanc ed three main grounds of appeal: 

 (1) that the evidenc e did not show that Wong instigated Kong to absent himself from duty without leave or good c ause; 

 (2) that the prosec ution had not disc harged the burden of proving that Kong lac ked the motive to falsely implic ate Wong; and 

 (3) that the evidenc e did not reveal the requisite guilty knowledge on the part of Wong. 

26     I shall now deal with these arguments in turn. 

**_Whether the evidence showed that Wong instigated Kong to absent himself from duty without leave or good cause_** 

27     Counsel for Wong c ontended that the distric t judge erred in law and fac t by believing Kong’s evidenc e. I did not agree with this c ontention. The distric t judge was very thorough in his examination of the evidenc e. He was mindful of the fac t that the prosec ution’s c ase hinged on Kong’s testimony and that Kong ac tually fell within the c lass of ‘ac c omplic es’, as defined in _Davis v DPP_ [1954] AC 378 at 400. As suc h, his grounds of dec ision were detailed and reflec ted muc h c aution. He had sc rutinised the testimonies of all the witnesses with c are and had eventually c ome to the dec ision to believe Kong instead of Wong. Essentially, he had found that Kong was a c redible witness despite the adverse c ontentions of c ounsel at the trial stage. 

28     There was a further c ontention that the distric t judge erred in finding that Wong was the person who would have authorised Kong’s leave applic ation. Counsel for Wong argued that the CIAS Polic e Human Resourc e Manual allowed for Wong to delegate his leave authorising duties. That being the c ase, Wong need not have been the person who direc tly approved (or disapproved) Kong’s leave. At any one point, Wong would not have known if Kong was on leave or otherwise. Therefore, c ounsel for Wong c laimed that the distric t judge was wrong to c onc lude that Wong had ac tual knowledge that Kong was not on leave when he went with him (Wong) on the two (June and July) trips. I disagreed with this c ontention. The distric t judge was entitled to arrive at this c onc lusion from his evaluation of all the evidenc e before him. He had found, as a matter of fac t, that Wong had _told_ Kong that he was not required to apply for leave for the duration of the two trips. Therefore, c ounsels’ c ontention regarding the Human Resourc e Manual neither added to nor altered this fac t. 

29     Counsel for Wong also c laimed that Kong’s evidenc e was self-serving and inc redible. 


However, this c laim was a repetition of his c ontention at the trial. The distric t judge had already stated in his grounds of dec ision that this c ontention was not ac c urate and had disposed of the issue. As suc h, an appellate c ourt would be slow to disturb the distric t judge’s finding of fac t, whic h was based on his assessment of the witnesses. At this junc ture, it would be useful to refer to _PP v Azman bin Abdullah_ <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 704</span> at 710, where I affirmed the following princ iple: 

 It was well-settled law that in any appeal against a finding of fac t, an appellate c ourt would generally defer to the c onc lusion of the trial judge who had the opportunity to see and assess the c redibility of the witnesses. An appellate c ourt, if it wished to reverse the trial judge’s dec ision, had to not merely entertain doubts whether the dec ision was right but had to be c onvinc ed that it was wrong 

On the evidenc e before him, the distric t judge was not wrong to arrive at this c onc lusion with regard to Kong’s c redibility. Therefore, I did not disturb his findings. 

**_Whether the prosecution had discharged the burden of proving that Kong lacked the motive to falsely implicate Wong_** 

30     Counsel for Wong c ontended that, sinc e Kong had every reason to implic ate him, the burden of proving a lac k of motive on the part of Kong to falsely implic ate Wong lay on the prosec ution. The distric t judge, therefore, had erred by plac ing the burden on the defenc e to prove suc h a motive. Counsel for Wong relied on the c ase of _Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP_ <span class="citation">[1995] 2 SLR 767</span> to buttress this point regarding the alloc ation of the burden of proof. 

31     This c ontention c ould not be supported. The distric t judge had not _actually_ plac ed the burden on the defenc e to prove that Kong had a motive to falsely implic ate Wong. In fac t, the distric t judge had sc rutinised Kong’s evidenc e with muc h c aution before asc ertaining that Kong had no reason (or motive, for that matter) to falsely implic ate Wong. The prosec ution was thus not required to prove a lac k of suc h a motive on Kong’s part, as the distric t judge had already found from the outset that Kong did not have suc h a motive. 

**_Whether the evidence revealed the requisite guilty knowledge on the part of Wong_** 

32     Counsel for Wong c ontended that there was no reason for him to instruc t Kong not to apply for leave for the trips, as Wong c ould have asked someone else to c ome along for the trip to China if Kong did not wish to go there or apply for leave. With regard to this partic ular c ontention, it was notable that the distric t judge had already found Wong’s defenc e to be inherently inc redible. He believed Kong when he testified that Wong knew that he (Kong) had been bac k at work sinc e May 

1998\. As suc h, Wong would have known that Kong would have to apply for leave to go on the June and July trips. The distric t judge had also found that Wong _had_ informed Kong that he was not required to apply for leave during the material periods. As the distric t judge had found Kong’s evidenc e to be c ogent and inherently plausible, I saw no reason to disturb his well-reasoned finding. 

33     On the totality of the evidenc e before me, and c onsidering c ounsel’s submissions, I found no reason to c onc lude that the distric t judge had erred in c onvic ting the first appellant, Wong. The distric t judge’s findings were c arefully made and well supported on the evidenc e. As suc h, I dismissed the first appellant’s appeal against c onvic tion. I now turn to the sec ond appellant, Subramaniam’s, appeal against c onvic tion before c onsidering both appellants’ appeal against sentenc e. 

**Subramaniam’s appeal against conviction** 


34     Counsel for the appellant, Subramaniam, laid down several broad c ontentions. In sum, seven main grounds of appeal c ould be disc erned: 

 1) that it was unc lear if Kong had ac tually told Subramaniam that the trips were unoffic ial; 

 2) that Subramaniam had not told Kong to make false entries in his poc ket book in respec t of the June and July trips; 

 3) that Kong was Wong’s ac c omplic e; 

 4) that Kong was not a c redible witness and that his evidenc e was self-serving; 

 5) that the distric t judge erred in his finding that Kong felt c ompelled to c omply with Subramaniam’s instruc tions; 

 6) that Wong and Kong worked hand in glove to implic ate Subramaniam; and 

 7) that Kong resiled on material admissions. 

35     I shall now deal with these arguments in turn. 

**_Whether Subramaniam knew that the trips were unofficial_** 

36     Counsel for Subramaniam c ontended that it was unc lear if Kong had ac tually told him that the trips were unoffic ial. In this regard, c ounsel doubted Kong’s c redibility and stated that the distric t judge had erred in believing Kong. This argument c ould not be ac c epted. First, the distric t judge had found _as a matter of fact_ that Kong was a c redible witness. He had arrived at this finding of fac t after muc h deliberation. He had also c autioned himself against ac c epting Kong’s evidenc e without deep sc rutiny, as Kong fell within the c ategory of ‘ac c omplic es’ as spec ified in _Davis v PP_. As he had reac hed a well-reasoned and c areful c onc lusion in this respec t, I saw no reason to disturb his finding. Sec ond, the distric t judge had noted that Kong’s evidenc e suggested that Subramaniam knew the true nature of the June and July trips. Third, Wong had denied informing Subramaniam that the trips were offic ial. In this regard, the distric t judge had c arefully weighed the evidenc e before him and c hose to believe Wong’s evidenc e on this. He found that Wong’s evidenc e c orroborated Kong’s testimony that Subramaniam was aware that the trips were not offic ial. 

**_Whether Subramaniam had told Kong to make false entries in his pocket book in respect of the June and July trips_** 

37     Counsel for Subramaniam c ontended that the distric t judge had erred in disbelieving his evidenc e with regard to his denial that he had asked Kong to falsify the poc ket book entries. However, on the evidenc e before him, the distric t judge was entitled to make suc h a finding. He had found that Subramaniam’s defenc e was c ontrived and artific ial. He noted that Subramaniam had not disputed that he had informed Kong to update his movements for the June and July trips in his poc ket book. That being the c ase, the distric t judge was only left to find if Subramaniam had indeed instruc ted Kong to falsely update his poc ket book. In this respec t, he found that Kong’s evidenc e was more c ogent and c learly showed that Subramaniam _had_ given these improper instruc tions. Additionally, Subramaniam’s lac kadaisic al attitude towards the inspec tion of poc ket books c ast suspic ion on his c ontentions. In this regard, I found the distric t judge’s reasoning to be well supported and well reasoned and, therefore dec lined to disturb his finding. 


38     Counsel further argued that there was no nec essity for Subramaniam to instruc t Kong to make false poc ket book entries if he knew that the trips were unoffic ial and that Kong was on unoffic ial leave. With regard to this c ontention, the distric t judge had reasoned that Subramaniam had always dutifully c omplied with Wong’s orders. He found that in light of the relationship between Subramaniam and Wong, it was not implausible that Subramaniam fac ilitated Wong in his unoffic ial trips to China. The distric t judge stated that this was the reason why Subramaniam had (i) persuaded Kong to ac c ompany Wong on the China trips without applying for leave and (ii) instruc ted Kong to falsify the poc ket book entries ac c ordingly. 

39     Counsel also argued that Kong had made false entries on his own or on Wong’s instruc tions. Strangely, nothing in the notes of evidenc e supported suc h a c ontention. Additionally, the distric t judge had already found that it was Subramaniam who had instruc ted Kong to falsify the poc ket book entries. This argument, therefore, was pure spec ulation and had already been proven otherwise. 

40     Counsel for Subramaniam also c ontended that Kong had been inc onsistent in his evidenc e pertaining to the false poc ket book entries. Counsel referred to a portion of Kong’s testimony under c ross-examination at trial. However, it is apparent from the selfsame portion of the c ross-examination that Kong had ac tually c onsistently maintained that he had falsely updated the poc ket book only after Subramaniam had instruc ted or reminded him to do so. In fac t, this argument ac tually c onfirmed that Subramaniam had indeed instruc ted Kong to falsify the poc ket book entries. 

**_Whether Kong was an accomplice_** 

41     Counsel for Subramaniam submitted that the distric t judge should have, in the interests of justic e and princ iples of fair hearing, sc rutinised and weighed c arefully the evidenc e of Kong, sinc e Kong was an ac c omplic e. However, I found that the distric t judge _had_ sc rutinised Kong’s evidenc e with muc h c aution before dec iding to rely on it. He had rec ognised that Kong fell within the c ategory of ‘ac c omplic es’, as laid down in _Davis v DPP_. The distric t judge had in fac t proc eeded with c are when analysing and relying on Kong’s evidenc e. 

42     Subramaniam also c ontended that Kong had testified against him bec ause Kong was aware that he might be c harged for an offenc e in the future and was hoping not to be c harged. However, on a perusal of the distric t judge’s grounds of dec ision, it was apparent to me that the distric t judge had already assessed this point suffic iently. He had noted that Kong was under the impression that he would be prosec uted even if he implic ated Subramaniam (and/or Wong). Ac c ording to Kong, the CPIB did not promise to waive prosec ution against him should he implic ate Subramaniam and Wong. 

**_Whether Kong was a credible witness and whether his evidence was self-serving_** 

43     Several c ontentions were made suggesting that Kong had implic ated Subramaniam in order to materially minimise his c ulpability. As suc h, c ounsel for Subramaniam submitted that Kong was not a c redible witness and that his evidenc e was self-serving. These arguments were a repetition of the very same arguments that had already been dealt with at the trial stage. The distric t judge was entitled to find that Kong was a c redible witness. As mentioned earlier, the c ase of _PP v Azman bin Abdullah_ is authority for the proposition that an appellate c ourt should be slow to disturb a distric t judge’s finding of fac t. Sinc e the distric t judge had already adequately dec ided on this matter, I did not disturb his findings. 

**_Whether the district judge erred in his finding that Kong felt compelled to comply with Subramaniam’s instructions_** 


44     Counsel for Subramaniam argued that it was untrue that Kong was c ompelled to c omply with his instruc tions to falsify the poc ket book entries. Further, it was c ontended that Kong was attempting to portray an image of a young, inexperienc ed junior c onstable who was exploited by his superiors. I disagreed with these c ontentions. At trial, the distric t judge had found that Kong was truthful when he testified that he felt some pressure to c omply with his superiors’ instruc tions (e.g. Subramaniam’s instruc tions to falsify the poc ket book) fearing that non-c omplianc e would affec t his c areer. To this extent, the distric t judge found Kong’s evidenc e c ogent and inherently plausible. 

45     Additionally, c ounsel argued that Kong should have just c omplained against Subramaniam’s impropriety instead of having c omplied with his instruc tions. Here, I agreed with the distric t judge’s finding that it was naïve to expec t Kong to openly c omplain about his superiors’ misc onduc t without any apprehension of the reperc ussions. Although Kong had, on a previous oc c asion, c omplained about Subramaniam to the Deputy Direc tor of CIAS Polic e, that oc c asion was with regard to Subramaniam overlooking Kong for a c ourse. Here, the potential c omplaint was with referenc e to impropriety on the part of his superiors. As suc h, the apprehension on the part of Kong would be warranted, c onsidering the entirely different c irc umstanc es. In any c ase, this argument was spec ulative and did not affec t the distric t judge’s finding that Subramaniam did indeed instruc t Kong to falsely update his poc ket book. 

**_Whether Wong and Kong worked hand in glove to implicate Subramaniam_** 

46     Counsel for Subramaniam theorised, here, that Wong and Kong had worked together to give Subramaniam the impression that the trips were offic ial in nature. Subramaniam was thus fooled by Wong and Kong and ended up being implic ated. I found this theory to be spec ulation and rejec ted it. For one, Subramaniam had not adduc ed any evidenc e to support this theory. Further, the distric t judge had already noted that Subramaniam and Wong enjoyed a c lose relationship and that Subramaniam would have fac ilitated Wong’s ac tions. That being the c ase, Wong would not have needed to fool Subramaniam into believing that the trips were offic ial. In fac t, the distric t judge had found that Subramaniam had knowledge that the trips were not offic ial and had in fac t enc ouraged Kong to ac c ompany Wong. 

**_Whether Kong resiled on material admissions_** 

47     Counsel c ontended that Kong’s testimony had plenty of disc repanc ies within it. As suc h, c ounsel c laimed that the distric t judge had erred in his fac t-finding by relying on Kong’s evidenc e. I dismissed this argument on the basis that the distric t judge had arrived at a well-reasoned dec ision on the selfsame issue. In fac t, the distric t judge _had_ noted that some minor disc repanc ies were present in Kong’s testimony, indic ating that the distric t judge had indeed thought through the issue of disc repanc ies. However, he had found that these disc repanc ies were more apparent than real and c ould be attributed to a genuine c onfusion in Kong’s mind. 

48     Nevertheless, the disc repanc ies did not relate to a material issue in c ontention. The distric t judge had ac c urately pointed out that the disc repanc ies were noted at Kong’s c rossexamination by c ounsel for Subramaniam. In that c ross-examination, the manner in whic h the China trips were desc ribed was put to sc rutiny. For instanc e, Kong had desc ribed the trips as being ‘unoffic ial’ as opposed to c ounsel for Subramaniam, who had desc ribed the trips as ‘illegal’. The distric t judge then found that the manner in desc ribing the China trips c ould not be said to be a real disc repanc y. It was simply a matter of loose desc ription and c ould not amount to a material disc repanc y. Sinc e this issue had been very adequately reasoned out I did not disturb this part of the distric t judge’s findings. 


49     On the whole, c ounsel’s submissions did not give me a reason to c onc lude that the distric t judge had erred in c onvic ting the sec ond appellant, Subramaniam. On the c ontrary, I found that the distric t judge had weighed the evidenc e before him very c arefully and had c ome to an ac c urate dec ision. As suc h, I dismissed the sec ond appellant’s appeal against c onvic tion. I now deal with both the appellants’ appeals against sentenc e. 

**The appeals against sentence** 

50     Counsel for both the appellants c ontended that the sentenc e imposed by the distric t judge was manifestly exc essive. They argued that the distric t judge had failed to take into ac c ount several mitigating fac tors. Essentially, they disagreed that a c ustodial sentenc e was appropriate and appealed for a fine instead. Although I agreed with the appellants that a c ustodial sentenc e was not nec essary, I disagreed with their arguments to this effec t. I first dealt with these arguments before moving on to explain why a fine (as opposed to a c ustodial sentenc e) should have been imposed instead. 

**_Wong’s appeal against sentence_** 

51     First, c ounsel for Wong c ontended that a breac h of Auxiliary Polic e Regulations is dealt with internally, with disc iplinary ac tion being imposed internally as well. Sec ond, he c ontended that there were exc eptional mitigating fac tors in the c ase. For instanc e, Wong had made signific ant c ontributions to the CIAS over the last 20 years. He relied on the dec ision of _Harry Lee Wee v PP_ [1980] 2 MLJ 56 to argue that suc h signific ant c ontributions should have been taken into ac c ount in sentenc ing. Additionally, c ounsel for Wong c laimed that the fac t that this was his first offenc e should be a fac tor to be taken into ac c ount. He relied on the c ase of _Tan Sai Tiang v PP_ <span class="citation">[2000] 1 SLR 439</span> to buttress this point. 

52     I dealt, first, with the c ontention on internal disc iplinary ac tion. An offic er in breac h of Regulation 6 of the Auxiliary Polic e Regulations (Cap. 235) may be prosec uted in c ourt and sentenc ed to a maximum fine of $500 or to imprisonment for a term not exc eeding three months or to both. The provision that allows for this is Regulation 10 of the Auxiliary Polic e Regulations. Sinc e the distric t judge had c harged Wong for an offenc e under Regulation 6 read with Regulation 10 of the Auxiliary Polic e Regulations, Wong c ould be prosec uted in c ourt and sentenc ed upon c onvic tion. As suc h, Wong’s c ontention failed. 

53     Next, I dealt with the c ontention that there were exc eptional mitigating fac tors in the c ase. Counsel for Wong c ontended that the c ase of _Harry Lee Wee_ stood for the proposition that c ertain signific ant c ontributions by an appellant c ould be taken into ac c ount in sentenc ing. In _Harry Lee Wee_ , the appellant’s regular servic e to the Counc il of Law Soc iety and his 18 years of servic e at the Law Fac ulty were taken into ac c ount in sentenc ing. In that c ase, the appellant’s c ontributions resulted in a reduc tion in the amount of a fine that was imposed on the appellant. 

54     It was true that the distric t judge had not c onsidered the _Harry Lee Wee_ c ase in his grounds of dec ision on sentenc ing. However, c ounsel for Wong was inc orrec t to say that the distric t judge had therefore not taken into ac c ount Wong’s c ontributions. The distric t judge, in his grounds of dec ision, had stated that there were c lear aggravating fac tors in the c ase that he took into ac c ount in sentenc ing. One of these aggravating fac tors was the fac t that Wong was the most senior law enforc ement offic er at CIAS Polic e. Notably, the distric t judge had c ommented on the fac t that Wong had ac tually abused his very status to c ommit the offenc es. As suc h, it was apparent that the distric t judge had indeed c onsidered Wong’s position, seniority and c ontributions when dec iding on the sentenc e. I disagreed therefore with c ounsel’s c ontention. 


55     Counsel for Wong also relied on the ‘c lang of the prison gates’ princ iple adopted in _Tan Sai Tiang_ <span class="citation">[2000] 1 SLR 439</span>. They referred to paragraph 39 of my dec ision in _Tan Sai Tiang_ : 

 The ‘c lang of the prison gates’ princ iple that was artic ulated by LP Thean J (as he then was) in Siah Ooi Choe v PP was adopted from the English dec ision of R v Jones ... This princ iple states that when an older person in his 40s or 50s is c onvic ted for the first time, the mere fac t that he goes to prison at all is a very grave punishment indeed. 

Counsel for Wong c laimed that the fac t that an older person like him had c ommitted an offenc e for the first time should be a fac tor to be c onsidered in sentenc ing. Notably, this c ase (and the ‘c lang of the prison gates’ princ iple) was not brought to the attention of the distric t judge during the plea-inmitigation. However, the distric t judge did note that Wong’s misc onduc t was not a one-off offenc e c ommitted on impulse, but one that was perpetrated _on two separate occasions_. 

56     It would, therefore, be inc orrec t to say that what Wong had done was ac tually a first offenc e. They were ac tually offenc es c ommitted in suc c ession and over a period of time, albeit a short period. It is true that, generally, an offender’s lac k of prior c onvic tions c an be of value in mitigation. However, this is not always the c ase. I held in _Chen Weixiong Jerriek v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[2003] SGHC 103</span> that the disc retion remains with the c ourt to refuse to c onsider someone as a first time offender if he has been c harged with multiple offenc es. This is the position even if the person does not have prior c onvic tions. As suc h, it c ould not be said that Wong was a first offender and that suc h a c onsideration should be taken into ac c ount in mitigation when it c ame to sentenc ing. 

57     Additionally, the benefit of the ‘c lang of the prison gates’ princ iple must not be weighed in Wong’s favour. Counsel for Wong had not relied on a material portion of my dec ision in _Tan Sai Tiang_ (at paragraph 40), to whic h I now refer: 

 Now, the underlying premise of the ‘c lang of the prison gates’ princ iple is not that, where first time offenders are c onc erned, the mere fac t that a jail sentenc e has been imposed is punishment enough. The ac tual basis for the applic ation of this princ iple is that the shame of going to prison is suffic ient punishment for that partic ular person c onvic ted. As suc h, in order for the princ iple to be applic able, the c onvic ted person must have been a person of eminenc e who had previously held an important position or was of high standing in soc iety. In other words, it would hardly ever apply in most c ases dealing with members of soc iety who had never held an important post or were persons or suffic ient standing in the eyes of soc iety. 

In the present appeal, Wong seemingly falls into this exc eptional c ategory of persons to whom the ‘c lang of the prison gates’ princ iple would apply. He was the Direc tor of CIAS Polic e and c ould, therefore, be noted to have been “a person of eminenc e who had previously held an important position or was of high standing in soc iety”. 

58     However, the fac t that Wong had abused this very position of eminenc e to c ommit the offenc es took him out of the exc eptional c ategory of persons to whom the princ iple applies. Wong c ould not argue that, sinc e he fit this exc eptional c ategory very neatly, he c ould therefore avail himself of the princ iple. Suc h an argument moc ks the rationale behind the ‘c lang of the prison gates’ princ iple. As a matter of logic , suc h an argument must fail. A person who had abused his status of eminenc e to c ommit an offenc e should not then be allowed to use that very status to his advantage. 

**_Subramaniam’s appeal against sentence_** 

59     Counsel for Subramaniam c ontended that the offenc es were minor and only c arry a 


maximum fine of $500, or imprisonment up to three months, or both. Additionally, c ounsel stated that the distric t judge did not c onsider the fac t that Subramaniam had served CIAS Polic e for 20 years. They also c laimed that Subramaniam had not initiated the offenc es and that the offenc es were also not c ommitted for the benefit of Subramaniam. Further, c ounsel for Subramaniam c ontended that the distric t judge had erred in imposing the same sentenc e on Subramaniam as he did on Wong, as the distric t judge’s findings revealed a greater c ulpability on the part of Wong. Counsel also stated that sinc e CIAS is not a public body, the distric t judge’s statement that public funds and resourc es had been misused was an error. 

60     I disagreed with the c ontention that the distric t judge had failed to take into ac c ount Subramaniam’s term of servic e with CIAS Polic e. The distric t judge had expressly stated in his grounds of dec ision that Subramaniam had c ommitted the offenc es in his c apac ity as a very senior offic er. In this regard, the distric t judge had mentioned the fac t that Subramaniam had served with CIAS Polic e for the past 20 years. As suc h, c onsideration _was_ given to Subramaniam’s servic e status. Therefore, c ounsel for Subramaniam was inac c urate in his c ontention. 

61     The distric t judge had also imposed the same sentenc e on Subramaniam as he did on Wong bec ause he had found that _both_ of them had grossly abused their authority by instigating Kong to AWOL and serve as Wong’s personal esc ort. To this extent, there was nothing in the distric t judge’s grounds of dec ision that showed that he had found Wong to be more c ulpable in c omparison to Subramaniam. The distric t judge had not erred in exerc ising his disc retion to sentenc e both Wong and Subramaniam similarly. 

62     Subramaniam’s c ontention that CIAS is not a public body was not a c onsideration that should be taken into ac c ount in sentenc ing. Although the distric t judge might have erred in stating that public funds and resourc es had been misused, this error did not affec t his dec ision in sentenc ing. It simply reflec ted the fac t that a waste of resourc es (be they public or private funds) had oc c urred. 

**My decision on sentence** 

63     Although I disagreed with c ounsel for the appellants with regard to their substantive grounds of appeal on the sentenc e, I did agree that a c ustodial sentenc e was inappropriate in these c irc umstanc es. What the appellants had done in this c ase was unbec oming of senior offic ers. It offended against the c ode of c onduc t whic h our uniformed personnel take pride in. I did not endorse their ac tions and severely reprimanded them for suc h foolish behaviour. However, to impose a c ustodial sentenc e for suc h behaviour was exc essive, as c ounsel rightly c ontended. In my opinion, a fine would have been more appropriate. 

64     Interestingly, the DPP had relied on _Public Prosecutor v Ong Teck Huat_ <span class="citation">[1993] 2 SLR 645</span> as an analogy to affirm the sentenc e that was imposed by the distric t judge. The ac c used in _Ong Teck Huat_ was c harged with c onduc t to the prejudic e of good order and disc ipline of the Polic e Forc e under Sec tion 27(1) of the Polic e Forc e Ac t (Cap. 235). Although the c harges in the c urrent c ase differ from those in _Ong Teck Huat_ , both c ases involved c onduc t that was prejudic ial to the good order and disc ipline of uniformed units. In _Ong Teck Huat_ , the respondent was a polic e offic er who had rec eived reports of a polic e anti-vic e raid on a hotel in the c ourse of his duty. He then tipped off an ac quaintanc e of his, whom he knew to be involved in vic e ac tivities at the hotel, about the raid. In that c ase, I c onvic ted the respondent and imposed a fine of $500 instead of a sentenc e of imprisonment. 

65     Now, the DPP argued that the fac ts in _Ong Teck Huat_ made out a less severe aspec t of the offenc e than the fac ts in the c urrent appeal. As suc h, the DPP argued that a c ustodial sentenc e 


would be more appropriate in this appeal. I disagreed with this c ontention. To the c ontrary, the fac ts of the present appeal are less severe than those in _Ong Teck Huat_. The prejudic e to the good order and disc ipline of the Polic e Forc e in _Ong Teck Huat_ was higher and of a different level. If a fine was imposed as the appropriate sentenc e in _Ong Teck Huat_ , I do not see how a fine would then not be appropriate in the present appeal as well. 

66     However, I must add that the penalties presc ribed in Regulation 10 of the Auxiliary Polic e Regulations are rather unsatisfac tory. Ac c ording to Regulation 10, a c ourt may impose upon an offender a term of imprisonment that does not exc eed three months or a fine not exc eeding $500 or both. I have dec ided that a c ustodial sentenc e would not be appropriate in this instanc e. That leaves me to impose a maximum fine of just $500. For one, if sentenc es are presc ribed to c arry with them some form of deterrenc e value, I do not see how a fine of $500 c an ac hieve maximum deterrenc e. Further, requiring the appellants to only pay a paltry sum for their offenc es would be too light a punishment for their unbec oming behaviour. 

67     I, therefore, question the suffic ienc y of the maximum fine presc ribed in Regulation 10. In my opinion, the maximum fine presc ribed should have been far higher than what it is c urrently. In that way, it will have some value of deterrenc e about it. Additionally, people like the appellants fall in the ‘in-between’ c ategories of offenders; they need not be imprisoned and yet should not be let off with too light a fine as well. With the existenc e of provisions suc h as Regulation 10, c ourts remain tied by the stric t letter of the law. 

68     However, sinc e this is a matter best left to the legislature, I ac c ordingly altered the appellants’ sentenc e and imposed a fine of $500 on eac h c harge, in default of whic h a sentenc e of two weeks of imprisonment on eac h c harge was imposed.
