: **_The claim_** 

This is a c laim for c onversion of a parc el of marine gas oil (MGO) whic h was in the tanks of a tanker ship c alled `Tokai Maru`. There is an additional c laim for c onversion of bunkering equipment and provisions. The c laimants, Kohap (Hong Kong) Ltd, were sub-time-c harterers of the tanker. The defendants were the owners of the tanker. There is an alternate c laim for breac h of duty based on bailment. 

**_The ship purchases_** 

The princ ipal players of this c ase are two businessmen: Albert Lim Liang Chai and Johnny Tay Siong Siew. Their business was shipowning and ship-operation. To get a full fac tual matrix it is nec essary to travel bac k in time a little. 

On 22 November 1991 three tankers were sold by c ompanies c ontrolled by Albert Lim to c ompanies c ontrolled by Johnny Tay. The partic ulars are as follows: 

 The ship : The Sea Sourc es: The Sellers : Sea Sourc es Trading Pte Ltd The Buyers : Cotan Petroleum Pte Ltd The Pric e S$600,000 S$300,000 to be paid immediately. The balanc e was payable in 36 monthly instalments of S$8,333. c ommenc ing on 22.11.91 and ending on 21.11.94. The ship : The Sea Endeavour: The Sellers : Hozun Oil Trading Pte Ltd The Buyers : Cotan Investments (S) Pte Ltd 


 The Pric e : S$700,000 $300,000 to be paid immediately. The balanc e was payable in 36 monthly instalments of S$11,111. eac h. The first was payable on 22.11.91 and the last on 21.11.94. The ship : The Sea Enterprise The Sellers : Seawell Petroleum Pte Ltd. The Buyers : Cotan Energy and Trading Pte Ltd The Pric e : S$550,000 S$300,000 to be paid forthwith. The rest was payable 36 monthly instalments of S$6,944.44 c ommenc ing on 22.11.91 and ending on 21.11.94. 

Johnny Tay`s c ompanies will be c ollec tively c alled `the Cotan c ompanies`. 

Johnny Tay and Madam Yap Hong Luan [c ommat] Ernie Surjati Djapri (`Ernie Yap`) were the direc tors of the Cotan c ompanies whic h purc hased the three vessels. As suc h they signed a guarantee for the outstanding amount in respec t of eac h purc hase. 

**_The main charterparty_** 

The defendants, Sea Sourc es Trading Pte Ltd, the owners of the Tokai Maru at the relevant time were a Singapore c ompany. By a time c harterparty dated 2 February 1994 they c hartered out the ship to Cotan Petroleum Pte Ltd. It was for a period of one year with an option for another year. The time-c harter was in the standard form of SHELLTIME-4 with additional c lauses. 

Clause 13 provided, inter alia, that `The master (though appointed by the Owners) shall be under the orders and direc tion of the vessel, agenc y and arrangements and shall sign bills of lading as c harterers or their agents may direc t`. 

Clause 18 and 46 of the main c harterparty permitted sub-letting of the ship. 

Clause 48 provided, inter alia, that `the vessel is to be delivered in a suitable c ondition for loading of the c harterer`s intended c argo and to be redelivered in the c ondition as delivery`. 

Clause 49 provided that `The c argo is to be disc harged into fishing vessels in the open Pac ific and Indian Oc ean and Arafura Sea and other ac c eptable area ac c ording to and c harterers` instruc tions to the Master of the vessel during the voyage.` 

Clause 57 provided that `The owner will agree to provide 16 c rews members, ie inc luding four KoreanChinese c rews subjec t to availability`. 

**_The sub-time-charter_** 


Cotan Petroleum Pte Ltd as c harters/owners let, that is to say sub-let the tanker to `Kohap (Hong Kong) Limited or nominees`. The sub-time-c harter c harterparty was also in SHELLTIME-4 form. In the result, the main c harterparty and the sub-c harterparty c ontained several c ommon c lauses. 

The c harterers did not reveal the partic ulars of the sub-c harter or the sub-c harterparty nor even their name to the owners. This was normal bec ause c harterers as a rule would not want the owners to know the rate of hire of the sub-c harter. Further, if the owners got to know the sub-c harterers there is a risk of the owner and sub-c harterer by-passing the c harterer in future business. 

**_Withdrawal of the vessel_** 

The tanker was delivered to the time-c harterers and, therefore, in turn to the sub-c harterers on 17 Marc h 1994. The tanker operated mainly in international waters. While the tanker was on c harter servic e, the c harterers paid to the owners the hire for the first month but failed to pay hire for the sec ond month. On ac c ount of this the owners withdrew the tanker from c harter that is to say they brought the c harter to an end alleging breac h by c harterers. 

At the time of the withdrawal there remained on board the `Tokai Maru` a c argo of marine gas oil (MGO) and equipment whic h had been plac ed on board the tanker pursuant to terms of the subc harter and the c harter. They were: 

(a) marine gas oil (MGO) 

(b) refrigerator oil 

(c ) bunkering equipment 

(d) provisions 

(e) two water makers 

The agents of the sub-c harterers Wonjin International asked the c harterer to arrange for the transfer of the MGO and equipment. This did not materialise. (More will be said about this later). The subc harterers` personnel, however, left the tanker. 

**_Indebtedness of Cotan Companies and set-off_** 

At this time the Cotan c ompanies were indebted to Albert Lim`s c ompanies fully $500,000. It had been outstanding for some time. The debt was in respec t of the tankers purc hased by the Cotan c ompanies from Albert Lim c ompanies as stated in [para ] 3. It is to be remembered that Johnny Tay and Ernie Yap by reason of the personal guarantees were jointly and severally liable to Albert Lim c ompanies for the debts. 

In these c irc umstanc es, Albert Lim, on behalf of the owners arranged for the sale of the MGO on board the `Tokai Maru`. At the time of the withdrawal the amount of bunkers on board was 905. m.t. From this he deduc ted 39.612 mt as this was the quantity of bunkers on board at the time of delivery. The quantity sold was therefore 865.778 m.t. He further arranged for the proc eeds of the sale of the MGO $212,433.53 to be set-off against the moneys due to Hozun Oil in respec t of the sale of the `Sea Endeavour`. 


In late May 1994 the name of `Tokai Maru` and its ownership were c hanged. The new name was `Enduranc e 1`. Following this the tanker was c hartered out. There was a mention that the new c harter rate was US$3,500 per day. 

**_Wonjin claims against Cotan_** 

The next signific ant events were a fax on 10 May 1994 and two faxes on 16 May 1994 from Wonjin International to Cotan Petroleum on asking for the transfer of the MGO and other things and holding the latter liable for the MGO and other things that remained on board the `Tokai Maru` Then on 10 June 1994 Wonjin International issued three invoic es to Cotan Petroleum. They were in respec t the MGO, the refrigerator oil, the bunkering equipment and provisions on board the `Tokai Maru`. The invoic es gave the bank ac c ount partic ulars to whic h Cotan Petroleum was required to remit the value. Cotan Petroleum never remitted the money. 

Nothing signific ant happened for more than a year. Johnny Tay and the Cotan c ompanies had paid nothing to Wonjin International or Albert Lim`s c ompanies. He also had other c reditors c hasing him, that is the Cotan c ompanies. 

**_Seawell sues Johnny Tay_** 

In these c irc umstanc es, Seawell Petroleum Pte Ltd on 22 June 1995 issued a writ against Johnny Tay and Ernie Yap c laiming S$138,888.96 Suit 1060/95. This was based on the guarantee signed by them on the debt of Cotan Energy &Trading (S) Pte Ltd on ac c ount of the purc hase of the `Sea Enterprise`. An applic ation for summary judgment was taken out Johnny Tay filed an affidavit to resist the indefensible c laim. This was what he said on the affirmation of his affidavit. [All italic s supplied by me]. 

 On 31 March 1995, the sellers rendered to the buyers a statement of account showing that S$541,755.68 was still owing from the sellers to the buyers under the said agreements as at 31 March 1995. There is now produced and shown to me in a bundle marked TSS-3, a copy of the buyers statement of account dated 31 March 1995 and invoices attached thereto. The defendants dispute the statement of account alleging that S$541,755.68 was due to the buyers in respect of the sale of the 3 vessels. The defendants will contend that the correct amount remaining unpaid to the sellers in respect of the sale of the 3 vessels to the buyers was S$527,777.62, which is the aggregate sum of 20 monthly instalments of S$26,388.88 each. Within the said statement of account itself, the buyers had given to the sellers credit a sum of S$212,433.53. The said sum of S$212,433.53 was allegedly the proceeds of sale of 865.748 mt of marine gas oil (hereinafter MGO) which was laden on board the mt Tokai Maru which was then owned by Sea Sources and chartered to Cotan Petroleum. The sale of the MGO took place between 15 May 1994 and 19 May 1994. The defendants will contend that the true value of the MGO at the time of the sale was US$175 per metric ton. The quantity of MGO remaining on board the mt Tokai Maru at all material times was 1064 k/l which was about 906.500 mt. The value of 906.500 mt of MGO which remained on board the mt Tokai Maru was therefore US$158,637.50, equivalent to S$244,777.62 at the then prevailing exchange rate of S$1.543 to US$1.00. There is now produced and shown to me in a bundle marked TSS-4 a copy each of the following: 

 (a) Time charterparty dated 2.2.94 and made between Sea Sources and Cotan 


_Petroleum._ 

_(b) Tokai Maru Report AFTER DISCHARGING dated 30.4.95._ 

_(c) Telerate Bunker Fuel Service printout for 16.5.95._ 

_On or about 14 May 1994, Sea Sources withdrew the mt Tokai Maru from charter to Cotan Petroleum. The defendants will contend that the withdrawal was wrongful and in breach of contract._ **_At the time of the withdrawal of the vessel, there were on board the Tokai Maru goods and materials which were the property of Cotan Petroleum_** _:_ 

_(a)_ **_2 water makers_** 

_(b)_ **_bunkering equipment_** 

_(c)_ **_provisions on board_** 

_(d)_ **_refrigerator oil_** 

**_The said goods and materials were never returned to Cotan Petroleum after the Tokai Maru was withdrawn from charter to Cotan Petroleum_**_. I am advised by the defendants` solicitors and I verily believe that in the circumstances., Sea Sources had wrongfully converted to their own use the said goods and materials. The value of the property listed in items (a) to (d) above are as follows:_ 

_(a) S$47,800._ 

_(b) US$93,768._ 

_(c) US$12,269._ 

_(d) US$534._ 

_There is now produced and shown to me in a bundle marked TSS-5 a copy of each of the following:_ 

_(i) Watermac Engineering Pte Ltd`s Invoice No 5921 for S$15,000._ 

_(ii) Aqua-tech Engineering & Supplies Pte Ltd`s Invoice No 5061/A for S$32,800._ 

_(iii)_ **_Invoice No TK-02 from Wonjin International Co Ltd to Cotan Petroleum for bunkering equipment for US$93,768._** 

_(iv)_ **_Invoice No TK-03 from Wonjin International Co Ltd to Cotan Petroleum for provisions for US$12,269._** 


 On the basis of the sellers statement of account dated 31 March 1995 TSS-3, the sellers should have given credit to Cotan Energy for 26.32% of the sum of S$212,433.53. 26.32% of S$212,433.53 is S$55,915.13. If the value of the MGO was S$212,433.53, the amount owing by Cotan Energy to the plaintiffs should be reduced by S$55,915.13. The defendants, however, contend that the true value of the MGO was S$244,777.62. 26.32% of S$244,777.62 is S$64,425.46. The amount owing by Cotan Energy to the plaintiffs should therefore be reduced by S$64,425.46. 

 Further, the defendants will contend that the plaintiffs should also give credit to Cotan Energy for 26.32% of the value of the goods and materials referred to in para 7 above. The value of the said goods and materials converted to Singapore currency at the date of the withdrawal of the Tokai Maru is about S$212,239.05. The defendants will contend that the sellers had wrongfully converted the said goods and materials to their own use towards payment of the monies which were owing from the sellers to the buyers in respect of the sale of the 3 vessels. In the circumstances, the defendants will contend that Cotan Energy was entitled to be credit a sum representing 26.32% of S$212,239.05 ie S$55,861.32. The amount owing by Cotan Energy to the plaintiffs should therefore be further reduced by S$55,861.32. 

It is to be remembered that c redit has already been given for S$212,433.53 to reduc e the indebtedness of Cotan Investments to Hozun Oil. In the event, on 18 Oc tober 1995 summary judgment was given for the full amount of $138,888.96. More than that, it is to be noted that Cotan Petroleum asserted as the owner of the goods and material on board the `Tokai Maru` and that the owner had c onverted Cotan Petroleum`s goods. Invoic es issued by Wonjin International was the basis of that assertion. There was no suggestion that Johnny Tay had asked the defendants to deliver the goods to the plaintiffs or Wonjin. The next day, 19 Oc tober 1995, Cotan Petroleum issued a writ against the `Enduranc e 1` ex `Tokai Maru` c laiming damages for breac h of c ontrac t, alternatively for wrongful withdrawal of the `Tokai Maru` and c onversion of two water makers. The other goods and materials were omitted. 

**_The action_** 

The writ in this ac tion was filed on 5 January 1996 against the owners of `Tokai Maru`. The indorsement of c laim read as follows: 

 The plaintiffs claim against the defendants as bailees or sub-bailees of the plaintiffs goods, which were on board the ship or vessel Tokai Maru now known as Endurance 1, damages for conversion of the said goods on or about 14 May 1994. 

The relevant segment of the statement of c laim read as follows: 

 On or about 24 April 1994, Sea Sourc es withdrew the vessel from the Head Charterparty with Cotan. 


On or about 10 May 1994, Sea Sourc es were given notic e by Cotan that the plaintiffs wished to transfer the plaintiffs` goods whic h were on board the vessel to another vessel. 

On or about 14 May 1994, upon the instruc tions of the plaintiffs, the mt `Ionian Light` attempted to take re-delivery of the plaintiffs` goods from the vessel. 

Sea Sourc es, however, by their servants or agents on board the vessel, refused to re-deliver the plaintiffs` goods to the mt `Ionian Light` but sailed away and made off with the plaintiffs` goods 

Partic ulars 

The plaintiffs` goods whic h were on board the `Tokai Maru` on 14 May 1994 c omprised: 

(a) 1,064.021 kilolitres (905.39 mt) of MGO; 

(b) Provisions as appears in the list attac hed hereto marked `Annex C`; 

(c ) Bunkering and other equipment as appears in the list attac hed hereto marked `Annex B`. 

In the premises, Sea Sourc es have refused to return the plaintiffs` goods and/or have sold or otherwise disposed of the plaintiffs` goods. Sea Sourc es have thereby c onverted the plaintiffs` goods to their own use. 

Partic ulars 

(a) On 15 May 1994, Sea Sourc es sold or permitted their nominees, Hozun, to sell 343.233 mt of MGO to Sentek Marine & Trading Pte Ltd (`Sentek`). 

(b) On 16 May 1994, Sea Sourc es sold or permitted Hozen to sell 318.644 mt of MGO to Sentek. 


 (c ) On 19 May 1994, Sea Sourc es sold or permitted Hozun to sell 203.871 mt of MGO to Sentek. 

 Alternatively, Sea Sourc es have in breac h of their duty as bailees failed to deliver the plaintiffs goods to them. 

 By reason of the aforesaid, the plaintiffs have suffered loss and damage. 

 Partic ulars of Loss and Damage 

 (a) Market value of 1,064. kilolitres (905.39 m.t.) of MGO on 14.5. 

 US$158,444.28 or S$244,479. 

 (b) Loss of profits on 1,064. kilolitres on sale at Indian Oc ean at US$320 per KL 

 S$ 86,280.55 or S$133,130. 

 (c ) Market value at Indian Oc ean of the provisions listed in Annex D 

### $10,326. 

 (d) Value of the equipment listed in Annex 

### $93,768. 

### $481,705. 

The defenc e denied that the defendants were the plaintiffs` bailees. It was denied that the plaintiffs, that is the sub-c harterers, entrusted the goods to the defendants. It asserted that the MGO was not at the material time the property of the plaintiffs and therefore entitled to the MGO. The defendants admitted that they sold the MGO but asserted that they did so `with the c onsent and/or knowledge of the main c harterers and/or agents but denied the MGO belonged to the plaintiffs`. The defenc e went on to assert that a lien on the MGO in respec t of moneys due to them under the time-c harter with Cotan Petroleum. Denial of the plaintiffs` c laim and asking them to prove their right was thus the essenc e of the defendants. Denial was the princ ipal plank of the defendants` c ase. And then, the defendants brought third-party proc eedings against Cotan Petroleum and Cotan Investments seeking payment of the money whic h was c redited to Cotan Investments. 

**_Hozun Oil`s action_** 

While plaintiffs` ac tion was making its c ourse Hozun Oil & Trading Pte Ltd filed a suit (DC Suit 5187/95) against Johnny Tay and Ernie Yap. This was under their guarantee in respec t of the indebtedness of Cotan Invesments (S) Pte Ltd on the purc hase of the `Sea Endeavour`. The amount c laimed was $64,750.77. This amount was arrived at after the c redit of S$212,239.05. The writ was filed on 22 Dec ember 1995. Summary judgment was entered for $64,750.77 on 29 Marc h 1996. 

**_The Endurance 1_** 

It would be salutory now to state in a summary form the dec ision in the suit Cotan Petroleum brought 


against the defendants, **The Endurance 1** <span class="citation">[1999] 1 SLR 661</span>. It was an admiralty ac tion in rem against the `Tokai Maru` whic h had been renamed `The Enduranc e I`. There was a c hange of ownership whic h had been held to be of no c onsequenc e. The ac tion was filed on 19 Oc tober 1995 by Adm 582/95. Cotan Petroleum c laimed US$571,200 (US$800 x 714 days) for breac h of c harterparty in failing to provide a vessel ac c ording to the requirements of the time-c harter. In the alternative they c laimed US$836,400 (US$1,200 x 697). They made a further c laim for c onversion of two water makers valued by them at S$47,800. 

The trial judge held that the defendants were in breac h of the time-c harter in failing to provide a vessel in c onformity with the c ontrac tual spec ific ations. Cotan Petroleum, however, did not terminate the time-c harter on that breac h. The defendants wrongfully withdrew the vessel bec ause the notic e they gave was outside the terms of the time-c harter. For this the trial judge awarded damages at US$800 and not US$1200 per day from 8 April 1994 to 16 Marc h 1996. They were also awarded the replac ement c osts of the two water makers as damages for c onversion. Cotan Petroleum was also given c osts on an indemnity basis. There was an appeal to the Court of Appeal. 

The Court of Appeal varied the orders made below. The finding of the trial judge that there was breac h of the time-c harter as to the spec ific ations of the vessel was held to be plainly wrong. The holding that the withdrawal of the vessel was wrongful was right. But the damages were rec alc ulated to US$260,000 at US$800 for 325 days omitting the option period. There was a c onversion of the water makers bec ause demand for them had been made by Cotan Petroleum in May 1995. But the damages should be reassessed taking into ac c ount deprec iation. The Court of Appeal c anc elled the order as to c osts made by the trial judge. One-third of the c osts was awarded to Cotan Petroleum. One-third of the c osts of the appeal was given to the defendants. 

**_The law conversion and bailment_** 

The law applic able to the resolution of the issues in this c ase is as follows. The c ommon law c onc ept of c onversion is too elusive to be expressed in words. This is bec ause of the multifarious forms in whic h it may manifest itself. It is like a hydra with many heads. There c an be c onversion by taking, by wrongful detention, by wrongful delivery, by wrongful disposition or by wrongful interferenc e. It may be based on possession, ownership or possessory title. In every c ase of c onversion it is a vital importanc e to hold in the forefront of the mind the exac t form of c onversion that is asserted by the plaintiffs. Sometimes the idea of c onversion is inextric ably interwoven with the c onc ept of bailment. It is so in this c ase. The c laim in this c ase was founded on c onversion stemming from bailment and subbailment. It is therefore nec essary to take a c lose look at the princ iples of the law governing bailment and c onversion as they affec t this c ase. 

Take this sc enario: P entrusts a thing to M. M in turn entrusts it to D with the knowledge and c onsent of P. M is in the middle. In suc h situation there is a bailment and a sec ondary bailment by sub-bailment. This situation spawns three bailments: P to M, M to D, as well as a direc t bailment between P and D. This was the situation in this c ase a bailment and a sub-bailment. In that situation it is c lear law that D, the sub-bailee owes a duty of c are to P as well as to M. P, the first bailor, as well as M c an direc tly sue D the sub-bailee for breac h of duty of c are as bailee: See **The Pioneer Container** [1994] 2 AC 324 and **The Winkfield** [1902] P 42. 

In a situation of a bailment and a sub-bailment, the princ ipal bailor, as a rule, c annot direc tly and independently demand delivery of the thing bailed from the sub-bailee who rec eived it from the subbailor without c onsent and authorisation from the sub-bailee. Otherwise there will be sc ramble for possession. There will be c onflic ting c laims and safe dealings will bec ome impossible. In partic ular the 


sub-bailee will be plac ed in a prec arious position. There are exc eptions to this rule there may a c ontrac tual or other arrangement whic h obliges the sub-bailee to effec t direc t delivery to the princ ipal bailor. For example, when one holds a bill of lading vesting the title to the goods in him the c arrier sub-bailee must deliver it to the holder of the bill of lading and no one else: See **The Houda; Kuwait Petroleum Corp v I & D Oil Carriers** [1994] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 541, **Sze Hai Tong Bank Ltd v Rambler Cycle Co Ltd** [1959] AC 577. 

Furthermore, if there a c onversion of the artic le of bailment, both the bailor and the sub-bailor have a c ause of ac tion for c onversion against the sub-bailee. The sub-bailor is entitled to rec over substantial damages, that is the full value of the goods, from the c onverter sub-bailee. The basis of this rule was expounded in **The Winkfield** [1902] P 42 at p 55: 

 As between possessor and wrongdoer the presumption of law is, in the words of Lord Campbell in Jeffries v Great Western Ry Co that the person who has possession has the property. 

In the same c ase, at pp 54-55 Collins MR said: `the wrongdoer who is not defending under the title of the bailor is quite unc onc erned with what the rights are between the bailor and bailee, and must treat the possessor as the owner of the goods for all purposes quite irrespec tive of the rights and obligations as between him and the bailor`. 

The princ iples stated in **_The Winkfield_** were approved and applied in **Chabbra Corp Pte Ltd v Owners of the Ship or Vessel Jag Shakti** [1986] AC 337 (a Privy Counc il Appeal from Singapore). 

The princ ipal bailee, that is the bailee who is in the middle, in that event is under an obligation to ac c ount to the bailor. The rule was stated by Sc rutton LJ in **The Joannis Vatis** [1922] P 92 at p 103: The sub-bailor `would be entitled to rec over the full value of the c argo against the wrongdoers, but would have to ac c ount over and would be liable to the owners of the c argo for their proper share`. The c argo owner is the princ ipal bailor. Lord Atkinson expounded the point with explic it emphasis in **Eastern Construction Co Ltd v National Trust Co** [1914] AC 197 at 210: 

 ... it would be against all notions of justice that the bailee who recovers the full value of the goods wrongfully taken out of his possession should be able to retain it for himself. The goods were not his, they belonged to the bailor. The money recovered under the judgment represents and is substituted for the goods themselves. To allow the bailee to keep it for himself would be to compensate him in damages for a loss he has never suffered ... the bailee who in such circumstances recovers the full value of the goods must account to the bailor for the sum recovered. 

**_Clerk & Lindsell on Torts_** (17th Ed, 1998), in para 13-143 presents this proposition of law: 

 Possession with an assertion of title, or even possession alone (which is the case of a bailee), gives the possessor such a property as will enable him to maintain an action against a wrongdoer: for possession is prima facie evidence of property. [Italics supplied by me]. 

The proposition is amply supported by **_The Winkfield_**. 


There stems from the above an important derivative rule whic h is relevant to this c ase. It is this: Where there are more than one bailor of a thing and one of them rec overs or otherwise deals with a third person the other bailor is barred further rec overy from the third person. `The wrongdoer having onc e paid full damages to the bailee, has an answer to the bailor,` said Collins MR in **_The Winkfield_** at p 61. 

This basis of the rule is estoppel and implied authorisation. Onc e there was a c onc lusive dealing or settlement the c ause of ac tion against the third party is extinguished. This is espec ially so if the owner transfers his rights to the bailee without reservation of title. The purpose of the rule is to prevent double jeapordy. 

**O`Sullivan v Williams** [1992] 3 All ER 385 states and illuminates the above princ iples with sparkling c larity. O`Sullivan allowed his girlfriend Linda to use his c ar while he was away on holiday. While the c ar was parked outside her home it was irreparably damaged by the defendant. Both brought an ac tion against the defendant in whic h the first plaintiff c laimed o1,300 as the value of the c ar and damages for loss of use of the c ar sinc e the ac c ident at o25 per week and the sec ond plaintiff c laimed damages for nervous shoc k and other distress and for loss of use. O`Sullivan`s c laim was settled without prejudic e to Linda`s c laim. The judge dismissed Linda`s c laim for damages for nervous shoc k and other distress but awarded her o400 damages for loss of the use of the c ar. The defendant appealed against that award. The appeal was allowed on the ground that the settlement of O`Sullivan`s c laim as bailor barred Linda`s c laim as bailee. Fox LJ with the agreement of Staughton and Beldam LJJ enunc iated the following princ iples: A bailee c an sue in tort in respec t of the bailed goods. The bailee c an sue a wrongdoer simply by reason of the bailee`s possession. Suc h possession is, as against the wrongdoer, full and c omplete ownership. It enables the bailee to rec over the full value of the c hattel. He must, however, ac c ount to the bailor for the amount rec overed. The bailee having rec overed damages against the wrongdoer the wrongdoer has an answer to any ac tion by the bailor. The same princ iple must apply to the bailee if the bailor has sued. There c annot be separate c laims by the bailor and the bailee. If the bailor rec overs damages and the bailee has some interest in the property enforc eable against the bailor, then the bailor must ac c ount appropriately to the bailee. Either the bailor or bailee may sue, and whic hever first obtains damages, it is a full satisfac tion. Any other rule would expose a tortfeasor to several ac tions founded on the same c ause of ac tion by persons with limited interests in the c hattel. Onc e the bailor`s c laim has been satisfied, the bailee has no c laim to pursue arising out of the bailment. The bailee must look to the bailor for satisfac tion in respec t of the interest, if any, of the bailee. 

It needs to be stated at onc e that the rule in **Hollins v Fowler** [1875] LR 7 HL 757 is outside the pale of the bailment situation. That applies when someone, albeit innoc ently, rec eives goods fraudulently taken away from its owner. In that situation the rec eiver before dealing with the goods is under an absolute duty to ensure that the person has proprietory in the goods he rec eives. It does not apply to a bailment sc enario bec ause the goods are voluntarily plac ed in the hands of a bailee and thus impliedly c lothes him with authority and c onfers on him ownership by possession. Next, c ases of c ompeting c laims of bunkers in the tanks of an arrested vessel ordered to be sold by the c ourt also are outside the pale of the princ iples outlined above. Suc h c ases are not c onversion or bailment c ases. The c ourt adjudic ates on c ompeting c laim as it would in an interpleader summons. Repeating myself, I add that the bailment rules I have outlined do not apply to the holder of a bill of lading. 

**_Findings and conclusions_** 

On the basis of all the evidenc e viewed as a whole and the princ iples of law outlined above I make 


the following findings and c onc lusions. There was a bailment and a sub-bailment first from Wonjin to the c harterers and from the c harterers to the owners. The plaintiffs in this c ase at onc e made an assertion and a c onc ession to that end in the endorsement in the writ. 

The bailment and the sub-bailment was first pursuant to and governed by the c harter and subc harter. When the main c harter c ame to an end when the `Tokai Maru` was withdrawn, the bailments c ontinued and were governed by an overlayer of the princ iples of the law of bailment I have outlined. There was no bill of lading in respec t of the MGO or the other goods. The owners were justified in treating the c harterers as owners of the MGO and other goods and dealing with them. The rule in **_Hollins v Fowler_** did not apply bec ause the goods were not fraudulently taken from Wonjin International or the plaintiffs. 

Under the princ iples of the law of bailment, the c harterers were in proprietary possession of the MGO and the equipment. As suc h they were entitled to assert ownership rights against the owners. The c harterers indeed did so. The owners too ac ted on the basis. 

Although as a matter of law there was a sub-bailment, the plaintiffs, Wonjin International and the c harterers throughout 1994 and the best part of 1995 were not aware of it. In the result Wonjin, and therefore the plaintiffs, asserted their rights only against the c harterers. The c harterers, as a matter of fac t, ac c epted responsibility and dealt with the owners on their own behalf making themselves ac c ountable to Wonjin International. At no time the plaintiffs or the Wonjin made a demand on the defendants for delivery of the MGO or the equipment. 

In any event, on 10 June 1994 Wongjin International by issuing the invoic es in favour of Cotan Petroleum relinquished all the rights in respec t of the MGO and the equipment by exc hanging them for the indebtedness of Cotan Petroleum for the values stated in the invoic es. On an objec tive basis that was the result of issuing the invoic es. Cotan Petroleum ac knowledged the indebtedness. There was a binding agreement. 

Above all the shipowners dealt with the c harterers on the basis that the MGO and equipment belonged to the latter and sold the MGO and c redit for it with the knowledge and c onsent of the c harterers. Not only that. The c harterers themselves asserted suc h a right at all relevant times and ac c epted the c redit and thus c onfirmed the settlement on that basis. Thereupon, the plaintiffs or Wonjin lost their rights, if they had not lost them earlier to bring an ac tion against the owners. 

The ac tion by the plaintiffs, in the c irc umstanc es was misc onc eived. They were c onfined to seek redress against Cotan Petroleum. 

**_Albert Lim`s evidence_** 

Albert Lim`s evidenc e was that in early May 1994 he had disc ussions with Johnny Tay about nonpayment of moneys due from Cotan Investments to Hozun Oil. The amount was S$277,194.30 and it was in respec t of the `Sea Enduranc e` sold to the former by the latter. Johnny Tay told him that the MGO on board the `Tokai Maru` belonged to Cotan Petroleum and that Albert Lim should sell the oil and set-off the proc eeds against the moneys due from Cotan Investments to Hozun Oil. Purusant to that instruc tion Albert Lim got Hozun Oil to sell the MGO on board the `Tokai Maru`. The sale produc ed a sum of US$138,519.68 or S$212,443.53. On 10 June 1994 Hozun Oil wrote to Sea Sourc es that the sale had been effec ted and forwarded c opies of the sale doc uments. Statements were sent to the buyers reflec ting a c redit amount of $212,443.53. 


**_Johnny Tay`s evidence_** 

Johnny Tay did not refute muc h of what Albert Lim said. Indeed he was not in a position to refute that. Johnny Tay admitted having dealt with Albert Lim. Johnny Tay admitted his c ompanies owed $500,000 plus to Albert Lim`s c ompanies. This meant that Johnny Tay as guarantor was also liable. He did not show the sub-c harter to the defendants. He did tell the defendants about the plaintiffs. He was not in a position to pay anyone as he was tight. Wonjin asserted that it was Cotan Petroleum that stole the MGO and equipment. Wonjin`s representative, Mr Choy, c ame to Singapore in June 

1994\. It was his responsibility and he agreed to solve the problem. Choy asked Lim for payment and he agreed to pay and he would look towards the owner for all the c laims. Choy agreed. The fac t that the owners had taken the c argo and equipment was not the problem of Choy, Wonjin and the plaintiffs. Johnny Tay was handling the c laim and he was going to c laim from the owners and that was why he had agreed to c ompensate Wonjin. The invoic es issued by Wonjin was in favour of Cotan Petroleum was evidenc e of sale and demand for payment. He did not pay Wonjin bec ause he had no money. Above all, he ac knowledged the c ontra ac c ount issued by Albert Lim and that c redit was given to Cotan Investments: `We totalled up the money payable on the purc hase and issued payment to whic h of the three c ompanies I c an say. Money went in the name of one c ompany to one of defendants` c ompany. They wanted us to issue to one c ompany so we issued to one c ompany. We did this for c onvenienc e.` In addition Johnny said this: ` **_I was under the notion that the goods belonged to Cotan_**. **_I formed this notion when they ran away with the goods_** .` [Italic s are mine]. This is what Albert Lim said Johnny Tay told him that the MGO belonged to him at the time the vessel was withdrawn. 

Then there was the affidavit of Johnny Tay in Suit No 1060 of 1995 against him and Ernie Yap. With full knowledge that c redit had been given as shown in statements issued by Albert Lim`s c ompaies, he asserted with absolute positiveness that: `at the time of the withdrawal of the vessel, there was on board the `Tokai Maru` goods and materials whic h were the property of Cotan Petroleum: (a) two water makers, (b) bunkering equipment, (c ) provisions on board, (d) refrigeration oil`. He went on to base his assertions on the invoic es whic h he c onc eded before me was evidenc e of sale to Cotan Petroleum. He made these asertions and sought a c redit when in fac t c redit had already been given to Cotan Investments for whic h was he liable. 

I hold that it was bec ause he was in debt and he was under pressure from Choy for payment of an admitted debt that he c ame up with the c ase of c onversion of all the goods and materials. Cotan Petroleum`s c laim for c onversion of the two water makers suc c eeded bec ause the Court of Appeal held that Cotan Petroleum `requested to be informed of the vessel`s loc ation on 6 May 1995 and 8 May 1995 to enable them to take the water makers from the vessel. The owners did not reply and the water makers remained on board. On those fac ts the learned judge held that the owners had c ommitted the tort of wrongfully retaining the c harterers` water makers. We entirely agree with the learned judge.` This means that the c harterers had not made a demand earlier and there was no demand from Wonjin or the plaintiffs direc tly to the owners. 

At the trial of this ac tion Johnny Tay made a major shift. He said that in May 1994, Albert Lim had begged him not to report the stealing of the c argo and to return the c argo and the goods to Wonjin. All this sounded rather bizarre bec ause this was totally inc onsistent with his view whic h he formed on the date of withdrawal that the c argo belonged to Cotan Petroleum. He never modified this view until after judgment was given in Suit 1060/95. Apart from that, taken in its entirety the evidenc e of Albert Lim was more c redible than Johnny Tay`s. As a witness Albert Lim was firm and forthright; Johnny Tay was wobbly. Often Johnny Tay paused to think up an answer. Albert Lim impressed me as a witness of truth but not Johnny Tay. Johnny Tay was a supplic ant to Albert Lim`s c ompanies. There 


was no reason for Albert Lim to fear Johnny Tay. They were friends until Suit No 1060 of 1995 was c ommenc ed. 

As to why he made a volte fac ie his explanation was that he was wrong in his view and realized the error only when his lawyer pointed out the error. In other words there was a mistake of law. In my judgment the new evidenc e was c ontrived to give support to the legal advic e he had rec eived. The thrust of the new thinking was that Cotan Petroleum had no right to deal with Albert Lim and his c ompanies. As has been demonstrated what Choy, Johnny Tay and Albert Lim thought and their c onduc t was well within the pale of law. The subsequent shift was inc orrec t. It was too late for Wonjin and the plaintiffs to assert their initial rights against the defendants. That would be against the law outlined in this judgment. 

**_Miscellaneous points_** 

Albert Lim was asked why he did not return the c argo and the equipment to the plaintiffs when the vessel was withdrawn. He said that no demand from them or Wonjin to the defendants. Insofar as c onversion is asserted in the form of wrongful detention, as distinc t from wrongful dealing, demand from the c laimant to the defendant and the right to demand possession must be proved. There was no suc h proof in this c ase. Johnny Tay had said in evidenc e that he relayed the c ontents of a telex from Wonjin to the defendants. Albert Lim was asked about the fax Johnny Tay said he sent to the defendants. Albert Lim said he never rec eived them. There was no proof that they were sent to Albert Lim or the defendants. The c onduc t of Johnny Tay and his evidenc e that he thought that Cotan Petroleum was the owner was inc onsistent with him having sent the faxes. There was no mention of him having sent the faxes or that Wonjin was owner subsequently. There was muc h evidenc e to the c ontrary. The c hange of mind and mind oc c urred after Johnny Tay and Choy realised that Johnny Tay and Cotan Petroleum were not worth power and shot. Additionally the thrust of the plaintiffs` c ase was the sale of the MGO by the defendants. 

It was c ontended for the defendants that the plaintiffs` c laim was not sustainable that they had an interest in the goods at any time. It was further c ontended that no offic er of the plaintiffs c ame to give evidenc e. I rejec t these arguments as unsupported by law. Wonjin were the agents of the plaintiffs. Even if the plaintiffs had no ownership in the MGO and the other goods, they were as c harterers entitled to assert a c laim. 

**_Summary_** 

On the basis of the analysis and c onc lusions I dismiss the plaintiffs` c laim. As to the MGO it was sold with the c onsent and knowledge of Cotan Petroleum. If it was sold without their c onsent, there was a settlement after the defendants gave c redit to Cotan Petroleum whic h ac c epted the settlement. As to the other goods there was no demand from the plaintiffs or Wonjin to the defendants for delivery of the goods before the ac tion. In any event they relinquished their rights when they issued the invoic es to Cotan Petroleum. In these c irc umstanc es there was no need to make an order in the third-party proc eedings. 

It c annot be denied that the plaintiffs were plac ed in an unfortunate position. This was bec ause Cotan Petroleum and Johnny Tay failed to keep their promises to Wonjin and the plaintiffs. That said, it c annot be denied that this ac tion by the plaintiffs overleapt the relevant fac ts and law whic h were kept out of their knowledge. For Choy said in his evidenc e that he was unaware of what had happened. He was not given the relevant information and advic e. 


## Outcome: 

Plaintiffs` c laim dismissed.
