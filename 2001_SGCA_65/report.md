(delivering the judgment of the c ourt): Before us are two related notic es of motion filed in CA 600057/2001. The first (No 600053/2001) seeks to strike out the notic e of appeal on the ground that it was filed out of time. The sec ond (No 600098/2001) seeks an extension of time so that the notic e of appeal already filed, even if out of time, would remain valid. 

**_The background_** 

On 20 Oc tober 2000, Fraser & Neave Ltd and three others (the respondents in the c ivil appeal and hereinafter referred to as `F&N and others`) filed a c ivil suit against Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Ltd and Hugh Young (the appellants in the c ivil appeal and hereinafter referred to as `Aberdeen & Young`) for defamation on ac c ount of a letter published by Aberdeen & Young in the 24 August 2000 issue of the Business Times. 

Aberdeen & Young duly filed their defenc e and pleaded, inter alia, that the public ation was not defamatory of F&N and others. 

On 27 November 2000, F&N and others filed an applic ation under O 14 r 12 for a determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of c ertain statements in the letter (`the words`). On 12 January 2001, the assistant registrar ruled that the words in question generally bore the defamatory meaning alleged in the statement of c laim. 

Aberdeen & Young were dissatisfied with the dec ision of the assistant registrar and appealed to the High Court. On 21 Marc h 2001, Tan Lee Meng J, after hearing arguments, found the words to be defamatory but he slightly modified that defamatory meaning from that determined by the assistant 


registrar. He further held that the meaning he determined related only to F&N. He found it inappropriate to determine the meaning of the words vis-.-vis the other plaintiffs, as there are no spec ific referenc es to the other plaintiffs in the letter. Evidenc e would be required to show a suffic ient nexus between these other plaintiffs and the words. This would have to be determined at the trial. 

The order of Tan J, however, has not been extrac ted as there were and are differenc es of views between the parties on how the order should be drawn up. The differenc es do not relate to the meaning of the words as determined by the judge. Bec ause of the differenc es, the solic itors for F&N and others wrote to the Registrar, Supreme Court (`the Registrar`), requesting that the matter be referred to the judge so that parties c ould attend before him to settle the order. To-date, there has been no response to that request. 

On 27 Marc h 2001, the solic itors for Aberdeen & Young wrote to the Registrar and requested for further arguments on the basis that the order made by the judge was an interloc utory order and c ited, in partic ular, s 34(1)(c ) of the Supreme Court of Judic ature Ac t (Cap 322, 1999 Ed) (`the SCJA`). It was only on 18 April 2001 that the Registrar informed the solic itors of Aberdeen & Young that the judge did not require further arguments. 

On 8 May 2001, the appellants filed their notic e of appeal against the dec ision of Tan J made on 21 Marc h 2001. This is the notic e of appeal whic h is the subjec t of the two notic es of motion. 

**_Issues_** 

Under O 57 r 4(a) of the Rules of Court, the period for the filing of a notic e of appeal against an order of a judge made in c hambers is one month from the date on whic h the order was pronounc ed. On this rec koning, the order of Tan J having been made on 21 Marc h 2001, the last day for filing the notic e of appeal would ordinarily be 21 April 2001. That is the stand taken by F&N and others. 

However, the position taken by Aberdeen & Young is that, as the order of 21 Marc h 2001 is an interloc utory order made in c hambers, following s 34(1)(c ) of the SCJA, the appellant had no right to appeal against that order unless the judge has c ertified, pursuant to a request for further arguments made within seven days of the order, that he did not require further arguments. In the present c ase, the request for further arguments was made on 27 Marc h 2001, whic h was within the presc ribed time. Under O 56 r 2(2) of the Rules of Court, unless the Registrar informs the requesting party within 14 days that the judge requires further arguments, it will be deemed that the judge has c ertified that he requires no further arguments. It follows from this rule that by 9 April 2001, the judge would be deemed to have c ertified that he required no further arguments. Aberdeen & Young took the view that they had one month from 9 April 2001 to file their notic e of appeal. Ac c ordingly, the notic e of appeal, having been filed on 8 May 2001, is therefore within time. 

Thus the two notic es of motion raised the following three issues for the c onsideration of this c ourt: 

(1) Is the order of 21 Marc h 2001 an interloc utory order or a final order? 

(2) If the order of 21 Marc h 2001 is an interloc utory order, should the notic e of appeal be filed within one month of 21 Marc h 2001 or 9 April 2001? 

(3) If the notic e of appeal should have been filed by 21 April 2001 (within one month from 21 Marc h 2001) should the c ourt in this instanc e exerc ise its disc retion and extend time so as to validate the 


notic e already filed by Aberdeen & Young on 8 May 2001? 

**_Interlocutory or final order_** 

Counsel for F&N and others, Mr Davinder Singh, submitted that the order of 21 Marc h 2001 had finally determined the substantive issue as to the meaning of the words. This issue c an no longer be reopened at the trial. It is a final order. Order 14 r 12 empowers the c ourt to make suc h a determination whic h is final even though it does not dispose of the entire ac tion. Counsel also relied upon a Privy Counc il dec ision from New Zealand, **Strathmore Group v Fraser** [1992] 2 AC 172, where the Privy Counc il held that a dec ision on a preliminary issue was a final order. 

As early as in 1967, this c ourt had the oc c asion to c onsider the question as to the proper test to be applied in determining whether an order was interloc utory or final. That was the c ase of **Tee Than Song Construction Co v Kwong Kum Sun Glass Merchant** [1965-1968] SLR 230 [1967] 2 MLJ 205. There, the c ourt noted that there were two prevailing tests. One was enunc iated in **Salaman v Warner** [1891] 1 QB 734 and the other in **Bozson v Altrincham Urban District Council** [1903] 1 KB 547. 

The **_Salaman_** test, whic h is also known as the applic ation test, was formulated as follows by Fry LJ (supra at 736): 

 ... an order is final only where it is made upon an application or other proceeding which must, whether such application or other proceeding fail or succeed, determine the action. Conversely ... an order is interlocutory where it cannot be affirmed that in either event the action will be determined. 

The **_Bozson_** test, whic h is also known as the order test, is, in the words of Lord Alverstone, in these terms: 

 Does the judgment or order, as made, finally dispose of the rights of the parties? If it does, then ... it ought to be treated as a final order; but if it does not, it is then ... an interlocutory order. 

The c ourt in **_Tee Than Song Construction_** expressed its preferenc e for the **_Bozson_** test as being the c orrec t test to adopt in determining the question whether an order was interloc utory or final in the c ontext of s 68(2) of the Courts of Judic ature Ac t 1964 (the predec essor provision of the present s 34(1)(c )). 

Later in 1992 in **Rank Xerox (Singapore) v Ultra Marketing** <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 73</span> , whic h was a c ase c onc erning an order granting c onditional leave to defend, this c ourt revisited the c ase law on the subjec t and reaffirmed the view that the **_Bozson_** test was the c orrec t test to apply. It held that `the rights of the parties` in that test referred to `the substantive rights in dispute in the partic ular ac tion`. Ac c ordingly, an order granting c onditional leave to defend was an interloc utory order. 

This view was again reaffirmed by this c ourt in the subsequent c ase **Ling Kee Ling v Leow Leng Siong** <span class="citation">[1996] 2 SLR 438</span>. 

It seems to us that it must be a rather exc eptional sort of a c ase where, applying the **_Salaman_** test, 


the order obtained would be held to be final. This is bec ause that test requires that whatever order made on the applic ation must determine the ac tion, irrespec tive of whether the applic ation suc c eeds or fails. We c an understand that where an applic ation suc c eeds that that c ould determine an ac tion. It is more diffic ult to envisage a situation where the applic ation fails and yet the ac tion is determined. As we see it, under the **_Salaman_** test, few orders obtained would be held to be final. In most instanc es, the orders would be interloc utory in nature. 

In our view, the **_Bozson_** test seems more logic al. We will illustrate it by a simple O 14 applic ation for summary judgment. In ac c ordanc e with the **_Salaman_** test, a summary judgment obtained on suc h an applic ation would not be a final order bec ause the test requires that even if the applic ation fails, it should also have determined the ac tion. This will not be so in an O 14 applic ation. If the applic ation for summary judgment fails, the ac tion would c ertainly not be determined. But, if the applic ation should suc c eed, it will be a final order, applying the **_Bozson_** test. This ac c ords with reality and c ommon sense. But under the **_Salaman_** test, this is only an interloc utory order. 

We now turn to examine **_Strathmore Group v Fraser_** (supra) whic h is relied upon by F&N and others. There, the petitioner sued its former direc tors for, inter alia, breac h of fiduc iary duty. In defenc e the respondents c ontended that there had been a c ompromise between them whereby the petitioner had agreed to abandon those c laims. In reply, the petitioner alleged that there was no c ompromise, or alternatively, that it had been c anc elled. The c ompromise issue was tried as a preliminary issue. Evidenc e and arguments were also tendered as to the c anc ellation issue. The first instanc e judge held that there was no binding c ompromise. The Court of Appeal of New Zealand reversed that dec ision and held that the c ompromise had not been c anc elled and dismissed the petitioner`s ac tion. The Court of Appeal also dismissed the petitioner`s applic ation for leave to appeal to the Privy Counc il, holding that the judgment was interloc utory and that the petitioner was not entitled as of right to appeal further. The petitioner then sought spec ial leave to appeal from the Privy Counc il, whic h held that the dec ision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal was a final judgment. In the following passages the Privy Counc il analysed the situation and stated why justic e demanded that the petitioner should have a right of appeal (at p 178): 

 If no preliminary issue had been ordered, the trial judge would have tried the whole action and decided the compromise issue, the cancellation issue and the misconduct issue. If the judge awarded damages to the petitioner on the grounds that there was no compromise or that the compromise had been cancelled and on the grounds that the respondents had been guilty of misconduct in the Clearwater transaction, then the respondents could have appealed to the Court of Appeal and either party, losing before the Court of Appeal, could have appealed to the Privy Council as of right and on that appeal all three issues, the compromise issue, the cancellation issue and the misconduct issue could have been argued. If the trial judge dismissed the petitioners action either on the compromise issue or on the misconduct issue, then the petitioner could have appealed to the Court of Appeal and either party, losing before the Court of Appeal, could have appealed to the Privy Council as of right and on that appeal all three issues, the compromise issue, the cancellation issue and the misconduct issue could have been argued. The judgment of the Court of Appeal would have been final if the action by the petitioner were dismissed and final if the petitioner were awarded damages. All three issues, the compromise issue, the cancellation issue and the misconduct issue would be in play on the hearing of any appeal to the Privy Council. 

 If the judgment of the Court of Appeal on 4 October 1991, finally deciding the compromise issue and the cancellation issue, was not a final judgment for the purposes of rule 2 of the Order of 1910, then the petitioner has been deprived of an appeal to the Privy Council as of right, an unintended consequence of the 


 decision of Wylie J that, in the interest of justice and for the possible saving of time and expense, the compromise issue should be tried as a preliminary issue ... 

 It seems to their Lordships that the petitioner cannot be deprived of a right of appeal solely because the trial was divided into two parts, the first part dealing with the compromise issue and the cancellation issue and the second part, so far as necessary, dealing with the misconduct issue. 

The Privy Counc il did not refer to the **_Bozson_** test. But it referred to the English Court of Appeal dec ision in **White v Brunton** [1984] QB 570[1984] 2 All ER 606 where it was held that a dec ision on a preliminary issue of doc umentary c onstruc tion was a final order. The following exposition of Sir John Donaldson MR ([1984] QB 570 at 573; [1984] 2 All ER 606 at 608) was wholly adopted by the Privy Counc il: 

 It is plainly in the interests of the more efficient administration of justice that there should be split trials in appropriate cases, as even where the decision on the first part of a split trial is such that there will have to be a second part, it may be desirable that the decision shall be appealed before incurring the possibly unnecessary expense of the second part. If we were to hold that the division of a final hearing into parts deprived the parties of an unfettered right of appeal, we should be placing an indirect fetter upon the ability of the court to order split trials. I would therefore hold that where there is a split trial or more accurately, in relation to a non-jury case, a split hearing, any party may appeal without leave against an order made at the end of one part if he could have appealed against such an order without leave if both parts had been heard together and the order had been made at the end of the complete hearing. 

Admittedly, the reasoning in **_White v Brunton_** seems quite persuasive. One c ould almost say that it should also apply to a c ase like the present bec ause what had oc c urred here is also a split trial. But there is one very signific ant differenc e. In **_White v Brunton_** (like that in **_Strathmore Group v Fraser_** ), there was no right of appeal exc ept with leave. However, in a c ase where s 34(1)(c ) applies, the parties` right of appeal is not taken away. All that the statutory provision superimposes is that the party intending to appeal should first write to the judge requesting for further arguments. The proc ess is basic ally to give the judge another opportunity to review his dec ision and onc e the judge dec ides to affirm his dec ision, the requesting party would have his undoubted right to appeal. Viewed in this light, the reasoning expressed in **_White v Brunton_** is naturally less c ompelling; similarly for the views expounded in **_Strathmore Group v Fraser_**. There is nothing unjust about requiring a party who wishes to appeal against a dec ision of a judge made in c hambers, and whic h does not dispose of the entire ac tion, to request for further arguments before he may file his notic e of appeal. 

We agree that the question of whether an order is interloc utory or final is sometimes not an easy one to dec ide: see Lord Denning MR in **Salter Rex & Co v Ghosh** [1971] 2 QB 597[1971] 2 All ER 865 at 

866\. We also rec ognise that a dec ision on a preliminary issue c ould arguably be viewed, as c ontended by Mr Davinder Singh, as a final order in the sense that it is binding upon the parties, unless it is reversed on appeal. But the question is, does that order finally dispose of the rights of the parties under the ac tion. The word `finally` must be given its ordinary meaning. The approac h c ontended by F&N and others would mean that where a trial is split, there would be many final dec isions whic h disposes of the rights of the parties. Conc eptually, we find that somewhat diffic ult to ac c ept when we are dealing only with one ac tion. 


Reverting to the c ase in hand, we ac knowledge that unless the determination as to the meaning of the words is reversed on appeal, Aberdeen & Young would not be able to re-open that issue and c anvas afresh the meaning of the words in question. But it does not nec essarily follow from this that the rights envisaged in the ac tion have been disposed of. It is even doubtful whether the determination here of the meaning of the words has in fac t disposed of any rights of the parties. While the determination has pronounc ed that the words are defamatory of F&N, it is far from established that the rights of Aberdeen & Young have been disposed of. That is only the first step. There are still the other defenc es to be c onsidered, namely, justific ation and fair c omment. If Aberdeen & Young are able to show that either of these two defenc es are available to them, then they would not be held liable in defamation. 

In the c irc umstanc es, we have no hesitation in holding that the order of Tan J is an interloc utory order. The answer would also have been the same if we had applied the **_Salaman_** test. We would add that the dec ision in **_Strathmore Group v Fraser_** (supra) is really quite c onsistent with the **_Bozson_** test if one bears in mind that there the New Zealand Court of Appeal had, in fac t, dismissed the petitioner`s c laim. That was a final order disposing of all the petitioner`s rights under the ac tion. Indeed, the c ase of **_Strathmore Group_** would not have satisfied the **_Salaman_** test. On the latter test, the order obtained there would c learly be interloc utory. 

**_Appeal within one month_** 

We now turn to the sec ond issue, whic h c onc erns the date from whic h the one-month period to file the notic e of appeal should have been rec koned. 

Under O 57 r 4(a), in the c ase of an appeal from an order of a judge made in c hambers, the notic e of appeal must be filed and served within one month `from the date when the order was pronounc ed or when the appellant first had notic e thereof`. 

In **Seow Teck Ming v Tan Ah Yeo** [1991] SLR 169 [1991] 2 MLJ 489 , this c ourt had the oc c asion to c onsider s 34(2) of the SCJA, the predec essor provision to the present s 34(1)(c ), and that provision reads: 

 No appeal shall lie from an interlocutory order made by a Judge in chambers unless the Judge has certified, after application, within 4 days after the making of the order by any party for further argument in court, that he requires no further argument, or unless leave is obtained from the Court of Appeal or from the Judge who heard the application. 

There the c ourt held (obiter) that time began to run for filing the notic e of appeal when the appellant was informed of the judge`s notific ation that the latter did not wish to hear further arguments. For this proposition the c ourt relied upon **Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association v Chai Yen** [1980] 1 MLJ 198 , a dec ision of the Privy Counc il from Malaysia. It is, however, important to bear in mind the essential fac ts in that c ase. The request for further arguments was made on 8 September 1976. It was only on 14 Oc tober 1976, some 35 days later, that the judge c ertified that he did not want to hear further arguments. On 1 November 1976, the applic ant filed his notic e of appeal. The Malaysian provision (r 13(a)) requiring that the notic e of appeal must be filed within one month of the order made in c hambers is in pari materia with our O 57 r 4(a). The Privy Counc il held that the one-month period should be rec koned from the date of the c ertific ation of the judge that he 


required no further arguments. A very important c onsideration whic h the Privy Counc il took into ac c ount was the absenc e of any time limit within whic h the judge should make his c ertific ation. Lord Lane, delivering the judgment of the Privy Counc il, asked pointedly `If [the judge] takes more than a month to make up his mind, what is the applic ant to do?` He c onc luded (at p 199): 

 The essence of any rule of procedure must be fairness, and to apply stringently the provisions of rule 13(a) would in circumstances such as the present work manifest injustice to the respondent. She might be forced, in short, to abandon a perfectly proper and relatively inexpensive application to the judge to hear further argument for a costly and possibly unnecessary appeal to the Federal Court. Nor are their Lordships impressed by the suggestion that the respondent could have put matters right by applying for special leave under rule 13(a). She should not have that burden thrust upon her. 

He also said that onc e an applic ation for further arguments was made, the whole matter `entered a state of suspended animation` until the judge ruled on the applic ation. In the c irc umstanc es, the time for appealing ran from the date when the judge`s dec ision not to require further arguments was c ommunic ated to the applic ant and not from the date of his original order. 

At a glanc e, one would be tempted to say that that position must similarly prevail under our s 34(1) (c ). That would have been so if the relevant rules of c ourt had remained the same. But there is a very signific ant amendment introduc ed into the rules whic h was absent in the Malaysian rules when the Privy Counc il c onsidered **_Bank of America v Chai Yen_** (supra). It was also absent in our rules when **_Seow Teck Ming v Tan Ah Yeo_** was c onsidered by this c ourt. The new rule (O 56 r 2(2)) reads: 

 Unless the Registrar informs the party making the application within 14 days of the receipt of the application that the Judge requires further arguments, the Judge shall be deemed to have certified that he requires no further arguments. 

The insertion of this new rule swept away the diffic ulties whic h a party who applied for further arguments fac ed when the judge took time to c onsider the applic ation. It would be rec alled that in **_Bank of America v Chai Yen_** (supra), when the judge`s dec ision on further arguments was c ommunic ated to the applic ant, the one-month period for filing the notic e of appeal had already expired. This was a c ritic al fac tor in the Privy Counc il`s dec ision. 

It seems to us that the draftsman of the new rule must have in mind the diffic ulties adumbrated by Lord Lane when they introduc ed the deeming provision in that rule. Following from this rule, by the latest 21 days after the judge made his dec ision in c hambers (allowing seven days to make the applic ation and 14 days for the deeming provision to set in) the applic ant would have known whether he c ould file his notic e of appeal and he has at least seven to ten days left (depending on the relevant month) to do the simple ac t of filing the notic e with the registry. Of c ourse, if the judge dec ides to hear further arguments, then the order already made is to be put on hold or suspended until the hearing of further argument. In suc h an event, time only begins to run from the date the judge makes his dec ision after hearing further arguments: see **Thomson Plaza v Liquidators of Yaohan Department Store** <span class="citation">[2001] 3 SLR 248</span>. 

In the result, we hold that the rationale whic h led the Privy Counc il to dec ide the way it did in **_Bank of America_** (supra) c an no longer apply in the light of the deeming provision. In our opinion, Aberdeen & Young were wrong to think that the one-month period was to be rec koned from the date the judge 


was deemed to have dec ided not to hear further arguments. Order 57 r 4(a) is very c lear. The onemonth period runs from the date the order was pronounc ed. Therefore, the notic e of appeal filed on 8 May 2001 is out of time. 

We would add that if it were intended by the rules that time to appeal would only begin to run as from the date the judge gives his c ertific ation that he requires no further arguments, or from the date it is deemed that the judge has so c ertified, the rules would have expressly so provided. An instanc e of this is found in O 56 r 3 whic h reads: 

 (1) A party applying for leave under section 34 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Chapter 322) to appeal against an order made, or a judgment given, by a Judge must file his application 

 (a) to a Judge within 7 days of the order or judgment; and 

 (b) in the event leave is refused by the Judge, to the Court of Appeal within 7 days of the refusal. 

 (2) A party who has obtained leave to appeal under this Rule shall file and serve the notice of appeal within one month from the date on which such leave was given. 

It will be seen that where leave to appeal was obtained, the one-month period to file the notic e of appeal is rec koned from the date of obtaining leave. It seems to us c lear that this rule has so provided bec ause it rec ognises the fac t that leave c ould very well have only been obtained after the one-month period from the date of the order has expired. This is to overc ome the same sort of problems that were enc ountered in **_Bank of America v Chai Yen_** (supra). 

**_Extension of time_** 

We now move to the third issue. It is settled law that there are four fac tors whic h the c ourt should take into c onsideration in determining whether it should exerc ise its disc retion to extend time to enable an applic ant to file a notic e of appeal out of time, namely, the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, the merits of the appeal and the degree of prejudic e: see **Pearson v Chen Chien Wen Edwin** [1991] SLR 212 [1991] 3 MLJ 208 and **Vettath v Vettath** <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 1</span>. 

In the present c ase the delay was some 18 days. The reason for the delay was that the solic itors thought that time only began to run from the date the judge was deemed to have c ertified that he did not require further arguments. This is a c ase of the solic itors misc onstruing the rules. So the question is: would suc h a misc onstruc tion c onstitute a suffic ient ground to grant an extension of time to file a notic e of appeal? 

In **Nomura Regionalisation Venture Fund v Ethical Investments** <span class="citation">[2000] 4 SLR 46</span> this c ourt had the oc c asion to c onsider the question whether a mistake made by a solic itor or his staff c ould c onstitute a suffic ient ground for the c ourt to exerc ise its disc retion to extend time to file a notic e of appeal. In that c ase some of the earlier English (pre-1909) and Malaysian (pre-1980) authorities were reviewed but those were c ases in relation to rules whic h required `spec ial leave` before an appeal c ould be brought out of time. A leading English c ase on the post-1909 position, where only simple 


leave was needed, is **Gatti v Shoosmith** [1939] Ch 841[1939] 3 All ER 916. There, bec ause of a misreading of the rule by the applic ant`s solic itors, the applic ant was a few days late in entering an appeal. But in that c ase, before the time for appeal had expired, the respondent`s solic itors were notified of the applic ant`s intention to appeal. The English Court of Appeal held that suc h a mistake might be a suffic ient ground to justify the c ourt in exerc ising its disc retion. But the c ourt must nevertheless examine the overall c irc umstanc es to dec ide whether the disc retion should, in fac t, be exerc ised in favour of the applic ant. On the fac ts there, the disc retion was exerc ised and an extension granted. 

This flexible approac h was followed in the later c ases of **Palata Investments v Burt & Sinfield** [1985] 2 All ER 517. In Malaysia too, the c hange in the rules also had its impac t on judic ial attitudes: see **Sinnathamby v Lee Chooi Ying** [1987] 1 MLJ 110. 

In Singapore, the c urrent position is enc apsulated in the c ase **_Pearson v Chen Chien Wen Edwin_** (supra), where the delay in filing the notic e of appeal was due to a misreading of the relevant rules of c ourt by the applic ant`s solic itors. Though the mistake was bona fide, the c ourt did not think that the `misreading` arose out of any diffic ulty or c omplexity in the rules. Furthermore, the c ourt did not think that the applic ant`s prospec ts for suc c ess in the appeal were good. Ac c ordingly, the c ourt refused to exerc ise its disc retion to extend time bec ause, overall, the applic ant had not shown `grounds suffic ient to persuade the c ourt to show sympathy to him`. 

Reverting to the present c ase, this would appear to be the first c ase where the c ourts here have to c onstrue O 57 r 4(a) in the light of O 56 r 2(2). The authority whic h seems to be applic able is **_Seow Teck Ming v Tan Ah Yeo_** (supra), and as we have said, this c ase in turn relied upon **_Bank of America v Chai Yen_** (supra). While we have for the reasons given above ruled that in view of the deeming provision in O 56 r 2(2), the position enunc iated in **_Bank of America v Chai Yen_** is no longer applic able, we nevertheless c annot truly say that the position whic h we have advanc ed above is patently c lear, leaving no room for argument. The mistake is c ertainly not gross. 

As to the question of merits, it is not for the c ourt at this stage to go into a full-sc ale examination of the issues involved. Neither is it nec essary for the applic ant to show that he will suc c eed in the appeal. The threshold is lower: the test is, is the appeal hopeless? (see **_Nomura Regionalisation Venture_** (supra at p 55)). Unless one c an say that there are no prospec ts of the applic ant suc c eeding on the appeal, this is a fac tor whic h ought to be c onsidered to be neutral rather than against him. In relation to the appeal of Aberdeen & Young, there is c ertainly room for argument as to the c orrec t meaning of the words. The appeal is not hopeless. We have not set out the c ontents of the letter as we do not think it is nec essary. F&N and others do not seriously c ontend that the appeal is hopeless. 

Lastly, as to the question of prejudic e, we c annot see any real prejudic e to F&N and others if the appeal is allowed to c ontinue. The `prejudic e` c annot possibly refer to the fac t that the appeal would thereby be c ontinued, if the extension is granted. Otherwise, it would mean that in every c ase where the c ourt c onsiders the question of an extension of time to file notic e of appeal, there is prejudic e. We endorse the views expressed in this regard by Woo Bih Li JC in **_S3 Building Services v Sky Technology_** (judgment of 8 May 2001 in Suit 1001/2000). The `prejudic e` here must refer to some other fac tors, eg c hange of position on the part of the respondent pursuant to judgment. 

Having c onsidered all the c irc umstanc es of the present c ase, we are of the view that they justify the grant of an extension of time. We would ac c ordingly allow the motion of Aberdeen & Young. 

**_Costs_** 


Finally, there is the question of c osts. On the motion of F&N and others, we note that of the two issues whic h arise out of the motion, they have failed on one (whether the order was interloc utory or final) but suc c eeded on the other (whether the one-month period was to be rec koned from 21 Marc h 2001). F&N and others are therefore only granted half c osts on their motion. 

As for the motion of Aberdeen & Young, as they are requesting the c ourt for indulgenc e, they should bear the c osts of the motion notwithstanding the fac t that F&N and others oppose it and they have failed in their opposition. 

## Outcome: 

Appellants` motion allowed.
