_Tort_ – _Negligence_ 

19     Dec ember 2012 Judgment reserved. 

**Andrew Ang J:** 

**I. INTRODUCTION** 

1       This ac tion arose out of the general anaesthetic (“GA”) proc edure during the plaintiff’s (Tong Seok May Joanne) lower segment c aesarean sec tion (“LSCS”) surgery. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant (anaesthetist Dr Yau Hok Man Gordon, who had c arried out the GA proc edure) was negligent in three aspec ts: 

 (a) failing to obtain her informed c onsent for the GA proc edure; 

 (b) failing to take proper c are when manipulating her nec k during the GA proc edure; and 

 (c ) failing to provide reasonable post-surgery c are. 

2       The plaintiff c laimed that the defendant’s negligenc e had c aused her to suffer from an injury to the anterior longitudinal ligament (“ALL”) of the c ervic al spine ( _ie_ , the first seven vertebrae of the spine starting from the nec k to the upper bac k) whic h had worsened over time and developed into a whole c onstellation of further symptoms and c omplic ations. She sought damages in the region of about $3m for physic al, emotional and psyc hologic al harm allegedly suffered. 

3       What c aused the plaintiff to withhold legal proc eedings until just before the ac tion would have been time-barred? On the plaintiff’s own evidenc e, she was initially not minded to pursue an ac tion against the defendant bec ause her husband and her father are also doc tors. Sinc e the medic al profession is, ac c ording to her, a well-guarded one where they do not attac k their own, she felt that the dec ision to bring an ac tion would adversely affec t her family. The plaintiff also explained that she c onsulted many different doc tors over the years bec ause she wanted to try everything she c ould first before resorting to legal ac tion. This was disputed by the defendant who alleged that the delay arose only bec ause the plaintiff was shopping around for a favourable opinion before c ommenc ing ac tion. Although a litigant’s motivation for instituting an ac tion may not be stric tly relevant, I thought it might be useful to plac e some c ontext as to why this ac tion was only brought three years after the inc ident. 


4       I should also mention at the outset that this trial spanned a lengthy 39 days and involved 25 witnesses of fac t and nine expert witnesses. I have duly applied my mind to the c ontents of the parties’ lengthy submissions, but I do not intend to c hronic le the voluminous c ontents of evidenc e so as not to risk the reader missing the wood for the trees. The c ontents of this judgment are therefore c onfined only to fac ts and issues that are truly relevant to the determination of liability. To fac ilitate understanding, the key medic al terms will be explained where nec essary when first mentioned. 

**II. THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND** 

**_The parties_** 

5       The plaintiff graduated with a law degree from the National University of Singapore in 1995 but did not prac tic e as a lawyer, having foregone a legal c areer in favour of devoting time to her family. She provided tuition in Mathematic s and English in premises above her husband’s c linic and generally led an ac tive lifestyle with no history of nec k pains. At the material time in 2006, the plaintiff was 35 years old and pregnant with her sixth c hild. She had had no problems with her five other pregnanc ies, all of whic h resulted in delivery by vaginal birth. 

6       The defendant is a medic al prac titioner in private prac tic e and a spec ialist in anaesthesiology of 25 years’ standing at the material time. His sub-spec iality is obstetric anaesthesia. 

**_The events surrounding the LSCS_** 

7       On 25 Oc tober 2006, when she was 35 weeks and four days pregnant with her sixth c hild, the plaintiff had some vaginal bleeding and abdominal c ramps. Together with her husband, she c onsulted her obstetric ian, Dr Tham Kok Fun (“Dr Tham”), at his c linic in Gleneagles Medic al Centre. Dr Tham was the plaintiff’s family friend and had also delivered her previous c hild. The plaintiff was admitted to Gleneagles Hospital at about 6pm that same day on Dr Tham’s advic e. At about 8pm, Dr Tham went to the labour ward to disc uss his c onc erns about the c ause of the plaintiff’s bleeding (whic h had stopped by then) with the plaintiff and her husband. Sinc e the baby was not engaged and was in a transverse lie ( _ie_ , at an angle relative to the axis of the mother’s womb), it was not possible to induc e labour. Dr Tham suggested LSCS as an alternative. After some disc ussion (the c ontents of whic h were disputed), the plaintiff dec ided to undergo the LSCS surgery. Dr Tham then made arrangements for the defendant to be the anaesthetist for the plaintiff’s LSCS surgery and c onfirmed with the plaintiff that the LSCS would start at 10am the next day. The plaintiff’s husband was present with her throughout the disc ussions that evening. He also stayed with her in the ward until she went for the LSCS the next day. 

8       Sinc e the prec ise timing of the events on the day of the LSCS on 26 Oc tober 2006 is disputed, the times given in this fac tual bac kground are only estimates. The plaintiff was brought down to the Operating Theatre Rec eption Room at about 9.40am and was wheeled into the Operating Theatre (“OT”) at about 9.50am. The defendant was engaged at another appointment at Mount Elizabeth 

Hospital at 9am that same morning. [note: 1] When he was making his way from that earlier 9am appointment to the plaintiff’s appointment (whic h was sc heduled for 10am), his c ar was bloc ked by another c ar at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital c ar-park. His departure was therefore delayed. The defendant estimated that he arrived at Gleneagles Hospital between 9.45am and 9.50am. It was not disputed that he saw the plaintiff for the first time when she was already in the OT. 

9       The GA proc edure c ommenc ed at around 10am and the LSCS soon thereafter. The baby was delivered suc c essfully and the entire proc edure ended at around 11.25am. The defendant, together with Honrado Laurenc e Magsano (“Nurse Honrado”) and a Circ ulating Nurse, esc orted the plaintiff from 


the OT to the OT Rec overy Room at about 11.30am. [note: 2] After handing the plaintiff over to the OT Rec overy Room nurses and c hec king that she was responsive and that her vital signs were stable, 

the defendant left to attend to another surgery in the same hospital. [note: 3] He did not return to review the plaintiff when she was in the OT Rec overy Room nor when she was in the ward. 

10     At around 11.35am, Dr Tham saw the plaintiff in the OT Rec overy Room. She c omplained of pain to him but did not indic ate the site of the pain. Dr Tham instruc ted the nurses to administer Pethidine (a pain-killer) to the plaintiff through the intravenous drip. The plaintiff was disc harged to the ward at around 12.30pm. The plaintiff stayed in the hospital for another two days before she was disc harged on the afternoon of 28 Oc tober 2006. The plaintiff c laimed to have told the ward nurses that she experienc ed nec k and upper bac k pains during her hospital stay but this c omplaint was not reflec ted in any of the medic al rec ords. 

**_Post-discharge_** 

11     The next day, on 29 Oc tober 2006, the defendant rec eived a telephone c all from Dr Tham. Dr Tham informed the defendant that the plaintiff’s husband had c alled him (Dr Tham), c laiming that the plaintiff had c omplained of nec k pain sinc e the LSCS and that her husband wanted to speak to the defendant. At or about the same time, the plaintiff’s husband used the Gleneagles Hospital’s answering servic e to c ontac t the defendant. In response to Dr Tham’s c all, the defendant telephoned the plaintiff’s husband. The plaintiff’s husband asked the defendant if the plaintiff’s nec k pain was related to the intubation proc ess during the GA proc edure. The defendant replied in the negative. The plaintiff’s husband then asked the defendant what the reason for the plaintiff’s nec k pain c ould be. The defendant replied that it c ould be musc le ac he due to the use of Suc c inylc holine, the musc le relaxant used for the intubation. The plaintiff’s husband did not ac c ept this explanation and the c onversation ended shortly thereafter. The defendant did not speak to the plaintiff and/or her husband thereafter. 

12     On 30 Oc tober 2006, two days after disc harge from the hospital, the plaintiff c onsulted Dr Chang Wei Chun (“Dr Chang”), an orthopaedic surgeon at Orthopaedic & Traumatic Surgery Pte Ltd, Gleneagles Medic al Centre. The plaintiff was in a wheelc hair and c omplained of: (a) severe pain in the nec k that radiated to the oc c iput (the bac k of the skull) and the upper bac k; and (b) dysaesthesia (an altered sensation that c an manifest itself as disc omfort or a burning sensation) in both hands, with the right hand worse than the left. She told Dr Chang that she woke up from the LSCS with 

“severe pain in the nec k and upper bac k and over the abdominal wound site”. [note: 4] Dr Chang examined the plaintiff and found that: 

 (a) the c ervic al spine was generally tender with spasm of the trapezius musc les on both sides; 

 (b) the range of movements of her c ervic al spine was about one-third of the normal range, and the plaintiff felt pain when she turned her nec k beyond this range; 

 (c ) there were no neurologic al defic its in the limbs referable to the c ervic al spine; and 

 (d) her power, sensation and tendon reflexes were all intac t. [note: 5] 

Dr Chang also ordered an X-ray of the plaintiff’s nec k (“the 2006 X-ray”). From his review of the Xray, Dr Chang noted that the normal c urvature of her nec k was absent but that there was no radiologic al evidenc e of c ervic al spondylosis (degeneration of the c ervic al spine). He made a provisional c linic al diagnosis of ac ute c ervic al disc herniation from ligamentous nec k strain. The 


plaintiff was advised to rest and to take analgesic s. [note: 6] 

13     On 2 November 2006, the plaintiff, together with her husband, went to Dr Tham’s c linic for a follow-up c onsultation in relation to her LSCS wound. She was in a nec k c ollar. The plaintiff told Dr Tham about her husband’s telephone c onversation with the defendant on 29 Oc tober 2006. Dr Tham testified that he might have c ontac ted the defendant again after this c onsultation with the 

plaintiff but he c ould not remember for sure. [note: 7] The defendant denied rec eiving any other phone 

c all from Dr Tham relating to the plaintiff other than the phone c all on 29 Oc tober 2006. [note: 8] 

14     Ac c ording to the plaintiff, her symptoms subsequently worsened. On 8 November 2006, she 

obtained a referral from Dr Chang for physiotherapy. [note: 9] On 10 November 2006, she went to see Dr Chang again, c omplaining of persistent nec k pain with tingling spasms down her upper bac k musc les and rec urrent parathesiae (“pins and needles” feeling) down to her left index, middle and ring fingers and, to a lesser extent, her right hand. Her nec k was also stiff. Dr Chang diagnosed her as having likely sustained a traumatic c ervic al disc herniation from ac c idental strain. Dr Chang rec ommended 

physiotherapy and rest. [note: 10] However, as the plaintiff was busy with the c are of her sic kly newborn c hild amongst other matters, she did not go for physiotherapy at all in 2006. Instead, she 

had massages at home. [note: 11] 

15     As at the end of 2006, the plaintiff was taking six different kinds of medic ation daily, inc luding Panadol (for pain relief ), Ponstan (for pain relief ), Papase (for anti-inflammation), Leftose (for anti

inflammation), Neuroforte (vitamins) and Zimor (for gastritis). [note: 12] 

**_The plaintiff’s condition in 2007_** 

16     The salient points of the plaintiff’s ac c ount of her c ondition in 2007 are as follows: 

 (a) her symptoms worsened and she would feel pain shooting down her nec k and upper bac k whenever she flexed or extended her nec k; 

 (b) she c ould not sit upright in a c ar for long periods due to the pain; 

 (c ) she started to experienc e a c old patc h and a thic k sensation over the left upper arm; and 

 (d) she had “pins and needles” whenever she had to grip anything. 

17     In Marc h 2007, the plaintiff c onsulted Dr Wong Hee Kit (“Dr Wong”), an orthopaedic surgeon at the National University Hospital. Dr Wong’s initial c linic al finding was that the plaintiff had bilateral 

c arpal tunnel syndrome. [note: 13] He ordered a Needle Elec tromyography and a Nerve Conduc tion 

Study with referenc e to bilateral c arpal tunnel syndrome. [note: 14] The plaintiff did not go for the appointment that Dr Wong had fixed but instead went for a Needle Elec tromyography test arranged by her husband on 30 April 2007 with referenc e to c ervic al radic ulopathy ( _ie_ , c ompression of nerves). [note: 15] The results of the Needle Elec tromyography showed that: 

 (a) there was elec trophysiologic al evidenc e of a mild right-sided c arpal tunnel syndrome; and 

 (b) there was no c lear elec trophysiologic al evidenc e of c ervic al radic ulopathy, although c linic ally the plaintiff most likely had a mild, “sensory-only” C5/C6 radic ulopathy whic h was below the detec tion threshold of the study. [note: 16] 


The plaintiff was advised in the Needle Elec tromyography report to bring the results c ontained therein bac k to Dr Wong to be reviewed or to be c orrelated to an MRI. The plaintiff did not do so as she c laimed that Dr Wong’s diagnosis did not address the symptoms in her nec k or bac k. Neither did the 

plaintiff bring the results of the elec tromyography bac k to Dr Chang. [note: 17] 

18     On 1 Marc h 2007, the plaintiff went for an MRI sc an (“the 2007 MRI”). In the MRI report, the radiologist noted that mild degenerative disc c hanges were seen at multiple levels of the c ervic al spine from the C3/C4 to the C7/T1 region. The radiologist also noted that there was a mild reversal of 

the normal c urvature of the c ervic al spine. [note: 18] On 9 Marc h 2007, the plaintiff brought the MRI sc an and ac c ompanying report to Dr Chang. Dr Chang rec ommended that she undergo physiotherapy 

and give herself time to rec over. [note: 19] The plaintiff started physiotherapy on 16 Marc h 2007 and eventually settled on attending physiotherapy at Core Conc epts Physiotherapy Centre about twic e a 

week. [note: 20] 

19     On 19 November 2007, the plaintiff c onsulted Dr Lim Lee Leng (“Dr Lim”), a neurologist at the Singapore Neurology & Sleep Centre at Gleneagles Medic al Centre. The plaintiff did not go bac k for follow-up sessions with Dr Lim as she c laimed that Dr Lim did not explain how her nec k and bac k pain 

c ould have been c aused by the c onditions that she (Dr Lim) suggested. [note: 21] 

20     Throughout most of 2007, the plaintiff was taking nine different kinds of medic ation daily. This inc luded the medic ation that she had been taking in 2006 (see above at [15]), as well as Ac tal (for gastric ), Tanakan (gingko extrac ts) and Voltaren Emulgel (a topic al pain relief and anti-inflammatory 

drug). [note: 22] In Dec ember 2007, the plaintiff stopped taking Panadol, Ponstan and Ac tal, and 

instead took Anarex (a musc le relaxant), Mobic (for anti-inflammation) and Valium (for sleep). [note: 23] 

**_The plaintiff’s condition in 2008_** 

21     In 2008, the plaintiff reduc ed her tuition c ommitments by about a third. [note: 24] This trend of reduc tion c ontinued in 2009 by a further one-third, and in 2010 when the plaintiff stopped giving tuition altogether. In addition to the symptoms desc ribed above at [16], she started to experienc e a 

“whooshing” sound in her right ear. [note: 25] 

22     On 14 July 2008, the plaintiff c onsulted another orthopaedic surgeon at the Singapore General 

Hospital (“SGH”), Dr Tay Boon Keng (“Dr Tay”). [note: 26] Dr Tay ordered an MRI sc an and blood tests, but the plaintiff’s husband arranged for her to take the MRI sc an and blood tests privately so as to 

avoid a long wait. [note: 27] The blood tests were only done on 29 July 2008 and they were negative 

for any rheumatoid and/or auto-immune diseases. [note: 28] The MRI sc an was eventually taken on 2 August 2008 (“the 2008 MRI”). In the ac c ompanying MRI report, the radiologist noted, _inter alia_ , that there were multiple mild diffuse disc bulges in the c ervic al spine from the C3/C4 levels to the C6/C 

levels but no c ord c ompression. [note: 29] 

23     Dr Tay then referred the plaintiff to Assoc iate Professor Lo Yew Long (“Assoc Prof Lo”), a neurologist at SGH and National Neurosc ienc e Institute. On 20 August 2008, Assoc Prof Lo c arried out 

the following neurophysiologic al tests on the plaintiff [note: 30] without c arrying out a c linic al 

examination of the plaintiff beforehand: [note: 31] 


 (a) transc ranial magnetic stimulation (“TMS”) study, a test for motor responses by examining a patient’s musc le twitc h response to elec tromagnetic stimulation; 

 (b) nerve c onduc tion study to assess if there was any nerve injury; 

 (c ) autonomic nerve func tion test; and 

 (d) somatosensory evoked potential study. 

24     The results of these tests were as follows: 

 ( a ) TMS study: The TMS study showed that the plaintiff’s left upper limb and left lower limb motor evoked potential (“MEP”) amplitudes were reduc ed to 3.1mv (instead of the usual 3.5mv) and 0.2mv (instead of the usual 0.4mv) respec tively. [note: 32] However, the c entral motor c onduc tion times for all four limbs were within the normal range. [note: 33] Assoc Prof Lo nonetheless c onc luded that the plaintiff had c ortic ospinal trac t c ervic al c ord dysfunc tion (an abnormal func tioning of the spinal c ord in the nec k region). [note: 34] 

 ( b ) Nerve c onduc tion study: The test results of the nerve c onduc tion study were mixed. [note: 35] The first part of the nerve c onduc tion study showed responses within the normal range ( ie , uninterrupted nerve c onduc tion of elec tric al impulses in the body). [note: 36] However, this was not c onc lusive of absenc e of nerve injury as the mac hines may not be sensitive enough to detec t all abnormal responses. [note: 37] The sec ond part of the nerve c onduc tion study whic h tested the plaintiff’s response to a needle pric k, showed “minimal elec trophysiologic al evidenc e of c hronic left C7 C8 radic ulopathy”. [note: 38] This meant that the plaintiff had numbness on her left arm and left hand due to “longstanding and not ac ute root c ompression in the nec k”. [note: 39] 

 (c ) The automatic nerve func tion test and somatosensory evoked potential study both showed results within the normal range. [note: 40] That said, those tests might not have been sensitive enough to pic k up all abnormal readings. [note: 41] 

25     Assoc Prof Lo also reviewed the plaintiff’s 2008 MRI and found the sc ans to be c onsistent with 

the TMS study results showing c ord dysfunc tion. [note: 42] He c onc luded that the plaintiff had c ervic al spondylosis and c ord dysfunc tion, although he c ould not asc ertain how and when the latter was 

sustained. [note: 43] The plaintiff did not return to see Assoc Prof Lo until 12 Oc tober 2009. 

26     Ac c ording to the plaintiff, her symptoms c ontinued to worsen in severity. In Dec ember 2008, the plaintiff c onsulted one Dr Christopher E Furneaux (“Dr Furneaux”), a neurosurgeon at Merc y 

Spec ialist Centre in Auc kland, in New Zealand, while she was there on holiday with her family. [note: 44] Dr Furneaux told her there were no neurologic al interventions that would help her c ondition and 

rec ommended that she c ontinue with physiotherapy. [note: 45] By late 2008, the plaintiff began to feel depressed bec ause of the pain in her nec k and bac k, and the effec t it was having on her private, 

family and soc ial life. [note: 46] 

27     Throughout 2008, the plaintiff c ontinued to take almost the same medic ation as those she took in Dec ember 2007 (see above at [20]), exc ept that Valium (for sleep) was replac ed with Imovane (for 

sleep), and Lexapro (an anti-depressant) was added to the list. [note: 47] 


**_The plaintiff’s condition in 2009_** 

28     In 2009, the plaintiff further reduc ed her tuition c lasses by another one-third. [note: 48] In early to mid 2009, the plaintiff started to develop problems with her balanc e and gait, as well as diffic ulty in 

c o-ordinating her movements. [note: 49] She stumbled down the stairs at her home twic e but 

fortunately was c aught by someone on both oc c asions. [note: 50] 

29     The plaintiff c onsulted three neurologists over the c ourse of the year: 

 (a) On 31 Marc h 2009, the plaintiff c onsulted Dr Chong Pang Ngiok (“Dr Chong”), a neurologist at PN Chong Neurology Clinic at Mount Elizabeth Medic al Centre. [note: 51] She did not return to c onsult Dr Chong subsequently as she was not c omfortable with taking the types of drugs presc ribed by him. [note: 52] 

 (b) On 29 July 2009, the plaintiff c onsulted Dr Goh Khean Jin (“Dr Goh K J”), a neurologist at the UMSC UM Spec ialist Centre Sdn Bhd in the University Malaya Medic al Centre in Kuala Lumpur (“KL”), Malaysia. [note: 53] 

 (c ) On 12 Oc tober 2009, the plaintiff returned to see Assoc Prof Lo. [note: 54] 

Both Dr Goh K J and Assoc Prof Lo rec ommended that she see a pain spec ialist. [note: 55] On both oc c asions, the plaintiff took no further ac tion as she was afraid of pain spec ialists who were usually 

also anaesthetists. [note: 56] 

30     At around that time, the plaintiff developed twitc hing in her left eyelid. [note: 57] On 30 Oc tober 2009, she c onsulted Dr Prem Pillay (“Dr Pillay”), a neurosurgeon at Singapore Brain Spine Nerves 

Centre. [note: 58] Dr Pillay rec ommended that she c ontinue physiotherapy and referred her for aqua

physiotherapy. [note: 59] The plaintiff obtained an aqua-physiotherapy evaluation on 24 November 

2009 [note: 60] and dec ided against aqua-physiotherapy as she had financ ial c onstraints and was 

unc omfortable with being assigned a male physiotherapist. [note: 61] 

31     On 12 November 2009, the plaintiff went to KL to have a flexion-extension MRI done (“the 2009 

MRI”). [note: 62] In the ac c ompanying MRI report, the radiologist noted that there was kyphosis 

(reversal of the normal c urvature) of the c ervic al spine. [note: 63] The radiologist further noted that mild c ervic al spondylosis with disc bulges was apparent at all levels between C3 and C7, the most 

prominent being at C5/C6. [note: 64] A loss of T2 signal was also seen. [note: 65] 

32     On 18 November 2009, the plaintiff saw another orthopaedic surgeon at SGH Spec ialist 

Prac tic e, Dr Yue Wai Mun (“Dr Yue”). [note: 66] Dr Yue c onduc ted a physic al examination on the plaintiff and found that the range of motion of her nec k was reduc ed and there was dec reased 

sensation in her left upper limb globally. [note: 67] In addition, she had mild weakness when extending 

her elbows bilaterally. [note: 68] Ac c ording to Dr Yue, those symptoms showed that there might be a 

nerve root problem, most likely on the left side. [note: 69] Dr Yue also found that there was no evidenc e of myelopathy ( _ie_ , spinal c ord injury) as there did not appear to be a lac k of c o-ordination or 


balanc e. [note: 70] Dr Yue also reviewed the plaintiff’s X-rays and past MRI sc ans and made the following further observations: 

 (a) 2006 X-ray: Dr Yue noted that it showed a loss of the normal c urvature of the c ervic al spine and spondylosis (degeneration) partic ularly at the C5/C6 levels, c ontrary to Dr Chang’s original observations (see [12] above); [note: 71] 

 (b) 2007 MRI: Dr Yue noted that there were osteophytes ( ie , bone spurs c aused by degeneration that do not nec essarily c ause any symptoms as they are merely touc hing, and not pressing on or c ompressing, the spinal c ord) indenting the spinal c ord at C4/C5, C5/C6 and C6/C7; [note: 72] and 

 (c ) 2008 MRI: Dr Yue noted that the 2008 MRI revealed similar c hanges as the 2007 MRI, although the 2008 MRI additionally showed a mild disc bulge at the C3/C4 level. [note: 73] 

33     In late 2009, the plaintiff broke down during one of the parent review sessions at one of her c hildren’s c ounselling sessions. The c ounsellor suggested she seek professional c ounselling for herself. [note: 74] The plaintiff dec ided to do so and saw Dr Rasaiah Munidasa Winslow (“Dr Winslow”), a 

psyc hiatrist at Promises Healthc are Pte Ltd, on 28 November 2009. [note: 75] Dr Winslow assessed the plaintiff together with a psyc hologist, Dr Lam Chun Yin Julia (“Dr Lam”), over a few sessions from 28 

November 2009 to 19 January 2010. [note: 76] Dr Winslow diagnosed the plaintiff with post traumatic 

stress disorder (“PTSD”) and a major depressive disorder on 19 January 2010. [note: 77] 

34     On 7 Dec ember 2009, the plaintiff c onsulted Dr Chang again. [note: 78] Dr Chang c onduc ted a physic al examination and found that the plaintiff had a stiff and irritable nec k with the range of nec k 

movements reduc ed by a quarter. [note: 79] Dr Chang also reviewed the plaintiff’s 2008 and 2009 MRIs, and the neurologic al tests ordered by Assoc Prof Lo (see [23] above). Dr Chang noted that 

both MRIs showed similar degenerative c hanges between the C3 and C7 levels [note: 80] and the plaintiff’s c urvature of the c ervic al spine had worsened from 2008 and gone into a state of kyphosis 

(reversal of the direc tion of the c ervic al c urve) in 2009. [note: 81] Dr Chang diagnosed the plaintiff’s symptoms to be due to a c ombination of nec k strain and c ervic al spondylosis, with the former likely to have been c aused during the GA proc edure c onduc ted by the defendant and the latter likely to have 

been aggravated by the initial nec k strain. [note: 82] Dr Chang was also of the view that the neurologic al tests ordered by Assoc Prof Lo on 20 August 2008 (see [23]–[24] above) supported his 

finding of nerve injury. [note: 83] 

35     Throughout 2009, the plaintiff took a total of 12 different kinds of medic ation daily. This list inc luded the medic ation that she had been taking in 2008 (see [27] above), as well as Lyric a (for 

nerve pain) and Xanax (anti-anxiety). [note: 84] 

**_The plaintiff’s condition in 2010_** 

36     In 2010, the plaintiff stopped working as a tutor. [note: 85] On 19 April 2010, she stumbled down 

the stairs again but this time there was nobody around to c atc h her. [note: 86] Her symptoms 

c ontinued to worsen after the fall. [note: 87] On 27 May 2010, the plaintiff c onsulted Dr Pillay again. [note: 88] Dr Pillay disc ussed with the plaintiff the surgic al options she c ould c onsider and again 


rec ommended aqua-physiotherapy. [note: 89] 

37     On 2 June 2010, the plaintiff went for her fourth MRI (“the 2010 MRI”). In the ac c ompanying MRI report, the radiologist noted that there were disc protrusions from C3/C4 all the way to T1/T 

levels ( _ie_ , from the c ervic al spine to the first and sec ond levels of the thorac ic spine). [note: 90] The radiologist also noted that there was a loss of normal T2 signal, whic h was c onsistent with c ervic al 

spondylosis. [note: 91] There was no signific ant c hange c ompared to the 2009 MRI. [note: 92] 

38     On 14 July 2010, following Dr Pillay’s rec ommendation, the plaintiff signed up for aqua

physiotherapy at Aqua Physio Rehab Center. [note: 93] The plaintiff found it helpful and has c ontinued 

going there onc e a week on average. [note: 94] 

39     In June 2010, when the plaintiff was in KL for a short trip, she went to Gleneagles Intan Medic al 

Centre for physiotherapy as she was in pain without her usual physiotherapy. [note: 95] The physiotherapist there was of the view that the plaintiff c ould have a vestibular disorder and rec ommended that she go for vestibular physiotherapy to help with her balanc e and c o-ordination 

problems. [note: 96] Sinc e she returned to Singapore in July 2010, the plaintiff has also been going for vestibular physiotherapy about onc e every three to four weeks at Tan Toc k Seng Hospital to help 

with her balanc ing problem. [note: 97] 

40     On 18 August 2010, the plaintiff fell again and injured her foot. [note: 98] She c onsulted Dr Benjamin Tow Phak Boon (“Dr Tow”), an orthopaedic surgeon at SGH. Dr Tow rec ommended surgery 

but the plaintiff was hesitant about suc h an option. [note: 99] He also rec ommended that the plaintiff 

wear a nec k c ollar, but she did not do so on the advic e of her physiotherapist. [note: 100] Dr Tow further rec ommended that the plaintiff see a c hiroprac tor but she did not do so as she was already 

going for physiotherapy and was c onc erned about the risk of injury in c hiroprac tic treatment. [note: 101] 

41     On 14 September 2010, the plaintiff c onsulted Dr Ho Kok Yuen (“Dr Ho”), a pain spec ialist at 

Pain Management Servic e, Raffles Pain Management Centre. [note: 102] Dr Ho performed a physic al examination and found that the plaintiff had reduc ed motor strength to 4+/5 and dysaesthesia 

( _ie_ , “pins and needles” feeling) in the left upper limb. [note: 103] Her reflexes were normal. [note: 104] 

Dr Ho suggested several invasive proc edures for the plaintiff to c onsider. [note: 105] Pending her dec ision, the plaintiff has been going bac k to see Dr Ho for review about onc e a month sinc e then. [note: 106] On 14 Oc tober 2010 and 23 Dec ember 2010 respec tively, the plaintiff c onsulted two other 

pain spec ialists – Dr Bernard Lee Mun Kam (at Singapore Painc are Center) [note: 107] and Dr Nic holas 

Chua Hai Liang (at Tan Toc k Seng Hospital) [note: 108] – for further opinions. 

42     Throughout 2010, the plaintiff c ontinued to undergo treatment for her PTSD and depressive disorder with Dr Winslow and Dr Lam. The plaintiff also took a total of 14 different kinds of medic ation 

daily, inc luding those that she was taking in 2009 (see above at [35]), [note: 109] as well as Mic ardis (hypertension) and Neurobion (in plac e of Neuroforte). 

**_The plaintiff’s condition as at 2011_** 

43     Ac c ording to the plaintiff, as at 2011 she was suffering from: 


 (a) headac hes from the base of her head to the whole bac k of her head, whic h sometimes worsened to migraine-like intense pain c ausing nausea; 

 (b) c hronic and persistent pain in her nec k, shoulders and upper bac k, whic h was worse on bending her nec k or turning her head right or left; 

 (c ) shooting pain and musc le spasms down the nec k into the upper bac k, espec ially when flexing her nec k up and down; 

 (d) left arm parasthesia, a c onstant thic k sensation on the outer part of her upper left arm, with reduc ed sensation and persistent, abnormal c oldness; 

 (e) sensation of pins and needles in both hands, extending up to the wrists, when gripping onto any objec t for a while; 

 (f) permanent numbness of all her fingertips, espec ially her right thumb; 

 (g) “pins and needles” in both feet and toes, whic h worsened on sitting; 

 (h) vestibular imbalanc e with nausea when in a moving vehic le; 

 (i) tripping and problems with c o-ordination sinc e 2009, whic h c aused her to fall; 

 (j) twitc hing in both eyelids, espec ially the left; 

 (k) “whooshing” sound in her right ear, whic h worsened or instantly c ame on when her nec k was in c ertain positions; 

 (l) sleep apnoea and snoring; 

 (m) poor c onc entration and memory and inability to think c learly; 

 (n) depression; 

 (o) anxiety; and 

 (p) anger. [note: 110] 

44     The plaintiff further c laimed that her life had been affec ted in the following major aspec ts: 

 (a) having to go for various physiotherapies on a regular basis so as to func tion daily; [note: 111] 

 (b) inability to func tion as a wife, mother and homemaker; [note: 112] 

 (c ) loss of independenc e and self-esteem; [note: 113] and 

 (d) loss of inc ome as a tutor. [note: 114] 

45     Throughout 2011, the plaintiff reportedly took a total of 14 different kinds of medic ation daily, 


inc luding those that she took in 2010 (see above at [42], as well as Ultrac et (for pain relief ), Stugeron (for giddiness) and Seroquel (for sleep and depression). 

**III. THE PLAINTIFF’S CASE** 

46     The pertinent points of the plaintiff’s c ase were as follows: 

 ( a ) Informed c onsent: the defendant did not disc harge his duty of c are to explain to her the nature, risks of and alternatives to GA, inc luding the risk of nec k injury. 

 (b) The intubation: 

 (i) The plaintiff was c onsidered a potentially diffic ult patient to intubate; 

 (ii) The defendant was in a rush and did not c arry out a pre-anaesthetic assessment at all to asc ertain her suitability for GA before c ommenc ing the GA proc edure. He therefore did not realise that she would be a potentially diffic ult patient to intubate. 

 (iii) The defendant did not adequately pre-oxygenate the plaintiff before intubating her sinc e he was in a rush; 

 (iv) The defendant had not previously presc ribed pre-medic ation for the plaintiff; 

 (v) The defendant did not realise that the plaintiff was ac tually a diffic ult patient to intubate until he tried to intubate her; 

 (vi) By this time, the plaintiff was unc onsc ious and her musc les were paralysed. As she was not able to breathe on her own, there would have been a need to intubate her as soon as possible before her oxygen saturation levels dipped dangerously low; 

 (vii) The defendant’s failure to antic ipate diffic ulty in intubation meant that he did not ensure that adjunc ts suc h as the stylet or bougie (adjunc ts used to assist with diffic ult intubations) were brought into the OT; 

 (viii) Against the bac kground of these c ountervailing pressures and fac ed with possible hypoxia from the plaintiff, the defendant had to intubate the plaintiff without the use of assisting adjunc ts; 

 (ix) This resulted in his having to use exc essive forc e and hyperextending the plaintiff’s nec k, thus c ausing injury to the C4/C5 level of the ALL that runs along the c ervic al spine; 

 (x) She c omplained of nec k and upper bac k pains upon waking up in the OT Rec overy Room and subsequently in the ward, whic h proved her c laim that an injury had been c aused by the defendant during the administration of GA; and 

 (xi) The X-ray and the four MRIs taken over the years also proved that the degeneration of her c ervic al spine was c aused by a traumatic injury, whic h must have been c aused by the defendant. 

 (c ) Post-operative c are: 

 (i) The defendant’s post-operative orders were inc omplete; 


 (ii) The defendant signed off on her disc harge from the OT Rec overy Room without c ertifying that she was fit for disc harge; 

 (iii) The defendant did not review her c ondition when she was in the ward; and 

 (iv) The defendant did not review the plaintiff even after hearing about her c ondition via telephone c all on 29 Oc tober 2006. 

**IV. THE DEFENDANT’S DEFENCE** 

47     The pertinent points of the defendant’s defenc e were as follows: 

 (a) Informed c onsent: 

 (i) The defendant had explained the risks of GA to the plaintiff. He did not explain to the plaintiff the risk of nec k injury bec ause that was not a c ommonly known risk of GA; and 

 (ii) The defendant did not have to explain to the plaintiff the alternatives to GA bec ause it was the usual prac tic e between Dr Tham and him for Dr Tham to disc uss the alternatives with the patient. 

 (b) The intubation: 

 (i) The plaintiff was not c onsidered a potentially diffic ult patient to intubate; 

 (ii) The defendant had c arried out a proper pre-anaesthetic assessment of the plaintiff and c onfirmed her suitability for GA; 

 (iii) He c arried out adequate pre-oxygenation on the plaintiff before intubating her; 

 (iv) He did not enc ounter any diffic ulty in c arrying out the GA proc edure; 

 (v) He had the stylet and the bougie ready (adjunc ts used to assist with diffic ult intubations) in the OT if he needed them and in fac t he had no need to use them; 

 (vi) He did not use exc essive forc e nor did he hyperextend the plaintiff’s nec k; 

 (vii) The plaintiff did not c omplain of nec k and upper bac k pain upon waking up in the OT Rec overy Room or at any time during her hospital stay; and 

 (viii) The X-ray and the four MRIs taken over the years proved that the degeneration of the plaintiff’s c ervic al spine was c aused by natural wear and tear and not a traumatic injury to the C4/C5 level of the ALL. 

 (c ) Post-operative c are: 

 (i) The post-operative orders were suffic ient as those orders not doc umented were already given verbally to the OT Rec overy Room nurses; 

 (ii) The plaintiff was fit for disc harge from the OT Rec overy Room as the nurses did not inform him of any c hange in the plaintiff’s c ondition;

52     Lastly, Dr Tsou Yu Yan Ian (“Dr Tsou”), a spec ialist in diagnostic radiology with MediRad Assoc iates Radiology Clinic at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, was c alled by agreement between both parties during the c ourse of the trial as a c ourt expert. 

**VI. THE GENERAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK** 

53     The applic able law on medic al negligenc e is set out in _Khoo James v Gunapathy d/o Muniandy_ [2002] 1 SLR(R) 1024 (“ _Gunapathy_ ”). The Court of Appeal in _Gunapathy_ adopted the test in _Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee_ [1957] 1 WLR 582 (“ _Bolam_ ”) as supplemented by _Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority_ [1998] AC 232 (“ _Bolitho_ ”). The _Bolam_ test (Mc Nair J at 587), quoted with approval in _Gunapathy_ at [54], is as follows: 

 ... [A doc tor] is not guilty of negligenc e if he has ac ted in ac c ordanc e with a prac tic e ac c epted as proper by a responsible body of medic al men skilled in that partic ular art. ... Putting it the other way round, a man is not negligent, if he is ac ting in ac c ordanc e with suc h a prac tic e, merely bec ause there is a body of opinion who would take a c ontrary view. ... 

54     The House of Lords in _Bolitho_ c larified that “the prac tic e ac c epted as proper by a responsible body of medic al men” must have a “logic al basis”, partic ularly in c ases involving the weighing of risks against benefits. This would require the experts to “have direc ted their minds to the question of c omparative risks and benefits and have reac hed a defensible c onc lusion on the matter” (at [241]– [242]). This was interpreted by the Court of Appeal (at [64]–[65]) in _Gunapathy_ to be a two-stage inquiry: 

 (a) whether the expert direc ted his mind to the c omparative risks and benefits relating to the matter, c onsidering and weighing all the c ountervailing fac tors relevant to the issue and rejec ting bare and unsupported assertions; and 


 (b) whether the medic al expert had reac hed a “defensible c onc lusion” as a result of the balanc ing proc ess. The test of a “defensible c onc lusion” was distinguished from the test of reasonableness at [65]: 

 ... Interpreted liberally, Bolitho c ould unwittingly herald invasive inquiry into the merits of medic al opinion. For if “defensible” were to be given a meaning akin to “reasonable”, the Bolam test would only be honoured in lip servic e. A doc tor would then be liable when his view, as represented by the defenc e experts, was found by the c ourts to be unreasonable. We do not think this was the intention of House of Lords in Bolitho. To our minds, a “defensible c onc lusion” c onnotes the satisfac tion of two c onc epts. First, the medic al opinion must be internally consistent on its face. It must make c ogent sense as a whole, suc h that no part of the opinion c ontradic ts with another. A doc tor c annot say, for example, that he supports a c ertain approac h and attest that in that very situation, he would nevertheless have done quite the opposite. Sec ond, the opinion should not fly in the face of proven extrinsic facts relevant to the matter. It should not ignore or c ontrovert known medic al fac ts or advanc es in medic al knowledge. [emphasis added in bold italic s] 

55     The Court of Appeal further found (at [70]) that the _Bolam_ test should be applied _after_ the trial judge has made a finding of fac t as “it is a well-settled princ iple that a question of fac t, as opposed to a question of the standards of medic al prac tic e, does not fall within the provinc e of the _Bolam_ test”. However, “judges and lawyers should not play at being doc tors” and should not enter the arena of divided medic al opinion bec ause the “lawyer-judge, while eminently equipped to follow suc h arguments, finds himself quite out of his depth when c alled upon to adjudic ate over them” (at [3]). 

56     With the applic able legal framework in mind, I turn now to address the first issue of informed c onsent. 

**VII. INFORMED CONSENT** 

**_Overview of the law on giving of advice_** 

57     There has been some debate about whether the general test for medic al negligenc e in _Bolam_ should apply to the giving of medic al advic e. The argument against the _Bolam_ test was artic ulated by Lord Sc arman in _Sidaway v Board of Governors of the Bethlem Royal Hospital and the Maudsley Hospital and others_ [1985] AC 871 (“ _Sidaway_ ”) (at 882): 

 ... The implic ations of this view of the law are disturbing. It leaves the determination of a legal duty to the judgment of doc tors. ... 

58     This objec tion subsequently found fuller artic ulation in _Pearce v United Bristol Healthcare NHS Trust_ [1999] PIQR P53 (“ _Pearce_ ”) and in _Chester v Afshar_ [2005] 1 AC 134 (“ _Chester_ ”). Lord Woolf MR in _Pearce_ (at P59) opined: 

 In a c ase where it is being alleged that a plaintiff has been deprived of the opportunity to make a proper dec ision as to what c ourse he or she should take in relation to treatment, it seems to me to be the law, as indic ated in the c ases to whic h I have just referred, that if there is a significant risk which would affect the judgment of a reasonable patient, then in the normal course it is the responsibility of a doctor to inform the patient of that significant risk, if the information is needed so that the patient can determine for him or herself as to what course he or she should adopt. [emphasis added] 


59     The “reasonable patient” test has been adopted in Australia (see _Rogers v Whitaker_ (1992) 175 CLR 479; _Rosenberg v Percival_ (2001) 205 CLR 434); Canada (see _Reibl v Hughes_ (1980) 114 DLR (3d) 1); and Malaysia (see _Foo Fio Na v Dr Soo Fook Mun and Anor_ [2007] 1 MLJ 593). On this approac h, a doc tor’s duty to warn his patient of all material risks would c over every situation where: (a) a reasonable person in the patient’s position, if warned of the risk, will be likely to attac h signific anc e to it; or (b) if the medic al prac titioner is or should be reasonably aware that the partic ular patient, if warned of the risk, will be likely to attac h signific anc e to it. 

60     Nevertheless, I find that the law in Singapore is c lear. The Court of Appeal in _Gunapathy_ had c onsidered and approved the _Bolam_ test in the c ontext of giving advic e _after_ having disc ussed _Sidaway_ and Lord Sc arman’s objec tions to the _Bolam_ test. It c onc luded (at [142]–[143]): 

 142 We ... feel c ompelled to address the judge’s inexplic able assumption that Bolam had been unc eremoniously evic ted from the issue of medic al advic e, and to make the observation that were this argument ever to arise in our jurisdic tion, it would find Sidaway ... to be somewhat shaky ground on whic h to stand. 

 143 Ac c ordingly, in affirming that the Bolam test applied to the issue of advice in the present appeal, we found that the defendant doc tors’ disc losure of the relevant perc entage risks of radiosurgery was supported by a respec table body of medic al opinion. They had not given negligent advic e to Gunapathy. 

 [emphasis added in bold italic s] 

61     Tay Yong Kwang J in _D’Conceicao Jeanie Doris (Administratrix of the estate of Milakov Steven, deceased) v Tong Ming Chuan_ [2011] SGHC 193 (“ _D’Conceicao_ ”) usefully summarised the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of _Sidaway_ in _Gunapathy_ (at [114]–[115]): 

 114 In Gunapathy , the Court’s interpretation of Sidaway was as follows. Yong CJ noted the dissenting view of Lord Sc arman that Bolam only applied to diagnosis and treatment and not advic e. Yong CJ then pointed out that the majority of the House in Sidaway parted c ompany with Lord Sc arman on this issue. Lord Diploc k, in the majority, stated (at 893) that the doc tor’s duty of c are was “not subjec t to dissec tion into a number of c omponent parts to whic h different c riteria of what satisfy the duty of c are apply, suc h as diagnosis, treatment and advic e”. A doc tor’s dec ision as to what risks a patient should be warned of was stated to be “as muc h an exerc ise of professional skill and judgment as any other part of the doc tor’s c omprehensive duty of c are” (at 895). Therefore, Lord Diploc k opined that “no c onvinc ing reason has ... been advanc ed ... that would justify treating the Bolam test as doing anything less than laying down a princ iple of English law that is c omprehensive and applic able to every aspec t of the duty of c are” (at 893). In Gunapathy (at [137]), the c ourt noted that Lord Diploc k had “entrenc hed the applic ation of Bolam to advic e in no unc ertain terms”. Lord Templeman was stated to have “effec tively supported the Bolam test” even though he did not make spec ific referenc e to the test ( Gunapathy at [138]). Yong CJ went on to state (at [141]) that “it was c lear that Lord Bridge [with whom Lord Keith agreed] did not agree with Lord Sc arman’s dissenting view that it was for the c ourt to determine what material risks a prudent patient was entitled to rec eive”. 

 115 However, Yong CJ noted that Lord Bridge did c arve a qualific ation into the Bolam test. The question of advic e and risk disc losure should not be abdic ated entirely to the medic al profession. Yong CJ observed (at [141]) that Lord Bridge took the view that: 

 ... if a risk was substantial and there was no c ogent c linic al reason why disc losure should not 


 be made, the judge was at liberty to c onc lude that no respec table medic al expert would have failed to make it. ... 

 This was seen by the Court of Appeal to be “a forerunner to the more general qualific ation made by Bolitho ” ( Gunapathy at [141]). 

62     Although the Court of Appeal in _Gunapathy_ c larified (at [142]) that it was not providing a c onc lusive ruling on the doc trine of informed c onsent as it did not have the benefit of full submissions on the issue, full submissions were given in _D’Conceicao_ and duly rejec ted by Tay J. 

63     There were three aspec ts to Tay J’s analysis, all of whic h I am in full agreement with. First, Tay J found that the authorities from other jurisdic tions advoc ating the “reasonable patient” test (see [59] above) had already been c onsidered and expressly rejec ted by the Singapore High Court in _Surender Singh s/o Jagdish Singh and another (administrators of the estate of Narindar Kaur d/o Sarwan Singh, deceased) v Li Man Kay_ [2010] 1 SLR 428 (“ _Surender_ ”) on the basis that it was bound by the Court of Appeal in _Gunapathy_ ( _Surender_ at [152]–[153]). I am also bound by _Gunapathy_. I note Hri Kumar and Terry Kaan SheungHung’s observations on _Gunapathy_ in “ _Developments in Singapore Law between 2001 and 2005_ ” (Singapore Ac ademy of Law, 2006) at p 702: 

 [Gunapathy] reaffirms and re-establishes beyond doubt that the Bolam princ iple applies in full forc e to diagnosis, treatment and advic e – and not just the first two – whic h are the three aspec ts of the single global duty of c are of the physic ian as defined by the majority in Sidaway. [emphasis added in bold italic s] 

64     Sec ond, Tay J rejec ted the proposition that the English c ases of _Pearce_ and _Chester_ supported an extension or repudiation of the _Bolam_ test. He found that notwithstanding Lord Woolf MR’s language in _Pearce_ whic h appeared to support the “reasonable patient” test (see [58] above) Lord Woolf MR had expressly ac c epted Lord Templeman’s speec h in _Sidaway_ as the law ( _Pearce_ at P58) and had thereby “effec tively supported the _Bolam_ test” ( _Gunapathy_ at [138]). Tay J also rejec ted the plaintiff’s relianc e on _Chester_ bec ause: (a) _Chester_ was a c ase on c ausation, and therefore any c omments on the standard of c are were only _obiter_ ; and (b) _Chester_ ’s emphasis on human rights and autonomy might be attributed to the binding effec t of the European Convention of Human Rights on the English c ourts pursuant to the Human Rights Ac t 1998 (UK) (c 42) (“Human Rights Ac t”), whic h Singapore is not bound by ( _D’Conceicao_ at [123]). 

65     I should add that _Chester_ is not without its detrac tors even in the United Kingdom. It has been desc ribed as a radic al dec ision whic h protec ts “autonomy interest in being fully informed”; see Jane Stapleton, “Oc c am’s razor reveals an orthodox basis for _Chester v Afshar_ ” (2006) 122 LQR 426. I also note that, to date, no Singapore c ase has applied either _Chester_ or _Pearce_. 

66     Third, Tay J in _D’Conceicao_ c onsidered and rejec ted the plaintiff’s argument that if the doc tor failed to c ommunic ate a signific ant risk to the patient before c arrying out the rec ommended treatment, this would fail to meet the _Bolitho_ threshold of logic and thus amount to a breac h of the doc tor’s duty of c are. Tay J c ommented (at [124]): 

 The plaintiff’s c harac terisation of the threshold of logic looks like an attempt to abolish Bolam’s applic ability to the issue of advic e. This is at odds with the Court of Appeal’s dec ision in Gunapathy whic h makes it c lear that the Bolam and Bolitho jurisprudenc e applies to the issue of advic e. Gunapathy is binding on me. I do agree with the plaintiff that if the medic al profession illogic ally omits to warn of c ertain risks whic h patients should undoubtedly be informed of, then the c ourt should interfere on the authority of Bolitho. In this regard, I turn to a passage from the 


 speec h of Lord Bridge in Sidaway (at 900), where he was one of the majority judges: 

 But even in a c ase where, as here, no expert witness in the relevant medic al field c ondemns the non-disc losure as being in c onflic t with ac c epted and responsible medic al prac tic e, I am of opinion that the judge might in certain circumstances come to the conclusion that disclosure of a particular risk was so obviously necessary to an informed choice on the part of the patient that no reasonably prudent medical man would fail to make it. The kind of c ase I have in mind would be an operation involving a substantial risk of grave adverse c onsequenc es, as, for example, the ten per c ent. risk of a stroke from the operation whic h was the subjec t of the Canadian c ase of Reibl v. Hughes, 114 D.L.R. (3d) 1. In suc h a c ase, in the absenc e of some c ogent c linic al reason why the patient should not be informed, a doc tor, rec ognising and respec ting his patient’s right of dec ision, c ould hardly fail to apprec iate the nec essity for an appropriate warning. 

 [emphasis in original] 

67     It is c lear from the foregoing that a doc tor’s duty to give advic e c annot be separated from his general duty of c are to his patient: the _Bolam_ test supplemented by the _Bolitho_ test of logic (c ollec tively “the _Gunapathy_ test”), applies equally to a doc tor’s giving of advic e as to his duties of treatment and diagnosis. I ac c ordingly rejec t the plaintiff’s relianc e on _Pearce_ and _Chester_. 

**_The taking of informed consent in the context of obstetric anaesthesia_** 

68     While the law on the giving of advic e is c lear, its prac tic al applic ation to the spec ific c ontext of obstetric anaesthesia is more diffic ult and requires further analysis. 

_The joint responsibility of giving advice_ 

69     Two related c onc epts govern the taking of informed c onsent: First, the giving of advic e is the joint responsibility of both the anaesthetist and the primary treating physic ian. Sec ond, the giving of advic e is a proc ess, and not an event, whic h begins from the moment relevant information is given to the patient until final c onfirmation of that information by the anaesthetist before the proc edure begins. The relevant information thus need not emanate from the same sourc e throughout the proc ess of informing the patient. 

70     Anaesthesia is a _unique_ medic al spec iality in the sense that it does not stand alone and is always performed in c onjunc tion with some other surgic al proc edure. When exploring anaesthetic options, the anaesthetist is in the best position to advise the patient about anaesthetic c onsiderations, while the obstetric ian is best plac ed to advise the patient about obstetric c onc erns. Anaesthetic and obstetric c onsiderations in relation to a patient’s anaesthetic options are rarely ever mutually exc lusive. In obstetric c ases, two distinc tive features stand out. First, unlike, for example, heart surgery, in relation to whic h GA is more often than not the only option available, a patient about to undergo LSCS usually has a real c hoic e between several anaesthetic options. Sec ond, as agreed by the obstetric experts on both sides, the patient’s obstetric c ondition is a fac tor that c an signific antly affec t the c hosen mode of anaesthesia. This gives rise to joint responsibility on the part of the anaesthetist and the primary treating physic ian for the giving of advic e. 

71     On behalf of the plaintiff, it was brought to my attention that the Gleneagles Hospital c onsent form used during the plaintiff’s LSCS has sinc e been amended to separate a patient’s c onsent to 

surgery from her c onsent for the anaesthesia. [note: 115] The plaintiff submitted that this new c onsent 

form showed that the anaesthetist has a personal and non-delegable duty [note: 116] to explain the 


nature, purpose, risks of and alternatives to the proposed anaesthesia to a patient. [note: 117] I am unable to ac c ept this submission. 

72     First, the fac t that an anaesthetist is responsible for final _confirmation_ of the patient’s c onsent before c ommenc ing the GA proc edure does not detrac t from the fac t that the initial proc ess of advising the patient is a matter of joint responsibility. If the plaintiff’s submission is right, the result would be to give one spec ialist the responsibility of giving advic e in relation to another spec ialist’s field of spec iality when advising on anaesthesia options. This would be unjust. 

73     Sec ond, as the giving of advic e is a proc ess and not an event, the anaesthetist does not have to be the one to provide the relevant information to the patient. Information c an be c ommunic ated by other relevant medic al professionals suc h as the primary treating physic ian, medic al offic ers, nurses, or even through available resourc es suc h as information pamphlets. 

74     I note Tay J’s c omments in _D’Conceicao_ (see [61] _supra_ ) that in a situation where a patient is attended to by a team of medic al personnel (at [129]): 

 ... Onc e a member of the team advises the patient of c ertain information and the patient understands suc h information, the patient c an be said to have pre-existing knowledge of suc h information with the effec t that the other members of the team need not repeat the same information to the patient. ... [emphasis added] 

_The anaesthetist’s ultimate responsibility for ensuring informed consent_ 

75     The c ontent of an anaesthetist’s non-delegable duty arises from his c ontrol of the c onduc t of the anaesthetic proc edure; he must ultimately ensure that the patient’s c onsent has been truly informed before c ommenc ing the proc edure. In other words, the anaesthetist is responsible not only for explaining to the patient the risks of a partic ular proc edure in so far as “pure” anaesthetic c onsiderations are c onc erned; he must also c onfirm that the primary treating physic ian has explained to the patient the anaesthetic c onsiderations relevant to his field of expertise. This final c onfirmation should be done in a meaningful way by c hec king with the patient what the primary treating physic ian had already disc ussed with her, as opposed to merely asking the plaintiff to c onfirm that there had been a disc ussion. However, as I will go on to elaborate, the question of whether or not an anaesthetist has disc harged his duty of c are in relation to final c onfirmation depends on the fac ts and c irc umstanc es of eac h c ase. 

76     That said, it bears emphasising that there must still be a balanc e between ensuring the disc losure of every c onc eivable risk, the c onstraints of time, as well as the possibility of frightening the patient and inadvertently c ausing her to c ome to an unbalanc ed dec ision. Ultimately, the _Gunapathy_ test applies in asc ertaining the standard to whic h an anaesthetist will be held when determining whether he has breac hed his duty of c are in this regard. 

**_Issues to be determined_** 

77     Having explained how the law on informed c onsent applies in the spec ific c ontext of obstetric anaesthesia, I turn now to c onsider whether, on the fac ts of this c ase, the defendant had disc harged his duty. To determine liability, the following c omponents of informed c onsent need to be addressed: 

 (a) Sub-issue 1(a): nature and risks of GA generally; 

 (b) Sub-issue 1(b): the spec ific risk of nec k injury; 


## Q: 

## A: 

## Q: 

 (c ) Sub-issue 1(c ): the alternatives to GA; and 

 (d) Sub-issue 1(d): whether informed c onsent was vitiated by the loc ation where c onsent was obtained. 

**_Sub-issue 1(a): The nature and risks of GA generally_** 

_(i) The defendant’s duty to explain about GA in so far as non-obstetric anaesthetic considerations were concerned_ 

78     The parties’ respec tive positions are as follows: 

 (a) Ac c ording to the plaintiff, the defendant c ame into the OT and started the GA proc edure immediately without saying a single word to her. The plaintiff relied on three piec es of evidenc e to show that the defendant c ould not possibly have spoken to her: 

 (i) inac c urac ies in the anaesthetic rec ord whic h would have been avoided if the defendant had c hec ked with the plaintiff; 

 (ii) rec ords of timing whic h are inc onsistent with the defendant having spoken to the plaintiff; and 

 (iii) the defendant’s rushed manner, preventing him from speaking to the plaintiff. 

 (b) Ac c ording to the defendant, he had spec ific ally advised the plaintiff on the general risks assoc iated with GA whic h inc luded post-operative nausea, vomiting, and soreness of the throat, and that the plaintiff had indic ated that she was aware of and understood the general risks assoc iated with GA. [note: 118] He had also asked the plaintiff if she had any questions, to whic h she answered in the negative. [note: 119] It was only thereafter that he c ountersigned the plaintiff’s c onsent form and c ommenc ed the GA proc edure. The defendant explained that he did not doc ument his disc ussions with the plaintiff as he had relied on the c onsent form to rec ord that he had done so. [note: 120] 

The Anaesthetic Rec ord 

79     The plaintiff c laimed that inac c urac ies in the Anaesthetic Rec ord were proof that the defendant 

c ould not possibly have spoken to her as he c laimed. [note: 121] 

80     First, the defendant wrote “prev GA ok” ( _ie_ , “previous GA okay”) under the sec tion on 

“Anaesthetic History”, [note: 122] although the plaintiff had never undergone GA before. When c rossexamined on this mistake, the defendant maintained that he had only written down what the plaintiff had told him: 

 Tell us how the patient c ame to tell you that she had previous GA? 

 I don’t know why but I only wrote what I heard. 

 So let me just get your c ase. You are saying this partic ular patient when asked about her anaesthetic history dec ided to tell you that she had undergone a previous GA proc edure. Is that your evidenc e? 


## A: 

## Q: 

## A: 

## Q: 

## A: 

## Q: 

## A: 

 Yes. 

 Dr Yau, it is obvious that you did not speak to the patient, c ertainly not about anaesthetic history, and that is why you wrote an entry whic h is not borne out in fac t. Agree or disagree? 

 I disagree bec ause although the entry is wrong, where else c ould I have got that information from? Bec ause if I hadn’t spoken to her, I c ould have just looked at the medic al rec ords and gotten the history and saw in the medic al rec ords that ac tually she had no previous surgery. And then I would have written c orrec tly in there. 

 I know. 

 The fac t that it’s wrong only goes to show that I must have spoken to her, although why it’s wrong I c annot explain, bec ause if I hadn’t asked her that question and I needed to fill in for doc umentation purposes that partic ular entry, I c ould have gone through the medic al rec ords to look for that information. It’s rec orded in the medic al rec ords. [note: 123] 

I note that this is inc onsistent with the defendant’s subsequent assertion that he had looked through the Admission History and Nursing Assessment rec ords whic h reflec ted that the plaintiff’s previous 

deliveries were all vaginal deliveries. [note: 124] However, this is not nec essarily an irrec onc ilable inc onsistenc y sinc e the defendant did not spec ify exac tly whic h of the medic al rec ords he was referring to. The fac t of the matter is that _what was recorded in the Anaesthetic Record was different from what the defendant would have recorded had he relied on any of the other medical records available instead of talking to the plaintiff_. The defendant’s explanation was therefore reasonable on the evidenc e. In fac t, based on the defendant’s evidenc e during c ross-examination, it is possible that the mistake arose out of misc ommunic ation: 

 All right. Now let’s look at anaesthetic history. Tell us how you obtained this information? 

 ... 

 I c annot remember prec isely what I said five years ago, Your Honour, but based on my usual prac tic e, I say “Do you have any previous general anaesthesia and, if so, did you have any problems”. That is what I normally say. [note: 125] 

Based on the defendant’s evidenc e of his usual prac tic e, the plaintiff might have said “no” to mean that she had not undergone any previous GA proc edures, but the defendant had mistaken her reply to mean that there was no problem with her previous GA proc edures instead. 

81     The other inac c urac y in the Anaesthetic Rec ord was found in the sec tion on medic al history. The tic k in the box marked “Nil” was c anc elled and the words “Thal Minor” ( _ie_ , thalassaemia minor (a blood disorder)) was added. Consequently, the Americ an Soc iety of Anaesthesiologists (“ASA”) 

c lassific ation of “1” was amended to “2”. [note: 126] The ASA c lassific ation is a system for assessing the physic al fitness of patients before surgery. The plaintiff’s c ase was that the amendments showed that the defendant did not speak to her at all, and that he subsequently obtained the information about the plaintiff’s thalassaemia minor from the various medic al rec ords inc luding Dr Tham’s c linic notes, the Admission History and Nursing Assessment, the Partogram & Labour Chart and the Peri

Operative Nursing Rec ord. [note: 127] The defendant explained that his working habit was to fill up the Anaesthetic Rec ord only after the surgery had started, and not to transc ribe his notes while he was 


speaking to the patient. [note: 128] As suc h, the amendments were made when he realised that he 

had filled in the information wrongly. [note: 129] Counsel for the plaintiff, Ms Melanie Ho (“Ms Ho”), submitted that had the defendant really spoken to the plaintiff, her c ondition of thalassaemia minor 

would not have slipped his mind just several minutes later. [note: 130] I do not find this argument c ompelling. If the defendant had not spoken to the plaintiff but had relied on the other medic al rec ords to obtain her medic al history, he would more likely than not have c opied the information down c orrec tly the first time and would not have had to make subsequent amendments. The defendant’s explanation was therefore c redible on the evidenc e before me. 

The issue of timing 

82     The plaintiff also relied on the doc umented timing of events to argue that the defendant c ould not have had enough time to c arry out all that he c laimed to have done in the pre-anaesthetic assessment, whic h inc ludes the disc ussion of risks of GA. The plaintiff’s c ase was that the defendant had, at most, five minutes to c arry out his entire pre-operative assessment for the following reasons: 

 (a) Ac c ording to the PeriOperative Nursing Rec ord, [note: 131] Nurse Honrado c ompleted her c hec ks in the OT Rec eption Room and then entered the time on the PeriOperative Nursing Rec ord as 9.50am, [note: 132] based on the OT Rec eption Room c loc k. [note: 133] The plaintiff was wheeled into the OT immediately after. [note: 134] 

 (b) Sinc e it was undisputed that the defendant only saw the plaintiff when she was already in the OT, he must have arrived just after 9.50am at the earliest. 

 (c ) The doc umented time of the c ommenc ement of the LSCS, as rec orded in the PeriOperative Nursing Rec ord, was 9.55am. [note: 135] Ac c ording to Dr Tham, that would have been the time that the intravenous c annula was inserted in preparation for the start of the GA proc edure. [note: 136] 

83     However, c ontrary to what Dr Tham explained, Nurse Honrado’s evidenc e was that the start time of the surgery was the time that the surgeon made the first inc ision based on the OT c loc k and 

not the time that the c annula was inserted. [note: 137] Nurse Honrado c onfirmed that she, rather than Dr Tham, was the one filling in the rec ords. One would therefore expec t Nurse Honrado to be more familiar with the c orrec t doc umenting prac tic es of the hospital than Dr Tham. However, if one were to ac c ept Nurse Honrado’s evidenc e that the first inc ision was made at 9.55am, the doc umented time of events would not tally for the following reasons: 

 (a) First, if the time Dr Tham had made the first inc ision was 9.55am, it would be inc onsistent with the fac t that the “time out” safety c hec k usually performed just before a surgeon makes his first c ut was doc umented at 10am in the Peri-Operative Nursing Rec ord. [note: 138] 

 (b) Next, the idea that Dr Tham made the first inc ision at 9.55am would also be inc onsistent with inferenc es drawn from the Vital Signs Report [note: 139] that pre-oxygenation for the GA proc edure only started just after 10am and intubation was c ompleted just before 10.05am. These two inferenc es, whic h both parties’ anaesthetic experts have c onfirmed are valid, are based on the following parameters: 

 (i) inO 2 (inspired oxygen) reading was 21% ( ie , oxygen c onc entration in room air) at 


 10am and 67% at 10.05am, suggesting that pre-oxygenation started just after 10am; and 

 (ii) etCO 2 (end-tidal c arbon dioxide) reading was 0% before 10.05am and 29% at 10.05am, suggesting that intubation was ac c omplished by 10.05am for the c arbon dioxide in the expired breath to be detec ted in the anaesthetic c irc uit. [note: 140] 

84     Although the point made in [83(b)] above seems to support the plaintiff’s c ase, the doc umented times in the plaintiff’s c ase _still_ would not tally for the following reasons: 

 (a) First, the time of the baby’s birth was doc umented as 10.06am on the Infant Examination rec ords [note: 141] (although it bears noting that there is no evidenc e as to what c loc k the timing was based on). However, as verified by the anaesthetic experts on both sides, one c ould infer from the Vital Signs Report that the baby was born sometime between 10.10am and 10.15am, and not at 10.06am, as the Vital Signs Report showed that the plaintiff’s heart rate and blood pressure dropped signific antly during that period. [note: 142] 

 (b) Sec ond, the plaintiff was unhooked from the monitors in the OT at 11.25am when the surgery ended, as doc umented in the Vital Signs Report. [note: 143] The end time of surgery, whic h was taken by Nurse Honrado after [note: 144] she wheeled the plaintiff to the OT Rec overy Room based on the OT Rec overy Room c loc k, was also rec orded as 11.25am in the PeriOperative Nursing Rec ord. [note: 145] Ac c ording to Nurse Honrado, she would have needed at least a minute or two to transfer the plaintiff onto the trolley and to wheel her to the Rec overy Room. [note: 146] It was unlikely that the c loc ks in both the OT and the OT Rec overy Room were sync hronised. 

85     It is immediately apparent that the various doc umented times simply do not tally with eac h other regardless of whether it was based on the plaintiff’s or Nurse Honrado’s ac c ount. The defendant’s explanation for this was that the doc umented times were based on different room c loc ks, mac hines and/or watc hes that were not sync hronised. In relation to the manual entries, the rec ording c ould also have been made _ex post_ , whic h meant that the relevant persons might have rec orded an estimated time ( _eg_ , 9.50am instead of 9.51am) and that they might also have rec alled the time wrongly. As suc h, it is possible that the defendant c ould have had more, or even less, time to c arry out the pre-anaesthetic assessment than what the plaintiff c laimed. Given the state of the evidenc e, I am unable to make a finding of fac t as to exac tly how muc h time the defendant had for the preanaesthetic assessment. 

86     Notwithstanding the serious dispute regarding the timing of events, little ac tually turns on the issue of time when it c omes to assessing whether the defendant had breac hed his duty of c are in the manner that he c arried out his pre-operative assessment. Although more time spent on a preanaesthetic assessment may indic ate that it was more likely to have been done properly and _vice versa_ , that itself is inc onc lusive. The time taken for a pre-anaesthetic assessment depends on many varying fac tors, suc h as the anaesthetist’s effic ienc y, the patient’s medic al and surgic al history, and whether the patient has many questions to ask. I heard evidenc e from Nurse Honrado that most anaesthetists she works with only take an average of five minutes to c omplete the anaesthetic assessment of a patient who has no signific ant medic al and surgic al history and who does not ask any 

questions. [note: 147] The defendant’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Sia, indic ated that he would probably 

take about ten minutes for suc h a patient. [note: 148] The plaintiff’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Delilkan, gave the longest estimate of 30 minutes but I am less inc lined to ac c ept Prof Delilkan’s evidenc e over 

the others as he admitted to having been out of prac tic e for more than 11 years. [note: 149] 


Other alleged shortc omings 

87     The real question, in my opinion, is this: even if the defendant was running late, would that have been suffic iently c ompelling for him to omit the pre-anaesthetic assessment, inc luding informing the plaintiff about the nature and risks of the GA proc edure? On this point, Ms Ho referred to other alleged shortc omings on the part of the defendant to persuade me to find that it was more likely than not that the defendant proc eeded with the GA proc edure without performing a pre-anaesthetic assessment. These alleged shortc omings were as follows: 

 (a) the omission to always ensure a reasonable time buffer between appointments; 

 (b) the omission to order c ross-matc hing tests for blood; and 

 (c ) the omission to presc ribe pre-surgery medic ation. 

The omission to always ensure reasonable time buffer between appointments 

88     Muc h time at trial was spent c ross-examining the defendant on his usual c ourse of prac tic e and, in partic ular, the various instanc es when he had ac c epted almost bac k-to-bac k and even overlapping appointments. It was submitted, on behalf of the plaintiff, that by failing to ensure that there was always a reasonable buffer between appointments to: (a) follow up properly with the earlier patient; and (b) to c arry out a proper pre-operative assessment on the next patient, and a domino effec t arose whic h c ompromised the c are of his patients. I will first set out the defendant’s explanation on his prac tic e generally before turning spec ific ally to the sc hedule of events on the day of the plaintiff’s LSCS. 

89     The defendant explained that in c ases where the surgeries were performed in the same c linic or hospital, less buffer time would be needed as travelling time would be minimal. Further, in c ases where the surgeon had booked the defendant for a longer period than what would normally be required for 

the surgery, buffer time might have already been built into the sc heduling. [note: 150] The defendant also pointed out that the day-to-day prac tic e of elec tive medic ine does not always run with c loc kwork-like prec ision bec ause surgeries and post-operative c are may take more or less time than antic ipated. In group prac tic es suc h as the defendant’s, fellow anaesthetists often c over for eac h other when needed. Therefore, if Surgery A looks like it will overrun, or if Patient A develops c omplic ations post-surgery, the defendant would ask the surgeon performing Surgery B (whic h was sc heduled to follow) to delay Surgery B, or c all his fellow c olleague in the same prac tic e to take on 

Surgery B. [note: 151] When c ases are performed in c linic s (as opposed to hospitals), the sc hedules 

are even more flexible. [note: 152] The defendant explained that he would ac c ept bac k-to-bac k and overlapping c ases as it is c ommon for a group prac tic e to ac c ept the c ases first and redistribute them 

later if nec essary. [note: 153] Patient safety would not be c ompromised as the anaesthetists in his 

group prac tic e are all qualified and c ompetent [note: 154] although, as the defendant c andidly 

admitted, suc h an arrangement would not be ideal from a patient’s perspec tive. [note: 155] The plaintiff pointed out that suc h subsequent c hanges were not reflec ted in his appointment books. However, as the purpose of appointment books is to rec ord _prospective_ appointments, I do not think it unreasonable that the defendant and/or his c lerks did not retrospec tively update the entries to reflec t the ac tual events of the day. I would, however, add that the defendant’s prac tic e of ac c epting appointments so c lose together is of some c onc ern. 

90     Unsatisfac tory as the defendant’s prac tic e was, the issue of how the defendant usually

 2 9am Marsupialisation of Bartholin c yst

 3 10am The plaintiff’s LSCS Gleneagles Hospital 

 4 11.30am Laparasc opic hysterosc opy Gleneagles Hospital 

sc heduled his appointments is not c ruc ial to the present c ase. What is more important is the defendant’s sc hedule on 26 Oc tober 2006, the day of the plaintiff’s LSCS. The relevant surgeries that 

he had to attend in the morning were as follows: [note: 156] 

91     I digress for a moment to deal with the plaintiff’s allegation that the defendant had tampered with the entries for 26 Oc tober 2006 in his appointment book. In his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief (“AEIC”), the defendant stated that he would not have agreed to take on the plaintiff’s c ase if the preferenc e indic ated by Dr Tham was for regional anaesthesia (“RA”) instead of GA as he would not 

have had enough time to prepare for the LSCS to start on time at 10am. [note: 157] During c rossexamination, the defendant supplemented his reasoning by saying that sinc e he had had an early start to the day with his first appointment at 7.45am, he wanted to have some refreshments before 

going for the plaintiff’s LSCS at 10am. [note: 158] Sinc e an RA generally takes longer to set up than a GA, he would not have had time to do so before the plaintiff’s LSCS if it was to be done under RA. (I pause to note that this explanation about needing refreshments was only raised at trial and not in the defendant’s AEIC. My impression is that this reason was an embellishment and I ac c ordingly plac e little weight on it.) Ms Ho then asked the defendant where the 7.45am entry was, as it was not very 

c lear in her bundle of doc uments. [note: 159] The defendant replied that he was referring to the very 

first entry of the day. [note: 160] After c lose sc rutiny, I agreed that I c ould just about make out the 

time “7.45” in the c ourt’s c opy of the bundle. [note: 161] The c ross-examination then c ontinued on the basis that the very first entry of the day was at 7.45am. However, upon re-inspec tion of the original appointment book after the trial had ended, both Ms Ho and the defendant’s c ounsel, Mr Lek Siang Pheng (“Mr Lek”), c onfirmed that the c orrec t timing was ac tually “8.45am” and not “7.45am”. 

92     Ms Ho then raised the allegation that the defendant had tampered with the photoc opying proc ess so as to c ause a mark resembling the digit “7” to appear in the first entry. Upon learning of suc h an allegation, I direc ted both Ms Ho and Mr Lek to appear before me in c hambers. At the hearing in c hambers, Mr Lek assured the c ourt that the defendant had had no part to play in the photoc opying proc ess, and that the photoc opying of bundles of doc uments in preparation for trial had been outsourc ed to the firm’s photoc opying c ontrac tor. Mr Lek also explained that the mark resembling the digit “7” somehow appeared in the c ourse of photoc opying and re-photoc opying the page after redac tion to leave out the patients’ names in the appointment book. In the original appointment book, there was nothing resembling the digit “7” at all. However, in the original redac ted photoc opy, a very faint shadow resembling the digit “7” appeared to have been made during the c ourse of photoc opying. Subsequently, in the c ourse of re-photoc opying the doc uments to prepare the bundles for trial, the shadow bec ame more distinc t. All these explanations were affirmed in an affidavit filed by Mr Lek after the hearing. 

93     Having personally inspec ted and c ompared the original appointment book, the original redac ted photoc opy, as well as the relevant bundles used by the Mr Lek, Ms Ho, and the c ourt’s c opy, I 


c onc lude that the shadow in the original redac ted photoc opy and the distinc t mark in the bundles used at trial did not look like they had been deliberately made. Further, the distinc t “7” in the bundles used at trial were at the exac t same spot where the shadow had appeared in the original redac ted photoc opy. I am therefore fully satisfied on the evidenc e that no tampering was made. I am also of the view that, on balanc e, the defendant had made an honest mistake in thinking that the first entry of the day was 7.45am instead of 8.45am. I do, however, wish to add that Mr Lek should have informed the c ourt of this mistake at the earliest opportunity. 

94     Returning to the analysis of the defendant’s sc hedule, I find that all that the plaintiff has suc c eeded in doing is to satisfy me that the defendant was often in a rush and that he was probably in some rush on the morning of the plaintiff’s LSCS. It is, however, a big leap to say that the defendant had c ompromised the plaintiff’s c are just bec ause he was in a rush. It bears emphasising that the LSCS was, on the evidenc e of Dr Tham as well as the O&G experts, an _elective_ surgery and not an emergenc y surgery even though the plaintiff’s original delivery date was pushed forward by about a month. Surgeries c an and often do overrun in prac tic e and there was no c ompelling reason for the defendant to c ompromise basic patient c are just for the sake of starting the anaesthetic proc edure on time. It is also a leap for the plaintiff to say that the defendant was c ompelled to start the anaesthetic proc edure at 10am on the dot bec ause he had a later surgery sc heduled at 11.30am. It is undisputed that Dr Tham usually takes only about 40 to 60 minutes to c omplete an LSCS for patients who are undergoing an LSCS for the first time, and that the OT will usually be booked for 

60     minutes only. [note: 162] Dr Tham himself was unsure why he ended up taking about 85 minutes to 

c omplete the plaintiff’s LSCS. [note: 163] Therefore, at the time when the plaintiff’s LSCS was about to start, the defendant would not have expec ted to be late for his 11.30am appointment, whic h was also in the same hospital. Furthermore, the defendant had explained that if he was running late for his next appointment, he would either have c alled the next surgeon to delay the surgery or asked one of his fellow anaesthetists in his group prac tic e to take over. On a related point, it is also farfetc hed to say that the defendant had, from the beginning, c losed his mind to the possibility of administering RA [note: 164] bec ause he had said that he would not have ac c epted the plaintiff’s c ase if it had been an 

RA instead of a GA. [note: 165] The defendant’s statement was made in the c ontext of sc heduling, and it is a stretc h to say that he would have doggedly insisted on proc eeding with GA even if the plaintiff was found to be c ontra-indic ated for GA. 

95     As suc h, even if the defendant was running late and the LSCS was unable to start on time at 10am, I am not satisfied on the evidenc e that this proves on a balanc e of probabilities that the defendant had c ompromised basic patient c are. 

The omission to order c ross-matc hing tests for blood 

96     The plaintiff’s next allegation was that the defendant omitted to order c ross-matc hing tests for blood despite his c onc ern for the plaintiff’s earlier bleeding problems. “Cross-matc hing” refers to the proc ess of taking a sample of blood from the patient, sending it to the laboratory to identify what blood type it is, matc hing with a donor’s blood, and having that blood ready to be given to the patient 

in the event of blood loss. This proc ess usually takes about two hours. [note: 166] In this regard, the plaintiff relied on c l 1.1.3 of the Singapore Soc iety of Anaesthesiologists (“SSA”) Guidelines whic h states as follows: 

 1.1.3 Blood Type and Screen : 

 1.1.3.1 The anaesthesiologist’s dec ision to order or require a blood type and sc reen or c rossmatc h should be individualised and based on antic ipated haemorrhagic c omplic ations, for example, 


 plac enta praevia in a patient with previous uterine surgery. [note: 167] 

97     Although guidelines suc h as the SSA Guidelines are useful in assessing the standard of c are that a doc tor should be held to, they are not sac rosanc t. It must be remembered that guidelines often set out best prac tic es and a departure from best prac tic e is not nec essarily improper. Ac c ording to 

Prof Sia, [note: 168] even KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital does not inc orporate medic al guidelines in totality. One must look at all the fac ts and c irc umstanc es to determine if the defendant’s c onduc t would be regarded as proper by a responsible body of medic al men. 

98     The defendant explained that he did not order c ross-matc hing tests as he took into ac c ount Dr Tham’s general preferenc e not to do so bec ause c ross-matc hing is an expensive proc edure whic h 

often gets wasted. [note: 169] Further, should bleeding ac tually oc c ur, there is always a store of 

emergenc y blood available in the hospital whic h c an be mobilised immediately. [note: 170] The defendant also explained that in an emergenc y the most important step in maintaining life would be to maintain the volume of blood, and this c an be done with other blood produc ts while blood is sent off 

for c ross-matc hing. [note: 171] As suc h, the fac t that there was no c ross-matc hed blood immediately 

available would not mean that the patient’s life would be endangered. [note: 172] Both parties’ anaesthetic experts also agreed that blood tests and investigations are usually ordered by the primary 

physic ian when the patient sees him at his c linic , and not by the anaesthetist. [note: 173] It is only when there are c ertain medic al indic ations that the primary physic ian may sometimes refer to the 

anaesthetist for a further opinion as to whether suc h tests and investigations are required. [note: 174] Even the plaintiff’s O&G expert, Dr Lai, agreed that suc h tests would have been ordered by him as the 

primary physic ian, and not by the anaesthetist. [note: 175] 

99     On the evidenc e, the defendant’s omission to order blood tests and investigations does not help to prove the plaintiff’s c ase that the defendant had a disregard for basic patient c are. 

The omission to presc ribe pre-surgery medic ation 

100    The plaintiff also alleged that the defendant omitted to presc ribe pre-surgery medic ation to prevent or minimise damage to the patient’s lungs should the stomac h c ontents enter the patient’s lungs during the intubation proc ess. Generally speaking, there are two types of pre-surgery medic ation: 

 (a) an alkali suc h as an antac id to neutralise the ac idity of the stomac h; and 

 (b) medic ine to dec rease ac id produc tion by the stomac h. 

In this regard, the plaintiff relied on c l 1.6 of the SSA Guidelines whic h states that “pulmonary aspiration prophylaxis should inc lude fasting, and use of a non-partic ulate antac id and histamine 

rec eptor (H 2 ) antagonist.” [note: 176] My c omments about the role of guidelines in asc ertaining the 

standard of c are disc ussed above in the c ontext of c ross-matc hing tests (at [97] above) also apply here. 

101    In relation to the first type of pre-medic ation, _viz_ , an alkali, the defendant explained that rec ent studies show that suc h medic ation was only effec tive if the ac id in the stomac h and the alkali 

in the medic ation mixed evenly. [note: 177] If the substanc es did not mix evenly, the patient might be 

worse off bec ause there would be even more liquid in the stomac h. [note: 178] As for the sec ond type 


of pre-medic ation, the defendant said that bec ause of the prac tic e of admitting the patient only on the same day as the surgery in elec tive proc edures, it was diffic ult to ensure that the patient takes suc h medic ation at least two hours before the surgery, whic h is the time needed for the medic ation 

to be effec tive. [note: 179] Sinc e the presc ription of pre-surgery medic ation did not make muc h differenc e to the mortality figures, the defendant was of the view that it is therefore not c ost

effec tive to presc ribe suc h medic ine. [note: 180] The defendant also emphasised that for both types of pre-medic ation, the drugs c ould only, at best, reduc e the harmful c onsequenc es of ac id aspiration. 

They would not minimise the risk of aspiration. [note: 181] As suc h, he felt that it was more important 

to have good anaesthetic tec hniques to _prevent_ ac id aspiration. [note: 182] 

102    The defendant’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Sia, agreed that the role of antac ids in an elec tive 

setting is now debatable in light of rec ent developments. [note: 183] He also agreed that it would be the primary treating physic ian, and not the anaesthetist, who would presc ribe pre-surgery medic ation. [note: 184] In c ontrast, the plaintiff’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Delilkan, insisted that pre-medic ation 

must be given by the anaesthetist and not the obstetric ian, for the reason that pre-medic ation is for 

the anaesthetic proc edure and not the obstetric operation. [note: 185] 

103    I am disinc lined to ac c ept Prof Delilkan’s views. As I have outlined (at [70] above), the duty to give advic e for an anaesthetic proc edure is shared between the primary treating physic ian and the anaesthetist. If the primary treating physic ian is jointly responsible for telling the patient to fast before surgery, it follows that he should also be jointly responsible for advising and presc ribing presurgery medic ation if nec essary, as both measures are intended to prevent or minimise the harmful c onsequenc es of ac id aspiration. As Prof Sia pointed out, although the latter involves the presc ription of medic ation, pre-surgery medic ation is not a spec ific anaesthetic drug whic h lies in the exc lusive 

domain of the anaesthetist. [note: 186] It is a drug whic h any doc tor c an presc ribe. [note: 187] In my view, sinc e Dr Tham as the primary treating physic ian did not c onsider it nec essary to presc ribe presurgery medic ation for the plaintiff and no evidenc e has been led to the effec t that Dr Tham was wrong, the defendant’s omission to do so c annot reasonably be said to have been a shortc oming on his part and c annot c onstitute a breac h of his duty of c are. 

The c ourt’s finding 

104    Apart from the abovementioned issues, it is also relevant to note these other points that surfac ed during the trial: 

 (a) the plaintiff said that she had expec ted the defendant to see and assess her before the c ommenc ement of the anaesthestic proc edure. [note: 188] It is therefore diffic ult to believe that she would have remained silent if the defendant had not said a word to her. There was no barrier to c ommunic ation sinc e the plaintiff is a well-educ ated woman who, by her own evidenc e, is also soc iable. [note: 189] The plaintiff did not give any evidenc e that she was so afraid that she c ould not speak up for herself; 

 (b) the plaintiff’s husband c laimed that at some time during her hospital stay, the plaintiff had told him that the defendant had failed to advise her before c ommenc ing the GA proc edure. [note: 190] If this were really the c ase, one would reasonably have expec ted the plaintiff’s husband to immediately raise the matter with Dr Tham or the defendant, partic ularly sinc e the plaintiff’s husband is also a medic al prac titioner who had previously done an anaesthetic posting and would have been aware of the gravity of suc h an alleged breac h of professional c onduc t by the 


 defendant. It was undisputed that no suc h c omplaint was ever lodged. The plaintiff’s husband’s explanation was as follows: 

 ... I did not raise the defendant’s c onduc t to Dr Tham bec ause Dr Tham had said the defendant was somebody he worked with c onstantly. I did not want to make it a diffic ult thing for Dr Tham so I did not raise it and of c ourse at that time, if the defendant c omes in and does the proper job and if nothing happened to my wife, I don’t see the reason why we should raise an issue like the defendant c oming in and not doing anything and just starting the thing. I mean, I think it’s not nic e for one doc tor to go around c ritic ising another, so I did not raise it. [note: 191] 

 (a) Sinc e Dr Tham is a family friend of the plaintiff and her husband, it is diffic ult to believe that the plaintiff’s husband was c ontent to keep quiet about the defendant’s alleged misc onduc t despite knowing that the safety of Dr Tham’s patients might be in serious jeopardy if he c ontinued working with the defendant. It is also telling that when the plaintiff’s husband spoke to the defendant over the phone on 29 Oc tober 2006, he did not c onfront the defendant about suc h irresponsible and dangerous c onduc t; and 

 (c ) the only other witness who was present by the plaintiff’s side prior to the c ommenc ement of the GA proc edure was the anaesthetic nurse, Nurse Honrado. Nurse Honrado had worked with the defendant on many other oc c asions before. Her evidenc e was that the defendant always c onduc ts a pre-anaesthetic assessment whic h inc ludes the disc ussion about GA. [note: 192] The fac t that Nurse Honrado was unable to rec all anything about the plaintiff’s c ase suggests that nothing out of the ordinary happened during the plaintiff’s LSCS. 

105    Having c onsidered the evidenc e before me (inc luding the plaintiff’s further allegations that the defendant had intubated her negligently (see [174]–[265] below) and that he had omitted to provide adequate post-operative c are (see [266]–[276] below)), I find that the plaintiff has not proved her c ase that the defendant neglec ted to disc uss GA c onsiderations with her. I turn now to c onsider whether the defendant had disc harged his duty of c are to c onfirm that Dr Tham had advised the plaintiff about the GA proc edure in so far as obstetric c onsiderations were c onc erned. 

_(ii) The defendant’s duty to confirm that obstetrics related anaesthetic considerations had been explained to the plaintiff_ 

106    As I have explained earlier (at [70]–[74] above), the taking of informed c onsent for obstetric anaesthesia is a matter of joint responsibility between the obstetric ian and the anaesthetist, with the anaesthetist taking ultimate responsibility for ensuring the patient’s c onsent. 

107    The plaintiff’s position was that she was never properly advised by anyone about obstetric c onsiderations in relation to anaesthesia. The defendant explained that he did not expressly c onfirm with the plaintiff that Dr Tham had explained the relevant c onsiderations to her bec ause he had relied on the usual working prac tic e between himself and Dr Tham where Dr Tham would always disc uss with his patients the risks of anaesthesia with respec t to obstetric c onsiderations. To determine liability on this point, two spec ific findings of fac t need to be made. First, did Dr Tham disc uss anaesthesia with the plaintiff, at least in so far as obstetric c onsiderations were c onc erned? Sec ond, was the defendant’s relianc e on his usual working relationship with Dr Tham suffic ient so as to disc harge his duty of c are? 

The disc ussion between Dr Tham and the plaintiff on 25 Oc tober 2006 


108    Dr Tham’s evidenc e was that he c ould not remember c learly the details of the c onsultation on 25 Oc tober 2006, the night before the LSCS. He admitted that he probably would have disc ussed the 

pros and c ons of doing either a GA or RA from his point of view as an obstetric ian [note: 193] and 

c ommunic ated his preferenc e for GA to the plaintiff “generally”. [note: 194] As for the plaintiff and her husband, their evidenc e as to whether, and to what extent, anaesthesia was disc ussed during the c onsultation with Dr Tham was, in my opinion, deliberately imprec ise. In the c ourse of c rossexamination, the position taken by the plaintiff vac illated from saying that there was no disc ussion 

about the mode of anaesthesia, [note: 195] to saying that there might have been some “general 

disc ussion” although she c ould not remember the details. [note: 196] The plaintiff’s husband c onfirmed that there was a disc ussion on the mode of anaesthesia that night, although his evidenc e was 

c ouc hed in similarly vague terms that they did not “go into detail” about anaesthesia. [note: 197] Given that the plaintiff and her husband c ould somehow remember the other aspec ts of the c onsultation 

with Dr Tham in a fair amount of detail, [note: 198] I have my doubts as to the verac ity of their c laim that they c ould not remember the anaesthetic aspec t of the c onsultation. 

109    The O&G experts of both parties generally agreed that any reasonable obstetric ian would advise his patient about anaesthesia. The differenc e between the testimony of the plaintiff’s O&G expert, Dr Lai, and the defendant’s O&G expert, Dr Rauff, was that Dr Lai was of the opinion that RA was the default c hoic e of anaesthesia unless the patient was c ontra-indic ated for RA. As suc h, Dr Lai 

would not talk about GA to his patient unless the patient brought it up. [note: 199] This differenc e aside, it is c lear that one would reasonably expec t the obstetric ian to disc uss anaesthesia with the patient, at least in so far as obstetric c onsiderations are c onc erned. 

110    It also bears noting that that the c onsultation between Dr Tham, the plaintiff and her husband was about two hours long. Although Dr Tham was not present for the entire two hours, as he was 

also busy making arrangements for the plaintiff’s surgery the next morning, [note: 200] there was more than suffic ient time and opportunity to disc uss anaesthesia in so far as obstetric c onsiderations were c onc erned. Furthermore, the plaintiff’s husband is a general prac titioner who had previously done 

obstetric and anaesthetic postings in hospitals. [note: 201] It is unlikely that he would not have asked about anaesthesia even if Dr Tham did not bring it up. It is also diffic ult to believe that the plaintiff, 

despite being nervous about the LSCS surgery as she never had surgery in her life, [note: 202] would have failed to ask about anaesthesia. There was no impediment to c ommunic ation sinc e the plaintiff is 

a well-educ ated woman who admitted to having been a soc iable person before the LSCS. [note: 203] Moreover, the plaintiff was familiar with Dr Tham as he was a c lose family friend and had previously delivered her fifth c hild. Although the c ouple were understandably anxious about their unborn c hild, I do not think on the evidenc e that this c onc ern would have bloc ked out other c onsiderations, suc h as c onc ern for the plaintiff as the mother, during the entire c onsultation. 

111    Ac c ording to Dr Tham’s staff nurse, Nurse Fay, Dr Tham would usually speak to the patient, c onfirm the surgery and obtain the patient’s signature on the c onsent form before she arranged the booking of the OT. It was only after all these proc edures were c ompleted that an anaesthetist would 

be booked. [note: 204] Usually, when Dr Tham wanted to engage the defendant to perform an anaesthetic proc edure in support of an LSCS, Dr Tham or his staff would c all the defendant to give him the general details of the operation, inc luding the mode of anaesthesia that the patient had 

indic ated a preferenc e for. [note: 205] When a patient had diffic ulty c hoosing whic h mode of 

anaesthesia to undergo [note: 206] or if Dr Tham assessed that a patient might have some anaesthetic 

risk, [note: 207] Dr Tham would ask the defendant to meet with the patient earlier to disc uss the 


various anaesthetic options with her. Sinc e Dr Tham did not ask the defendant to meet with the plaintiff to disc uss the anaesthetic options with her, it suggested that in all likelihood Dr Tham had: (a) assessed the plaintiff to be suitable for GA in so far as obstetric c onsiderations were c onc erned; and (b) the plaintiff had agreed with Dr Tham’s indic ated preferenc e for GA. 

112    The c onsent form signed by the plaintiff also indic ated that Dr Tham did disc uss anaesthesia with her during the c onsultation, at least in so far as obstetric c onsiderations were c onc erned. In 

partic ular, c l 2 of the c onsent form stated: [note: 208] 

2\. I, also c onsent to: 

 2.1 The administration of General, Loc al or other forms of anaesthesia, and c onfirm that the nature, risks and alternatives of suc h anaesthesia have been explained to me. 

The c onsent form was dated 26 Oc tober 2006. The plaintiff’s evidenc e in her AEIC was that she was asked to sign the c onsent form only on 26 Oc tober 2006 in the OT Rec eption Room while lying on the 

trolley and without her glasses. [note: 209] However, when the plaintiff was asked during c rossexamination whether she had also filled in the details of the c onsent form while lying on the trolley 

and without her glasses, she said that she c ould not remember. [note: 210] 

113    The doc umentary evidenc e plainly c ontradic ts the plaintiff’s c laim that she had only signed the c onsent form on 26 Oc tober 2006 in the OT Rec eption Room. It showed that she had signed the c onsent form in the ward on the night of 25 Oc tober 2006, and not on the morning of 26 Oc tober 2006: 

 (a) First, the Nursing Care Plan had an entry “valid c onsent up” at 2237 hours on 25 Oc tober 

2006\. [note: 211] The entry “valid c onsent up” meant that the c onsent form had been signed. 

 (b) Next, the PeriOperative Nursing Rec ord showed that the ward nurse had tic ked the c orresponding “Ward” box for sec tion B, item 2, titled “Valid Consent Taken and Signed” at 0630 hours. [note: 212] That indic ated that the c onsent form had already been signed while the plaintiff was still in the ward. 

 (c ) Third, the witness to the plaintiff’s signature on the c onsent form was the ward nurse and not the OT Rec eption Nurse. [note: 213] 

On the evidenc e, I find that the plaintiff had signed the c onsent form in the ward on the night of 25 Oc tober 2006 at or before 2237 hours. The date entered in the c onsent form, 26 Oc tober 2006, must have been an error. There is therefore nothing to suggest that the plaintiff did not have the time and ability to read and understand the c ontents of the c onsent form before signing it. More likely than not, the plaintiff was aware of the nature and risks of GA after the c onsultation with Dr Tham, at least in so far as obstetric c onsiderations were c onc erned. 

114    For these reasons, I find that the plaintiff was informed about the nature and risks of GA in so far as obstetric c onsiderations were c onc erned. I turn next to the question of whether the defendant had breac hed his duty of c are in omitting to expressly c onfirm with the plaintiff what Dr Tham had disc ussed with her. 

The defendant’s omission to expressly c onfirm with the plaintiff what Dr Tham had disc ussed with her 


115    It was undisputed that the defendant had been Dr Tham’s main anaesthetist for about five 

years, before the plaintiff’s LSCS, and the two were familiar with eac h other. [note: 214] The evidenc e of the defendant, that the usual working prac tic e between himself and Dr Tham was that Dr Tham would always disc uss with his patients the preferred c hoic e of anaesthesia where obstetric c onsiderations are c onc erned was not c ontradic ted. I have also already ac c epted, in the prec eding sec tion, the evidenc e of the defendant that he had advised the plaintiff on the general risks assoc iated with GA – whic h inc luded post-operative nausea, vomiting and soreness of the throat – and c onfirmed that she had no questions to ask about GA. In view of these c irc umstanc es, and in partic ular the fac t that the evidenc e of the O&G experts was that they would always disc uss anaesthesia with the patient in so far as obstetric c onsiderations are c onc erned, I am of the view that the defendant did not breac h his duty of c are in omitting to expressly c onfirm with the plaintiff what Dr Tham had disc ussed with her. 

_Conclusion on sub-issue 1(a)_ 

116    In c onc lusion, I find that the defendant had not breac hed his duty of c are in so far as the disc losure of the general nature and risks of GA was c onc erned. I now turn to c onsider whether the defendant was under a duty to disc lose the spec ific risk of nec k injury and, if so, whether suc h duty was breac hed. 

**_Sub-issue 1(b): The specific risk of neck injury_** 

117    It was undisputed that the defendant (and Dr Tham) did not disc lose the risk of nec k injury to the plaintiff. The question is: was the defendant under a duty to do so? Both parties’ anaesthetic 

experts have never c ome ac ross any c ase of nec k injury arising from GA. [note: 215] The anaesthetic experts also agreed that they would not disc uss the risk of nec k injury with a patient unless: 

 (a) their assessment revealed that intubation might potentially be diffic ult; and/or 

 (b) if it was made known that the patient had an existing nec k c ondition or history of nec k injury. [note: 216] 

In an otherwise normal and healthy patient, nec k injury arising from intubation is not a c ommonly known risk. Given the evidenc e of both anaesthetic experts, it c ame as a surprise that the plaintiff’s orthopaedic expert, Dr Singh, took the position that nec k injuries arising from the GA intubation proc ess were well doc umented and that he had treated seven to ten suc h c ases over the past 

ten years. [note: 217] 

118    The relevant issues for determination are as follows: 

 (a) Did a duty of c are to disc lose the risk of nec k injury exist bec ause: 

 (i) the plaintiff was c onsidered a potentially diffic ult patient to intubate; or 

 (ii) the plaintiff had made it known that she had an existing nec k c ondition or history of nec k injury? 

 (b) Even if the answer to (a) is no, did a duty of c are to disc lose the risk of nec k injury nonetheless arise bec ause it is a c ommonly known risk of intubation? 


Sinc e it was undisputed that the plaintiff had no known existing nec k c ondition or history of nec k injury at the material time, the analysis below will foc us only on the issues listed at (a)(i) and (b) above. 

_Whether the plaintiff was considered a potentially difficult patient to intubate_ 

119    It was the plaintiff’s c ase that she was, at the material time, c onsidered a potentially diffic ult patient to intubate, and that the defendant did not realise this bec ause he did not c arry out a preanaesthetic assessment on her before c ommenc ing the GA proc edure. For the reasons given in the prec eding sec tion, I do not ac c ept this c laim. I will nevertheless c onsider the plaintiff’s c ase at its next highest, _viz_ , that the defendant had performed the pre-anaesthetic proc edure improperly. 

120    The inquiry as to whether the defendant’s c onduc t of the GA proc edure was proper, as ac c epted by a responsible body of medic al opinion, foc uses on the defendant’s assessment of the plaintiff’s airway, the key c omponent of a pre-anaesthetic assessment to determine whether a patient is c onsidered a diffic ult patient to intubate. The airway assessment c onsists of two parts. The first part is the Mallampati sc oring, whic h looks at the patient’s oral c avity. The sec ond part involves examining the plaintiff’s physic al features. I will address eac h part in turn. 

(i) Mallampati sc oring 

121    Put simply, the Mallampati sc oring is done by looking at the anatomy of the patient’s oral c avity and grading the view on a sc ale of 1 to 4. The higher the grade, the more likely it is that intubation will be diffic ult. The defendant c arried out the Mallampati assessment with the plaintiff lying supine, and found that she had a Mallampati sc ore of “2”. The plaintiff’s c ase was that the defendant’s assessment was erroneous for the following reasons: 

 (a) the c lassic al teac hing of Mallampati sc oring is done with the patient sitting up and not lying supine; and 

 (b) Prof Delilkan and Dr Ho (one of the plaintiff’s pain spec ialists and also an anaesthetist) assessed the plaintiff’s airway in 2009 and 2010 respec tively and assessed her sc ore as a “3”. It was undisputed that a woman’s Mallampati sc ore generally tends to be higher when she is pregnant bec ause of water retention and swelling assoc iated with pregnanc y. As suc h, ac c ording to the plaintiff, her true Mallampati sc ore at the time of the LSCS should have been “3” or higher. 

122    The plaintiff has, however, failed to prove that the defendant’s assessment of sc ore “2” was erroneous and that she was ac tually a diffic ult patient to intubate for two reasons. First, although t he _classical_ Mallampati sc oring is done with the patient sitting upright, there was evidenc e in the medic al literature (E J Tham _et al_ , “Effec ts of Posture, Phonation and Observer on Mallampati Classific ation” British J of Anaesth 1992; 68: 32–38) that the patient’s position made little differenc e 

to the sc oring. [note: 218] Contrary to the plaintiff’s submissions, the medic al evidenc e showed that an examination in a supine position would tend to show a _higher_ Mallampati sc ore as c ompared to an 

examination done in a seated position. [note: 219] The plaintiff’s witness, Dr Ho, agreed with this. [note: 220] Further, the defendant’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Sia, gave evidenc e that he would sc ore his 

patients in _both_ the seated and supine positions bec ause although the seated position is the _classical_ 

position, it was not nec essarily the _optimal_ position. [note: 221] Ac c ording to Prof Sia, an examination of the patient lying supine was more valuable sinc e that will provide the same view that he would see 

just before c arrying out the intubation proc ess. [note: 222] Ac c ording to Prof Sia, a possible explanation as to why the c lassic al Mallampati sc oring is done with the patient seated is that most 


patients would usually be examined by an anaesthetist in an ambulatory setting. [note: 223] 

123    As observed by the Court of Appeal in _Gunapathy_ at [64], an expert witness has not reac hed a “defensible c onc lusion” unless the opinion “make[s] sense as a whole, suc h that no part of the opinion c ontradic ts with another. A doc tor c annot say, for example, that he supports a c ertain approac h and attest that in that very situation, he would have nevertheless done quite the opposite”. To put it simply, an expert witness has to put his money where his mouth is. I am thus unable to plac e muc h weight on Prof Sia’s evidenc e on this point as he had simultaneously c ondoned the defendant’s prac tic e of assessing the Mallampati sc oring in the supine position while professing to his own prac tic e of assessing his patients in _both_ the supine and seated position. Nevertheless, this point is, at best, neutral and the plaintiff has not proven, on a balanc e of probabilities, that her Mallampati sc oring was higher than “2”. 

124    Sec ond, substantial inter-observer variability exists in the Mallampati sc oring. [note: 224] In other words, different observers performing the Mallampati sc oring on the _same patient_ , even at the _same time_ , may not always report the _same score_. Fac tors c ausing suc h variability inc lude subjec tivity between different observers, as well as the element of patient c o-operation ( _eg_ , how wide the patient c hooses to open her mouth and whether she makes a sound). For these reasons, the 

Mallampati test is reported to be of “poor reliability”. [note: 225] This inter-observer variability was doc umented in medic al literature produc ed to the c ourt and was also generally ac c epted by the 

anaesthetic witnesses of both parties. [note: 226] For this reason, Prof Delilkan’s and Dr Ho’s assessments of the Mallampati sc ore “3” in 2009 and 2010 respec tively have little evidential value to the plaintiff’s Mallampati sc ore in 2006. 

125    The defendant also emphasised that in any event, the Mallampati sc oring is just a predic tive diagnostic sc oring tool. It is not an ac tual indic ator of whether there will be, or that there ac tually was, diffic ulty intubating the plaintiff. 

126    Having c onsidered the evidenc e before me, I find that the plaintiff has not proven on a balanc e of probabilities that the defendant’s assessment of Mallampati sc ore “2” was wrong. Before moving on, I should also mention that Ms Ho offered Prof Sia the opportunity to assess the plaintiff’s airway 

during the trial. [note: 227] Prof Sia dec lined to assess the plaintiff’s physic al features (whic h is the sec ond part of the airway assessment) for reasons set out below at [128]. The plaintiff c ontended that as Prof Sia had not offered any reason for dec lining to assess the plaintiff’s Mallampati sc ore (whic h is the first part of the airway assessment), the c ourt should draw an adverse inferenc e that he was seeking to avoid giving evidenc e unfavourable to the defendant. I disagree. Although the invitation to Prof Sia to assess the plaintiff extended to both the Mallampati sc oring and the 

examination of physic al features, [note: 228] in fairness to Prof Sia, what transpired _after_ that invitation foc used only on the examination of the plaintiff’s physic al features. In any event, this c ontention was not put to Prof Sia. I should also add that the evidential value of any assessment by Prof Sia would be low bec ause of the inter-observer variability present in the Mallampati sc oring (see [124] above). Having made my findings as to the first part of the airway assessment, I turn now to c onsider the evidenc e in relation to the sec ond part of the airway assessment involving the examination of the plaintiff’s physic al features. 

(ii) Examination of physic al features 

127    The examination of a patient’s physic al features for the purposes of airway assessment involves looking at whether the patient has a limited mouth opening, a rec eding c hin and/or limited nec k movements. The defendant had rec orded in the Anaesthetic Rec ord that all these 


c harac teristic s of the plaintiff were normal. The plaintiff’s position was that she had limited nec k movement and a rec eding c hin in 2006, as found by her anaesthetic expert, Prof Delilkan, when he 

examined her in November 2009. [note: 229] 

128    As a preliminary point, I am unable to plac e muc h weight on Prof Delilkan’s alleged observations of the plaintiff’s limited nec k movement and rec eding c hin bec ause he had no supporting doc uments to show that these features were noted during his examination of the plaintiff in November 2009. [note: 230] Further, as Prof Sia pointed out, the plaintiff’s nec k pains whic h surfac ed _after_ the LSCS 

would have had a bearing on her subsequent range of nec k movements. [note: 231] Moreover, the plaintiff’s nec k deformity that developed over the years _after_ the LSCS might have altered her fac ial 

profile over the years, partic ularly the c hin. [note: 232] As suc h, even if Prof Delilkan’s observations in November 2009 were true, they are of limited value as to the plaintiff’s state at the time of the LSCS. I find these reasons valid and do not draw any adverse inferenc e from Prof Sia’s failure to ac c ept the invitation to examine the plaintiff. I ac c ept Prof Sia’s explanation that there would have been little value in his doing so. 

129    At the trial, Ms Ho also suggested that the anaesthetic experts look at photographs [note: 233] that showed the profile of the plaintiff taken _before_ the LSCS, and give their opinion as to whether 

the plaintiff had a rec eding c hin bac k in Oc tober 2006. [note: 234] Prof Delilkan c laimed that the relevant photographs showed that the plaintiff had a rec eding c hin bec ause the lower jaw was 

“underdeveloped” and thus had a tendenc y to “rec ede” and “c ause an overbite”. [note: 235] In c ontrast, Prof Sia did not see any suc h overbite and was of the opinion that the plaintiff’s c hin was 

normal. [note: 236] I too was unable to see evidenc e of an overbite and therefore agree with Prof Sia. 

130    Having c onsidered all the evidenc e before me, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove on a balanc e of probabilities that the defendant had performed any part of the airway assessment in a manner not regarded as proper by a responsible body of medic al opinion. There is therefore no basis to say that the defendant’s assessment that the plaintiff was not a diffic ult patient to intubate was wrong. I pause to note, parenthetic ally, that even if the plaintiff’s Mallampati sc ore in Oc tober 2006 was “3”, as she c laimed, she may still not be c onsidered a diffic ult patient to intubate bec ause, ac c ording to Prof Sia, it is only when a patient’s Mallampati sc ore is “4” that he will c onsider her to be 

a potentially diffic ult patient to intubate. [note: 237] 

_Whether the risk of neck injury is commonly known_ 

131    In view of the dispute between the anaesthetic experts on one side and Dr Singh on the other as to whether the risk of nec k injury is a c ommonly known risk of GA, and to determine whether the anaesthetic experts’ views meet the _Gunapathy_ test, it is nec essary for me to examine: (a) Dr Singh’s alleged experienc e; and (b) the medic al literature he tendered to support his position. 

(i) Dr Singh’s alleged experienc e 

132    Of those seven to ten c ases he c laimed to have treated, Dr Singh was able to rec all from 

memory some details of four of them [note: 238] but was unable to produc e the medic al rec ords in relation to any of them. His reason was that the hospital in Malaysia dec lined to release them. This was despite my granting another further tranc he of hearing for this issue to be heard. Sinc e the defendant’s orthopaedic expert was not given a fair opportunity to examine the rec ords and c omment on the c ases that Dr Singh sought to rely on, I am unable to plac e weight on Dr Singh’s evidenc e in 


relation to those four c ases. 

133    On the last day of the trial, Dr Singh was able to produc e some supporting doc umentary 

evidenc e [note: 239] in relation to one _other_ c ase (hereinafter referred to as the c ase of “Patient X”). As a preliminary point, the probative value of this c ase is limited bec ause Dr Singh was only able to produc e his own c ase notes and the MRI sc ans. Other important doc uments, suc h as the operation rec ords, anaesthetic rec ord, nursing rec ords and emergenc y department rec ords, were all unavailable. The defendant’s orthopaedic expert, Dr Li, therefore did not have the opportunity to properly c onsider and c omment on the c ase of Patient X. I nevertheless allowed both orthopaedic experts to c onsider the MRI sc ans of Patient X to see if there was any objec tive evidenc e of Patient X suffering from an injury similar to the plaintiff’s. 

134    Patient X was a 45-year-old male who allegedly suffered nec k pains after undergoing GA for a lipoma ( _ie_ , lump) exc ision on 7 Oc tober 2011. He was seen by Dr Singh on 10 Oc tober 2011. The relevant sequenc es of MRI for the c ase of Patient X were as follows: 

 (a) MRI 1: T1 sequenc e ( ie , the sequenc e whic h better shows anatomic al struc ture than fluid); 

 (b) MRI 2: Short Tau Inversion Rec overy (“STIR”) sequenc e ( ie , sequenc e whic h is the most sensitive to detec t fluid); and 

 (c ) MRI 3: T2 sequenc e ( ie , the sequenc e weighted suc h that fluids show up as bright images). 

135    Ac c ording to Dr Li, MRI 3 showed that Patient X already had severe pre-existing c ervic al spondylosis as evidenc ed by multiple anterior osteophytes, partic ularly at C4/C5 and C5/C6, and 

c ompression of the spinal c ord. [note: 240] There was also either a haematoma (swelling c ontaining blood) or oedema (swelling c ontaining fluid) spreading from C2 to C6 as evidenc ed by a high signal 

c hange anterior to the c ervic al spine whic h was most evident on MRI 2. [note: 241] Ac c ording to Dr Li, MRI 2 also showed a break anterior to the disc spac e of C5/C6, suggesting that there may be some 

injury at that level. [note: 242] His c onc lusion was that Patient X suffered from an injury at the C5/C6 

level and not the C4/C5 level. [note: 243] Further, the injury was quite a serious one resembling an 

injury from a high speed whiplash and he doubted that it was c aused by intubation. [note: 244] 

136    Dr Singh’s position was that the MRI sc ans showed that Patient X had suffered an ALL injury at 

C4/C5. Ac c ording to him, there was a haematoma in front of C4/C5 seen in MRI 1 and MRI 2. [note: 245] There was also a signal c hange at the anterior portion of the lower border of C4 and upper border 

of C5, and soft tissue swelling and bleeding representing a haematoma shown “in MRI 3 in the STIR 

sequenc e”. [note: 246] However, sinc e it is MRI 2 and not MRI 3 that is the STIR sequenc e, it is unc lear whic h MRI Dr Singh was ac tually referring to. He might also ac tually have been referring to MRI 1 sinc e he had earlier said the high signal c hange at C4/C5 in MRI 1 indic ated a tear in the ALL. [note: 247] When c hallenged on what he interpreted a high signal c hange to mean, Dr Singh at first 

said it meant an oedema, [note: 248] but just a few minutes later c onc eded that it ac tually 

represented fat. [note: 249] Dr Singh disagreed with Dr Li’s observation that MRI 2 showed a tear in C5/C6 on the basis that the blac k line whic h Dr Li had identified as the ALL was ac tually the bone 

struc ture. [note: 250] 


137    Owing to the dispute between the orthopaedic experts as to the interpretation of Patient X’s MRIs, a radiologist at MediRad Assoc iates Radiology Clinic at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Dr Tsou, was c alled in as a c ourt expert by agreement of both parties (see [52] above). Dr Tsou’s evidenc e was that based on MRI 2, there was a loss of anterior c ontinuity at the C5/C6 level of the disc whic h most 

likely indic ated a small tear. [note: 251] He also noted that there was preverterbral oedema between 

C2 and C6. [note: 252] In finding that there was a small tear at the C5/C6 level, Dr Tsou pointed to there being “additional evidenc e” of soft tissue swelling, oedema and fluid anterior to the c ervic al 

spine at C5/C6. [note: 253] Dr Tsou’s interpretations bore out Dr Li’s interpretation but not Dr Singh’s interpretation. When further queried by the c ourt, Dr Tsou said that Patient X’s spine had undergone a lot of degeneration as evidenc ed by the multiple anterior and posterior osteophytes. As suc h, 

Patient X was likely elderly or had suffered a previous injury. [note: 254] In short, Dr Tsou’s views were more c onsistent with Dr Li’s views than with Dr Singh’s views. 

138    At this junc ture, I pause to note that Dr Singh was c onfusing and misleading in his testimony. He was unc lear as to whic h spec ific MRI he was relying on in relation to his various observations and tried to c over up his ambiguity by saying that he was looking at the different films in totality. He swung from insisting that a high signal in MRI 1 referred to oedema before c onc eding a few minutes later that it was ac tually fat. He had tried to rely on MRI 1 to support his c onc lusion of haematoma when the foc us of MRI 1 was on anatomic al struc ture and would not show fluids as c learly. He insisted that the blac k line in MRI 2 whic h ac tually represented the ALL was only the bone. Had these few points been the only inc idents, I might have been prepared to ac c ept that Dr Singh was not being deliberately misleading but was merely out of his depth as his expertise was not in radiology. However, as I will point out further on, there were many other inc idents whic h showed Dr Singh’s lac k of c redibility as an expert witness. Take, for example, the following exc hange after Dr Tsou finished giving his observations on Patient X’s MRIs: 

 Court: Now, if c ounsel will agree, I think the best way to proc eed is as I indic ated: let Dr Harwant Singh start first, bec ause this is something that he has brought to the c ourt’s attention. Let’s look at it. 

 Dr Singh, what is it that you seek agreement from Dr Tsou about? 

 Dr Singh: Can I give him a brief history? Would you want a history of the patient? 

 Court: No , I think -c an I do this? I want to depend on the MRI. 

 Can you pose the points that you say are borne out by the MRI to Dr Tsou, and see whether Dr Tsou agrees with you on the points that you make, before you go into the history? 

 Dr Singh: I understand. 

 Court: Just tell him, “This is what I observed in the MRI,” and see whether he agrees. 

 Dr Singh: This is a patient that I managed for a hyperextension injury. Is this c onsistent with a hyperextension? 

 Co urt : Dr Singh, I have just told you. The whole idea is I want you to seek confirmation of whatever points you are able to see from the MRI. 

 Dr Singh: I thought -I mean -[note: 255] 


 [emphasis added] 

It was c lear to all that the purpose of c alling Dr Tsou was to obtain an objec tive interpretation of Patient X’s MRIs. It was also made very c lear that Patient X’s history was not to be given before Dr Tsou had given evidenc e as to whic h expert’s interpretation was borne out by the MRIs and Dr Singh had said that he understood. By informing Dr Tsou that Patient X was a patient he managed for a hyperextension injury _in the very next breath_ , Dr Singh was, to my mind, deliberately trying to c olour Dr Tsou’s mind. Dr Singh’s explanation that he did not know how to frame the questions unless 

he gave Dr Tsou the history was a lame exc use. [note: 256] 

139    Ac c ordingly, I find that Dr Singh was either trying to mislead the c ourt, or was simply not c ompetent in interpreting MRI sc ans. In either event, I view his evidenc e with c irc umspec tion. I ac c ept the opinion of Dr Li, as independently c orroborated by Dr Tsou, that more likely than not, Patient X had suffered an injury at the C5/C6 level and not the C4/C5 level. I also ac c ept Dr Li’s evidenc e that it was doubtful that Patient X’s injury was c aused by intubation. The injury suffered by Patient X was therefore _not_ similar to that of the plaintiff and c annot be used by the plaintiff to support her c laim that nec k injuries are a c ommon risk of intubation. 

140    In the plaintiff’s c losing submissions, it was submitted that if this c ourt was not inc lined to ac c ept that there had been an ALL injury at C4/C5, it should nonetheless ac c ept that the loc ation of 

the plaintiff’s ALL injury c ould also have been at C5/C6. [note: 257] I do not ac c ept this. It is c lear that until the c ase of Patient X was disc ussed on the very last day of the trial, the plaintiff’s c ase theory throughout the trial was that there was an ALL injury at the C4/C5 level. It is untenable to dismiss the differenc e in loc ation just bec ause, ac c ording to the plaintiff, “the physic al distanc e between C4/C5 and C5/C6 is mere millimeters on the MRI sc ans and the slight disparity in views may be the result of interpretation of the MRI sc ans”. In fairness to the defendant, the only c ase that he needs to meet is in relation to the plaintiff’s allegation that there had been an injury to the ALL _at the C4/C5 level_. 

(ii) Medic al literature 

141    The anaesthetic experts [note: 258] and the orthopaedic experts [note: 259] of both parties agreed that there are no reported c ases of injuries similar to that allegedly suffered by the plaintiff in medic al literature. Dr Singh, however, tendered six artic les whic h allegedly prove that the mec hanism of suc h injuries was nonetheless, in his words, “well-doc umented”. These artic les, as we shall see, were either not on point or taken out of c ontext by Dr Singh. 

142    The first artic le was John W R Mc Intyre, “The diffic ult trac heal intubation” Can J Anaesth 

1987; 34(2): 204–213. [note: 260] Dr Singh highlighted p 206 of the artic le whic h states as follows: 

 ... If rec ourse is taken to one of the hazardous earlier positions advoc ated for laryngosc opy in whic h the c ervic al spine and atlanto oc c ipital joint are extended, then damage to bony and c artilaginous struc tures must be c arefully avoided. It should be noted that vigorous attempts to improve visualisation by extending the c ervic al spine c an bow it forward, thus lifting the larynx of some patients anteriorly and out of the line of view. [note: 261] 

Ac c ording to Dr Singh, this passage explained that an anaesthetist “c an lift the c ervic al spine, 

espec ially the anterior portion at the C4/C5 level, whic h then c an injure the [ALL]”. [note: 262] However, as Mr Lek pointed out, this artic le was written spec ific ally in the c ontext of diffic ult 


intubation. [note: 263] Dr Singh eventually admitted that this c ontext was c ruc ial after the question 

was put to him by Mr Lek. [note: 264] 

143    The next artic le was Divatia J V and Bhowmic k K, “Complic ations of Endotrac heal Intubation 

and other Airway Management Proc edures” Indian J Anaesth 2005; 49(4): 308–318. [note: 265] Dr Singh highlighted Table 1 at p 309 where “spinal c ord and vertebral c olumn injury” were stated to be a c omplic ation of endotrac heal intubation “at the time of intubation”. He then referred to the sec tion on “spinal c ord and vertebral c olumn injury” at p 310 whic h states as follows: 

 Extension of the c ervic al spine during laryngosc opy may c ause trauma to the spinal c ord resulting in quadriplegia. ... 

As Mr Lek again pointed out, Dr Singh failed to bring to the attention of the c ourt that the statement 

relied on by him was made in the following c ontext: [note: 266] 

 ... This is more likely in patients with c ervic al spine frac tures or malformations, tumours or osteoporosis. In patients with suspec ted instability of the c ervic al vertebrae, the head must be maintained in a neutral position during laryngosc opy and intubation at all times; hyperextension is stric tly avoided. ... 

Sinc e the plaintiff had no known pre-existing c ervic al spine problems before the LSCS, the statement Dr Singh relied on c arries little weight. It also bears noting Dr Li’s c omment that even though the ALL is anatomic ally a part of the vertebral c olumn, it is still a stretc h to say that the writer meant to also 

inc lude ALL injury when he referred to vertebral c olumn injury. [note: 267] 

144    The third artic le Dr Singh relied on was “Virtual Disaster Medic ine Training Center (VDMTC): Module 3: Complic ations of Managing the Airway, Complic ations with Intubation”, 

[http://vdmtc](http://vdmtc) .org/module03/intubate/intubate03.htm (ac c essed 7 Oc tober 2011) [note: 268] and in partic ular the following passage at pp 2 and 3: 

 Trauma to the larynx and voc al c ords is not unc ommon following endotrac heal intubation. It depends on the experienc e and skill of the intubator, as well as the degree of diffic ulty. ... Injuries of the laryngeal musc les and suspensory ligaments are also possible. ... 

However, as Prof Sia explained, when this artic le was raised, “suspensory ligaments” refer to the 

ligaments relating to the voc al c ords. [note: 269] Sinc e the laryngeal musc les and suspensory ligaments are struc tures that are loc ated _above_ where the laryngosc ope blade would sit when it is inserted into the patient, and the ALL is loc ated _below_ that, it is diffic ult to see the direc t relevanc e of this 

passage. [note: 270] Dr Singh also sought to rely on the following passage at p 5 of the same artic le: 

 Airway management tec hniques suc h as c hin lift, jaw thrust and direc t laryngosc opy transmit movement to the c ervic al spine and may induc e cervical spine injury. Attempts to hyperextend the nec ks of patients with ankylosing spondylitis may result in c ervic al frac tures and quadriplegia. [emphasis in original] 

On the fac e of it, it is unc lear whether the first sentenc e above also referred to patients with ankylosing spondylitis (an underlying spine problem) or if it was meant to be a general statement also applic able to healthy patients. The weight of all the other evidenc e, however, c learly showed that the risk of nec k injury was not a c ommonly known risk of intubation in a normal healthy patient.

As suc h, I find that the first sentenc e was more likely than not made in the c ontext of patients who have ankylosing spondylitis, and not as a general statement. 

145    The fourth artic le was Randolph H Hastings _et al_ , “Cervic al Spine Movement during Laryngosc opy with the Bullard, Mac intosh and Miller Laryngosc opes” Anaesthesiology 1995; 82(4): 

859–869. [note: 271] Spec ific ally, Dr Singh referred to Figure 5 on p 865 whic h c ompared the head extension angle with the angle between the oc c iput and C4 ( _ie_ , the angle between C0 and C4). Ac c ording to him, the figure showed that when a laryngosc ope is used, “the mec hanic s of getting the 

head bac k c auses an extension all the way right down to ... at least the C4/C5 segment”. [note: 272] However, it bears noting that: 

 (a) C5 was never mentioned in Figure 5; and 

 (b) Dr Singh’s evidenc e on this artic le was given after Dr Tsou had c onfirmed that Patient X’s injury was at the C5/C6 level and not at the C4/C5 level. 

Dr Singh was deliberately imprec ise in explaining to the c ourt how this artic le supported his position. The relevant parts of the transc ript are set out below to provide a fuller pic ture: 

 ... Dr Singh, you have to help us interpret, very briefly, what you want us to understand from this? 

 Okay. When we use a laryngosc ope, the mec hanic s of getting the head bac k c auses an extension all the way right down to C -at least to the C4/C5 segment. 

 W here does it say C5? 

 The C4 angle is the upper part of the C5 segment. 

 No. Dr Singh has to be very c areful. A few times now, even to Dr Tsou, he slipped in the word “C5”. I was letting him [know] it, bec ause I [know] the Hastings artic le does not have the referenc e to C5 at all, yet he is doing it still in the middle of his testimony, slipping in C5. 

 It is not slipping in, Sir. What c omes below the C4, what is the lower border of C4? C5. 

 Dr Singh, if you are referring to this artic le, then stic k to this artic le, what the artic le says. 

 Yes. 

 No, but -

 If you say it refers to C5, then point us to the relevant paragraph that says so. 

 To the C4? 

 So is it C4 or C5? 

 I am inferring, to the C4 angle, that it is an extension all the way through at the C4. C4 is up to the C5. That is what I’m trying to say. 

 Sorry, I do not get you. Why is C4 up to the C5?

 Dr Li:

 Dr Singh:

 Dr Singh:

 Dr Singh: 

 Dr Singh: 

 Court: 

 Dr Singh: 

 Because below the C4 segment is C5, so it is C5 and above, so it is C0 to C4. If you prefer, C4. 

 I disagree. I think you c annot, just bec ause C5 is below C4, that you c an -... So this artic le just mentions ac tually the whole angle from C0 to C4 as the angle, not whether it is the C4/C5, angle, whic h is what he says. He has to take it in c ontext, bec ause this is measured, C0 to C4 is measured as one angle. 

 ... 

 The purpose of this was that whenever you extend the head and nec k, you will have an extension all the way through up to C4 , as it says here then. So you c annot have any other movement exc ept an extension up to there. There c an never be any movement exc ept an extension based on this study. That is the referenc e point for this. 

 ... 

 So you say this artic le, and I suppose in partic ular Figure 5, shows that there is extension 

- 

 All the way up to C4. 

 -up to C4. 

 Yes. 

 From where to C4? 

 From C0, the back of the head, up to C4. ... 

 ... 

 I added in C5 because the end point of C4 is at the C4/C5 junction. But I am happy to just say at C4 if that is what the court wishes. 

 It is not what the c ourt wishes, it is what the artic le talks about. Dr Singh, I think you have to be fair. I am not trying to put words into your mouth. But when you speak and you refer to 5, I find no referenc e to 5 here, so I asked you, “Where is 5?” 

 Yes, okay. C4. [note: 273] 

 [emphasis added] 

In any event, these results were qualified at p 865 with the express proviso that: 

 ... Manual stabilization, c ric oid pressure, and immobilizing devic es, whic h are also c omponents of standard tec hniques for direc t laryngosc opy of trauma patients with potential c ervic al spine injuries, were not employed. ... [note: 274] 

This artic le was therefore of little relevanc e to the present c ase sinc e a pillow (for manual stabilisation) and c ric oid pressure were used in the plaintiff’s c ase. 


146    The fifth artic le was Kun Yan & Mary Franc es Diggan, “A Case of Central Cord Syndrome 

Caused by Intubation: A Case Report” J of Spinal Cord Med 1997; 20: 230–232. [note: 275] It reported a c ase where the patient suffered an injury to the c ervic al c ord ( _ie_ , c entral c ord syndrome) due to hyperextension of the nec k during intubation, for whic h there was no history of high veloc ity forc e. Ac c ording to Dr Singh, if a devastating injury c ould have happened to a normal patient, then a minor 

injury with just minimal trauma c an also c ause an injury to the ALL. [note: 276] However, as Dr Li pointed out, the MRI sc an done on the patient after the surgery revealed that the c ervic al spine was 

“entirely normal”. [note: 277] There was no disc ussion in the artic le on ALL injury. It was also expressly stated in the introduc tion that this was an isolated c ase sinc e “there have been no reports in the 

literature of c entral c ord syndrome c aused by intubation”. [note: 278] There were also several distinguishing fac tors in the c ase reported in this artic le, in partic ular: 

 (a) The patient already had some neurologic al func tion impairment as evidenc ed by her musc le weakness and foot drop. [note: 279] 

 (b) This was an emergenc y intubation done to resusc itate the patient who had developed severe hypoxia, the intubation was likely to have been done in a rush, [note: 280] and the patient’s nec k might be moved about more bec ause of the need to do c ardiopulmonary resusc itation. [note: 281] 

 (c ) It was not known whether the doc tor who performed the intubation was a skilled anaesthetist. If it had been done by an inexperienc ed doc tor, he might not have positioned the patient’s nec k properly and/or inserted the laryngosc ope properly, thus c ausing injury to the patient’s nec k. 

147    The sixth artic le was Bradley J Hindman _et al_ , “Cervic al Spinal Cord, Root and Bony Spine 

Injuries” Anaesthesiology 2011; 114(4): 782–795. [note: 282] Ac c ording to Dr Singh, this artic le c hronic led six c ases in whic h diffic ulty in airway management was a possible c ontributor to c ervic al 

spine injury. [note: 283] However, as Dr Li pointed out, the disc ussions in the artic le noted that the 

patients in most of these c ases had pre-existing c ervic al spine problems. [note: 284] For one of the c ases, there was some ambiguity as to whether the patient’s c ervic al spondylosis and c ord c ompression were pre-existing at the time of surgery. Nonetheless, reading the artic le as a whole, it is c lear that the artic le c onc ludes that: 

 ... in almost all of these c ases, it appears that severe c ervic al spondylosis was present, in patients undergoing c ervic al spine surgery as well as patients who experienc ed c ord injury during nonc ervic al spine proc edures. [note: 285] 

The ambiguous c ase was, more likely than not, a c ase where the patient had a pre-existing spine problem whic h was not disc overed until after the surgery. Even if this was not so, the weight of the evidenc e (inc luding the other c ases disc ussed in these medic al artic les, as well as the evidenc e of the anaesthetic experts) c learly show that the risk of nec k injury was not a c ommonly known risk of intubation. 

148    In c onc lusion, the artic les tendered in support of the plaintiff’s c ase were of little evidential value, if at all, as none of them were written in the spec ific c ontext of an experienc ed anaesthetist c arrying out an intubation proc edure in an otherwise healthy patient with no known existing nec k injury. 


_Conclusion on sub-issue 1(b)_ 

149    For the reasons given above, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove on a balanc e of probabilities: 

 (a) that the defendant’s assessment of her airway was erroneous and that she was ac tually c onsidered a diffic ult patient to intubate (see [119]–[130] above); and 

 (b) that nec k injury is a c ommonly known risk of GA in an otherwise normal patient (see [131]– [148] above). 

I find that the defendant’s omission to advise her on the risk of nec k injury is supported by a respec table body of medic al opinion whic h meets the threshold test of logic in the _Gunapathy_ test (see [53] _supra_ ). Ac c ordingly, I find that the defendant was not under a duty to disc lose that there was a risk of nec k injury, or to ensure that the risk of nec k injury was disc losed to the plaintiff. 

150    It is also worth noting that even if the princ iples in the English c ases of _Pearce_ (see [58] _supra_ ) and _Chester_ (see [58] _supra_ ) were applic able in our loc al c ourts, suc h that a patient has a right to be informed of a small but well established risk of serious injury, the defendant would still not be liable. This is bec ause, as set out above, the evidenc e before me was that nec k injury arising from the GA intubation proc ess in a normal patient is not a c ommonly known or well-established risk at all. 

**_Sub-issue 1(c): The alternatives to GA_** 

151    It was undisputed that the defendant did not disc uss any alternatives to GA with the plaintiff. Neither did he expressly c onfirm with the plaintiff that Dr Tham had disc ussed the alternatives with her. 

_The applicable legal principles_ 

152    It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the alternatives to a c hosen treatment must always be disc losed regardless of whether the alternatives were ac tually less suitable. The plaintiff relied on the c ase _Birch v University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust_ (2008) 104 BMLR 168 (“ _Birch_ ”). In _Birch_ , the patient was informed of the risks involved with c atheter angiography but not the c omparative risks assoc iated with MRI, an alternative to the angiography. She then suffered a stroke bec ause of c omplic ations from the angiography. In finding that the defendant, Queen Square Prac tic e (“Queen Square”), had breac hed its duty of c are to the patient by not disc losing the c omparative risks of MRI, Cranston J stated (at [74]) that: 

 ... there will be c irc umstanc es where c onsistently with Lord Woolf MR’s statement of the law in Pearce [ v United Bristol Healthcare NHS Trust ] the duty to inform a patient of the signific ant risks will not be disc harged unless she is made aware that fewer, or no risks, are assoc iated with another proc edure. In other words, unless the patient is informed of the c omparative risks of different proc edures she will not be in a position to give her fully informed c onsent to one proc edure rather than another. ... 

153    However, the duty to inform in _Birch_ arose out of “spec ial” (at [77]) and “unusual” (at [78]) c irc umstanc es whic h the c ourt took pains to highlight: 

 (a) Mrs Birc h had been referred to Queen Square by a neurologist, Professor Giovannoni (“Prof Giovannoni”), who had spec ific ally rec ommended an MRI; 


 (b) Prof Giovannoni had raised c onc erned about c avernous sinus pathology whic h c ould not be detec ted by an angiogram but c ould be detec ted by an MRI; 

 (c ) Mrs Birc h was at a higher risk of stroke with the angiography as she was a poorly c ontrolled longstanding diabetic , with a vasc ular history. By c ontrast, there was no risk assoc iated with an MRI; 

 (d) her admission notes identified both an MRI and c atheter angiography as possibilities for the next day; and 

 (e) when the dec ision for an angiogram was made later, one of the four key doc tors involved in the dec ision, a general radiology registrar, c ontinued to suggest an MRI as a suitable possibility. 

154    Cranston J c onc luded at [78]–[79]: 

 [78] ... Given this bac kground, where two procedures were open for Mrs Birch , she needed to have explained to her the c omparative risks. While I do not ac c ept the c laimant’s submission that she needed to be informed explic itly what Professor Giovannoni had proposed, she did need to know than an MRI would have provided answers to the c onc erns Professor Giovannoni had raised about both an aneurysm and c avernous sinus pathology, and to the degree of c onfidenc e he thought nec essary. ... 

 [79] ... I am c onvinc ed that in Mrs Birc h’s c ase no reasonable, prudent medical practitioner would have failed to discuss the respective modalities and risks with her along the lines outlined. In their absenc e she was denied the opportunity to make an informed c hoic e. Even if I am wrong on this, the failure to disc uss with Mrs Birc h these matters c ould not be desc ribed in law as reasonable, responsible or logic al. On either approac h, therefore, the failure to provide her with this information was in breac h of duty. 

 [emphasis added] 

155    The duty to inform arose out of the fac t that it was unreasonable and imprudent for the four doc tors in _Birch_ not to have disc ussed the c omparative risks of a suitable treatment whic h they had been c onsidering up until the last moment. _Birch_ does not lay down a general rule that a doc tor has a duty of c are to disc lose all other alternatives to a patient regardless of their suitability. 

156    In any event, the applic able test in Singapore, as set out in _Gunapathy_ (see [53] _supra_ ), is whether a responsible body of medic al opinion would regard the defendant’s omission, to disc uss with the plaintiff any alternatives to GA and to verify whether Dr Tham had done so, as proper. 

_Analysis on the facts_ 

157    To determine liability, the first fac tual question to be c onsidered is whether the alternatives to GA were reasonably ruled out in the plaintiff’s c ase. During c ross-examination, Dr Tham agreed that GA was preferable in the plaintiff’s c ase bec ause of the totality of the following obstetric c onsiderations: (a) the c onc ern for bleeding by the plaintiff; (b) the baby’s unstable lie; and (c ) the 

baby’s prematurity. [note: 286] 

158    The c onc ern for bleeding was c aused by three fac tors: 


 (a) the antepartum haemorrhage ( ie , bleeding before delivery) although it had stopped by the night of 25 Oc tober 2006; [note: 287] 

 (b) the plaintiff’s history of postpartum haemorrhage ( ie , bleeding after delivery) with two of her previous pregnanc ies; [note: 288] and 

 (c ) the plaintiff’s status of “grand multip” ( ie , woman who has given birth five or more times) whic h predisposed the plaintiff to postpartum haemorrhage. [note: 289] 

The defendant explained that GA would have been preferable should bleeding ac tually oc c ur during the LSCS. This is bec ause if the plaintiff was under GA her airway and breathing would already have been sec ured as she would have been intubated and ventilated, and he would only need to 

c onc entrate on restoring her c irc ulation. [note: 290] In c ontrast, if the plaintiff was under RA, he would first have to _convert_ the RA into a GA so as to sec ure the plaintiff’s airway and breathing before 

restoring her c irc ulation. [note: 291] The drugs used in RA and GA might also aggravate the 

hypotension. [note: 292] I should mention at this junc ture that for the reasons set out above (at [96]– [99]), the fac t that the defendant did not order c ross-matc hing tests for blood is not inc onsistent with his c laim that he was c onc erned about bleeding. 

159    Both the plaintiff’s obstetric expert, Dr Lai, [note: 293] and the defendant’s obstetric expert, 

Dr Rauff, [note: 294] generally agreed with the proposition that GA would have been preferable if bleeding was a serious c onc ern, at least in relation to the state of medic al tec hnology bac k in 2006. Dr Rauff also explained that if there was some c hanc e that an RA would have to be c onverted into a GA, then it might be better to start with GA from the outset so as not to expose the patient to the 

risks of _both_ RA and GA. [note: 295] Although Dr Lai and Dr Rauff agreed that there was some general c onc ern about bleeding, they differed as to how serious the c onc ern ac tually was. 

160    Dr Lai was of the view that the c onc ern about bleeding was not very serious sinc e: 

 (a) the plaintiff did not have to be monitored in the delivery suite instead of a ward; [note: 296] 

 (b) a heparin plug for intravenous exc ess was not inserted into the plaintiff while she was in the ward, whic h is the usual step taken when bleeding is a c onc ern so that the patient c an be resusc itated quic kly without wasting time trying to find a vein in the event of a c atastrophic bleed; [note: 297] 

 (c ) blood tests and investigations were not c arried out; [note: 298] and 

 (d) the plaintiff’s LSCS was an elec tive and not an emergenc y proc edure. [note: 299] 

On the other hand, Dr Rauff was of the view that the c onc ern about bleeding was probably serious enough to justify the c hoic e of GA sinc e: (a) Dr Tham ordered 60 units of Syntoc inon and 1ml of 

Ergometrine (drugs c ommonly presc ribed to prevent bleeding); [note: 300] and (b) although the situation was not so dire as to require an emergenc y LSCS, Dr Tham still felt it nec essary to have the 

baby delivered about a month earlier than full term. [note: 301] 

161    Ac c ording to Dr Tham, the next fac tor that made GA more favourable was the fac t that the 


baby was in an unstable lie ( _ie_ , the baby’s position in relation to the axis of the mother kept c hanging 

before labour). [note: 302] Dr Tham explained that bec ause of this he might have needed to perform an additional vertic al c ut to manoeuvre the baby out, although he had not c ome ac ross suc h a situation 

before. [note: 303] He nonetheless admitted that if suc h a need arose, it would have been more 

c omfortable for the plaintiff if she was under GA as she would have been more relaxed. [note: 304] This view was also shared by Dr Rauff who further pointed out that the need for a vertic al c ut c ould also have arisen as the lower segment of the uterus would have been poorly formed at 35 weeks and six 

days. [note: 305] Dr Lai, however, was of the view that RA would still be good enough. [note: 306] 

162    The third fac tor that made GA more favourable was the fac t that the baby was of less than 37 

weeks’ gestation and therefore premature. [note: 307] Dr Tham explained that the baby’s prematurity, 

on its own, was a “very minor” fac tor when c onsidering whether to c hoose GA over RA. [note: 308] This was bec ause although the plaintiff’s baby was c onsidered a pre-term baby at 35 weeks and six 

days, it was still relatively developed (as opposed to pre-term babies posing serious problems). [note: 309] Nevertheless, Dr Tham agreed that the totality of all the obstetric fac tors made GA the preferred 

c hoic e. [note: 310] 

163    On the evidenc e before me, it is quite c lear that there were obstetric reasons to favour GA over RA but not suc h as to prec lude RA as a viable option. The question then arises as to whether a responsible body of medic al men would still have advised the plaintiff about RA in these c irc umstanc es. Ac c ording to the defendant’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Sia, he would not do so as long 

as the plaintiff was not found to be c ontra-indic ated for GA. [note: 311] His position is that Dr Tham c ould not have reac hed a preferenc e for GA without having first disc ussed alternatives with the 

plaintiff, and there would be no need for further disc ussion of the RA alternative. [note: 312] In 

c ontrast, the plaintiff’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Delilkan, said that he would. [note: 313] 

164    I ac c ept Prof Sia’s evidenc e as it meets the _Bolitho_ (see [53] _supra_ ) threshold test of logic. It seems to me that if: 

 (a) the preferenc e for GA was made bec ause there were obstetric fac tors favouring GA over RA; 

 (b) this information had already been explained by Dr Tham to the plaintiff on the night before the LSCS; 

 (c ) the defendant was aware of the obstetric ian’s preferenc e for GA; and 

 (d) the defendant c onfirmed that the plaintiff was not c ontra-indic ated for GA, 

there would be no need to belabour the point and disc uss alternative modes of anaesthesia and their c omparative risks. In this partic ular c ase, it is also signific ant that the plaintiff did not indic ate in any way that she did not want to proc eed with the GA and/or that she was c onsidering other alternatives. 

_Conclusion on sub-issue 1(c)_ 

165    Ac c ordingly, I find that the defendant did not breac h his duty of c are by not disc ussing with the plaintiff the alternatives to GA. In view of the usual working prac tic e between the defendant and 


Dr Tham (see [115] above), I also find that the defendant did not breac h his duty of c are in omitting to expressly c onfirm with the plaintiff that Dr Tham had indeed gone through the proc ess of explaining the alternatives to her. 

**_Sub-issue 1(d): Whether informed consent was vitiated by the location where the consent was obtained_** 

166    The plaintiff took the position that her informed c onsent, if any, was vitiated by the fac t that it was taken whilst she was lying on the OT table and in a vulnerable mental state. The plaintiff’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Delilkan, agreed that informed c onsent should never be taken in the OT 

unless it is an emergenc y situation. [note: 314] 

167    The defendant’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Sia, disagreed with the plaintiff and Prof Delilkan’s c ontention. Prof Sia explained that if the proc ess of obtaining informed c onsent was started muc h earlier by the primary physic ian (as it usually would be), then the patient would have had time to 

think about her dec ision. [note: 315] In suc h a situation, there was nothing wrong in performing the 

final steps of c onfirming her informed c onsent in the OT itself. [note: 316] Even if for some reason the proc ess of informed c onsent had not been started before the patient was wheeled into the OT, 

Prof Sia said that while it would not be ideal to take informed c onsent in the OT, [note: 317] he would not have the patient wheeled out of the OT and bac k in again just for the sake of doing so. He explained that what is more important is that the anaesthetist takes as muc h time as is needed to 

assess the patient and advise her. [note: 318] Loc ation _per se_ is not determinative as regard must be had to the prac tic al realities of hospital administration, suc h as the best fit between the respec tive 

loc ations of the patient and the anaesthetist. [note: 319] 

168    For the reasons explained by Prof Sia, I find that his opinion meets the _Gunapathy_ test. I also find that sinc e Dr Tham had already begun the proc ess of obtaining informed c onsent on the night of 25 Oc tober 2006, the plaintiff would have had suffic ient time and opportunity to proc ess the relevant information. In the absenc e of any reason to think that the plaintiff’s c onsent was not truly informed, in partic ular sinc e she did not ask the defendant any questions about the GA proc edure, the defendant was not in breac h of his duty merely bec ause he performed the steps leading to the final c onfirmation of informed c onsent in the OT. It follows that the plaintiff’s informed c onsent was not vitiated by the c irc umstanc es in whic h it was taken. 

**_Decision: No breach of duty of care_** 

169    Having c onsidered the relevant evidenc e in totality, I am of the view that the plaintiff’s c onsent to GA was informed. Ac c ordingly, I find that the defendant had not breac hed his duty of c are to obtain the plaintiff’s informed c onsent. 

**_Decision: No causation even if there was breach of duty of care_** 

170    Even if the defendant had breac hed his duty of c are to obtain the plaintiff’s informed c onsent, the plaintiff’s c laim would still fail for want of c ausation. This is bec ause the plaintiff did not give any evidenc e to the effec t that she would have c hosen RA instead of GA if she was informed of the risk of nec k injury and/or the alternatives to GA. Instead, the plaintiff’s evidenc e was that she would have been c ontent for the anaesthetist to make the c hoic e of anaesthesia based on what was best for 

her. [note: 320] Sinc e it was established that GA was indeed the preferred option for her and she was not c ontra-indic ated for GA, c ausation is not made out. 


171    Ms Ho submitted that the plaintiff should still be entitled to a remedy in the interests of justic e even if the c ourt is inc lined to find that the defendant’s breac h of duty of c are did not direc tly result in the plaintiff’s injury. In this regard, the plaintiff relied on the c ase of _Chester_ (see [58] _supra_ ) in whic h the House of Lords modified the traditional approac h to c ausation. In _Chester_ , the neurosurgeon did not warn the patient of the risks of c auda equina syndrome (1–2%), whic h was an inherent risk of the operation. While the patient, if warned of the risk, would not have agreed to the operation there and then, she did not go so far as to say that she would never have c onsented to the surgery in the future. In holding that there was a suffic ient c ausal link between the failure to warn and the damage, the House of Lords held that the issue of c ausation has to be addressed by referenc e to the sc ope of the doc tor’s duty to advise his patient of the disadvantages or dangers of the proposed treatment. In partic ular, Lord Hope of Craighead rec ognised at [56] that the “but for” test is under-inc lusive and c onc luded (at [88]) that: 

 ... justic e requires that Miss Chester be afforded the remedy whic h she seeks, as the injury which she suffered at the hands of Mr Afshar was within the scope of the very risk which he should have warned her about when he was obtaining her c onsent to the operation whic h resulted in that injury. [emphasis added] 

172    In _D’Conceicao_ (see [61] _supra_ ), the plaintiff similarly relied on _Chester_ to establish c ausation. Tay J found that _Chester_ does not represent the law in Singapore (at [199]) as the basis of _Chester_ , _viz_ , autonomy within the meaning of the Human Rights Ac t, has no applic ation in Singapore (see [64] above). I agree, and also dec line to apply _Chester_. The effec t of _Chester_ is to found liability purely on the basis of a breac h of duty infringing the right of a plaintiff to c hoose for herself. This entirely sidesteps any enquiry of fac tual c ausation. I agree with Lord Hoffmann’s dissenting opinion in _Chester_ (at [31]) that the relevant question is “whether one would have taken the opportunity to avoid or reduc e the risk, not whether one would have c hanged the sc enario in some irrelevant detail”. Given that the plaintiff has not proven that she would not have had the GA proc edure, I find that the ordinary princ iples of tort law militate against my applying the rule in _Chester_ simply to vindic ate the plaintiff’s right of autonomy when there has been no provable damage c aused. 

173    I note further that even if _Chester_ does represent the law in Singapore, the princ iples on c ausation therein are not applic able to the present c ase as unlike the risk of c auda equina syndrome in _Chester_ whic h was “within the sc ope of the very risk whic h [the doc tor] should have warned [Miss Chester] about”, the risk of nec k injury in the present c ase is not one whic h a responsible body of medic al opinion would disc lose to an otherwise healthy patient as it is not a c ommonly known risk. 

**VIII. THE INTUBATION** 

**_The necessary preliminary factual findings to determine liability_** 

174    As mentioned earlier, the plaintiff’s c ase theory was that the defendant was in a rush and therefore negligent in the following aspec ts: 

 (a) he did not realise that the plaintiff was a diffic ult patient to intubate as he did not c arry out a pre-anaesthetic assessment on her to asc ertain her suitability for GA. The failure to antic ipate this diffic ulty meant that the defendant did not ensure that adjunc ts used to assist with diffic ult intubations were brought into the OT, and he was forc ed to intubate the plaintiff without these assisting adjunc ts; and 

 (b) he did not c arry out the pre-oxygenation proc ess adequately resulting in insuffic ient time to intubate the plaintiff before her oxygen saturation levels dipped dangerously low.

It was alleged that the defendant thus used exc essive forc e, hyperextending the plaintiff’s nec k and c ausing injury at the C4/C5 level of the ALL. 

175    I have already found in the prec eding sec tion that the defendant did perform a pre-anaesthetic assessment on the plaintiff and that the plaintiff failed to prove that this assessment was erroneous. The remaining issues of fac t that arise for my c onsideration are as follows: 

 (a) whether there was suffic ient pre-oxygenation c arried out; 

 (b) whether there was diffic ulty in intubation; and 

 (c ) whether there was otherwise any need to use exc essive forc e and/or to hyperextend the plaintiff’s nec k. 

_General explanation of the intubation process and the Vital Signs Report_ 

176    To understand the tec hnic alities of the nec essary findings of fac t to be made, it is useful to begin by explaining the intubation proc ess generally. For ease of understanding, Nurse Honrado’s detailed explanation of the intubation proc ess is set out in the table below (hereinafter referred to as “Table 1”). After establishing venous ac c ess by inserting an intravenous c annula into the patient’s left 

hand, the following steps are c arried out: [note: 321]

177    Before turning to c onsider the disputes of fac t, it is also useful to set out in tabular form 

(“Table 2” below) the relevant parameters in the plaintiff’s Vital Signs Report. [note: 322] Subsequent referenc es to the parameters will make use of the c orresponding symbols in the third c olumn of Table 2: 


 Ms Ho: 

## A: 

 Ms Ho: 

## A: 

_Whether there was sufficient pre-oxygenation_ 

(i) How does one determine if the pre-oxygenation given is suffic ient? 

178    Before I c an make a finding of fac t as to whether the plaintiff was in fac t suffic iently preoxygenated, it is nec essary to first address how suffic ienc y of pre-oxygenation is determined. The evidenc e on this sc ore was c onfused and c onfusing. Witnesses were often talking at c ross-purposes with Ms Ho. Ms Ho submitted that for a patient to be c onsidered suffic iently pre-oxygenated, it was c ruc ial for the inO 2 readings to reac h c lose to 100% and the etO 2 readings to reac h at least 90%. 

[note: 323] On behalf of the defendant, it was submitted, to the c ontrary, that suffic ient pre

oxygenation is reac hed where inO 2 readings reac h c lose to 100%, etO 2 readings reac h anything 

above 85%, and SpO 2 readings reac h c lose to 100%. 

179    Muc h of the dispute between the parties c entred on the signific anc e of the three parameters (inO 2 , SpO 2 and etO 2 ). As explained in Table 1 (at [176] above), the proc ess of pre-oxygenation 

starts with giving the patient 100%, or c lose to 100%, oxygen by dialling up the oxygen dial on the 

anaesthetic mac hine [note: 324] in order to inc rease the oxygen reserves of the patient before intubation. The key indic ator with regard to this step is the inO 2 (or inspired oxygen) reading. The 

plaintiff and defendant agreed that this reading should reac h as c lose to 100% as possible. This is to ensure that the patient is being given as c lose to 100% pure oxygen as possible. This would inc rease the reserves of oxygen in the patient’s blood so that she would have a suffic ient supply of oxygen 

during the intubation proc ess when she would be unable to breathe on her own. [note: 325] However, the inO 2 may not always reac h 100% bec ause, for example, the fac e mask may not be c ompletely 

airtight against the patient’s fac e, c onsequently allowing some dilution of oxygen. 

180    After c ric oid pressure is applied, a fast-ac ting musc le relaxant Suc c inylc holine is administered and c onsequently the patient will not be able to breathe on her own. This c an only be done when the patient has been suffic iently pre-oxygenated. It was a sourc e of some c onfusion whether the SpO 2 (the oxygen saturation of red blood c ells in the arterial blood) or the etO 2 (end-tidal oxygen or 

c onc entration of oxygen in the expired breath rec orded in parts per volume) readings would be the indic ator of suffic ient pre-oxygenation. The defendant suggested that the SpO 2 reading would be an 

important indic ator. He testified: 

 ... I’m talking about if you don’t reac h the three-minute mark, is there an issue for the patient? 

 An issue, sorry, in what sense? 

 Problems. Means the patient would not be at c lose to 100 saturation before the intubation proc ess. 

 While we are doing pre-oxygenation, we are also looking at the patient’s oxygen saturation [ie. SpO2]. If we are happy with the patient’s oxygen saturation, then the three minutes is c ompleted, is good enough. [note: 326] 

 [emphasis added] 

181    Ms Ho submitted that this was inc onsistent with the defendant’s expert, Prof Sia’s testimony to the effec t that etO 2 would be the indic ator of adequate pre-oxygenation. Prof Sia had testified: 


 Ms Ho:

 Court: 

 ... Whic h rec ordings do you look at in order to see whether there was pre-oxygenation of a patient? 

 ... 

 ... I’m asking is it in0 2 , et0 2 , Sp0 2. 

 Et0 2. 

## ... 

 To see whether there has been suffic ient pre-oxygenation, the anaesthetist would be looking at et0 2. Is that what you are saying? 

 Yes, your Honour. 

 And what numbers are you expec ting to see whic h show you suffic ient pre-oxygenation? 

 I would want to see a number of 85. 

 In the et0 2 , is that what you are saying? 

 Yes, your Honour. 

 ... 

 So this is no longer Sp0 2. 

 Yes, Your Honour. [note: 327] 

182    Ms Ho further submitted that this was internally inc onsistent with evidenc e that Prof Sia had earlier given: 

 ... SpO 2 is what we measure on the patient. That is the most important. If SpO 2 is 100 per c ent, it means the patient is well. ... 

 ... 

 You are saying oxygen going in is 100 per c ent and oxygen going out is 100 per c ent but, if I understand you c orrec tly, you are saying what is important is what is in the blood and that is SpO 2. 

 Yes, Your Honour. 

 ... 

 So in the instanc e of Sp0 2 , Your Honour – may I c ontinue. 

 Yes. 


 Prof Sia: 

 Prof Sia: 

 My prac tic e is I look at the Sp0 2 , if it’s 100 per c ent, I don’t write it down. I know it’s 100 per c ent and I would start the c ase. [note: 328] 

Prof Sia had also explained that the SpO 2 after pre-oxygenation may not reac h 100%: 

 ... In most people the SpO 2 will be around 97, 96, 97 per c ent, above 95. But with additional oxygen, with pre-oxygenation, that c ould potentially go up to 100. Not all the time of c ourse but it would go up by maybe one or two points. [note: 329] 

183    The plaintiff’s expert, Prof Delilkan, did not dispute this aspec t of Prof Sia’s evidenc e, but his 

c ontention was that the SpO 2 reading should have been rec orded on the Vital Signs Report. [note: 330] 

Neither did Prof Delilkan dispute Prof Sia’s evidenc e on the importanc e of the etO 2 reading other than 

to say that a number of 90% and above would be a better indic ation of suffic ient pre-oxygenation. 

184    I do not find that Prof Sia and the defendant’s statements were internally or externally inc onsistent as Ms Ho c laimed. Prof Sia and the defendant both agreed that the oxygen saturation in the blood, or SpO 2 , was an important reading during the entire proc ess leading up to intubation. The 

reason for this is c lear: the whole purpose of pre-oxygenation is to inc rease the oxygen saturation in the blood so that the plaintiff will have suffic ient reserves of oxygen to sustain her when 

Suc c inylc holine is administered. [note: 331] The SpO 2 reading thus c annot be ignored. When asked 

whether there would be an issue in terms of oxygen saturation ( _ie_ , SpO 2 readings being less than 

100%), the defendant replied that he _also_ looked at the SpO 2 readings. The import of both the 

defendant and Prof Sia’s testimonies is that there is no single determinant of the suc c ess of the preoxygenation proc ess, but the anaesthetist must keep an eye on all three readings, with different readings bec oming more or less important depending on the situation. This is not an inc onsistenc y whic h renders the defendant’s testimony unreliable. I find that it is perfec tly logic al for an anaesthetist to always be keeping an eye on the SpO 2 readings sinc e this is ultimately the reading 

that will matter during intubation. 

185    In this regard, I also note that it was put to the defendant that the patient’s pre-oxygenation saturation was “c lose to below 90 per c ent when [the defendant] first started [intubation]” and that he did not wait for 100% pre-oxygenation bec ause he was in a rush to have the surgery c ommenc e 

on time at 10am. [note: 332] The defendant disagreed, but agreed that if the SpO 2 reading fell below 

90%, the patient would be in a “life or death” situation. [note: 333] This assessment, _viz_ , that a reading of below 90% would indic ate that the patient was in c ritic al c ondition, was wholly c onsistent with Prof Sia’s evidenc e that an SpO 2 reading in a normal person _before_ undergoing pre-oxygenation 

would be 96% to 97%. The proc ess of pre-oxygenation, ac c ording to Prof Sia (and whic h ac c ount Prof Delilkan did not dispute), would inc rease the SpO 2 reading potentially to 100% or (if less) by one 

or two perc entage points. [note: 334] That being the c ase, how c ould the plaintiff’s SpO 2 reading have 

been at c lose to below 90% while she was being pre-oxygenated or even before pre-oxygenation? There was no evidenc e whatsoever that the plaintiff was in c ritic al c ondition even _before_ the defendant c ommenc ed intubation, and there is ac c ordingly no reason why the plaintiff’s SpO 2 reading 

should have been “c lose to below 90 per c ent” _during_ pre-oxygenation when her SpO 2 reading would 

have been in the 96% to 97% range _before_ pre-oxygenation. Ms Ho was c learly c onfused and the evidenc e elic ited by her questioning was misinterpreted in her submissions. 


186    During intubation, whic h oc c urs after the administration of Suc c inylc holine, the etO 2 and 

inO 2 readings would be irrelevant as the patient is not able to breathe on her own and would not be 

inhaling or exhaling any oxygen throughout this entire period. It is when the SpO 2 reading falls c lose 

to, or below, 90% _during intubation_ that the patient would be in a c ritic al “life or death situation”. [note: 335] It is thus also perfec tly logic al that an anaesthetist would c onsider it apposite to start 

intubation when SpO 2 readings are 100% or c lose to 100% (Prof Sia’s testimony). 

187    I ac c ept that the anaesthetic proc edure is a c omplex one, and a global assessment of the situation is what informs ac tual prac tic e. An anaesthetist may c hoose to foc us on SpO 2 in one 

situation and etO 2 in another, or to foc us on both at the same time. The fac t that there is no single 

indic ator of when pre-oxygenation is suffic ient does not mean that relianc e on one over the other, or on both, is inc onsistent. 

188    I further find that Prof Sia’s referenc e to using etO 2 as an indic ation of suffic ient pre

oxygenation is perfec tly logic al and c onsistent with the medic al literature adduc ed by both parties, and with the defendant’s testimony. 

189    The proc ess of pre-oxygenation is also known as denitrogenation. Ronald D Miller, _Miller’s Anesthesia_ (Elsevier Health Sc ienc es, 7th Ed, 2010) (“ _Miller’s Anesthesia_ ”), a textbook that both parties made referenc e to, states (at p 1577): 

 The princ ipal oxygen stores are in the lungs. These stores c an be inc reased by using a manoeuvre c alled “preoxygenation” ( also known as denitrogenation ), whic h is ac hieved by having the patient breath 100% oxygen from a c lose-fitting fac emask before induc tion of anesthesia. Several tec hniques of preoxygenation have been desc ribed, and the most effec tive tec hnique should be used. Deep breathing with a high fresh gas flow for 1-5 minutes and tidal breathing for 3 minutes are equally effec tive. [emphasis added] 

190    During c ross-examination, [note: 336] Ms Ho brought the defendant’s attention to the c hapter “Anesthesia for Obstetric s” in _Miller’s Anesthesia_ , and in partic ular, point 4, whic h states: 

 Denitrogenate with a high flow of oxygen for 3-5 minutes or 4 vital c apac ity breaths. [emphasis added] 

191    The longer time period of 3–5 (instead of 1–5) minutes is, as the defendant explained, [note: 337] due to: (a) a pregnant woman’s higher metabolic rate resulting in a higher oxygen c onsumption 

and faster oxygen de-saturation; and (b) the reduc tion in lung volume c aused by the swelling in the 

abdomen pushing the diaphragm upwards. [note: 338] The plaintiff did not dispute this explanation. Ms Ho’s main line of c ross-examination was that, as a matter of fac t, the defendant had only pre

oxygenated the plaintiff for one minute, instead of the rec ommended three. [note: 339] However, her c ase theory, as we shall see, depended on the doc umented time in the hospital’s PeriOperative Nursing Rec ord being ac c urate. 

192    During c ross-examination, [note: 340] Ms Ho also brought the defendant’s attention to Issam 

Tanoubi _et al_ “Optimizing Preoxygenation in Adults” Can J Anaesth 2009; 56: 449–466. [note: 341] By way of c larific ation, I asked the defendant if this artic le indic ated that the purpose of pre

oxygenation is “to replac e the nitrogen in the lungs with oxygen”. He replied in the affirmative. [note: 


342] 

193    It is immediately obvious from this c harac terisation of pre-oxygenation as denitrogenation that another way of approac hing the suffic ienc y of pre-oxygenation is by measuring how muc h nitrogen has been dispelled from the patient’s lungs and, c orrespondingly, how muc h oxygen has now gone to replac e the nitrogen. This measure c an only be reac hed by looking at the etO 2 reading, as this would 

measure how muc h oxygen has ac tually replac ed the nitrogen. The inO 2 reading would be insuffic ient 

for this purpose as it only measures the c onc entration of oxygen inspired by the patient. [note: 343] In 

this c ontext, it should be noted, as both Prof Sia [note: 344] and the defendant [note: 345] testified, that the air expired would c ontain less oxygen than what was inspired as some oxygen would have already been extrac ted by the body for utilisation and the etO 2 reading would thus be lower than the 

inO 2 reading. How muc h “de-nitrogenisation” has ac tually oc c urred would thus best be assessed by 

looking at the etO 2 reading. Prof Sia testified: 

 Your question earlier Your Honour, was that – if I got it c orrec tly – is that should it have been 100 bec ause of the proc ess of pre-oxygenation. The answer to that question is it’s not easy to get 100 on the end-tidal 0 2. Most people would aim for about above 85. That would have been taken as almost like the gold standard for pre-oxygenation, the end-tidal 0 2. [note: 346] 

194    Prof Delilkan disputed this by saying that he would prefer a reading of above 90%. However, in c ontrast to Prof Sia, Prof Delilkan did not provide any basis for his opinion, nor did he provide any rebuttal of Prof Sia’s explanation for why the etO 2 reading would be lower than the inO 2 reading. I also 

note that Prof Delilkan’s evidenc e on this sc ore was c onfused. In that same c onnec tion, he opined 

that the _plaintiff’s_ reading of 67% expired oxygen was not a good point to start intubation: [note: 347] 

 Prof Delilkan: Bec ause as I think Prof Sia mentioned, the aim should be to c ome to at least 85 and I think it has been pointed out that you want it to be at least towards 90. I think that would be a better assessment to start off the anaesthetic with the oxygenation c oming up to already 90, whic h is a safer level to start and give your drugs and tube. But if you start and ac c ept 67, I think it’s not a good point to start, the oxygenation is not enough, had been provided by the preoxygenation. 

 ... 

 Prof Sia: Your Honour, I have a different take on this. The readings at 10.05 for the et0 2 as well as in0 2 , as I said earlier, would be the ones after intubation. So these readings are not reflec tive of the in0 2 and the et0 2 at the time of pre-oxygenation whic h should have taken plac e prior to 10.05. [note: 348] 

Prof Delilkan later bec ame c onfused (perhaps by Ms Ho’s question): 

 Ms Ho: Prof Delilkan, if I say saturation of the oxygen in the lungs, is it SpO 2 or etO 2? 

 Prof Delilkan: If I use the term “oxygen saturation”, it obviously means oxygen saturation in the lungs whic h then transfers to the blood. 

 Ms Ho: Yes. So when I say “saturation”, what is the saturation of the oxygen in the lungs? 


 Prof Sia: 

 Prof Sia: 

 Prof Delilkan: That is a figure of oxygen saturation whic h is in the lungs at the terminal end of the breathing passages in the lungs at the alveoli level and that will reflec t what the oxygen saturation will be. [note: 349] 

This did not make sense as the oxygen in the lungs is measured by parts per volume and not as a func tion of saturation. Prof Sia c orrec ted him as follows: 

 I c ompletely disagree. When you talk about etO 2 , you are talking about end-tidal c onc entration of oxygen. And saturation of oxygen is – well, in this respec t we are talking about the SpO 2 whic h is the oxygen saturation of the arterial blood. [note: 350] 

As Prof Sia had earlier stated: 

 In the lungs, Your Honour, we don’t talk about oxygen saturation per se , we talk about oxygen c onc entration. [note: 351] 

I was thus not able to put muc h weight on Prof Delilkan’s evidenc e and c onsider Prof Sia’s and the defendant’s evidenc e c ogent and believable on a balanc e of probabilities. 

195    In sum, I ac c ept the evidenc e of both the defendant and Prof Sia that the following parameters will indic ate that a patient is suffic iently pre-oxygenated: 

 (a) inO 2 reading of a figure very c lose to 100%; 

 (b) etO 2 reading of anything above 85%; and 

 (c ) SpO 2 reading of a figure very c lose to 100%. 

It bears noting that despite the dispute over the evidenc e, what Ms Ho was endeavouring to establish was that the time the defendant took for pre-oxygenation was only one minute and not so muc h whether SpO 2 , inO 2 or etO 2 was the best indic ator. 

(ii) Was the plaintiff in fac t suffic iently pre-oxygenated? 

196    Having c larified the threshold issue of how suffic ient pre-oxygenation should be established, I now turn to c onsider whether the plaintiff was, as a matter of fac t, suffic iently pre-oxygenated. The plaintiff’s c ase was that Steps 1 to 6 of Table 1 (at [176] above) started at about 9.59am and was c ompleted just after 10am suc h that the baby was delivered by 10.06am. Her c ase was that the intubation proc ess was c ompleted so quic kly bec ause the defendant did not pre-oxygenate her suffic iently and therefore had to rush the proc ess. In this regard, the plaintiff relied on the fac t that 

the Vital Signs Report [note: 352] (see Table 2 at [177] above) did not rec ord any baseline readings of inO 2 , etO 2 and SpO 2 in the range of 100% whic h would have indic ated that the plaintiff was 

suffic iently pre-oxygenated. 

197    The defendant, on the other hand, asserted that he had suffic iently pre-oxygenated the plaintiff. His position was that: (a) pre-oxygenation ( _ie_ , Step 1 of Table 1) started just after 10am and ended at around 10.03am; and (b) the entire intubation proc ess ( _ie_ , Step 6 of Table 1) ended just before 10.05am. He explained that the relevant baseline readings were not rec orded in the Vital Signs Report bec ause of the way the Vital Signs Monitor works. The readings of the various 


parameters are always _displayed_ in real-time on the Vital Signs Monitor and the anaesthetic mac hine. [note: 353] However, under the default setting of the Vital Signs Monitor, only the readings at fixed 

five-minute intervals (hereinafter referred to as “the Vital Signs Trend”) are _recorded_. The hard c opy of the Vital Signs Report, whic h c ontains the Vital Signs Trend, is printed out from the Vital Signs 

Monitor only _after_ the end of the operation by the anaesthetic nurse. [note: 354] Although the Vital Signs Trend c an be assessed during the operation by entering some c ommands into the Vital Signs 

Monitor, [note: 355] it c annot be viewed at the same time as the real-time readings. [note: 356] The defendant’s explanation was that he had, at the material time, rec eived real-time visual c onfirmation 

that the inO 2 reading was c lose to 100. [note: 357] While he agreed that it would have been ideal if 

that figure was c aptured in the Vital Signs Trend (and c onsequently also the printed Vital Signs Report), he did not think to ensure that it was indeed c aptured as he did not antic ipate having to 

fac e a legal matter. [note: 358] The defendant’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Sia, also took the position 

that a visual c onfirmation would suffic e for him to proc eed with the intubation. [note: 359] 

198    In c oming to his position that pre-oxygenation started just after 10am, the defendant relied on the fac t that the inO 2 reading was 21% ( _ie_ , the c onc entration of oxygen in room air) at 9.55am and 

10am, and 67% at 10.05am. The defendant’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Sia, agreed with the defendant’s position by relying on the fac t that the etO 2 reading was 21% ( _ie_ , the c onc entration of 

oxygen in room air) at 9.55am and 10am, but reac hed 62% at 10.05am. 

199    As for the defendant’s position that: (a) pre-oxygenation was c ompleted at around 10.03am; and (b) the entire intubation proc ess was c ompleted just before 10.05am, the defendant relied on the following inferenc es drawn from the Vital Signs Report: 

 (a) First, the etCO 2 reading was 0% before 10.05am and 29% at 10.05am. This suggests that the intubation proc ess was c ompleted by 10.05am in order that the c arbon dioxide in the expired breath would be detec ted in the anaesthetic c irc uit. 

 (b) Next, the etN 2 O (end-tidal nitrous oxide) and inN 2 O (inspired nitrous oxide) readings were both 0% before 10.05am, but 19% and 25% respec tively at 10.05am. Sinc e nitrous oxide would have been introduc ed into the c irc uit only after intubation is c ompleted, and the total volume of gases in the c irc uit is fixed, the inO 2 and etO 2 readings just before 10.05am would have been higher than what they were at 10.05am. 

 (c ) Third, there was a signific ant drop in the plaintiff’s heart rate and blood pressure between 10.10am and 10.15am (see rows 1, 3 and 4 of Table 2 at [177] above). This implied that the plaintiff’s baby was delivered sometime between 10.10am and 10.15am (and not 10.06am as rec orded in the Infant Examination rec ords). [note: 360] The defendant’s estimate of the delivery time is also more c onsistent with Dr Tham’s evidenc e that he usually takes six to ten minutes to deliver a baby in a normal LSCS. [note: 361] 

200    The defendant also explained that the plaintiff’s SpO 2 readings at 9.55am and 10am had a “?” 

sign instead of a numeric al figure (see Table 2 at [177] above) bec ause the monitoring probe whic h would have been attac hed onto the plaintiff’s finger might have been removed to fac ilitate the 

insertion of the c annula into the plaintiff’s hand before the start of pre-oxygenation. [note: 362] Although the SpO 2 readings were not c aptured at 9.55am and 10am, the fac t that the SpO 2 reading 

was a full 100% at 10.05am makes it very unlikely that anything untoward had happened to the 


plaintiff before 10.05am, inc luding the possibility of insuffic ient pre-oxygenation. [note: 363] This reading would have been c aptured _after_ intubation. The oxygen input would have resumed, but at a lower level than the 100% required for pre-oxygenation. The vital signs monitor indic ated that inO 2 was at 67%, while etO 2 was at 62%. This is bec ause after intubation nitrous oxide would have 

been introduc ed into the c irc uit thereby reduc ing the oxygen c onc entration (see Prof Sia’s evidenc e [note: 364] ). It was undisputed that inO 2 should be c lose to 100% and needs to be administered for at 

least three minutes in order to ac hieve the average 1% to 2% inc rease in SpO 2 required for the 

intubation proc ess (see [179] and [185] above). It is thus highly improbable that the SpO 2 reading 

would have _increased_ so rapidly to 100% after intubation when administration of oxygen had just been resumed at a muc h lower c onc entration than that required for pre-oxygenation. Instead, it is more likely than not that the SpO 2 reading was at 100% during intubation and _prior_ to the time the 

10\.05am reading was c aptured on the vital signs monitor. 

201    The plaintiff and the defendant’s respec tive c ase theories with respec t to the Vital Signs Report were put to the anaesthetic experts for validation. The defendant’s expert, Prof Sia, agreed 

that the defendant’s c ase theory is c onsistent with the Vital Signs Report. [note: 365] He was of the view that the Vital Signs Report showed that the plaintiff was suffic iently pre-oxygenated, although he c onc eded that he was unable to tell exac tly how long the pre-oxygenation was c arried out for. [note: 366] Prof Sia was also of the view that the plaintiff’s c ase theory was not borne out by the Vital 

Signs Report. [note: 367] The plaintiff’s expert, Prof Delilkan, agreed that the defendant’s c ase theory 

was possible based on the Vital Signs Rec ord. [note: 368] However, Prof Delilkan was of the opinion that the plaintiff’s c ase theory was also possible bec ause there was no data showing the plaintiff’s 

SpO 2 reading before 10.05am in order to make a c omparison with the 10.05am reading. [note: 369] 

202    Having c onsidered the evidenc e before me, I ac c ept the defendant’s c ase theory on this issue for the following reasons. First, Prof Delilkan had not been able to suffic iently explain how the Vital Signs Report readings showed that the plaintiff had not been suffic iently pre-oxygenated. It bears reiterating that Prof Delilkan had expressly agreed that the various inferenc es drawn by the defendant and Prof Sia were valid. Furthermore, apart from the mere relianc e on the missing SpO 2 readings at 

9\.55am and 10am, Prof Delilkan was not able to point to any other inferenc e that c ould be drawn from the Vital Signs Report to prove that there was insuffic ient pre-oxygenation. In short, the plaintiff’s c ase fell apart when the other readings in the Vital Signs Report were taken into ac c ount. 

203    I should also mention that I am not c onvinc ed on a balanc e of probabilities that the defendant, an anaesthetist of 25 years’ experienc e at the time of the LSCS, would have failed to suffic iently preoxygenate the plaintiff. This is espec ially sinc e the importanc e of pre-oxygenation is something 

ingrained in all spec ialists. [note: 370] Moreover, the plaintiff’s LSCS was, to all intents and purposes, still an elec tive surgery for whic h there was no need for the defendant to rush this vital step and risk a “life or death” situation oc c urring just for the sake of having the surgery start prec isely on time. It also bears noting that Dr Tham, who was c alled as a witness for the plaintiff and who had previously worked c losely with the defendant, testified during c ross-examination that the defendant was always 

c ompetent and responsible. [note: 371] 

204    Lastly, I should also mention that I am aware of the fac t that based on Nurse Honrado’s estimate, Steps 1 to 6 of the intubation proc ess c ould have taken slightly more than five minutes (see Table 1 at [176] above). This is slightly more time than the defendant’s c ase theory that the entire proc ess took slightly less than five minutes. I am of the view that this slight differenc e c an be safely disregarded sinc e Nurse Honrado was only giving general estimates during c ross-examination. 


## Q: 

## A: 

## Q: 

## A: 

Further, the fac t that pre-oxygenation and intubation was c ompleted swiftly in less than five minutes would support the defendant’s assertion that the intubation proc ess had ac tually been a smooth one. 

205    For these reasons, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove on a balanc e of probabilities that the defendant did not c arry out suffic ient pre-oxygenation on her. 

_Whether there was actual difficulty encountered during intubation_ 

206    The next c ruc ial finding of fac t is whether the defendant had in fac t enc ountered diffic ulty intubating the plaintiff. The plaintiff c laimed that there was ac tual diffic ulty enc ountered during the intubation proc ess, whic h the defendant denied. 

207    The defendant pointed out that the plaintiff’s Cormac k and Lehane sc ore was rec orded as “2” 

in the Anaesthetic Rec ord. [note: 372] The Cormac k and Lehane sc oring is done based on the view of 

the epiglottis and the opening of the trac hea as it is _actually_ seen during laryngosc opy. [note: 373] 

The Cormac k and Lehane sc ore is graded on the sc ale of 1 to 4. [note: 374] A lower sc ore reflec ts that 

the intubation was an easy one and the c onverse is also true. [note: 375] The Cormac k and Lehane sc ore is different from the Mallampati sc ore – the former measures diffic ulty _during_ the intubation whereas the latter is a mere _predictive_ tool to assess the antic ipated diffic ulty of intubation _before_ it oc c urs. Sinc e the Cormac k and Lehane sc ore is the only referenc e material for what happened during intubation _and_ the defendant had rec orded the plaintiff’s Cormac k and Lehane sc ore as “2”, it c an be inferred that the intubation had proc eeded without diffic ulty. 

208    Furthermore, there is no indic ation on the fac e of the relevant medic al rec ords that the defendant had experienc ed diffic ulty during the intubation proc ess. The plaintiff’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Delilkan, had initially suggested that the defendant’s presc ription of Voltaren (as evidenc ed in the 

Inpatient Medic ation Rec ord [note: 376] ) c ould be interpreted to mean that the defendant had antic ipated that the plaintiff would have “nerve interferenc e pain (swelling following exc essive nec k 

manoeuvres during airway management)”. [note: 377] However, at trial, Prof Delilkan c onc eded that 

Voltaren is ac tually frequently used as part of the normal analgesia regime for LSCS. [note: 378] 

209    It is also signific ant to note that the defendant did not use assistive adjunc ts suc h as the stylet and the bougie, whic h were readily available to him in the event of a diffic ult intubation. The plaintiff’s bare assertion that the defendant did not have these adjunc ts readily available in the OT is implausible. This aspec t of the plaintiff’s c ase was based wholly on the defendant’s testimony in relation to the diffic ult-intubation c art: 

 Can I just understand why there is no c hec k for the fifth point, “diffic ult-intubation c art available”? 

 The diffic ult-intubation c art is available in the main c orridor outside the operating room, just outside the door of the operating room. And the intubation c art is only brought in if the anaesthetist requests for it in antic ipation of a diffic ult intubation. It is not routinely put inside the operating room at the beginning of every c ase. 

 Can I understand the adjunc ts that are used for diffic ult intubation. Are they on this c art? 

 Yes.

 This c art I think you said is not routinely put in the OR at the beginning of every c ase? 

 Yes. 

 You said it is put at the main c orridor just outside the door of the OR? 

 Yes. [note: 379] 

210    However, the above exc hange must be read in light of the defendant’s subsequent c larific ation when he was c ross-examined on the issue of the c hec king of the anaesthetic equipment: 

 Your ac c ount presupposes that you would be there early enough to tell her what size of tube you want based upon whic h she then c uts -

 All these tubes are kept on the anaesthetic trolley. There’s a trolley with this endotrac heal tube, some fac e masks, airways, laryngosc opes, there’s a bougie and a stylet in an anaesthetic trolley, a standard anaesthetic trolley and this is available in every operating room sitting next to the anaesthetic mac hine. So when the anaesthetist c omes into the operating room, he will just tell the nurse, “I want for example a size 7 tube, c ut to 24 c m”. So she would do that. 

 ... 

 Just one or two points. You have just said that the anaesthetic tray, I don’t know what you c all it, will have the bougie and the stylet. 

 Yes. 

 But I remember just now earlier on in evidenc e -unless I’m mistaken -you said it was outside the operating room. 

 No, the one outside the operating room refers to the diffic ult-intubation trolley whic h has a lot of other adjunc ts like different types of laryngosc ope with different types of blades, intubating laryngeal masks, et cetera , all these other adjunc ts. Of all the diffic ult-intubation aids, the stylet and the bougie are standard equipment whic h is found on every anaesthetic trolley in every anaesthetic room. I’m sorry if I gave the wrong impression. 

 I thought you meant otherwise and I was puzzling over this, wondering what if there were two operations in proc ess and some other doc tor had already taken -some other anaesthetist had already taken the bougie and then your nurse c ame out to look for one and c ouldn’t find it. I was thinking that was unworkable. So every tray would have it. 

 Would have at least one bougie and stylet and stylets of various sizes as well. [note: 380] 

211    It is c lear to me that the bougie and stylet were readily available in the OT to assist the defendant in the event of a diffic ult intubation, but he did not use it in the plaintiff’s c ase. This is signific ant in two ways. First, it c orroborates the defendant’s c laim that the intubation was a smooth one. Sec ond, it shows that even if the defendant had enc ountered a diffic ulty during intubation, he c ould have used the adjunc ts to overc ome it. While it is still _possible_ that the defendant c ould have disregarded the adjunc ts and proc eeded to use exc essive forc e and/or hyperextended the plaintiff’s nec k, it is not _probable_ that an anaesthetist with 25 years’ experienc e would c hoose to ignore useful 


tools that were readily available if he did in fac t enc ounter diffic ulty during intubation just for the sake of having the surgery start on time. Ac c ordingly, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove on a balanc e of probabilities that the defendant had ac tually enc ountered diffic ulty during the intubation proc ess. 

_Whether there was otherwise any need to use excessive force and/or to hyperextend the plaintiff’s neck_ 

212    Lastly, I turn to c onsider the initial plac ement of the plaintiff’s head and nec k at the start of the intubation proc ess, as this bears on whether there was any need for the defendant to use exc essive forc e and/or to hyperextend the plaintiff’s nec k during the intubation proc ess. The defendant’s evidenc e was that he had plac ed the plaintiff’s head in the neutral position at the start of the intubation proc ess. The term “neutral position” refers to the position of the nec k and head lying normally on a pillow, in whic h position the head would have been slightly extended ( _ie_ , bent bac kwards), and the nec k would have been slightly flexed ( _ie_ , bent forwards), bec ause of the natural 

c urve in the c ervic al spine. [note: 381] 

213    Ac c ording to the plaintiff’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Delilkan, the plaintiff’s head and nec k 

should have been plac ed in the “sniffing the morning air” position, and not the neutral position. [note: 382] I should mention at the outset that although the stric t definition of the term “sniffing the morning 

air position” refers to the position where a patient’s head is extended at an angle of 35 degrees and 

the nec k is flexed at an angle of 15 degrees, [note: 383] Prof Delilkan took the term to desc ribe the 

position where the head is extended to the maximum possible. [note: 384] Prof Delilkan was of the opinion that his definition of the “sniffing the morning air” position ( _ie_ , head extended to the maximum) would have been the optimal position to begin with bec ause this position would ensure that the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes were aligned in suc h a way as to provide the best view of the larynx. Ac c ording to Prof Delilkan, the need to start with (his definition of ) the “sniffing the morning air” position is even more pressing for obstetric patients bec ause their tendenc y to have fluid retention inc reases the likelihood of diffic ult intubation. Sinc e the plaintiff’s head should have been extended to the maximum at the beginning, any diffic ulty in intubation would have required exc essive forc e and/or hyperextension of the plaintiff’s nec k. 

214    The defendant’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Sia, agreed that the “sniffing the morning air” position gave the best view of the larynx. He, however, disagreed that suc h a position was nec essarily the optimal starting position. Ac c ording to Prof Sia, the neutral position is the optimal one, espec ially for an experienc ed anaesthetist, as it provides the anaesthetist with a good view of the larynx without having to move the patient’s nec k too muc h. His reasoning is that “bec ause anaesthesia is not direc tly therapeutic ... [he] would want to use the least forc e to ac c omplish the greatest effec t”. [note: 385] 

215    Prof Sia’s evidenc e on this issue is signific ant in two ways. First, sinc e there is medic al opinion, defensible in logic , that starting off in the neutral position is regarded as an ac c eptable prac tic e, the defendant c annot be said to have been in breac h of his duty of c are in this regard. Sec ond, sinc e the defendant had started off in the neutral position (as opposed to Prof Delilkan’s “sniffing the morning air” position in whic h the head would have already been extended to the maximum) the likelihood of the defendant having used exc essive forc e and/or hyperextended the plaintiff’s nec k is low even if there were diffic ulties enc ountered during intubation. Furthermore, as pointed out by the defendant, an anaesthetist who enc ounters diffic ulty during intubation would have further flexed the patient’s nec k instead of extending it, in an effort to better align the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes so as 


to get a better view of the larynx. [note: 386] Prof Sia agreed. [note: 387] 

216    I should also mention that even though the defendant had mentioned in his AEIC that he did not “flex, extend, tilt, or in any way manipulate the plaintiff’s nec k while c arrying out the GA 

proc edure”, [note: 388] I ac c ept his oral c larific ation that what he meant was that he did not _further_ flex, extend, tilt or in any way manipulate the plaintiff’s nec k beyond what was required for 

intubation. [note: 389] 

**_Res ipsa loquitur_** 

217    The last plank to the plaintiff’s argument was that the princ iple of _res ipsa loquitur_ applies to shift the burden of proving reasonable c are to the defendant. I use the word “princ iple” instead of “doc trine” as I c onc ur with the views of Megaw LJ in _Lloyde v West Midlands Gas Board_ [1971] 1 WLR 749, where he opined (at 755): 

 I doubt whether it is right to desc ribe res ipsa loquitur as a “doc trine.” I think that it is no more that an exotic , although c onvenient, phrase to desc ribe what is in essenc e no more than a common sense approach , not limited by tec hnic al rules, to the assessment of the effect of evidence in certain circumstances. It means that a plaintiff prima fac ie establishes negligenc e where: (i) it is not possible for him to prove prec isely what was the relevant ac t or omission whic h set in train the events leading to the ac c ident; but (ii) on the evidenc e as it stands at the relevant time it is more likely than not that the effec tive c ause of the ac c ident was some ac t or omission of the defendant or of someone for whom the defendant is responsible, whic h ac t or omission c onstitutes a failure to take proper c are for the plaintiff's safety. [emphasis added] 

218    The princ iple of _res ipsa loquitur_ is c ommonly said to apply where the evidenc e “speaks for itself”. What is meant by the phrase “the evidenc e speaks for itself” is that a _prima facie_ c ase of negligenc e, if established, is suffic ient to disc harge the plaintiff’s burden of proof. The plaintiff must still establish, or prove, what this c ase of negligenc e is; _res ipsa loquitur_ may not be used to subvert the ordinary rules of proof. It falls to the plaintiff to prove negligenc e by leading evidenc e of some oc c urrenc e whic h, in the ordinary c ourse of things, is _more likely than not_ to have been c aused by negligenc e: see _Teng Ah Kow v Ho Sek Chiu_ [1993] 3 SLR(R) 43 at [22]. 

2       1 9 _Res ipsa loquitur_ applies where (see _Scott v The London and St Katherine Docks Company_ (1865) 3 H&C 596, quoted with approval in _Zweite MS “Philippa Schulte” Shipping GmbH & Co KG v PSA Corporation Ltd_ [2012] SGHC 135 at [159]): 

 (a) the oc c urrenc e would not have happened without negligenc e; 

 (b) the thing whic h inflic ted the damage was under the sole management and c ontrol of the defendant; and 

 (c ) there must be no evidenc e as to why or how the oc c urrenc e took plac e. 

220    The plaintiff’s c ase simply does not meet the c umulative three-stage test for the applic ation of _res ipsa loquitur_. The plaintiff relied on _res ipsa loquitur_ to prove her c ase for her. This was, however, a wholly inappropriate use of _res ipsa loquitur_. The oc c urrenc e whic h, by its very nature, suggests negligenc e on the part of the defendant was, ac c ording to the plaintiff, the nec k injury itself. The plaintiff argued that bec ause the nec k injury was so unusual and manifested itself only after the LSCS, it must have been c aused by the defendant’s negligenc e during intubation. This is a leap of logic and mistakes limited c irc umstantial evidenc e for a _prima facie_ c ase suffic ient to shift the burden

of proof to the defendant. The plaintiff has not shown that the nec k injury would not have happened without negligenc e (see [174]–[216] above). The first limb of the c umulative three-stage test is not fulfilled. 

221    The third limb is also not fulfilled. _Res ipsa loquitur_ is inapplic able where there is evidenc e on c ausation: see also _Tesa Tape Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Wing Seng Logistics Pte Ltd_ [2006] 3 SLR(R) 116 (at [21]). In the present c ase, there was ample evidenc e by both parties, the subjec t of 39 days of trial, as to why and how the nec k injury _might have_ taken plac e. 

2       2 2 _Mahon v Osborne_ [1939] 2 KB 14 (“ _Mahon_ ”), whic h the plaintiff relied on, does nothing to advanc e her c ase. In _Mahon_ , a c otton swab was left in the patient’s body at the end of an abdominal operation with the result that the patient died three months later. It was undisputed that the defendant had left the c otton swab in the patient’s body _and_ that his doing so was improper. The c ourt, by a majority of two to one, reasoned that the ac t of leaving the c otton swab in the patient’s body c alled for an explanation from the defendant and _res ipsa loquitur_ thus applied. This is c learly distinguishable from the present c ase whic h c ontains signific ant fac tual disputes. The doc trine of _res ipsa loquitur_ c annot be applied where there is signific ant dispute over the fac ts. Given that I have also found that the intubation was not improperly done, it would be perverse to use _res ipsa loquitur_ to c ontradic t that finding. 

223    For the reasons given above, I find that the plaintiff’s argument on _res ipsa loquitur_ is a nonstarter and does not affec t the analysis in the rest of this judgment. 

**_Decision: No breach of duty of care_** 

224    Having made the nec essary preliminary fac tual findings, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove that the defendant had c onduc ted the intubation proc ess in a manner whic h is not ac c epted as proper by a responsible body of medic al men. Even if the defendant had used exc essive forc e and/or hyperextended the plaintiff’s nec k (whic h I have not found), Prof Delilkan’s evidenc e is fatal to the plaintiff’s c ase sinc e he testified that even use of “tremendous forc e” was ac c eptable prac tic e: 

 ... In your testimony just now, you desc ribed what you would do when there is a diffic ulty in intubation. Remember you used the language like they are opposing movements, you push, I lift, two manoeuvres, tug of war and tremendous force. You remember that portion where you desc ribed what you do? 

 Yes. 

 Would I be c orrec t to assume that what you have desc ribed is something that is an appropriate manner to c onduc t laryngosc opy and intubation? 

 In a situation where it bec omes diffic ult intubation. 

 Yes. So the answer is a yes, right? 

 Yes. 

 Bec ause I started with in a diffic ult – 

 I said yes without speaking it loudly. Yes, in a diffic ult intubation situation. 


 Mr Lek: 

 Prof Delilkan: 

 So you would consider this to be a proper standard of care type of conducting a laryngoscopy and intubation, right? 

 Yes. [note: 390] 

 [emphasis added] 

**_Direct causation_** 

225    Even if the defendant had breac hed his duty of c are (whic h I have not found), the plaintiff’s c ase would still fail for lac k of c ausation. I will first set out the c ase theory of the plaintiff’s orthopaedic expert, Dr Singh, as well as my c omments on his theory. I will then set out the c ase theory of the defendant’s orthopaedic expert, Dr Li, as well as my c omments on his theory. Thereafter, I will explain why I find Dr Singh’s c ase theory to be untenable and why Dr Li’s c ase theory is made out on the evidenc e. 

_Dr Singh’s case theory_ 

226    Dr Singh’s c ase theory as to the biomec hanic s of the plaintiff’s injury evolved during the c ourse of the proc eedings and bears setting out in some detail. 

227    In brief, the main points of Dr Singh’s initial c ase theory as gleaned from his AEIC were as follows: (a) the kyphosis (reversal of the natural c urvature of the c ervic al spine) at C4/C5 indic ated 

injury to the c ervic al spine at that level; [note: 391] (b) the injury was to the C4/C5 disc ; [note: 392] 

and (c ) the mec hanism of the injury was of a “whiplash”-like mec hanism. [note: 393] For ease of referenc e, I shall refer to this c ase theory as the “Initial C4/C5 Disc Injury Theory”. 

228    During the first day of his oral evidenc e in c ourt, Dr Singh c onc eded that it would be inac c urate to say that as a general statement, a kyphosis at C4/C5 means that there was trauma suffered at 

that region. [note: 394] Dr Singh explained that his statement applied spec ific ally to the plaintiff. [note: 395] Dr Singh also said that there was a failing in the tension of the ALL at the C4/C5 level whic h 

subsequently started a c hain of events. [note: 396] For ease of referenc e, I shall refer to this as the “ALL Injury Theory”. He c laimed that para 15 of his report where he said that “the mec hanism of 

injury to the C4/C5 disc ... was of a ‘whiplash’-like mec hanism” was inac c urately stated. [note: 397] Rather, what he meant to say was that the instantaneous and primary effec t of the trauma was the ALL giving way, whic h only subsequently c aused injury to the disc. It bears noting that the idea of the ALL giving way as the primary effec t was not stated in Dr Singh’s report. 

229    Nearing the end of the first day of his testimony, Dr Singh first mentioned that there was a 

fulc rum at C4, and that the start of the trac hea was loc ated near C4. [note: 398] His interpretation was that there had been some forc e with the fulc rum applied at C4/C5 whic h c orresponds to where a 

laryngosc ope is inserted. [note: 399] When Mr Lek pointed out that the start of the trac hea was loc ated at C5/C6 and not C4/C5, Dr Singh responded that he agreed, but the fulc rum is applied higher up. When c hallenged on the artic le entitled “Cervic al Spine Motion with Direc t Laryngosc opy and 

Orotrac heal Intubation” Anaesthesiology 1996; 85(1): 26–36 [note: 400] whic h c onc luded that the vast majority of motion produc ed during intubation is experienc ed at C0 to C2, Dr Singh said that “the 

fulc rum had moved from C0/C1 to C3/C4”. [note: 401] In fairness to Dr Singh, in this instanc e, the referenc e to C3/C4 instead of C4/C5 was probably an innoc ent slip of the tongue as he had in all 


other situations maintained that C4/C5 was the fulc rum, not C3/C4. Dr Singh also said that the 

movement of the fulc rum was an “abnormality”. [note: 402] For ease of referenc e, I shall refer to this c ase theory as the “Shift In Fulc rum Theory”. 

230    The Shift In Fulc rum Theory subsequently evolved when Dr Singh returned to the stand to give c onc urrent evidenc e together with Dr Li. Dr Singh said that even though a fulc rum would also have been c reated at C4/C5 regardless of whether there was c ric oid pressure, c ric oid pressure aggravated 

it. [note: 403] Ac c ording to him, he did not disc uss c ric oid pressure in his report or in his earlier testimony bec ause it only c ame about in “a disc ussion” afterwards and he thought that he had 

already given an adequate explanation. [note: 404] In the joint statement given by the orthopaedic 

experts, [note: 405] Dr Singh stated that the left and upward forc e applied at around the C2 to C4 region during laryngosc opy, together with the presenc e of c ric oid pressure applied at C5/C6, c aused 

“a stress rising at the level of C4/C5”. [note: 406] In other words, the opposing forc es ( _ie_ , the c ric oid pressure and the laryngosc opy) gave rise to a resultant forc e whic h c aused the shearing injury at the 

point of fulc rum. [note: 407] For ease of referenc e, I shall refer to this theory as the “Resultant Forc es About the Fulc rum Theory”. 

_The court’s comments on Dr Singh’s case theory_ 

231    It is not unac c eptable for witnesses to supplement or c larify their evidenc e as the need arises. However, in the present c ase, the substantial shifts in Dr Singh’s theory, both in form and in substanc e, make it diffic ult to ac c ept that the different elements of his theory were mere c larific ations. Be that as it may, the final version of Dr Singh’s theory, _ie_ , The Resultant Forc es About the Fulc rum Theory, suffers from many defic ienc ies. I will address eac h c omponent of the Resultant Forc es About the Fulc rum Theory in turn. 

Hyperextension/extension 

232    I c onsider first the issue of whether hyperextension was nec essary for the tension forc e that allegedly c aused an injury to the ALL at the C4/C5 level. Question 6 of the orthopaedic s’ joint statement asked if “the plaintiff [suffered] an [ALL] injury c aused by trauma”. Dr Singh answered: 

 Yes. The Plaintiff had nec k strain/injury during the LSCS on 26 Oc t 2006. The Plaintiff’s nec k strain/injury is c aused by trauma; ( tension force in the anterior c ervic al spine at the levels of the C4/5 disc ) whic h injured the anterior longitudinal ligament (“ALL”) at the C4/5 levels of the c ervic al spine. This tension forc e was c aused by 

 a. Hyperextension of the Plaintiff’s neck during the intubation proc ess; 

 b. This may oc c ur as a result of the upward lifting motion (at around the C2/3 and C3/4, levels) during the laryngosc opy; 

 c. In an obstetric patient, the upward lifting motion of the laryngosc ope blade between C2/3 C3/4, in the presenc e of c ric oid pressure at C5/6, c auses a stress rising at the level of C4/5. 

 ... 

 [emphasis added] 


233    When Mr Lek and the c ourt sought to c larify Dr Singh’s position in relation to part (a) of his answer, spec ific ally on the issue of hyperextension, Dr Singh’s evidenc e was imprec ise and inc onsistent. He initially referred to hyperextension of the plaintiff’s nec k mainly at C0/C1 and also all 

the way until C3/C4 when the laryngosc ope is introduc ed into the patient’s larynx. [note: 408] This, quite c learly, was a referenc e to the movement of the spine. When I asked him spec ific ally if he was referring to an extension or a hyperextension, he said he identified “a hyperextension in the c ontext 

of an extension”. [note: 409] I then pointed out to him that the pic tures of X-rays [note: 410] do not 

show any hyperextension, [note: 411] and Dr Li added that in a patient lying on a pillow, even though there is hyperextension at the C0/C1 and C1/C2 level, there c an be no hyperextension at the sub

axial level ( _ie_ , below C2). [note: 412] Ac c ording to Dr Li, a hyperextension at the sub-axial level c an 

only happen if a patient’s head is hung over the edge of the bed. [note: 413] 

234    Thereafter, Dr Singh sought to c larify that he referred to hyperextension in terms of the _forces_ 

_on the ALL_ , and _not in terms of the movement of the spine_. [note: 414] I then emphasised to him that referenc es to terms suc h as “hyperextension” should be used stric tly in referenc e to the movement of the spine (sinc e that had been the way the term “hyperextension” had been used throughout the 

proc eedings). [note: 415] Dr Singh then admitted that using “hyperextension” might have misled 

everyone into thinking that he was referring to the movement of the nec k. [note: 416] He said that what he was alluding to was the “extensile forc es of hyperextension” and the “hyperextension forc es 

on the ligament at the spot, C4/C5”. [note: 417] When I again pointed out to him that his use of the term “hyperextension” in the c ontext of forc es was c onfusing, he replied that it was “semantic s”. [note: 418] Onc e again I requested Dr Singh to limit his use of the words flexion, extension and 

hyperextension to movement of the spine only and he agreed. [note: 419] Dr Singh nevertheless c ontinued to stretc h the definition and understanding of those terms and c aused further c onfusion. At this junc ture, his position c hanged from previously saying that there must have been “hyperextension forc es” to saying that there must have been an “ _extension_ forc e on the ligament” in 

order to c ause the injury. [note: 420] It bears emphasising that the differenc e between hyperextension and extension is material bec ause “hyperextension” involves a bending of the nec k bac kwards _beyond its normal physiological means_ , whereas “extension” refers to that whic h is still _within its normal_ 

_physiological means_. [note: 421] 

235    When I asked Dr Singh if he was ac tually referring to a forc e ac ting on the spine whic h c aused 

the extension, he agreed and said that it was “well put”. [note: 422] Mr Lek then asked him spec ific ally if that forc e c aused an extension or a hyperextension, and Dr Singh c onfirmed that he was referring 

to a forc e c ausing _extension_ of the plaintiff’s nec k. [note: 423] He also c onfirmed that the use of the 

word “extension” “would be exac tly ac c urate as [he] wanted to mean it”. [note: 424] When rounding up the disc ussions on this issue, I c hec ked with Dr Singh onc e more that he was not saying that 

there was hyperextension at C4/C5. [note: 425] He admitted that he had used a wrong c hoic e of words 

and c onfirmed that he was referring to a _force causing extension at C4/C5_. [note: 426] 

236    After I had taken great pains to c larify and get to the bottom of Dr Singh’s position, _he withdrew his corrections the very next day_. Ac c ording to Dr Singh, what he meant was that there 

was a forc e c ausing extension in the ALL and there was still hyperextension in the spine. [note: 427] He then asked for part (a) of his answer to Question 6 of the orthopaedic s’ joint statement to be amended to read as “a forc e c ausing extension (hyperextension) of the plaintiff’s nec k during the intubation proc ess” to reflec t this new position. When Mr Lek asked Dr Singh why he had said the day 


before that there was no hyperextension, Dr Singh responded that he had “always maintained that 

there was hyperextension”. [note: 428] He then c onfirmed that he wished to withdraw his statement the previous day that there had been no hyperextension at C4/C5. His reason for this c hange was 

that he was “c onc entrating on the ligament” the previous day, [note: 429] and was so exhausted after 

one day of c ross-examination that he “was not in a position to be as alert as [he] was”. [note: 430] 

237    From the above, it is patently c lear that Dr Singh’s evidenc e was imprec ise and inc onsistent. In partic ular, I find that he sought to muddy the waters by stretc hing the definitions of prec ise terms. I do not ac c ept his exc use that he was not very alert towards the end of the day. This was neither a slight error nor one whic h c ould reasonably be attributed to exhaustion. The c ourt and Mr Lek had taken great efforts to c larify, re-c larify, c onfirm, and re-c onfirm Dr Singh’s position when he initially made those c orrec tions. Eac h time, Dr Singh had agreed to the c orrec tions. 

Forc es 

238    I now proc eed to c onsider the next c omponent of Dr Singh’s theory, whic h is the forc e that ac ts on the c ervic al spine and the ALL. When Dr Singh drew a diagram for the c ourt to understand his theory, he had indic ated that 50 Newtons of forc e, the forc e estimated to be used when the laryngosc ope is lifted, also ac ts on the c ervic al spine. Dr Li disagreed. Ac c ording to Dr Li, the lifting forc e of the laryngosc ope lifts the pharynx up and away from the c ervic al spine and there is nothing 

c onnec ting the pharynx and the c ervic al spine other than loose c onnec tive tissues. [note: 431] In response, Dr Singh c laimed that the c onnec tive tissues c onnec t the pharynx to the ALL and would 

transmit the forc es between these struc tures. [note: 432] He denied that there was a loose spac e 

between the c onnec tive tissues and the c ervic al spine. [note: 433] When Ms Ho asked him if the c onnec tive tissues are stronger or weaker than the ALL, Dr Singh replied that “it is the same strength 

or weaker than the ALL”. [note: 434] When I c ommented that I c ould not imagine how the c onnec tive tissues c ould be as strong as the ligaments, Dr Singh c onc eded that they are not as strong as the 

ALL. [note: 435] Dr Singh then went on to say that although in normal people the c onnec tive tissues are weaker than the ALL, the c onnec tive tissues in trained athletes might be as strong as the ALL. [note: 436] This was plainly a misleading and untruthful statement bec ause, as Dr Singh had earlier 

c onc eded, even a trained athlete c an only train his musc les and not his c onnec tive tissues. [note: 437] 

239    Dr Li then explained that the c onnec tive tissues are so loose that during surgery, one c an 

sweep them away with just one finger. [note: 438] He desc ribed it as analogous to “breaking a 

c obweb”. [note: 439] In response to this, Dr Singh agreed with Dr Li’s position in the c ontext of normal 

patients. [note: 440] However, Dr Singh proc eeded, unhelpfully in my opinion, to talk about how he has seen hard tissues in c adavers, and how for patients with nec k problems the loose c onnec tive tissues 

might not be the same as those in normal patients. [note: 441] These were c learly irrelevant exc eptions as the plaintiff was a normal patient. Dr Singh was also evasive and refused to give a proper answer on this issue by saying that he wanted to listen to Dr Li’s overall opinion first before 

c ommenting. [note: 442] It bears emphasising that how loose or strong c onnec tive tissues are is a matter of basic human anatomy. On this issue, as well as the others that I have pointed out in the c ourse of this judgment, Dr Singh had shown himself to be misleading and unhelpful. 

240    Next, in relation to the amount of forc e needed to c ause the alleged injury to the ALL in view of the fac t that the plaintiff had been administered a musc le relaxant, Dr Singh stated in the orthopaedic s’ joint statement that: 


 ... The amount of forc e required to do this in an awake patient would be an immense forc e bec ause the ligament is a very resilient struc ture. By c omparison, a minimal forc e would result in signific ant injury in a paralysed nec k. [note: 443] [emphasis added] 

In response, Dr Li expressed that sinc e a musc le relaxant works only on the musc les, and not the ligaments, he c ould not see how the ALL would have been more relaxed and more susc eptible to injury 

just bec ause a patient was under a musc le relaxant. [note: 444] After this point was made by Dr Li, Dr Singh c laimed that he had made a typographic al error and had instead intended to say that “the amount of forc e required to do this in an awake patient would be an immense forc e bec ause the _non-_ 

_paralysed muscles_ is [ _sic_ ] a resilient struc ture”. [note: 445] It goes without saying that this c learly c ould not have been a typographic al error. “Non-paralysed musc les” and “ligaments” are totally different anatomic al struc tures and have very different spelling. I also do not ac c ept Dr Singh’s assertion that he had failed to address his “typographic al error” earlier bec ause he was so engrossed in his disc ussions on other issues. 

Cric oid pressure 

241    I turn now to the last main c omponent of Dr Singh’s c ase theory. Ac c ording to Dr Singh, the c ric oid pressure whic h is applied at the C5/C6 loc ation fixes the ALL at C5/C6 and transfers the stress to the adjac ent moving segment, whic h is C4/C5. Bec ause of the presenc e of c ric oid pressure, C4/C5 

bears “double the tension forc e”, therefore c ausing the ALL to give way at C4/C5. [note: 446] When the c ourt asked if his c onc lusion that C4/C5 absorbed _double_ the tension forc e was a matter of mathematic al determination, Dr Singh indirec tly c onc eded that it was only ac c urate to say that C4/C5 bears _more than its usual level_ sinc e the stress is transferred both up and down the spine, and not 

just up the spine to C4/C5. [note: 447] This, to me, was another example of exaggeration on Dr Singh’s part. 

_Dr Li’s case theory_ 

242    I now set out Dr Li’s c ase theory. Dr Li disagreed with Dr Singh’s view that there would have been a forc e c ausing hyperextension or extension at C4/C5. Dr Li’s opinion is that the C4/C5 point would have been in a state of _flexion_ instead ( _ie_ , the opposite of an extension). His reasoning was as follows: 

 (a) When the patient is lying on the pillow, there is a natural tendenc y for the sub-axial spine ( ie , the levels below C2) to be in a neutral position or in a slight state of flexion. 

 (b) When the patient’s head is tilted bac kwards to open the mouth and introduc e the laryngosc ope, most of the motion is an extension at the C0/C1 and C1/C2, with little c hange at the sub-axial spine. 

 (c ) Sinc e the pillow supports only the head and the nec k is ac tually not supported, the tendenc y is for the sub-axial portion of the nec k to go into further flexion when c ric oid pressure is applied downwards and a little upwards towards the head of the patient at the C5/C6 region. 

 (d) When the laryngosc ope is inserted up to the level of about C3/C4 and lifted upwards and forwards to expose the opening of the larynx, the amount of forc e that eventually gets transmitted to the spine through the loose c onnec tive tissues, while unknown, is definitely not the full 50 Newtons used during laryngosc opy bec ause: 


 (i) the forc e is distributed evenly throughout the surfac e of the laryngosc ope blade; and 

 (ii) other than the loose c onnec tive tissues, there is nothing c onnec ting the pharynx to the c ervic al spine, and the spine would not be direc tly lifted up with the laryngosc ope blade. 

 (e) Sinc e C5/C6 is pinned down by the c ric oid pressure and the laryngosc ope is lifting upwards and forward, the resultant forc e is a rotational one that c auses flexion. 

 (f) If the c ervic al spine at C4/C5 is in a state of flexion, the ALL would be more relaxed instead of being in a state of tension. Thus, the ALL would not be injured. [note: 448] 

243    Dr Li also helpfully highlighted a few important points about the ALL. First, the ALL is a very resilient, three-layered struc ture with many different points of anc horing to the vertebrae. The deepest layer c onnec ts the vertebrae that are adjac ent to eac h other ( _ie_ , between C2 and C3, between C3 and C4, _etc_ ). The intermediate layer involves overlapping layers that transverse about two to three vertebrae ( _ie_ , along C2/C3/C4, along C3/C4/C5, _etc_ ). The last layer, whic h is the superfic ial layer, runs along the whole length of the spine with points of anc horing to eac h vertebra. [note: 449] The sec ond point that Dr Li highlighted was that the ALL only starts from C2 onwards. 

[note: 450] As suc h, even if there was extension at the C0/C1 or C1/C2 levels when the head was 

tilted bac kwards, and even if the c ric oid pressure at C5/C6 c reated a “stoppage” point suc h that the ALL below C5/C6 was immobile, the ALL at the C4/C5 level would not have been in a state of tension and c ould not have been injured. 

_The court’s comments on Dr Li’s case theory_ 

244    I find Dr Li’s explanation c onsistent, c lear and logic al. It withstood c ross-examination. I will elaborate below. 

_Decision: No direct causation_ 

245    It bears emphasising from the outset that the issues that Dr Singh and Dr Li were c alled to give expert evidenc e on are not nebulous in nature. Issues involving forc es and motion are in the realm of physic al sc ienc e and within the grasp of a layperson with the benefit of suffic ient explanation. The key issue in relation to c ausation is whether the sub-axial spine ( _ie_ , the levels below C2), was in a state of extension as Dr Singh c laimed, or in a state of flexion as Dr Li c laimed. There are no two ways about it. 

246    Having heard both experts explain their views through oral testimony aided by drawings on the white board, I invited them to demonstrate how the movement of the laryngosc ope c aused c hanges in the c urvature of the sub-axial spine. It is, of c ourse, ac knowledged that a model c an never fully represent the ac tual human skeletal struc ture. However, the model that was used served the purpose as it mimic ked the jointed c onnec tions of the c ervic al spine and c ould be moved. A book was plac ed underneath the oc c iput of the model to simulate a pillow. Dr Li demonstrated first, and I c ould see at onc e that the movement of the laryngosc ope c aused the sub-axial spine of the model to be in a state 

of flexion. [note: 451] 

247    When it was Dr Singh’s turn to demonstrate, he kept starting with the head in a hyperextended position although it was made c lear to him that he had to start his demonstration in the neutral 

position to mimic the defendant’s ac tions during the plaintiff’s intubation proc ess. [note: 452] More than onc e, he tried to move the lower end of the c ervic al spine model when it was c lear that it should 


have been fixed to simulate the presenc e of c ric oid pressure. [note: 453] It was c lear to me that he c ontrived to manipulate the c ervic al spine model so as to show an extension at the sub-axial level. It got to the point that I had to move the model for Dr Singh step by step. Up until the end, Dr Singh insisted that the sub-axial spine was in a state of extension when it was plain for all to see that it was ac tually in a state of flexion. 

248    Given the way that Dr Singh’s “demonstration” turned out, it was unsurprising to me that on the last tranc he of hearing, whic h was meant _only_ to disc uss some of the seven to ten c ases of similar injury whic h Dr Singh c laimed to have treated, he asked to try the demonstration again on another model. I did not allow it. He c laimed that the model that was used during the demonstration 

was “flopping” all over the plac e. [note: 454] This was untrue. Dr Li managed to demonstrate the movements adequately. If the model was moving all over the plac e when Dr Singh was using it, it was only bec ause he was vainly trying to manipulate the model to twist it into the shape that he wanted. Dr Singh had c ompletely ignored or forgotten that his duty was to the c ourt and this overrode any “obligation” to the plaintiff who c alled him as her expert witness. 

249    On the evidenc e before me, I c an therefore safely disregard Dr Singh’s c ase theory as it does not stand up to sc rutiny. It is c lear to me that the sub-axial spine would have been in a state of flexion and not extension. I therefore c onc lude that even if the defendant had breac hed his duty of c are in the manner that he performed the intubation (whic h I have not found), the plaintiff’s c ase would have failed for lac k of c ausation. 

**_Indirect causation_** 

250    I turn now to address the plaintiff’s c ase on c ausation at its next highest. The plaintiff argues that even if the defendant did not direc tly c ause the plaintiff’s nec k injury and she had pre-existing c ervic al spondylosis at the time of the LSCS (whic h the defenc e pointed out was suggested by the Xrays and MRIs), the defendant had triggered her symptoms of nec k pain. In this regard, the plaintiff relied on the “eggshell skull” rule that the defendant must take the plaintiff as he finds her. The defendant denied triggering the plaintiff’s pre-existing c ervic al spondylosis. 

251    For the plaintiff to establish the c ausal link between the GA proc edure and her nec k pain, it is nec essary for her to prove that she felt pain immediately or very shortly after the GA proc edure. This is bec ause of the nature of c ervic al spondylosis. Cervic al spondylosis refers to the degeneration of the c ervic al spine. It is usually c aused by the natural proc ess of wear and tear, although diseases and injuries c an also be a c ause. Oftentimes, those who suffer from c ervic al spondylosis are asymptomatic for many years. However, if and when symptoms do manifest, they manifest over a 

short period of time, usually within days or weeks. [note: 455] The manifestation of symptoms c an be triggered by an injury or by nothing at all. Dr Li estimated that about 90% of c ervic al spondylosis 

patients manifest symptoms for no partic ular reason. [note: 456] To attribute the onset of the plaintiff’s symptoms to the spec ific event of the GA proc edure, the plaintiff’s own witness, Dr Chang, said that he would expec t “pain to be immediate or in the first few hours of the injury”. Conversely, he testified that if the pain manifested “two to three days later”, he would honestly not think that 

the GA proc edure had anything to do with the manifestation of symptoms. [note: 457] This view was also shared by another of the plaintiff’s own witnesses, Dr Yue, as well as Dr Li. 

252    Dr Singh agreed that if the pain is to be attributed to a singular event, it must oc c ur immediately after that event. However, his position as to what c onstitutes “immediate” was different from the other experts. Ac c ording to Dr Singh, the plaintiff’s onset of pain would still be c onsidered to 

have oc c urred “immediately” after the GA proc edure even if it had happened many days, weeks [note: 


458] or even a month [note: 459] after the event. This is bec ause, ac c ording to Dr Singh, the GA was a 

“signific ant event” and there was no intervening event between that and the onset of pain. [note: 460] Suc h reasoning lac ks c ogenc y as it ignores the fac t that the symptoms of c ervic al spondylosis c an, and often do, manifest themselves without a triggering event. 

253    As suc h, I find that to establish a c ausal link between the GA proc edure and the plaintiff’s symptoms, the plaintiff must prove that she had suffered nec k pain immediately or very shortly after the GA proc edure. It is, of c ourse, diffic ult to state a definitive range of time, espec ially when one takes into c onsideration the fac t that the plaintiff was on painkillers for her surgic al wound whic h might have had the effec t of masking her nec k and/or bac k pains, if any. But as a general proposition, the longer the symptoms take to manifest themselves, the less likely it c an be said to have been c aused by the GA proc edure. The c onverse would also be true. I turn now to examine the plaintiff’s evidenc e as to the existenc e and/or extent of nec k and/or upper bac k pains: (a) upon waking up from the LSCS in the OT Rec overy Room; and (b) during her hospital stay in the ward. 

_The existence and/or extent of neck and/or back pains in the OT Recovery Room_ 

254    Ac c ording to Dr Tham, the plaintiff did not spec ify that she had pain in her nec k and/or bac k; 

she only told him that she was in pain. [note: 461] The plaintiff’s evidenc e was inc onsistent in several aspec ts. First, the plaintiff was unc lear as to whether she had informed Dr Tham and/or the nurses about the alleged pains in her nec k and upper bac k. In the plaintiff’s Amended Reply, she pleaded that she had “immediately informed the rec overy room nurses and Dr Tham when she woke up from the 

general anaesthesia with nec k and bac k pain”. [note: 462] Yet, during her oral testimony in c ourt, the plaintiff said that she only remembered telling Dr Tham and/or the nurses that she was in pain, and 

that she did not spec ify whether it was at the surgic al site or her nec k and/or bac k. [note: 463] Sec ond, the plaintiff’s desc ription of the alleged pain in her nec k and/or bac k was also inc onsistent. In 

her AEIC, she had desc ribed the pain as “exc ruc iating pain everywhere”. [note: 464] However, during 

her testimony, she agreed that the pain was a sore feeling as opposed to a severe pain. [note: 465] Further into her testimony, she said that she was in “exc ruc iating pain all over” when she woke up 

from the surgery. [note: 466] When this inc onsistenc y was pointed out to the plaintiff, she attempted to bridge the gap between the words “ac he” and “pain” by trying to explain that she was making a 

distinc tion between the intensity of pain and the type of pain. [note: 467] 

255    It is also signific ant that the Rec overy Room Nursing Rec ord [note: 468] and the Pain Flow Sheet [note: 469] rec orded the plaintiff as only c omplaining of “mild pain” at the material time. I pause to 

mention that it was only when the plaintiff was mid-way through her testimony that she started to c hallenge the c ontents of the medic al rec ords by alleging that the nurses had rec orded the pain sc ore without her input. This resulted in the introduc tion of six new witnesses in the middle of the trial ( _ie_ , five nurses from Gleneagles Hospital and one additional friend of the plaintiff, Ms Sheila). Ac c ording to the OT Rec overy Room nurse, Nurse Khor (who was not the nurse that tended to the plaintiff but who is able to give evidenc e as to the usual prac tic e of OT Rec overy Room nurses), the sc oring of “mild pain” in the Rec overy Room Nursing Rec ord (Sec tion C) would have been done onc e the plaintiff 

arrived at the OT Rec overy Room at 11.30am. [note: 470] Thus, it c an be inferred that the plaintiff was only suffering from “mild pain” before the Pethidine drip was started at 11.35am. This inferenc e is c onsistent with the fac t that the plaintiff’s vital signs were rec orded as stable in Sec tion B of the 

Rec overy Room Nursing Rec ord. [note: 471] Nurse Khor further explained that there was a standing order for the OT Rec overy Room nurses to start the Pethidine drip after the existing saline drip had finished so as to keep the patient c omfortable, and this would be done regardless of whether the 


surgeon instruc ted them to do so. [note: 472] 

256    There was no evidenc e supporting the plaintiff’s bare allegation that the pain sc ore was rec orded without her input. There was simply no reason why the relevant nurse in c harge of the plaintiff (who is no longer in the employment of Gleneagles Hospital and thus was not c alled as a witness) would put down a false pain sc ore. This is espec ially so sinc e Gleneagles Hospital is a Joint Commission International (“JCI”) ac c redited hospital, and a heavy emphasis is plac ed on pain sc oring 

under the JCI ac c reditation sc heme. [note: 473] Furthermore, it bears noting that the plaintiff was rec orded as being “c omfortable” and drowsy but “responds to voic e” upon her arrival in the 

OT Rec overy Room. [note: 474] She would therefore have been in a position to artic ulate her alleged nec k and/or upper bac k pains to Dr Tham and/or the nurses if she was indeed in suc h pain. 

257    Having c onsidered the evidenc e before me, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove on a balanc e of probabilities that she suffered from severe pain in her nec k and/or bac k upon waking up in the OT Rec overy Room. I turn now to c onsider the plaintiff’s ac c ount of the existenc e and/or extent of nec k and/or upper bac k pains during her stay in the hospital ward. 

_The existence and/or extent of neck and/or back pains in the hospital ward_ 

258    The plaintiff’s ac c ount of nec k and/or bac k pains whilst in the hospital ward was similarly vague and fraught with inc onsistenc ies. In the plaintiff’s AEIC, she said that she was in “so muc h pain” and 

“great pain” that she: (a) c ould not breastfeed; [note: 475] (b) c ould not look after her c hild; [note: 476] (c ) had to use a bedpan as she c ould not go to the toilet; [note: 477] (d) c ould not sleep; [note: 

478] and (e) had to ask her husband to bring extra mattresses. [note: 479] However, it is signific ant 

that the plaintiff did not spec ify the _site_ of the pain. One would quite reasonably think that the pain, if any, would have been at the surgic al site ( _ie_ , the abdomen). To my mind, the plaintiff failed to be prec ise in her AEIC so as to c reate a sweeping impression. When she was c ross-examined, the plaintiff eventually c onc eded that: 

 (a) her abdominal pain was the hindranc e behind her inability to breastfeed her c hild; [note: 480] 

 (b) her baby was plac ed in the room with her on the first night as evidenc ed by the 0330 hours entry on 27 Oc tober 2006 in the Nursing Care Plan; [note: 481] and 

 (c ) she would not have needed to use a bedpan to relieve herself on 26 Oc tober 2006 as she had just undergone surgery and a urinary c atheter was still in plac e at that time as evidenc ed by the 1230 hours entry on 26 Oc tober 2006 in the Nursing Care Plan. [note: 482] 

Even if plaintiff did use a bedpan for the rest of her hospital stay, this did not nec essarily show that she had nec k and/or bac k pains. This c ould equally have been the result of the surgic al wound at the abdomen. 

259    The plaintiff desc ribed her nec k and/or bac k pains in her AEIC as a “disc omfort” on the night of 

26     Oc tober 2006 [note: 483] whic h “worsened” on the morning of 27 Oc tober 2006. [note: 484] This was substantially different from her oral testimony, wherein she c laimed that her pain level on 26 Oc tober 

2006 until the morning of 27 Oc tober 2006 was, on a sc ale of 1 to 10, a grade of 8. [note: 485] The plaintiff further stated in her AEIC that on 27 Oc tober 2006 she asked to be transferred to 


another suite as she thought that her c ondition was due to the hospital bed. [note: 486] However, this 

c ould not be arranged and she remained in her original suite. [note: 487] When c ross-examined, the plaintiff said that she definitely would have told the ward nurses about the soreness of her nec k and bac k by 27 Oc tober 2006 (although she c ould not remember the prec ise timing) bec ause that was the 

date that she asked to be transferred to another suite. [note: 488] The plaintiff also stated in her AEIC that despite the extra mattresses whic h her husband delivered on the night of 27 Oc tober 2006, she 

woke up on 28 Oc tober 2006 feeling as though her “whole nec k and bac k were breaking”. [note: 489] 

260    The plaintiff’s ac c ount, however, is not borne out by the medic al nursing rec ords. Not a single mention of nec k and/or bac k pains and/or ac he was made by the nurses in the Nursing Care Plan or the Pain Flow Sheet throughout the duration of the plaintiff’s hospital stay. The relevant entries only showed that the plaintiff c omplained of mild pain at the surgic al site. If the plaintiff was suffering from a grade 8 pain in her nec k and/or upper bac k whic h subsequently worsened, it is diffic ult to understand why she did not at least mention this pain to the nurses, partic ularly sinc e the plaintiff is a well-educ ated woman well c apable of c ommunic ating her pain. If indeed the plaintiff had c omplained to the nurses of severe bac k and/or nec k pains, it is inc onc eivable that _all_ the nurses involved in her c are would have disregarded it, partic ularly in light of the heavy emphasis plac ed on pain sc oring in JCI ac c redited hospitals like Gleneagles Hospital. The plaintiff pointed out that her gastric pain was not rec orded and sc ored when she was presc ribed Losec for gastric at 7pm on 27 Oc tober 2006. It was argued that this represented at least one instanc e in whic h the plaintiff c omplained of pain whic h was not rec orded or sc ored. This, however, was not an egregious omission as the medic ation presc ribed, Losec , would have indic ated the presenc e of gastric pain without more. There is also no indic ation that the gastric pain was unusual or severe. In c ontrast, severe pain in the nec k and/or bac k would have been unusual and thus warranted rec ording, or at least notifying Dr Tham and/or the defendant. To my mind, the fac t that none of these things was done demonstrates the implausibility of the plaintiff’s c laim. 

261    Not only is the plaintiff’s ac c ount not borne out by the nursing rec ords, it is also inc onsistent with Dr Tham’s rec ords. Dr Tham c hec ked in on the plaintiff the evening after her LSCS, and 

subsequently at least onc e a day until she was disc harged on 28 Oc tober 2006. [note: 490] His evidenc e was that he only rec alled the plaintiff c omplaining that she was “unc omfortable” and that 

she had asked to be transferred to another suite. [note: 491] Dr Tham made no referenc e to the plaintiff’s alleged nec k and/or bac k pains. Furthermore, there was also no rec ord of the plaintiff having c omplained of nec k and/or bac k pains and/or ac he in the Clinic ian’s Collaborative Progress Notes. [note: 492] In fac t, ac c ording to Nurse Lai, Dr Tham had indic ated that the plaintiff was to be 

disc harged as early as 27 Oc tober 2006 bec ause the word “home” was written in the c olumn under 

“treatment and investigations”, and she had signed off against that entry with her initials. [note: 493] Nurse Lai was sure that the entry said “home” as she rec ognised Dr Tham’s handwriting. I agree that the sc ribble that Nurse Lai c laimed read “home” looked similar to the entry “home” on 28 Oc tober 

2006\. Nurse Lai also explained that sinc e she was only on duty on 27 Oc tober 2006 and not on 26 Oc tober 2006, the “home” entry was wrongly dated as 26 Oc tober 2006, instead of 27 Oc tober 2006. Unfortunately, as Dr Tham had already been released as a witness by then, he was not able to verify what Nurse Lai had said. Nevertheless, the other medic al rec ords support Nurse Lai’s c ontention that Dr Tham had c ertified the plaintiff to be fit for disc harge as early as 27 Oc tober 2006: 

 (a) the Nursing Care Plan rec orded that Dr Tham had ordered “home today with T.T.O” at 1050 hours on 27 Oc tober 2006. “T.T.O” refers to the “to take out” pac kage ordered by Dr Tham for the plaintiff to bring home when disc harged; and 


 (b) the Infant Nursing Care Plan rec orded that “the mum is disc harged but she will stay as a lodger on the 10th floor” and “would like the c hild to have phototherapy on the 10th floor as well in her room” at 11.50am on 27 Oc tober 2010. [note: 494] Ac c ording to Nurse Lai, what probably happened was that Dr Tham had disc harged the plaintiff on 27 Oc tober 2006, but the plaintiff did not want to leave bec ause the baby was not yet ready to be disc harged. [note: 495] 

In any event, even if Dr Tham had found the plaintiff fit to be disc harged only on 28 Oc tober 2006 and not on 27 Oc tober 2006, the fac t that he disc harged her without any further ac tion in relation to her alleged nec k and/or bac k pains, suggests to me that she had not c omplained to him about her alleged pain. 

262    It will be rec alled that the plaintiff and her husband are good friends with Dr Tham. The plaintiff’s husband is also a doc tor and had shown himself on several oc c asions to be pro-ac tive in the management of his wife’s c are. For example, the plaintiff’s husband told her to refuse Dr Tham’s presc ription of Panadeine and Arc oxia, and gave her Panadol and Ponstan instead, sinc e he felt that 

Panadeine and Arc oxia were not safe for breastfeeding. [note: 496] On another oc c asion, it was rec orded in the Nursing Care Plan at 10.50am on 27 Oc tober 2006 that the plaintiff and her husband 

had raised c onc erns that the plaintiff’s loc hia ( _ie_ , vaginal disc harge) was very heavy. [note: 497] If the plaintiff really had suc h severe nec k and/or bac k pains during her hospital stay, one would have expec ted either the plaintiff or her husband to have brought it to the attention of the nurses and Dr Tham. 

_Decision: No indirect causation_ 

263    It seems to me that the plaintiff’s unfortunate c ervic al spondylosis symptoms more likely than not manifested spontaneously (just like 90% of patients with c ervic al spondylosis do, ac c ording to 

Dr Li) [note: 498] or was c aused by some other triggering event after she was disc harged and before she went to see Dr Chang on 30 Oc tober 2006. Even though the plaintiff’s nec k and/or upper bac k pains c ertainly manifested themselves by 30 Oc tober 2006, whic h is only four days after the LSCS and two days after she was disc harged, the medic al evidenc e is that the longer the symptoms take to manifest, the less likely it c an be said to have been c aused by the GA proc edure. Even the plaintiff’s own witness, Dr Chang, testified that if the pain manifested “two to three days later”, he would not have made any link between the GA proc edure and the manifestation of c ervic al 

spondylosis symptoms. [note: 499] 

264    Ac c ordingly, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove on a balanc e of probabilities the requisite c ausal link between the GA proc edure and her nec k pain. Her alternative c ase on indirec t c ausation fails. 

**_Decision: Plaintiff’s claim for negligent intubation fails_** 

265    For the reasons given above, I find that the plaintiff failed to prove, on a balanc e of probabilities, that the defendant breac hed his duty of c are in the manner that he performed the intubation proc edure. Even if the defendant had breac hed his duty of c are (whic h I have not found), the plaintiff’s c ase would still fail on c ausation, both direc t and indirec t. Ac c ordingly, I dismiss the plaintiff’s c laim in this regard. I turn now to address the plaintiff’s last main allegation that the defendant had not disc harged his duty in relation to the giving of post-operative c are. 

**IX. POST-OPERATIVE CARE** 


266    The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had breac hed his duty of post-operative c are in the following aspec ts: 

 (a) the post-operative orders; 

 (b) signing off against the plaintiff’s disc harge from the OT Rec overy Room to the ward before reviewing her a final time; 

 (c ) omitting to review her in the ward; and 

 (d) the telephone c onversation on 29 Oc tober 2006. 

**_Post-operative orders_** 

267    It was undisputed that save for his name and his mobile phone number, the defendant omitted 

to fill in the sec tion on post-operative orders in the Anaesthetic Rec ord. [note: 500] However, as the 

defendant explained, [note: 501] the analgesia and fluid regimen would already have been doc umented 

in the Inpatient Medic al Rec ords. [note: 502] The redundanc y of having to fill in the same information in 

two medic al rec ords is evidenc ed by the newer version of the Anaesthetic Rec ord [note: 503] whic h no longer provides for the analgesia regimen to be filled in. Furthermore, the evidenc e showed that some of the post-operative instruc tions were given to the nurses verbally. For example, oxygen therapy at 

five litres per minute for ten minutes was doc umented in the Rec overy Room Nursing Rec ord. [note: 504] This showed that the defendant had given verbal instruc tions to the Rec overy Room nurses 

without whic h the nurses would not have known: (a) to give oxygen therapy sinc e it is not a standard post-operative regime and is only given upon the anaesthetist’s instruc tions; and (b) how 

muc h and for how long the oxygen should be given. [note: 505] 

268    The key issue is whether the defendant had, as a matter of fac t, disc harged his duty of c are with regard to his post-operative orders. Given that there is evidenc e of verbal post-operative orders, the inc ompleteness of the defendant’s doc umentation is not material. 

**_Signing off against the discharge from OT Recovery Room to the ward_** 

269    It was undisputed that the defendant had pre-signed the disc harge form for the plaintiff to be 

disc harged from the OT Rec overy Room to the ward. [note: 506] He had not subsequently reviewed her after handing her over to the c are of the OT Rec overy Room nurses. The defendant had, however, written his mobile phone number in the Anaesthetic Rec ord and told the nurses that he would be in 

another OT in the same hospital for another c ase and c ould be c ontac ted if nec essary. [note: 507] In the plaintiff’s c losing submissions, it was submitted that sinc e Nurse Khor (the nurse manager in c harge of the OT Rec overy Room) said that the nurses would usually try to c ontac t the anaesthetist 

before c ontac ting the primary treating physic ian if the patient c omplained of pain, [note: 508] the fac t that Dr Tham was c alled implies that the defendant c ould not be c ontac ted. The defendant denied being c ontac ted by anybody in relation to the plaintiff’s situation in the OT Rec overy Room. I am unable to ac c ept the plaintiff’s submissions on this point. First, there is no evidenc e in the medic al 

rec ords that the OT Rec overy Room nurse had tried to c ontac t the anaesthetist but c ould not. [note: 509] Sec ond, Nurse Khor’s statement as to the nurse’s normal working prac tic e must be read in light of 

subsequent c larific ation that they would not c ontac t the anaesthetist if the patient was only 

c omplaining of mild pain and her vital signs appeared normal. [note: 510] As disc ussed earlier, the 


Rec overy Room Nursing Rec ord showed that the plaintiff had only c omplained of mild pain [note: 511] 

and her vital signs were stable. [note: 512] I am therefore unable to find that the defendant was c ontac ted by the nurses and/or Dr Tham when the plaintiff was in the OT Rec overy Room. 

270    The defendant’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Sia, explained that in addition to the anaesthetist, 

other hospital personnel are also empowered to disc harge a patient bac k to the ward. [note: 513] In a 

private hospital suc h as Gleneagles Hospital, this person would be the OT Rec overy Room nurse. [note: 514] Dr Sia’s explanation was supported by the Rec overy Room Nursing Rec ord whic h c ontained the 

following instruc tion for the nurses: 

 When reassessment sc ore is not attained (9 and above), please inform the Attending Anaesthetist/Doc tor for further instruc tions prior [to] patient’s transfer to the ward. [note: 515] 

By implic ation, this must mean that in the absenc e of any c omplic ation whic h c auses the patient to be unable to attain a sc ore of 9 and above, the OT Rec overy Room nurses in Gleneagles Hospital c an disc harge a patient to the ward without further referenc e to the anaesthetist. 

271    On the other hand, the plaintiff’s anaesthetic expert, Prof Delilkan, insisted that the anaesthetist must personally see the patient and c ertify that the patient is fit to be disc harged to 

the ward. [note: 516] This, of c ourse, c ontradic ts Prof Sia’s position. With respec t, given that Prof Delilkan had himself admitted that he was unfamiliar with the prac tic e of anaesthesia in 

Singapore, [note: 517] I am inc lined to ac c ept the views of Prof Sia instead, whic h I find to be defensible in logic. 

272    Sinc e there is a responsible body of medic al opinion that regards the defendant’s c onduc t in this regard as proper, the defendant c annot be said to have breac hed his duty of c are in his provision of post-surgic al c are. I should also mention, for c ompleteness, that even if the defendant was in breac h of his duty of c are in this regard, the plaintiff has not shown how suc h a breac h led to the injuries for whic h she is now c laiming c ompensation. In fac t, the plaintiff c annot show suc h c ausation as her entire c ase is built on the assertion that she suffered pain _immediately_ after the LSCS and before any post-operative c are would have been given. 

**_Reviewing the plaintiff in the ward_** 

273    The defendant’s evidenc e was that he was not informed of any alleged c omplaint of pain in the 

plaintiff’s nec k and/or upper bac k throughout the c ourse of the plaintiff’s hospital stay. [note: 518] It will be rec alled that the defendant was first notified of the plaintiff’s alleged injuries by her husband _via_ telephone on 29 Oc tober 2006, _after_ the plaintiff was disc harged from hospital (see [11] above). Dr Tham did not give any evidenc e to the c ontrary, while the various ward nurses who took the stand all denied rec eiving any suc h c omplaint in the first plac e. Ac c ording to Prof Sia, it is not routine prac tic e for an anaesthetist to pay ward visits to the patient if he was not informed of any reason to 

do so. [note: 519] Therefore, in the absenc e of any evidenc e that the defendant was apprised of the plaintiff’s alleged c omplaints whilst in the ward, the defendant had not breac hed his duty of c are in this regard. Even if the defendant was in breac h of his duty of c are, the plaintiff has again not shown how suc h a breac h led to the injuries for whic h she is now c laiming c ompensation. 

**_The telephone call on 29 October 2006_** 

274    The plaintiff argued that the defendant was under a duty to review the plaintiff after he had 


the telephone c onversation with her husband on 29 Oc tober 2006. The defendant denied this. On the evidenc e, the nature of the phone c all was to find out from the defendant if anything had happened 

during the GA proc edure. [note: 520] It was not made with the purpose of seeking a c onsultation or treatment. The defendant had fulfilled the purpose of the phone c all by answering that nothing happened during the intubation proc ess that c ould have resulted in the plaintiff’s c omplaint. It also bears noting that Dr Tham did not ask the defendant to review the plaintiff together with him. The defendant ac c epted that he would be under a duty to do so if Dr Tham, as the primary physic ian, had 

asked him to review the patient. [note: 521] This view is largely in line with the views of Prof Sia, [note: 522] Dr Rauff [note: 523] and Dr Lai. [note: 524] Differing from the views of the other experts, 

Prof Delilkan stated that it would have been the “ethic al duty” to review a patient who c omplains of 

pain. [note: 525] 

275    Sinc e there is a responsible body of medic al opinion that regards the defendant’s c onduc t as proper, I find that the defendant did not breac h his duty of c are to the plaintiff omitting to follow-up with the plaintiff after the telephone c all on 29 Oc tober 2006. I ac c ordingly also rejec t the plaintiff’s 

submissions that the defendant’s c onduc t is evidenc e of his guilt. [note: 526] Even if the defendant had breac hed his duty of c are in this respec t, the plaintiff has not shown how suc h a breac h led to the injuries for whic h she is now c laiming c ompensation. As pointed out by the defendant, there was little he c ould have done even if he had reviewed the plaintiff sinc e his spec iality is not relevant to the plaintiff’s c omplaint. The appropriate person to review her would have been a neurologist or orthopaedic surgeon, and suc h a referral c ould have been made by Dr Tham as the primary physic ian who had the point of first c ontac t with the plaintiff. 

**_Decision: The plaintiff’s claim for negligent post-operative care fails_** 

276    In c onc lusion, sinc e there is a responsible body of medic al opinion that regards the defendant’s post-operative c are as proper, there is no basis to say that the defendant had breac hed his duty of c are in the manner in whic h he provided post-operative c are. Even if there was a breac h of duty of c are, the plaintiff has not shown how suc h a breac h led to the injuries for whic h she is now c laiming c ompensation. 

**X. CONCLUSION** 

277    For the reasons given above, I dismiss the plaintiff’s entire c laim with c osts.
