**Tan Lee Meng J:** 

1       The applic ant, Ms Linda Lai Swee Lin (“Ms Lai”), applied for a stay of the bankruptc y proc eedings initiated against her by the AttorneyGeneral. Her applic ation was dismissed by the assistant registrar, Ms Joyc e Low. I affirmed the assistant registrar’s dec ision and now give the reasons for dismissing Ms Lai’s appeal. 

2       Ms Lai, a former Senior Offic er Grade III at the Land Offic e, Ministry of Law, assumed duty on 28 November 1996. She was put on probation for one year. In the normal c ourse of events, she should have been informed in writing by 27 November 1997 that she was a c onfirmed employee or that her probation period had been extended or that her servic es were no longer required. However, she rec eived no suc h notific ation by that date. 

3       On 19 August 1998, Ms Lai was informed that adverse reports about her work had been rec eived and that her appointment c ould not be c onfirmed. Her period of probation was retrospec tively extended for one year, from 28 November 1997 to 27 November 1998. On 17 Dec ember 1998, her servic es were terminated. She appealed to the Appeals Board and to the Singapore Public Servic e Commission (“PSC”) but her appeals were unsuc c essful. 

4       Ms Lai then made an applic ation under O 53 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 1997 Rev Ed) for leave to apply for an order of _certiorari_ to quash the following: 

 (a) the dec ision of the Commissioner for Lands/Permanent Sec retary (Law) c onveyed to her on 19 August 1998, whic h extended her probationary period as a Senior Offic er Grade III (Law) for one year retrospec tively from 28 November 1997; 

 (b) the dec ision c onveyed to her on 17 Dec ember 1998 terminating her appointment; and 

 (c ) the dismissal by the PSC of her appeal against the retrospec tive extension of her probationary period and the termination of her appointment. 

5       Ms Lai also applied for an order of _mandamus_ for her reinstatement as a c onfirmed Senior 


Offic er Grade III with effec t from 28 November 1997. 

6       The High Court granted her leave to apply for an order of _certiorari_ but not for an order of _mandamus_. However, the Court of Appeal allowed the PSC’s appeal against the dec ision to grant her leave to apply for an order of _certiorari_ : see _Public Service Commission v Lai Swee Lin Linda_ <span class="citation">[2001] 1 SLR 644</span>. L P Thean JA, who delivered the judgment of the c ourt, explained that the relationship between Ms Lai and the Government was one of employer and employee and her c omplaints, if well founded, amounted to breac hes of c ontrac t, for whic h the remedy was provided by private law. As suc h, the question of judic ial review did not arise and leave to apply for an order of _certiorari_ should not have been given. 

7       After hearing submissions on c osts, the Court of Appeal ordered Ms Lai to pay 50% of the c osts of the appeal and the hearing below. The Senior Assistant Registrar, who taxed the Bill of Costs on 8 Marc h 2005, allowed party and party c osts at $37,060.00 and c ourt fees at $2,276.00. A statutory demand was served on Ms Lai in April to pay the sum due from her, whic h amounted to $19,668.00. Ms Lai applied for a stay of the bankruptc y proc eedings. Her applic ation was dismissed by Assistant Registrar Joyc e Low. 

**The appeal** 

8       Under s 64 of the Bankruptc y Ac t (Cap 20, 2000 Rev Ed), the c ourt may, for suffic ient reason, make an order staying the proc eedings on a bankruptc y petition, either altogether or for a limited time, on suc h terms as the c ourt may think just. In view of this, the issue before the c ourt is whether there is suffic ient reason for a stay of the bankruptc y proc eedings. Regrettably, at the hearing of the appeal, Ms Lai did not furnish any good reason as to why her appeal against the assistant registrar’s dec ision should be allowed. 

9       During the hearing of the appeal, Ms Lai, who c ommenc ed Suit No 995 of 2004 against the AttorneyGeneral for breac h of her employment c ontrac t after her ac tion against the PSC was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in 2001, foc used her attention on this new suit, whic h had nothing to do with the statutory demand in question. She informed the c ourt that in her new ac tion against the AttorneyGeneral, she was seeking to rec over the c osts that she had been ordered by the Court of Appeal to pay the PSC in 2001. She c ould not ac c ept that the question of reversing the Court of Appeal’s order of 29 January 2001 on the c osts in her previous suit against the PSC did not arise. In para 7 of her written submissions, she stated: 

 Using medic al analogy, it was the Defendant whic h c aused the sic kness, should not the perpetrator of the sic kness be liable for c osts? If there was no sic kness in the first plac e, there would be no need for any panac ea. Using another analogy, should not the perpetrator of a c rime be liable for his ac tions? 

10     Ms Lai alleged that the AttorneyGeneral was using the c osts owed by her as “a weapon to prevent her from pursuing the matter” so that the “failure to c omply with rules and proc edures and the abuse of power would be swept under the c arpet”. She did not substantiate this allegation. 

11     After taking all the c irc umstanc es into ac c ount, I dismissed her appeal against the assistant registrar’s dec ision to refuse to order a stay of the bankruptc y proc eedings against her.
