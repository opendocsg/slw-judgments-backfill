**Introduction** 

1       The plaintiff, Mr Yashwant Bajaj, and the defendant, Mr Toru Ueda, former partners in a fund management business, sued eac h other in the High Court as a result of disputes c onc erning the c essation of their partnership. After mediation, their c laim and c ounterc laim were c ompromised with a settlement agreement (“Settlement Agreement”). The Settlement Agreement envisaged final c alc ulations to be effec ted by an independent ac c ountant. Following an evaluation proc ess that did not go smoothly, the appointed independent ac c ountant issued a qualified opinion but set out a c alc ulation ac c ording to the rubric provided by the Settlement Agreement. This c alc ulation resulted in a sum owing from Mr Bajaj to Mr Ueda. 

2       Mr Ueda followed on with letters asking Mr Bajaj to pay the sum c alc ulated by the ac c ountant, an additional sum spec ified by the Settlement Agreement and Mr Bajaj’s share of the ac c ountant’s fees. These letters were ignored. Subsequently, Mr Ueda served a statutory demand on Mr Bajaj on 17 April 2018 (the “Statutory Demand”) c laiming the same. 

3       Mr Bajaj applied to set aside the Statutory Demand. On 13 July 2018, an Assistant Registrar dismissed Mr Bajaj’s applic ation. On 30 July 2018, I dismissed Mr Bajaj’s appeal therefrom. Mr Bajaj has filed an appeal against my dec ision and I set out the grounds of my dec ision. 

**Background** 

4       Mr Bajaj and Mr Ueda were partners involved in a fund management business. The fund they managed was known as the Hac himan Japan Fund. The parties managed the fund through the use of 

several c orporate entities: [note: 1] 

 (a) Hac himan Capital Management (“Hac himan Cayman”), a fund management c ompany inc orporated in the Cayman Islands in 2004; 

 (b) Hac himan Capital Management Private Limited (“Hac himan Singapore”), a wholly owned 


 subsidiary of Hac himan Cayman inc orporated in Singapore; 

 (c ) TY Advisors (“TY Cayman”), a c ompany inc orporated in the Cayman Islands; and 

 (d) TY Advisors Japan (“TY Japan”), a branc h of TY Cayman registered in Japan. 

5       I shall refer to Hac himan Cayman and Hac himan Singapore c ollec tively as the “Hac himan Entities”, and to TY Cayman and TY Japan as the “TY Entities”. The parties were the direc tors and equal shareholders of Hac himan Cayman and TY Cayman. They managed the Hac himan Japan Fund together from Japan from 2004 to 2009. For tax and regulatory reasons, the parties c onduc ted their business ac tivities in Japan though TY Japan. TY Japan would provide subadvisory servic es to Hac himan Cayman, the offshore fund management c ompany. From 2009 to 2011, the parties managed 

the Hac himan Japan Fund from Singapore through Hac himan Singapore. [note: 2] In the c ourse of their business, the parties made use of the servic es of two unrelated c ompanies for c orporate support: 

 (a) Tric or Singapore Pte Ltd (“Tric or”) a c ompany in Singapore whic h provided servic es suc h as book keeping and the running of a trust ac c ount for Hac himan Singapore; and 

 (b) Kaneyama & Assoc iates (“Kaneyama”) a business in Japan whic h handled the financ ial rec ords of TY Japan. 

6       Sometime in September 2010, the parties agreed to wind up their joint business and end their partnership. They entered into an agreement for how the assets of their business ought to be divided. Unfortunately, shortly after this agreement, there was a dispute over c ertain subsequent transac tions and business dec isions, as well as a dispute as to the prec ise nature and sc ope of their agreement. While these disputes were ongoing, Mr Bajaj resigned as a direc tor of the TY Entities around Marc h 2011, and also resigned as a direc tor of the Hac himan Entities in May 2011, to enable him to take up 

a direc torship in another fund management c ompany. [note: 3] 

7       Mr Ueda c ommenc ed a suit against Mr Bajaj on 13 Marc h 2013 (“the Suit”). Mr Bajaj filed a c ounterc laim. The parties agreed to refer the dispute to mediation and eventually resolved the Suit by 

entering into the Settlement Agreement on 19 August 2014. [note: 4] 

8       The Settlement Agreement is c entral to the present dispute. Its key terms are the following: [note: 5] 

 (a) Clause 1 provides that “[t]he parties are to jointly appoint an Independent Ac c ountant to c alc ulate and populate the entries” in “Tables X and Y”, two tables enc losed in the Settlement Agreement. Clause 2 provides a c alc ulation formula premised on figures found in Tables X and Y (“the Settlement Amount”). 

 (b) Clauses 3 and 4 provide for payment of the Settlement Amount to either Mr Bajaj or Mr Ueda, depending on whether the Settlement Amount c alc ulated is a positive or negative sum. 

 (c ) Clause 6 provides that all “c osts, fees and expenses of the Independent Ac c ountant” as well as Singapore Mediation Centre’s (“SMC”) fee for appointing the Independent Ac c ountant shall be borne by Mr Bajaj and Mr Ueda equally. 

 (d) Clause 8 provides that all parties “will take all nec essary steps to proc ure that the parties and the Independent Ac c ountant are to be given free and unfettered ac c ess to all doc uments of 


 [Hac himan Cayman] and all related entities” for the purposes of Clause 1. 

 (e) Clause 9 provides that the “Independent Ac c ountant’s c alc ulations shall be final and binding”. 

 (f) Clause 10 provides that “[Mr Bajaj] is to pay [Mr Ueda] USD50,000”. 

 (g) Clause 14 provides that “[t]his Settlement Agreement represents a full and final settlement and/or c ompromise of all disputes and/or c laims whatsoever arising out of or in c onnec tion with [the Suit, Hac himan Cayman, Hac himan Japan Fund, Hac himan Singapore, TY Cayman, TY Japan] or otherwise. 

 (h) Clause 15 provides that parties undertake to make all reasonable endeavour to implement the terms of the Settlement Agreement. 

 (i) Clause 16 provides that the parties undertake to return before Mr George Lim SC (“the Mediator”) for further mediation to resolve any disputes or issues arising out of the performanc e of this Settlement Agreement. 

 (j) Clause 17 provides for payment of the sums due under the Settlement Agreement by instalments, and also provides for suc h sums to bec ome immediately payable upon a failure to pay any instalment within the time stipulated. 

9       On 14 November 2014, pursuant to a Neutral Evaluation Agreement, the parties c onsented to the appointment of Mr Sajjad Akhtar (“Mr Akhtar”) to provide a “Neutral Evaluation Servic e”. It was not disputed that this was in effec t appointing Mr Akhtar as the “Independent Ac c ountant” under Clause 1 of the Settlement Agreement. Under the Neutral Evaluation Agreement, the parties agreed to a “Doc umentsonly” Neutral Evaluation and also agreed that the terms of the SMC’s Neutral 

Evaluation Rules (the “Neutral Evaluation Rules”) were inc orporated. [note: 6] 

10     The neutral evaluation proc ess was marred by delays and various inc idents. The parties initially agreed to submit an agreed statement of fac ts to Mr Akhtar. A draft was forwarded by Mr Ueda’s solic itors to Mr Bajaj on 12 Dec ember 2014; however, Mr Bajaj refused to finalise the agreed 

statement of fac ts. [note: 7] Case statements as well as replies to the c ase statements were filed by 

both parties between 12 January 2015 and 3 February 2015. [note: 8] These c ase statements 

c ontained the doc uments nec essary to c alc ulate and populate Tables X and Y. [note: 9] Mr Ueda provided an 86page folio of doc uments c omprising various transac tion rec ords, bank statements from 

2011 and management ac c ounts provided by Tric or. [note: 10] 

11     After reviewing the c ase statements and the replies, Mr Akhtar had several queries. [note: 11] He thus proposed a c larific ation hearing to be attended by both parties. There were diffic ulties in arranging for a c ommon time for this hearing, and Mr Ueda’s solic itors initially proposed that Mr Akhtar meet with eac h party individually instead. Mr Bajaj, however, insisted on having both parties present 

at the hearing. [note: 12] Finally, both parties agreed via email on a c ommon hearing date of 2 April 

2015\. Mr Ueda flew in from Tokyo to attend the hearing and provide explanations. Mr Bajaj did not 

appear. Mr Ueda and Mr Akhtar proc eeded with the hearing in Mr Bajaj’s absenc e. [note: 13] In his 2nd 

affidavit, Mr Bajaj c laimed that he did not agree to meet on 2 April 2015 [note: 14] but Mr Ueda 

c ountered with a c opy of Mr Bajaj’s email of 3 Marc h 2015 agreeing to the date. [note: 15] 


12     Subsequent to the hearing, Mr Akhtar requested an explanation for Mr Bajaj’s absenc e. Mr Bajaj c laimed that he was overseas and did not rec eive Mr Akhtar’s email notific ation reminding the parties of the hearing. In his detailed desc ription of the neutral evaluation proc ess annexed to his Report, Mr Akhtar expressed doubt about the reasons provided by Mr Bajaj for his absenc e. The notific ation email was sent to Mr Bajaj’s usual email address and Mr Akhtar did not rec eive any notific ation of non

delivery. Mr Akhtar also noted that Mr Bajaj had previously agreed to the date. [note: 16] In his 3rd Affidavit, Mr Bajaj c ontended that he was in Italy organising a roc k festival at the time and his 

residenc e in Italy did not have internet c onnec tivity. [note: 17] Mr Ueda highlighted that this was unlikely for three reasons: (i) Mr Bajaj was operating as a fund manager at the time; (ii) Mr Bajaj was organising a roc k festival; and (iii) his residenc e in Italy was desc ribed, in a news artic le, as a “luxury 

villa”. [note: 18] 

13     In order to push the proc ess forward, Mr Ueda waived his right under Clause 7 of the Settlement Agreement to be represented in all meetings with the Independent Ac c ountant and c onsented for Mr Akhtar to meet Mr Bajaj without Mr Ueda’s representatives in a separate c larific ation 

meeting. [note: 19] Notwithstanding, despite Mr Akhtar’s efforts to set up a meeting, Mr Bajaj effec tively ignored him. Mr Akhtar sent several emails during the month of April 2015 requesting a 

suitable meeting date from Mr Bajaj, but Mr Bajaj ignored the emails. [note: 20] Finally, on 3 July 2015, Mr Bajaj responded, proposing to make himself available on or after 24 August 2015. Mr Ueda was c onc erned about the delay in the proc ess, and his solic itors suggested by way of an email on 10 July 2015 that the c larific ation hearing take plac e through a c onferenc e c all, instead of waiting until August. Mr Bajaj firmly rejec ted this suggestion and insisted on a fac e to fac e meeting in August. [note: 21] 

14     On 4 and 19 August, Mr Akhtar c ontac ted Mr Bajaj to c onfirm a meeting date. Mr Bajaj onc e 

again failed to respond. [note: 22] 

15     On 26 August 2015 Mr Akhtar c onsulted SMC on how to proc eed. SMC rec ommended that he proc eed to issue his opinion in light of the fac t that the matter had bec ome unduly protrac ted. Mr Akhtar wrote to both parties on 13 Oc tober 2015 stating that sinc e Mr Bajaj had refused to provide reasonable alternative dates for a c larific ation hearing, Mr Akhtar would issue his opinion on the basis 

of the doc uments submitted to date. [note: 23] 

16     The next day, 14 Oc tober 2015, Mr Bajaj finally responded, stating that he would not ac c ept Mr Akhtar’s opinion unless he was given a c hanc e to be heard. Mr Bajaj subsequently began alleging bias on the part of Mr Akhtar and wrote to the SMC and Mr Ueda’s solic itors, proposing that Mr Akhtar be replac ed. His proposal was rejec ted by both the SMC and Mr Ueda. Mr Akhtar c ontinued to engage Mr Bajaj but Mr Bajaj refused to rec iproc ate, maintaining his position that Mr Akhtar was biased. Mr Akhtar, with the support of SMC, wrote to Mr Bajaj and informed him that he would proc eed to issue 

his report on 27 November 2015 if Mr Bajaj did not meet him prior to this. [note: 24] 

17     Mr Bajaj finally met Mr Akhtar for a c larific ation hearing on 25 November 2015. During this meeting, Mr Bajaj raised reservations that he had no ac c ess to c ertain sourc e doc uments of the 

Hac himan Entities and the reliability of the ac c ounts provided by Mr Ueda. [note: 25] For the first time, Mr Bajaj expressed a c onc ern that the ac c ounting rec ords did not reflec t a loan given by Hac himan Cayman to TY Japan (“Hac himan Loan”). 

18     To address these c onc erns, Mr Akhtar went to Tric or’s offic es in January 2016 to review the 


ac c ounting rec ords of Hac himan Cayman maintained by Tric or. Mr Akhtar appeared to be satisfied with the ac c ounts after his review. In partic ular, he examined the ac c ounting rec ords for the Hac himan Loan and found that it had been repaid, and henc e was rightfully no longer reflec ted on the 

ac c ounts. [note: 26] He emailed parties his results with various detailed working doc uments enc losed on 24 February 2016. 

19     Mr Bajaj did not query Mr Akhtar’s c alc ulations or working doc uments. He remained dissatisfied, however, and wanted further ac c ess to the sourc e doc uments. Mr Ueda initially resisted Mr Bajaj’s requests for the sourc e doc uments. Finally, however, at Mr Akhtar’s request, Mr Ueda in June 2016 instruc ted Tric or to provide ac c ess to the doc uments they had available and also wrote to Kaneyama, 

authorising Kaneyama to release all doc ument relevant to the Hac himan Entities. [note: 27] It appears 

that Kaneyama did not respond to Mr Bajaj’s subsequent requests for doc uments. [note: 28] 

20     Tric or retrieved further doc uments from a warehouse and forwarded c opies of the doc uments to 

Mr Bajaj in August 2016. [note: 29] The doc uments rec eived by Mr Bajaj from Tric or were, nonetheless, not to his satisfac tion. Broadly, Mr Bajaj wanted two further sets of doc uments. 

21     First, c ertain doc uments kept by Cayman National Bank (“CNB”) in relation to Hac himan 

Cayman’s bank ac c ount with CNB inc luding: [note: 30] 

 (a) Bank statements from CNB for the months of July, August, November and Dec ember 2010; 

 (b) CNB debit advic e slips for the 4th quarter of 2010; 

 (c ) Hac himan Singapore Wire Instruc tions for the 4th quarter of 2010. 

22     Sec ond, c ertain doc uments rendered and managed by Kaneyama in relation to TY Japan for the 

period of June 2010 to Marc h 2011. These doc uments inc luded: [note: 31] 

 (a) TY Japan’s general ledger of ac c ounts and invoic es; 

 (b) TY Japan’s monthly balanc e sheet; 

 (c ) TY Japan’s payroll ac c ount statements and government pension c ontributions; 

 (d) TY Japan’s tax invoic es of subadvisory servic es rendered to Hac himan Cayman; 

 (e) TY Japan’s trust ac c ount statements with Kaneyama; and 

 (f) TY Japan’s other deposit statements. 

23     I shall refer to the doc uments c ollec tively as the “CNB and Kaneyama Doc uments”. 

24     Mr Bajaj insisted that without the CNB and Kaneyama Doc uments to verify the ac c ounts 

rendered by Tric or, Tables X and Y would be populated with “false information”. [note: 32] Hac himan Cayman’s CNB bank ac c ount had, however, been terminated, and Mr Ueda had no ac c ess to the statements unless he opened the ac c ount again. Mr Ueda’s position was that these doc uments were 

not in his possession or power and he had no obligation to proc ure them. [note: 33] 

25     This impasse c ontinued throughout 2016 and 2017. In September and Oc tober 2016, SMC 


attempted to arrange a meeting between the parties and Mr Akhtar, but these attempts were unsuc c essful. In November 2016, SMC proposed a meeting between the parties, Mr Akhtar, and the 

Mediator. Mr Ueda agreed to attend. [note: 34] Mr Bajaj, on the other hand, responded on 19 and 21 November 2016, refusing to attend any meeting until he rec eived the CNB and Kaneyama Doc uments. Mr Bajaj also raised a new allegation: that Mr Ueda had wound up Hac himan Singapore without his c onsent, and may have sequestered around $150,000. Mr Bajaj used this allegation as further grounds for refusing to c onsent to any meeting between the parties, Mr Akhtar and the Mediator. Over the period of Dec ember 2016 to April 2017, the parties exc hanged emails, but no progress was made. Mr Bajaj c ontinued to demand the outstanding doc uments and allege impropriety in the winding up of Hac himan Singapore. Mr Ueda rebutted Mr Bajaj’s allegations while ac knowledging that Mr Bajaj was 

free to present his allegations in an appropriate forum. [note: 35] 

26     In May 2017, Mr Akhtar made a final attempt to get the parties to return to mediation but stated that if they did not agree to return to mediation, he would issue a report with appropriate qualific ations. Mr Ueda disagreed, as he “[did] not c onsider that parties will realistic ally make any headway by returning to mediation after suc h extended c orrespondenc e on various issues and having 

explored the various approac hes suggested by [Mr Akhtar] ...”. [note: 36] Mr Bajaj replied in an email 

dated 14 May 2017. [note: 37] He agreed to return to mediation, stating that: “[Mr Akhtar’s] issuanc e of a qualified c alc ulation would invalidate the agreement that I made with Mr Ueda and I am therefore willing to return to mediation in an attempt to get him to release the ac c ess to the sourc e information suc h that a non qualified statement c an be obtained”. Mr Bajaj insisted that even a qualified report 

c ould not be issued due to various alleged improprieties on the part of Mr Ueda, inc luding: [note: 38] 

 (a) the allegation that Mr Ueda wound up Hac himan Singapore without his c onsent and funds in Hac himan Singapore were not ac c ounted for; 

 (b) the allegation that Mr Ueda had not ac c ounted for funds that were left in the ac c ounts of the TY Entities. Mr Bajaj’s position was that the TY Entities was put into liquidation sometime around mid2010. [note: 39] Henc e the suggestion appeared to be that Mr Ueda had sequestered all funds remaining in the ac c ounts of the TY Entities, whic h was improper bec ause Mr Bajaj, as a shareholder of TY Cayman, was entitled to a share of the funds. 

27     Mr Akhtar stressed in his reply on 29 June 2017 that the winding up of Hac himan Singapore oc c urred after 2011 and henc e the issues surrounding the winding up was outside of his remit, whic h was merely to obtain net asset value (“NAV”) figures for Hac himan Cayman in 2010 and 2011, populate Tables X and Y, and c alc ulate the Settlement Amount. Nevertheless, Mr Akhtar requested a response from Mr Ueda on the allegation pertaining to the funds left in the ac c ounts of the TY Entities. Mr Ueda’s reply was that any issue pertaining to the ac c ounts of the TY Entities was entirely irrelevant to the NAV of Hac himan Cayman, sinc e TY Cayman was neither a parent c ompany nor a subsidiary of Hac himan Cayman. In his opinion, it was outside of the sc ope of Mr Akhtar’s remit. Mr Ueda reiterated his position that Mr Bajaj ought to pursue his allegations in a separate ac tion if he 

wished to do so. [note: 40] The parties c ontinued to exc hange emails on this without any resolution. 

28     On 31 July 2017, Mr Akhtar attempted to remedy the impasse by seeking additional supporting doc uments that pertained to the transac tions between Hac himan Cayman and the TY Entities. Tric or 

c onfirmed that they did not have any further doc uments. [note: 41] On 31 August 2017, Mr Akhtar informed the parties of this development, and also reiterated that events pertaining to the winding up of Hac himan Singapore were outside his remit. On the same day, Mr Bajaj replied that Tables X and Y c ould not be “populated with false information” and stated that he would “separately c ontac t” the 


Mediator and the SMC. [note: 42] 

29     On 25 September 2017, Mr Bajaj demanded that Mr Akhtar halt his ac tivities until Mr Bajaj managed to c ontac t the Mediator to “give guidanc e on next steps” stating that “I will keep everyone updated on the outc ome of c ontac t with the mediator, if he does not do so himself first”. While SMC did c ommunic ate Mr Bajaj’s request to the Mediator, and c ontac t details were exc hanged, Mr Akhtar did not rec eive any further c ommunic ation regarding this. Henc e he issued a qualified Neutral 

Evaluation Report on 23November 2017 (the “Report”). [note: 43] 

30     The Report would only be released to the parties upon payment of all outstanding amounts owing to the Neutral and SMC. Clause 6 of the Settlement Agreement provided that fees and expenses should be borne equally. Mr Bajaj refused to pay his share of the fees. Eventually, on 2 Marc h 2018, Mr Ueda paid for Mr Bajaj’s share of the fees, being the sum of S$32,399.60, in order to 

proc ure the release of the Report. [note: 44] 

31     Mr Akhtar’s Report was released on 7 Marc h 2017 and an amendment was made on 14 Marc h 

2017, c larifying a typographic al error. [note: 45] Nothing turns on the c larific ation, there was no dispute regarding the sum as c orrec ted. The population of Tables X and Y and final c alc ulations 

resulted in a sum of US$226,481.92 payable by Mr Bajaj to Mr Ueda. [note: 46] As allowed by the Neutral Evaluation Rules, the Report was qualified to explain Mr Akhtar’s c onstraints. 

32     Following the issue of Mr Akhtar’s Report, Mr Ueda’s solic itors wrote to Mr Bajaj on 9 April 2018 to demand payment of his share of Mr Akhtar’s fees. They also wrote to Mr Bajaj on the same date to 

demand payment of sums owing under the Settlement Agreement. Mr Bajaj ignored both letters. [note: 47] Ac c ordingly, Mr Ueda served the Statutory Demand on 17 April 2018 on Mr Bajaj demanding 

payment for three debts: [note: 48] 

 (a) The debt of US$50,000 pursuant to Clause 10 of the Settlement Agreement (the “Clause 10 Debt”); 

 (b) The Settlement Amount of US$226,481.92 pursuant to Clause 3 of the Settlement Agreement; and 

 (c ) Mr Bajaj’s share of the fees under Clause 6 of the Settlement Agreement, being S$32.399.60 (the “Clause 6 Debt”). 

33     This was the Statutory Demand that Mr Bajaj applied to set aside. 

**Preliminary issues** 

34     At the hearing on 30 July 2018, two preliminary objec tions were raised by c ounsel for Mr Ueda: 

 (a) First, there was improper introduc tion of new evidenc e in the form of annexes that were appended to Mr Bajaj’s written submissions for the appeal. 

 (b) Sec ond, the notic e of appeal was served on Mr Ueda out of time. 

I deal with these in turn. 

**_New evidence_** 


35     The new evidenc e sought to be adduc ed was divided into two annexes: 

 (a) Annex 1 involved emails that indic ated that on 16 July 2018, Mr Bajaj had put in a Request for Mediation; 

 (b) Annex 2 involved a letter from c ounsel for Mr Bajaj enc losing c ertain doc uments purportedly obtained from the c ase statement made by Mr Ueda in 2015, pursuant to the neutral evaluation proc ess (see [10] above). The letter alleged fraud and/or oppression on the part of Mr Ueda during the winding up of the TY Entities and Hac himan Singapore. 

The annexes were appended to the bac k of Mr Bajaj’s written submissions for the appeal dated 26 July 2018. 

36     Order 38 r 2(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) makes plain that the proper means by whic h evidenc e ought to be admitted before the Court in the c ontext of proc eedings suc h as the present is by way of affidavit: 

 Evidence by affidavit (O.38, r.2) 

 ... 

 (2) In any c ause or matter begun by originating summons and on any applic ation made by summons, evidenc e shall be given by affidavit unless in the c ase of any suc h c ause, matter or applic ation any provision of these Rules otherwise provides or the Court otherwise direc ts, but the Court may, on the applic ation of any party, order the attendanc e for c rossexamination of the person making any suc h affidavit, and where, after suc h an order has been made, the person in question does not attend, his affidavit shall not be used as evidenc e without the leave of the Court. 

37     The Court of Appeal in _WBG Network (S) Pte Ltd v Sunny Daisy Ltd_ [2007] 1 SLR (R) 1133 (“ _WBG Network_ ”) had the opportunity to c onsider the admissibility of improperly adduc ed evidenc e. In _WBG Network_ , the appellant in the c ourt below had attempted to adduc e evidenc e in the form of a letter c ontaining three attac hments. This was done in the c ontext of an appeal from a summary judgment applic ation. The letter was not produc ed in the form of an affidavit and instead was handed to the judge below by c ounsel at the hearing before the judge. The judge refused to admit the evidenc e (see _WBG Network_ at [4]). The question before the Court of Appeal was whether the judge was entitled to do so. The Court of Appeal stated (at [5]): 

 We are of the opinion that, based on the improper manner the evidenc e was adduc ed, the c ourt would have been entitled to rejec t the doc uments. Doc uments do not amount to evidenc e unless they have been properly adduc ed and admitted into evidenc e by the c ourt. Ac c ordingly, the person adduc ing the evidenc e must do so on oath or affirmation as well as be subjec t to c rossexamination, if nec essary, so as to asc ertain the relevanc e or authentic ity of the evidenc e that is sought to be admitted. ... 

3       8 _WBG Network_ illustrates that the rules relating to the adduc ing of evidenc e are not premised on mere rigid adherenc e to tec hnic ality but are nec essitated by the proper administration of justic e. Where evidenc e is not adduc ed by affidavit and merely appended to written submissions or handed to the judge on the day of the hearing, it deprives the opposing c ounsel the opportunity to properly obtain instruc tions to make further c omment on the evidenc e adduc ed. The opposing party, properly 


advised, may c hoose to reply by affidavit. The requirements of O 38 r 2(2) of the ROC provide further a safeguard as to the relevanc e and authentic ity of the doc uments appended to an affidavit, by providing the option of c rossexamining the party who affirms the affidavit. This is c ruc ial bec ause relevanc e, authentic ity and reasons for late adduc tion are key in a dec ision whether to admit suc h evidenc e upon a Registrar’s Appeal. 

39     I therefore disregarded the two annexes. Somewhat surprisingly, despite c ounsel for Mr Ueda’s objec tions, c ounsel for Mr Bajaj did not make any applic ation – not even an oral one – to introduc e the new evidenc e. Instead, the two annexes were appended to Mr Bajaj’s written submissions and referred to in the body of the submissions as if they were already in evidenc e within the affidavits. Suc h c onduc t ought to be disc ouraged. 

**_Service of notice of appeal out of time_** 

40     On 13 July 2018, the unsealed notic e of appeal was sent by Mr Bajaj’s solic itors to Mr Ueda’s solic itors. The sealed notic e of appeal, however, whic h was issued on 16 July 2018, was not served 

on Mr Ueda’s solic itors until 26 July 2018. [note: 49] There was no dispute that this was due to the inadvertenc e of Mr Bajaj’s solic itors. Order 56 r 1(3) of the ROC provides that the applic able time frame for servic e of a Notic e of Appeal is “within 7 days of it being issued”. Order 3 r 2(5) provides that where the period of time spec ified is seven days or less, days other than working days “shall be exc luded”. It was c ommon ground that the last date for proper servic e of the notic e of appeal was 25 July 2018 and Mr Bajaj’s solic itors were one day late. 

41     Again, c ounsel for Mr Bajaj did not file any applic ation for an extension of time for the servic e of the notic e of appeal. When opposing c ounsel objec ted to the tardy servic e, he then – orally – asked the c ourt for an abridgment of time. In my view, Mr Bajaj required an extension of the time frame beyond seven days in order to c orrec t the proc edural irregularity in servic e. _Black’s Law Dictionary_ (Thomson Reuters, 10th Ed, 2014) at p 8 defines “abridgment” as “the reduc tion or diminution of something c onc rete (as a treatise) or abstrac t (as a legal right)”. Put in c ontext, this was the shortening of the applic able time frame provided by law. Despite his insistenc e that the proper applic ation was for an abridgment of time, in the interests of justic e, I nevertheless c onsidered the applic ation on the basis of a request for an extension of time. 

42     The Court of Appeal in _Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party and others and another suit_ [2008] 1 SLR (R) 757 (“ _Lee Hsien Loong_ ”) at [18]–[28] has c onfirmed that the four fac tors of (a) the length of the delay, (b) the reasons for the delay, (c ) the c hanc es of suc c eeding on appeal and, (d) the degree of prejudic e, are the fac tors to be c onsidered when dec iding an applic ation to extend time to serve a notic e of appeal. These four fac tors are of equal importanc e and must be taken into ac c ount and balanc ed amongst one another having regard to all the fac ts and c irc umstanc es of the c ase c onc erned; although, in c onsidering the merits of appeal, the threshold is a low one (see _Lee Hsien Loong_ at [19] and [28]). With regard to the fac tors of the length and reason for delay, the c ourt also noted, at [21], that “it would generally be the c ase that an extremely short delay might be exc used without the need for the c ourt to inquire at length into the reasons for that delay”. 

43     Counsel for Mr Ueda foc used his objec tion to the extension of time on the fac tor of “reason for delay”. He highlighted that c ounsel for Mr Bajaj was responsible for the delay in serving the notic e of appeal and henc e Mr Bajaj c ould not be granted an extension of time. He c ited two c ases to support his position: the Malaysian c ase of _Ooi Chew Seng v Ultratech Sdn Bhd & Ors_ [1997] 2 MLJ 344 (“ _Ooi Chew Seng_ ”) as well as the Singapore High Court dec ision of _Stansfield Business International Pte Ltd (trading as Stansfield School of Business) v Vithya Sri Sumathis_ <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR(R) 927</span> (“ _Stansfield Business_ ”). 


44     I did not think either c ase went far enough to support Mr Ueda’s position. _Ooi Chew Seng_ merely c onfirms that servic e of an unsealed notic e of appeal is invalid servic e (see _Ooi Chew Seng_ at 349–350). This was not in dispute. As for _Stansfield Business_ , while the c ase appears to suggest that a default on the part of the solic itors may disentitle a party from rec eiving an extension of time from the Court (see _Stansfield Business at_ [33]), the Court of Appeal c larified in the later dec ision of _Nomura Regionalisation Venture Fund Ltd v Ethical Investments Ltd_ [2000] 2 SLR (R) 926 ( _“Nomura_ ”), that “there is no absolute rule of law whic h presc ribes that an error on the part of a solic itor or his staff c an never, under any c irc umstanc es be a suffic ient ground” (at [28]). In _Nomura_ , the Court of Appeal affirmed the dec ision of the judge, who granted the extension on the basis that the delay was not prolonged, the solic itors were not tardy in pursuing the appeal, the mistake was _bona fide_ , the appeal was not utterly hopeless and there was no prejudic e to the appellant (see _Nomura_ at [34]–[35]). 

45     In the present c ase, there was a delay of only one day. There was also no prejudic e oc c asioned by the mistake of Mr Bajaj’s solic itors. Mr Ueda was aware of the appeal. His solic itors rec eived the unsealed c opy of the notic e of appeal on 13 July 2018 when it was filed, and solic itors for Mr Bajaj followed on to apply for a _quia timet_ injunc tion to restrain a bankruptc y applic ation by Mr Ueda in order to prevent Mr Bajaj’s appeal from being rendered nugatory. The date for the Registrar’s Appeal was also made c lear during the _inter partes_ hearing of the _quia timet_ injunc tion before a duty 

senior judge on 17 July 2018. [note: 50] The issues raised in the appeal, on the low threshold envisaged by _Lee Hsien Loong_ , merited c onsideration. In light of the short length of delay and lac k of prejudic e to Mr Ueda, I found it appropriate to exerc ise my disc retion to grant an extension of time to Mr Bajaj for the servic e of his notic e of appeal. 

46     Having dealt with the preliminary issues, I turn, then, to the reasons why I did not set aside the Statutory Demand. 

**Application to set aside the Statutory Demand** 

47     Rule 97 of the Bankruptc y Rules (Cap 20, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Bankruptc y Rules”) allows a debtor to apply to set aside a statutory demand for reasons spec ified in Rule 98. The applic able portion of Rule 98 reads as follows: 

 Hearing of application to set aside statutory demand 

**98.** —(1) On hearing the applic ation, the c ourt may either summarily determine the applic ation or adjourn it, giving suc h direc tions as it thinks appropriate. 

 (2) The c ourt shall set aside the statutory demand if — 

 (a) the debtor appears to have a valid c ounterc laim, setoff or c ross demand whic h is equivalent to or exc eeds the amount of the debt or debts spec ified in the statutory demand; 

 (b) the debt is disputed on grounds whic h appear to the c ourt to be substantial ... 

 ... 

48     Paragraph 144(3) of the Supreme Court Prac tic e Direc tions provides further guidanc e on how r 98(2) of the Bankruptc y Rules is to be applied: 

 144. Applications to set aside statutory demands made under the Bankruptcy Rules 


## ... 

 (3) When the debtor: 

 (a) c laims to have a c ounterc laim, setoff or c ross demand (whether or not he c ould have raised it in the ac tion or proc eedings in whic h the judgment or order was obtained) whic h equals or exc eeds the amount of the debt or debts spec ified in the statutory demand; or 

 (b) disputes the debt (not being a debt subjec t to a judgment or order), 

 the Court will normally set aside the statutory demand if, in its opinion, on the evidenc e there is a genuine triable issue. 

49     From the provisions set out above, it is c lear that in order to set aside a statutory demand on the basis of r 98(2)(a)–(b) of the Bankruptc y Rules, the debtor must show that there is a “genuine triable issue” in relation to either a valid c ounterc laim, set off or c rossdemand (r 98(2)(a)) or a dispute over the debt on substantial grounds (r 98(2)(b)). In this c ontext, the Court of Appeal in _Mohd Zain bin Abdullah v Chimbusco International Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2014] 2 SLR 446</span> (“ _Chimbusco_ ”) has emphasised at [30] that a mere assertion of a triable issue is insuffic ient, : 

 ... The c ourt must examine all the facts to asc ertain whether the “genuine triable issue” test in para 144 of the Prac tic e Direc tions is satisfied. The upshot of this is that the c ourt will only set aside a statutory demand (and thereby require a c reditor to initiate a c ivil suit if he wishes to pursue the c laimed debt further) where the debtor is able to adduc e evidenc e on affidavit that raises a triable issue. 

50     In this c ase, Mr Bajaj argued that, as envisaged in rr 98(2)(a) and (b) of the Bankruptc y Rules, the debts in the Statutory Demand were substantially disputed by the plaintiff, or alternatively, that Mr Bajaj had a valid c ounterc laim, setoff or c ross c laim that exc eeded the value of the demanded 

sums. [note: 51] 

**Is there a substantial dispute on the debt?** 

51     The Settlement Agreement formed the basis of the Statutory Demand. Mr Bajaj c ontended that the following gave rise to triable issues: 

 (a) Mr Ueda had breac hed various obligations of the Settlement Agreement in the neutral evaluation proc ess whic h would disentitle him from deriving any benefit from the Settlement Agreement; [note: 52] 

 (b) the opinion given by the Neutral was qualified and was not final and binding; [note: 53] 

 (c ) the proper c ourse for parties, in view of Mr Bajaj’s dispute, would be a return to mediation under Clause 16 of the Settlement Agreement; [note: 54] and 

 (d) the Clause 10 Debt and the Clause 6 Debt were not due. [note: 55] 

52     These issues deal with various issues of law relating to the Settlement Agreement and the neutral evaluation c ompleted by Mr Akhtar. I therefore deal first with the arguments c onc erning the 


approac h of the c ourt on questions of law in the c ontext of statutory demands. 

**_Approach to questions of law in applications to set aside statutory demands_** 

53     Counsel for Mr Bajaj submitted that “a statutory demand c an be set aside where there is a 

question of law whic h amounts to one single genuine triable issue”. [note: 56] In the hearing before me, he relied on the c ase of _Ang Ai Tee v Resource Credit Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2017] 5 SLR 402</span> (“ _Ang Ai Tee_ ”) to suggest that if there was a question on law before the c ourt, the c ourt exerc ising its bankruptc y jurisdic tion would be c ompelled to setaside the statutory demand and let the matter be dec ided at a c ourt exerc ising c ivil jurisdic tion at trial. Several of the issues identified above (at [51]) required the c ourt to c onsider the legal effec t of the words of the Settlement Agreement. Counsel for Mr Bajaj argued that bec ause the legal effec t of the words of the Settlement Agreement was disputed by parties, there was a genuine triable issue and the Statutory Demand had to be set aside. 

54     It was not disputed that it is not the func tion of a bankruptc y c ourt to c onduc t a full hearing of the dispute and adjudic ate on the merits of the c reditor’s c laim (see _Wong Kwei Cheong v ABN-AMRO Bank NV_ <span class="citation">[2002] 2 SLR(R) 31</span> at [3]). Nevertheless, the mere fac t that a question of law has been raised by the debtor c annot and should not automatic ally result in the setting aside of the Statutory Demand. In _Ang Ai Tee_ the c ourt set aside a statutory demand that was served by a lic ensed moneylender on a borrower on the grounds that there was a substantial dispute over the debt ( _Ang Ai Tee_ at [72]). A key issue before the c ourt was whether the lic ensed moneylender had infringed c ertain provisions of the Moneylenders Ac t (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“MLA”) by imposing a 10% administrative fee for every loan refinanc ing arrangement ( _Ang Ai Tee_ at [36]–[38]). This was an issue that involved the interpretation of the Ac t in question. Instead of immediately dec laring that there was a genuine triable issue, and deferring the matter to trial, the c ourt embarked on an examination of the applic able provisions of the Ac t and the applic able subsidiary legislation and even disc ussed the parliamentary intent behind the enac tment of c ertain provisions ( _Ang Ai Tee_ at [39]–[40], [49]–[53]). It was only after the c ourt determined the legal effec t of the MLA that the c ourt turned to examine the fac ts and c onc lude that there were triable issues. ( _Ang Ai Tee_ at [54]). From this reading of _Ang Ai Tee_ , it is c lear that even a c ourt exerc ising bankruptc y jurisdic tion may legitimately determine questions of law. 

55     This approac h is c onsistent with the guidanc e of the Court of Appeal in _Chimbusco_ , where it was emphasised that the affidavits must reveal a genuine issue for trial: see above, at [49]. An issue before the Court of Appeal in _Chimbusco_ was whether it was possible for a c ourt to grant a c onditional stay of bankruptc y proc eedings. The Court of Appeal held that it was appropriate to extend the analogy of a summary judgment applic ation to the imposition of c onditions for granting a stay of bankruptc y proc eedings (see _Chimbusco_ at [18]). The c ourt at [22] highlighted that to hold otherwise would entail several diffic ulties: 

 22 If a bankruptc y c ourt were unwilling to grant a c onditional stay of bankruptc y proc eedings and were to dismiss outright a bankruptc y applic ation on the strength of a shadowy c ase, the c reditor would nec essarily have to safeguard his interest in different proc eedings. This would involve his filing a writ and statement of c laim and making a summary judgment applic ation, whereupon the same issues that were c anvassed before the bankruptc y c ourt would have to be rehearsed in detail. This c ould involve the same waste of resourc es that justifies the extension of summary judgment princ iples to the insolvenc y c ontext in the first plac e (see [17] above). Worse still, it c ould unfairly prejudic e the interests of the c reditor as he fac es the risk of the debtor using the delay to dissipate his assets. The court should therefore be astute to avoid taking an overly formalistic approach in exercising its jurisdiction: matters that a bankruptcy court can determine as well as a civil court should be resolved to the fullest extent possible at the first 


 opportunity. After all, in Singapore, the bankruptc y c ourt is the same c ourt as the c ivil c ourt, albeit exerc ising a different jurisdic tion. [Emphasis added] 

56     In my view, these c onc erns are equally pertinent in the c ontext of setting aside a statutory demand. A c reditor ought not to be put to unnec essary expense. If, after being made to c ommenc e a writ ac tion, a c reditor c ould obtain summary judgment on that writ ac tion, he would have been put to wasted c osts. The same rationale undergirds the remedy of summary judgment and the setting aside of statutory demands. If the interposition of a trial would add nothing to the information already available to the c ourt to make a determination on a question of law, doing so would inc rease c osts to no effic ac ious purpose, entail a waste of judic ial resourc es and c ause undue delay whic h would result in unfair prejudic e to the c reditor who has been kept waiting. 

57     Therefore, to the extent that there were questions of law in relation to determining the legal effec t of the words of the Settlement Agreement, I dealt with these in the manner explained below. 

**_The Settlement Amount under Clause 3_** 

58     I have given a detailed ac c ount of the evaluation proc ess in the bac kground sec tion, bec ause Mr Bajaj made many c ontentions whic h may be distilled as follows. First, Mr Ueda’s nonc omplianc e with his Clause 8 disc losure obligation disallows him the fruits of his c onduc t, the Settlement Amount. Sec ond, bec ause the independent ac c ountant’s report is qualified, the Settlement Amount is not binding on parties as envisaged in Clause 9 of the Settlement Agreement. And third, in these c irc umstanc es, the only c ourse is to return to mediation as provided by Clause 16 of the Settlement Agreement. 

_Has Mr Ueda breached his obligations?_ 

59     It was not disputed that the NAV of Hac himan Cayman in 2010 and 2011 were c omponents of Table X and Y. It was also not disputed that Mr Ueda had agreed to supply the nec essary doc uments. Mr Bajaj c ontended that Mr Ueda breac hed Clause 8 of the Settlement Agreement, whic h reads as 

follows: [note: 57] 

8\. All parties will take all nec essary steps to proc ure that the parties and the Independent     Ac c ountant are to be given free and unfettered ac c ess to all doc uments of [Hac himan Cayman] and all related entities for the purposes of [Clause 1] above; 

Both tables c ontained a footnote (the “Underlying Doc uments Footnote”), whic h read as follows: [note: 58] 

 ^This is to be c alc ulated relying on the underlying bank statements and any other doc ument exc ept for the audited ac c ounts 

Mr Bajaj’s c ontention was that the CNB and Kaneyama Doc uments were nec essary for the c alc ulation of NAV in Table X, and were not made available. 

60     The fundamental question, nevertheless, was whether the CNB and Kaneyama Doc uments were relevant to Mr Akhtar’s task. The mere fac t that Mr Bajaj desired the doc uments did not make it nec essary for Mr Ueda to proc ure them. The obligation under Clause 8 is qualified by the phrase “for the purposes of [Clause 1] above”. Mr Ueda was only obliged to take all nec essary steps to proc ure doc uments for the purposes of Clause 1. Likewise, the Underlying Doc uments Footnote requires that the NAV of Hac himan Cayman (a c omponent of Table X and Y) be c alc ulated with referenc e to 


underlying bank statements _and other documents_. It does not suggest that it must be c alc ulated solely on underlying bank statements, nor does it suggest that Mr Bajaj was entitled to demand any doc ument he wished. Mr Ueda, in submitting his c ase statement c ontaining 86 pages of doc uments suc h as management ac c ounts, transac tion rec ords and bank statements at 2015 (see [10] above), [note: 59] and further, in writing to all relevant parties to authorise ac c ess in 2016 (see [19] above), 

had suffic iently disc harged his obligations under the Settlement Agreement. It is signific ant to note that both Clause 8 and the Underlying Doc uments Footnote were limited in sc ope to doc uments relevant for the purpose of c alc ulating and populating Tables X and Y. Mr Akhtar was satisfied, as early as in 13 Oc tober 2015, that the doc uments made available were suffic ient to populate Tables X 

and Y (see [15] above). [note: 60] 

61     Clause 8 must also be reasonably limited to doc uments within Mr Ueda’s power or possession. The CNB ac c ount was c losed and while the Kaneyama doc uments were not in his possession, Mr Ueda authorised Kaneyama to release doc uments to Mr Bajaj’s satisfac tion. Despite this, Mr Akhtar went further and reviewed the rec ords at Tric or’s offic es and was satisfied with the adequac y of the 

rec ords by 24 February 2016 (see [18] above). [note: 61] This c hec k was important bec ause the request for the CNB and Kaneyama doc uments related to Mr Bajaj’s allegations about a loan made to TY Japan that was subsequently rec orded by Tric or as returned to a Tric or trust ac c ount. There is no merit in any of Mr Bajaj’s c ontentions about the loan. Tric or is an independent third party against whom Mr Bajaj has made no allegations. Neither is there any merit in his allegations about missing proc eeds from the liquidation of the TY entities, whic h was furnished as the reason for the request for the Kaneyama doc uments. Mr Bajaj was an equal shareholder and would rec eive half of those proc eeds in liquidation; if not, his rec ourse would be with the liquidators. Mr Bajaj raised these last disc losure requests simply to stall c ompletion of the proc ess. 

_Parties’ duty to cooperate_ 

62     In this c ontext, it is useful to deal with the duty to c ooperate reposed on parties. Mr Bajaj raised the argument that Mr Ueda had breac hed his implied duty to c ooperate. In my view, it was Mr Bajaj who was remiss in c ooperating. I deal with it here as it is relevant to how Clauses 9 and 16 should be dealt with. 

6       3 _Evergreat Construction Co Pte Ltd v Presscrete Engineering Pte Ltd_ [2006] 1 SLR (R) 634 (“ _Evergreat_ ”) formed the premise of Mr Bajaj’s argument on this point. There, a main c ontrac tor and a subc ontrac tor were in a dispute over delayed c onstruc tion works and agreed to a c onsent order, referring all pending c laims to an Independent Assessor from the c onstruc tion industry who would assess the respec tive c laims as an expert rather than an arbitrator. The Independent Assessor held a first meeting with both parties, where various timelines regarding filing of c laim papers, exc hange of doc uments, payment of fees and hearing dates were unequivoc ally agreed to. The main c ontrac tor c omplied with the timeline for filing c laim papers but disregarded every other timeline. It also did not pay for its share of the Independent Assessor’s fees, whic h was a breac h of the c onsent order. For the next few months, the main c ontrac tor c ontinued to disregard a whole host of direc tives and attempts from the Independent Assessor to engage the main c ontrac tor, despite warnings from the Independent Assessor that an award would be issued on the basis of the evidenc e as submitted by the subc ontrac tor if the main c ontrac tor did not c omply with the orders and attend the meetings/hearings as agreed. 

64     The Independent Assessor, in his award, struc k out the main c ontrac tor’s c laim and defenc e to the subc ontrac tor’s c ounterc laim and awarded a sum of slightly over $350,000 to the subc ontrac tor. On an applic ation to set the award aside, V K Rajah J (as he then was), found that the 


main c ontrac tor “was to all intents and purposes c ompletely uninterested and unc onc erned about the assessment proc edure and/or outc ome” and in “c ontumac ious disregard” of the direc tions of the Independent Assessor (see _Evergreat_ at [13] and [15]). Rajah J held, at [29], that in the absenc e of fraud or any c orrupt c olouring of the Independent Assessor’s determination, there were no grounds to reopen the merits of the c ase, in light of the c ontrac tual bargain of the parties to have their c ase finally and irrevoc ably determined by an expert. 

65     Rajah J, at [48]–[51], was of the view that parties must be assumed to intend the performanc e of a c ontrac t they agree to, and an implied duty to c ooperate arose therefrom. Bec ause the main c ontrac tor had repudiated its obligation, the subc ontrac tor should be absolved from the c onsequenc es of the main c ontrac tor’s c onduc t. The wider princ iple at play was that a party in default under a c ontrac t c annot take advantage of its own breac h to gain a benefit or evade his c ontrac tual obligations. Rajah J stated at [52]: 

 52 In order to invoke this princ iple it must be shown that the c ontrac tual right or benefit that a party is asserting or c laiming is a direc t result of that party’s prior breac h of c ontrac t. The relevant breac h, the fac tual c onsequenc es flowing from the breac h and the advantage the c ontrac t breaker is seeking to raise must be identified. The princ iple seeks to prevent the c ontrac t breaker from seeking an “advantage” arising from his default... 

Therefore, the main c ontrac tor was not entitled to take advantage of the alleged breac h of the terms of referenc e, whic h was c aused by the main c ontrac tor’s failure to c ooperate. 

66     I would highlight that in the present c ase, the duty to c ooperate is express, and not merely implied. Clause 15 provides that “parties undertake to take all reasonable endeavours” to give effec t to the Settlement Agreement. Mr Bajaj’s behaviour over the c ourse of this dispute is squarely a breac h of his duty to c ooperate. As set out at [10]–[30] above, Mr Bajaj embarked on a c ourse of c onduc t that was c ompletely antithetic al to the smooth func tioning of the neutral evaluation proc ess. He did not show up for prearranged hearings, was tardy and unresponsive in his replies and gave dubious exc uses for his absenc es. It was only after the threat of an opinion being issued in his absenc e that he sprang into ac tion, making spurious allegations alleging bias on the part of Mr Akhtar. [note: 62] Then, some seven months after the originally sc heduled c larific ation hearing that Mr Bajaj 

failed to attend, Mr Bajaj raised for the first time the issue of ac c ess to sourc e doc uments and his 

c onc erns about the reliability of the ac c ounts. [note: 63] Mr Akhtar’s efforts to plac ate Mr Bajaj resulted in the dispute dragging on until November 2016. A proposal for a meeting with the Mediator at this point was rejec ted by Mr Bajaj, and he insisted on the rec eipt of the CNB and Kaneyama Doc uments before proc eeding further; he also raised another new allegation whic h had no bearing on 

Tables X and Y. [note: 64] It was only in August 2017, more than two years after the originally sc heduled c larific ation meeting, and six months after the proposal for a meeting with the Mediator was roundly rejec ted by Mr Bajaj, that Mr Bajaj suddenly c laimed that he intended to c ontac t the 

Mediator. [note: 65] Even then, no c ontac t appeared to have been made with the Mediator. It appeared to me that Mr Bajaj’s ac tions were c alc ulated to drag out the proc eedings for as long as possible, rather than to seek a prompt resolution of the dispute pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement. The delay of more than two years was c aused by Mr Bajaj’s disregard for agreed hearing dates, failure to answer emails, a demand for Mr Akhtar to rec use himself on grounds of bias, and then, as a last resort, a demand for doc uments with peripheral relevanc e. 

67     If Mr Bajaj had promptly raised all his c onc erns at the proper time when the doc uments were supplied in February 2015 or at the agreed c larific ation date of 2 April 2015, it would have been easier to fault Mr Ueda for not doing more to provide the doc uments that Mr Bajaj desired. Mr Bajaj well 


knew that the passage of time would have had an impac t on the ease of proc uring the doc uments sought; their plan was to wind up their joint business whic h nec essitated c losure of ac c ounts and liquidation of c ompanies. His insistenc e on these doc uments, when he knew they were not within Mr Ueda’s power, c ontrol or possession, resulted in the qualific ation of Mr Akhtar’s Report. In c onsidering whether Clauses 9 and 16 apply, on the basis of _Evergreat_ , Mr Bajaj may not be allowed the benefit of his own misc onduc t. 

68     Mr Bajaj’s breac h of his duty to c ooperate, then, would have been suffic ient to deal with his c ontentions on Clauses 9 and 16. Nevertheless, his c ontentions on those c lauses were in any event without merit, and I turn to explain why. 

_Was Mr Akhtar’s calculation final and binding?_ 

69     The final and binding nature of Mr Akhtar’s c alc ulations is provided for in Clause 9 whic h states: [note: 66] 

9\. The Independent Ac c ountant’s c alc ulations shall be final and binding on both parties 

70     The arguments foc used on the qualific ations made by Mr Akhtar in his Report, whic h stated: [note: 67] 

5\. Although the terms of referenc e... stated this to be a “Doc uments only NE”, Mr. Bajaj has all along c laimed that he does not have doc uments to submit; supporting his stanc e by alleging that     Mr. Ueda has refused to provide ac c ess to the underlying business and ac c ounting doc uments, sinc e Parties fell out with eac h other. 

6\. This was indeed a surprising revelation and should have been surfac ed and addressed during the mediation. As it transpired, the only doc uments submitted to me c ame from Mr. Ueda ... 

 ... 

29\. In view of the c irc umstanc es enc ountered, and for the reasons desc ribed below, I am unable to wholly c arry out the terms of referenc e of my appointment as [Neutral Evaluator]: 

 ... 

 v) ...I do not ac c ept that in the event of no agreement between Parties as to the opening NAV, the [Independent Ac c ountant] must take it upon himself to determine the amount. If [Hac himan Cayman’s] c onsolidated ac c ounts had been duly audited I c ould have made referenc e to suc h ac c ounts in extrac ting the NAV at end 2010. In the absenc e of suc h audited ac c ounts I expec t Parties to c onfirm their agreement as to the books and rec ords of [Hac himan Cayman] that represent the sourc e from whic h the [Independent Ac c ountant] is able to extrac t the relevant information. In the situation at hand we have one party (Mr. Ueda) presenting the NAV as extrac ted from the ac c ounts prepared by Tric or; but the other party (Mr. Bajaj) is refusing to ac c ept the NAV so submitted on the grounds that he has been denied ac c ess to the underlying sourc e doc uments and information. This is a fundamental issue whic h parties should have dealt with either a) prior to entering into the Settlement Agreement, or b) by providing a proc edure in the Settlement Agreement as to how the NAV at end 2010 was to be determined... 

 vi) ... In an effort to find a way forward I managed to obtain Mr. Ueda’s agreement to allow 


 Mr. Bajaj to have ac c ess to supporting doc uments that Mr. Bajaj demanded in order for him to be able to satisfy himself as to the propriety of the doc uments; and thereafter to either, i) ac c ept that the information provided to me by Mr. Ueda is ac c urate; or, ii) to spec ific ally identify the areas of his disagreement with appropriate explanations and the impac t thereof on the Tables X and Y. 

 vii) However, having rec eived the doc uments from Tric or, Mr. Bajaj has c ontinued to demand original bank statements from Cayman National Bank as well as doc uments (direc tly from Mr. Kaneyama of [TY Japan]) to support a full ac c ount of the amounts loaned by [Hac himan Cayman] to [TY Japan]. Mr. Ueda c onfirmed through his Counsel, WP, that he does not have original bank statements as they were never rec eived form [ sic ] the bank; the bank always sent soft (sc anned) c opies elec tronic ally... Similarly, Mr. Ueda c onfirmed through Tric or that there are no original invoic es from [TY Japan] for SubAdvisory Fee c harged to [Hac himan Singapore]. ... 

30\. In my view, Parties must adopt either of the following to enable the [Settlement Agreement] to be implemented; 

 i) Take the dispute bac k to mediation (in ac c ordanc e with Clause 16 of the [Settlement Agreement]) to address and c ome to an agreement on the issue of appropriate underlying books and rec ords, supporting doc uments and the financ ial statements to be used in determining the NAV and the c onsequential Settlement Amount. ... 

 ii) Alternatively, Parties should agree to appoint an independent auditor to perform an audit of the financ ial statements of [Hac himan Cayman] as at and for the period ended 31 Dec ember 2010 as well as 31 Dec ember 2011. ... 

**D**. **QUALIFIED OPINION IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 10.5 6 OF THE NEUTRAL EVALUATION RULES** 

31\. Based on the c ase statements and underlying doc uments submitted by Mr. Ueda, Tables X and Y of the Settlement Agreement, populated as required under c lause 1 of the [Settlement     Agreement], are attac hed herewith as **Annexures 3 and 4**. The settlement amount ... amounts t o **$226,481.92** payable by Mr. Bajaj to Mr Ueda. However, these numbers are subjec t to adjustments for the reasons desc ribed in Paragraph 29 above. Ac c ordingly, the NAV as at 31     Dec ember 2011 as well as the settlement amount of S$226,481.92 are subjec t to c hanges depending on adjustments that may result from: 

 a) Parties reac hing agreement on disputed items desc ribed in paragraph 29 (and others, if any) through mediation; or 

 b) Parties agreeing to resolve the disputed items by appointing an independent auditor to perform an audit of the financ ial statements of [Hac himan Cayman] for the periods ended 31 Dec ember 2010 and 31 Dec ember 2011. 

 ... 

(^6) Rule 10.5: “If the Neutral is of the view that further investigations should be c onduc ted after the Evaluation Session(s), parties should be informed ac c ordingly. Unless parties agree to c ommission suc h an investigation, the Neutral shall render an opinion based solely on the submissions and evidenc e available. The Neutral may qualify the opinion to explain the c onstraints 


 under whic h the opinion was rendered.” 

 [Emphasis in original] 

71     I have set out the relevant parts of the Report here in some detail bec ause Mr Bajaj’s c ase rested on these extrac ts. The c ruc ial point to c onsider was the effec t of Mr Akhtar’s qualific ations, and whether they rendered the Report and the Settlement Amount c alc ulated invalid. For the reasons whic h follow, I held that they did not. 

72     It was not disputed that the neutral evaluation proc ess whic h produc ed Mr Akhtar’s Report was in the nature of an expert determination. _Evergreat_ is of assistanc e on this point. There, Rajah J, in c onc luding, at [43] and [47] that the expert’s terms of referenc e were not breac hed, set out, at [41]–[42], the situations where an expert determination in the c ontext of an arbitration c ould be c hallenged: 

 41 The c rux of the matter is that if the parties agree to appoint an expert to resolve a dispute, his report or award c annot be c hallenged unless the expert has departed from his instruc tions in some material respec t. ... 

 42 In Commonwealth of Australia v Wawbe Pty Ltd (BC 9805379, Lexis) Gillard J, c orrec tly, in my view, observed: 

 In each case the critical question must always be: Was the valuation made in accordance with the terms of a contract? If it is, it is nothing to the point that the valuation may have proc eeded on the basis of error or that it c onstitutes a gross over or under value. Nor is it relevant that the valuer has taken into c onsideration matters whic h he should not have taken into ac c ount or has failed to take into ac c ount matters whic h he should have taken into ac c ount. The question is not whether there is an error in the discretionary judgment of the valuer. It is whether the valuation complies with the terms of the contract. 

 [Emphasis in original] 

73     These princ iples were reiterated in _Geowin Construction Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1256_ <span class="citation">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1004</span> (“ _Geowin_ ”) at [8]. _Geowin_ was a c ase where one of the parties to a Settlement Agreement c hallenged an expert determination on the grounds that the expert had breac hed her c ontrac tual obligations by failing to make a proper assessment. The agreement provided that the dec ision of the expert was “final and no appeal [should] lie against suc h a dec ision”. Rajah J examined the effec ts of expert dec isions that were expressed to be final at [19]: 

 19 If the parties agree that an expert’s dec ision is final, a c ourt should not inquire (in the absenc e of a c harge of fraud or c ollusion): 

 (a) how a dec ision has been reac hed; 

 (b) into the basis for the dec ision; or 

 (c ) whether the dec ision was indeed c orrec t. 

 To do so would be entirely c ontrary to the parties’ c ontrac tual intentions to be bound by an 


 expert’s dec ision – partic ularly if the agreement itself expressly stipulates that the dec ision of the expert is final. I respec tfully c onc ur with Lord Denning MR’s view in Campbell v Edwards ([16] supra ) that the only errors that c an be c orrec ted by the c ourt are those that appear on the “ face ” of the award or report (see at [17] above). In the c ontext of a speaking award, the c ourt should not stray beyond the ac tual report or award in c onsidering how or why the dec ision was reac hed. The underlying evidenc e ought not to be reexamined or referred to as this would be tantamount to an appellate hearing and to that extent c ontrary to what the parties had solemnly agreed to. The right of review should be c onfined to c orrec ting apparent mistakes that appear on the fac e of the report or award ( eg apparent mathematic al misc alc ulations) and to determining whether the expert has c omplied with his terms of appointment. If an expert answers the right question in the wrong way his dec ision will nevertheless be binding ... 

Henc e Rajah J c onc luded, at [20], that the c omplaints were not suffic ient to set aside the expert determination, being nothing more than a bac kdoor attempt to reopen the merits of the c ase. 

74     Therefore, in the present c ase, the question of whether Mr Akhtar’s c alc ulations in the Report c an be relied upon turns on whether as a matter of c ontrac tual interpretation of the Settlement Agreement and the other terms agreed between the parties, Mr Akhtar had c omplied with his terms of referenc e. 

75     I found that Mr Akhtar had c omplied with his terms of referenc e. The role of the “Independent Ac c ountant” as expressed in the Settlement Agreement was a narrow one, as seen by the following: [note: 68] 

1\. The parties are to jointly appoint an Independent Ac c ountant to _calculate and populate_ the entries in the enc losed Tables X and Y; 

2\. The Settlement Amount is to be c alc ulated as follows with referenc e to the enc losed Tables X and Y: 

 a. Add the amounts at (i) Table X(E)(4) and (ii) Table Y(E) 

 b. Divide the above sum [at 2(a)] by 2; 

 ... 

9\. The Independent Ac c ountant’s c alc ulations shall be final and binding on both parties; 

 [Emphasis added] 

76     From the above, it is c lear that Mr Akhtar’s role was merely to “c alc ulate and populate” the entries and onc e he had done so, his c alc ulations would be final and binding on both parties. Mr Akhtar fulfilled this role. At paragraph 31 of the Report, based on c ase statements and underlying doc uments submitted by Mr Ueda, Mr Akhtar populated Tables X and Y and c ame up with a figure for the Settlement Amount. 

77     Muc h was made about the fac t that Mr Akhtar appeared to think that he did not “wholly c arry 

out the terms of referenc e” [note: 69] and also proposed that the parties return to mediation or seek an audit of the financ ial doc uments. Nevertheless, the Settlement Agreement only states that Mr Akht ar’s _calculations_ are binding on the parties. The sc ope of Mr Akhtar’s remit did not extend to ruling on the legal effec t of his award. That is the provinc e of the c ourt. 


78     My c onc lusion that Mr Akhtar’s role was intended to be narrow in sc ope is fortified by the type of evaluation the parties had agreed to. The parties had agreed to a “Doc uments only” Neutral 

Evaluation. [note: 70] The Neutral Evaluation Rules provides that a “Doc umentsonly Evaluation” 

although the Rule 10.1 allowed the Neutral to seek c larific ations. [note: 71] Mr Akhtar’s opinion was intended to have been served ten working days from the date of the last “Evaluation Session(s) or 

further investigation or site visit”. [note: 72] If Mr Bajaj had turned up on 2 April 2016 as agreed, the Report may have been issued in April 2016. Although the parties subsequently embarked on further hearings and meetings, this initial agreement reflec ted the understanding that the neutral evaluation proc ess was not intended to be a detailed and drawn out proc ess, but rather, a c onfined proc ess c onc luding with an effic ient expert c alc ulation. 

79     Therefore, I found that Mr Akhtar had c omplied with his terms of referenc e, his qualific ations notwithstanding, and henc e the c alc ulation in the Report, and the Settlement Amount, was final and binding on the parties. 

_What is the effect of Clause 16?_ 

80     Clause 16 states: 

16\. Parties undertake to return before [the Mediator] for further mediation to resolve any disputes or issues arising out of the performanc e of this Settlement Agreement 

81     Mr Bajaj argued that there was a dispute between the parties as to Mr Akhtar’s c alc ulations, 

and Clause 16 operated suc h that Mr Ueda was obliged to go for mediation. [note: 73] This was ac c ompanied by a suggestion for a stay in aid of a mediation agreement pursuant to the s 8 of the 

Mediation Ac t (Ac t 1 of 2017). [note: 74] 

82     The question that c onfronts the c ourt in this c ase is whether in the c irc umstanc es, Mr Bajaj is entitled to raise any dispute, however spurious, in order to defeat the final and binding c alc ulations provided by Mr Akhtar. This c annot be the c ase. Clause 16 must be subjec t to a standard of reasonableness, made express in Clause 15, whic h states: 

15\. Parties undertake to take all reasonable endeavours to give effec t to and implement the terms of this Settlement Agreement 

83     It follows then, from the flow and form of the Settlement Agreement, that if a partic ular request to refer a dispute for mediation is not part of a reasonable endeavour to give effec t to and implement the terms of this Settlement Agreement, suc h a request would fall outside the sc ope of Clause 16. 

84     In my judgment, Mr Bajaj’s belated attempt to return to mediation was merely the latest gambit, in a series of many, to delay the resolution of the dispute for as long as possible. When rec ourse to the Mediator was first suggested by the SMC in November 2016, Mr Ueda agreed but Mr Bajaj refused, insisting on rec eipt of the CNB and Kaneyama doc uments before proc eeding further. [note: 75] Mr Bajaj’s c hange of heart only c ame in May 2017 when he realised that Mr Akhtar was 

intending to issue a report despite Mr Bajaj’s various objec tions and allegations, albeit a qualified one. [note: 76] His response at that point, whic h I detail at [26] above, also c ontained an insistenc e that 

he would not regard suc h a report as a valid one. Mr Ueda’s refusal at that point was entirely reasonable. The attempt to refer the dispute to mediation was not a reasonable attempt to resolve 


issues relating to the enforc ement of the Settlement Agreement but in fac t an attempt to stymie, onc e again, its implementation. Clause 16 was not applic able. 

**_The Clause 10 Debt_** 

85     Mr Bajaj c ontended that Clause 17 of the Settlement Agreement “envisages that any payment made between the parties pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, would be made after the [Settlement Amount] is finalised.” On this basis, the Clause 10 sum was c onditional on the Settlement 

Amount being made final and binding. [note: 77] 

86     I was of the view, in any event, that the Settlement Amount was final. I highlight, nevertheless, that the effec t of Clauses 10 and 17 is to make all sums, inc luding that under Clause 10, payable onc e the first of 30 instalments is not made by the first business day of the month following the release of the Report. They read: 

10\. [Mr Bajaj] is to pay [Mr Ueda] USD50,000 

 ... 

17\. All payments arising from this Settlement Agreement are to be made in the following manner from the date of the Independent Ac c ountant’s report:- 

 a. In the event that payment is to be made by [Mr Bajaj], the same is to be made by equal instalments over a period of 30 months on the first business day of eac h month and the first instalment payment is to be due no earlier than 1 November 2014; 

 b. In the event that payment is to be made by [Mr Ueda], the same is to be made by equal instalments over a period of 6 months on the first business day of eac h month; 

 c. The first instalment payment by the paying party is to be paid one month after the date of issue of the Independent Ac c ountant’s report or on 1 November 2014 whic hever is later; 

 d. If any instalment payment is not made by the first business day of eac h month by the paying party to the rec eiving party, the paying party has a further 7 days, or any further time period so agreed by the parties to effec t payment, failing whic h, the sum of the remaining instalment payments will bec ome immediately due and payable; 

87     On the fac e of the Settlement Agreement, the event that triggers the obligation to pay the Clause 10 sum is the release of Mr Akhtar’s Report. There is nothing to suggest that the Settlement Amount affec ts in any way the obligation to pay the Clause 10 sum. 

**_The Clause 6 Debt_** 

88     Mr Bajaj argued that bec ause there were breac hes of the Settlement Agreement on the part of Mr Ueda, the terms of the Neutral Evaluation Rules, whic h suggested that parties were jointly and 

severally liable for Mr Akhtar’s fees, c ould not be relied upon by Mr Ueda. [note: 78] The only relevant point is that parties agreed by Clause 6 of the Settlement Agreement to share equally all fees and expenses. Onc e the debt arose, Mr Bajaj’s share was due. 

**Whether there was a valid cross claim** 


89     Counsel for Mr Bajaj c laimed that Mr Bajaj had a valid c ross c laim in the form of an ac tion “in 

fraud or oppression”, in relation to: [note: 79] 

 (a) The alleged nonrepayment of the Hac himan Loan; 

 (b) The alleged failure to ac c ount for the sums remaining in the ac c ounts of the TY Entities prior to the liquidation of the entities; 

 (c ) The alleged winding up of Hac himan Singapore without the c onsent of Mr Bajaj and the alleged sequestering of the funds in Hac himan Singapore. 

In this c ontext, the use of the passing label of “oppression” was not explained. No assertion was made as to how this c ould ground a c laim. Any remedy for oppression pursuant to s 216 of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Ac t”), would only be available to “any member or holder of debenture of a c ompany”: s 216(1) of the Companies Ac t. It was not disputed that the 

relevant entities have been wound up. [note: 80] I deal therefore only with the assertions of fraud in this sec tion. 

90     In my view, there was no basis for the c ontentions of fraud. Of relevanc e was the fac t that all the doc uments relied on by c ounsel for Mr Bajaj in making this submission were loc ated in the two annexes to his written submissions whic h, as I mention at [39], I did not admit into evidenc e. Counsel orally informed the c ourt that the doc uments were obtained from the c ase statement folio tendered by Mr Ueda in early 2015. If this were so, it was inexplic able that a valid c ross c laim would be raised by way of annex to appellate submissions more than three years later. 

91     The c ourt was thus left with unsubstantiated assertions made in Mr Bajaj’s affidavits. As highlighted by the Court of Appeal in _Chimbusco_ (whic h I detail at [49] above), mere assertions of fraud are insuffic ient to establish a genuine triable issue. Indeed the evidenc e that was before the c ourt indic ated quite the opposite. The Report makes c lear that Mr Akhtar had, in the c ourse of his neutral evaluation, investigated the c laim that the Hac himan Loan was not repaid. After reviewing the doc uments available at Tric or’s offic es, Mr Akhtar was satisfied with the manner in whic h the 

Hac himan Loan was dealt with. [note: 81] Further, Tric or was an independent party, and the management ac c ounts prepared by Tric or for Hac himan Cayman stated that the Hac himan Loan was 

repaid into a Tric or trust ac c ount. [note: 82] Mr Bajaj stated that: “it has never been my intention to c hallenge the work produc t of Tric or ... However, my position has c onsistently been that Tric or’s ability to generate a true and c omplete ac c ount of Hac himan Cayman, would be dependent on it being 

given ac c ess to the full set of Sourc e Doc uments by [Mr Bajaj]...”. [note: 83] This assertion lac ks premise: as the Tric or trust ac c ount was maintained by Tric or, there was no need to rely on external doc uments from Mr Ueda to trac k monies flowing into the Tric or trust ac c ount. 

92     I ac c ordingly found that there was no genuine triable issue in relation to any of the c ross c laims c ontended. 

**Whether it was appropriate to grant a conditional setting aside of the statutory demand** 

93     Counsel for Mr Bajaj suggested that if the c ourt was not minded to set aside the Statutory Demand, the c ourt ought to grant a c onditional setting aside of the Statutory Demand. Suc h a stay was granted and upheld by the Court of Appeal in _Chimbusco._ The c ase involved guarantors of a loan and the c reditor, Chimbusc o International Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Chimbusc o”). Chimbusc o had issued a c all on the guarantees, but the guarantors ignored the c all and the subsequent 


statutory demands. The guarantors resisted bankruptc y proc eedings on the basis of an allegation that there were oral representations that the guarantees were meant to be mere formalities and not binding on the parties. The judge below granted a c onditional stay of bankruptc y proc eedings as he found triable issues, albeit shadowy in nature. 

94     I ac c ept that in princ iple, the c ourt c an grant a c onditional setting aside of a statutory demand. The c irc umstanc es in the present c ase were, however, markedly different from that of _Chimbusco_. The High Court, with whom the Court of Appeal agreed, found that the dispute was inc apable of resolution through affidavit evidenc e alone, given the equivoc al doc umentary evidenc e, and the fac t that the allegations pertained to oral representations made. I did not have the same diffic ulty in the present c ase. 

**Conclusion** 

95     Mr Ueda and Mr Bajaj signed their Settlement Agreement on 19 August 2014. Their Neutral Evaluation Agreement, c onc luded on 14 November 2014, spec ified a doc umentsonly evaluation by an independent ac c ountant. One would have expec ted the c alc ulation to be derived from two tables to have been a simple exerc ise for an expert. Mr Bajaj’s c onduc t resulted in in a protrac ted proc ess and a delayed Report, whic h was finally released to parties in Marc h 2018 after Mr Ueda paid for Mr Bajaj’s share of the fees. In the same manner that he has delayed eac h step of the implementation of the Settlement Agreement, Mr Bajaj has c ontinued to delay the enforc ement of sums owing under it, whic h form the basis of the Statutory Demand he sought to set aside. 

96     In my judgment, there was no substantial dispute on the debts stated in the Statutory Demand nor was there a valid c ross c laim or c ounterc laim. I ac c ordingly dismissed the Registrar’s Appeal. Costs, after hearing parties, were awarded to the defendant and fixed at $5,000 (inc lusive of disbursements).
