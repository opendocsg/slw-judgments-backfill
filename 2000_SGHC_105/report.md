## JUDGMENT: 

**GROUNDS OF DECISION** 

1\. The ac c used is 38 years old. He was tried before me on two c harges of raping his daughter (on 12 and 13 November 1998 respec tively), and one c harge of molesting her on 11 November 1998. His daughter was 15 years old at the material time. The ac c used was divorc ed from his wife (the daughter’s mother) in 1990 or 1992 (the evidenc e was not c lear on this point) and the three c hildren of the marriage inc luding the daughter and her two younger siblings then aged (8) and (6) respec tively lived with the ac c used and his sister and parents. From 1994 to 1998 the ac c used was in remand in a drug c entre and the c hildren were looked after by their paternal grandmother. 

2\. The prosec ution adduc ed evidenc e from the daughter by way of her c onditioned statement. The ac c used had no objec tion to this. Her evidenc e was that about 7pm on 11 November 1998 the ac c used brought the daughter to a void dec k of a Housing and Development Board ("HDB") flat and there they sat smoking c igarettes for a while. The ac c used then asked the daughter to move c loser to him. She did. Then he pulled her to his lap and pulled her pants and panties down to her thigh. She told him not to do so, and even shouted at him. She also pushed him with one hand while holding on to her c igarette with the other. The ac c used then inserted a finger into his daughter’s vagina and tic kled her there. She told him "that it was enough" and he then stopped. On the way home he asked her to smell his finger but she pushed it away remarking that "it was disgusting". 

3\. The next morning, while the ac c used’s sister and father were at work and his mother went out, the ac c used hugged his daughter from behind and then c alled her to the bedroom saying that he wished to talk to her. At that time her younger siblings were playing c omputer games in the living room. She went into the bedroom with the ac c used and sat on the bed next to him. He told her that he was not satisfied after the previous night. He "pushed [her] on the bed with her legs dangling down". The daughter deposed that she thought that he was "going to do the same thing as what he did to me last night. So I just lay there and smoked". The ac c used pulled down her pants and panties and inserted his penis into her. 

4\. On the afternoon of 13 November 1998 when all the other adults were out of the flat the ac c used and his daughter played c omputer games together. After losing a "bowling game" to his daughter on the c omputer the ac c used sat behind her while she c ontinued playing. She deposed that she c ould feel his penis rubbing behind her bac k but she did not do anything bec ause she thought that he was masturbating behind her and she did not c are. Shortly after that he pulled her down in a supine position and had sex with her. She said that she tried to push him away bec ause she did not want to do it with him. He asked her to perform fellatio but she refused. After some initial diffic ulty due to the flac c idity of his member he managed to c omplete the sexual ac t. He told her that he had ejac ulated in 


her and went to the toilet to wash himself. When he returned he told her "tak best" and she understood that to mean "having sex with me was not satisfying". 

5\. The prosec ution sought to admit five statements of the ac c used inc luding three c autioned statements under s.122(6) of the Criminal Proc edure Code. These statements were rec orded in the afternoon of 19 January 2000, 25 and 26 January 2000. The ac c used c hallenged these statements on the ground that the statements were not made voluntarily. He said that on the morning of 19 January 2000 he was brought into a small interview room by the investigating offic er S/Sgt Chan. He was stripped naked and forc ed to stay in a "half- squat" position. He was kept like that for about 45 minut es. He stole some moment’s rest when S/St Chan left the room. An Indian offic er whom he identified as one of the two offic ers who arrested him on 18 January 2000 (later asc ertained to be S/Sgt Lawrenc e) entered the interview room and told him to admit to the c harges. S/Sgt Chan also told the ac c used that unless he admits to the c harges he will c ontinue to treat him in the same manner. When the ac c used finally agreed to admit to the c harges the investigating offic er treated him "normally", he had no problems after that. This ac c ount was denied by the two offic ers. 

6\. The ac c used testified that after he was stripped S/Sgt Chan took a photograph of his penis. He had earlier shown S/Sgt Chan a small stone whic h he had inserted under the skin of his penis. Under c ross- examination S/Sgt Lawrenc e admitted that there was a Polaroid c amera in the offic e adjoining the interview room. However, he denied that it was used to take the photograph of the ac c used. 

7\. Three different interpreters were used in the rec ording of the five statements. They were c alled to testify that no treat, induc ement or promise was made to the ac c used. However, one of the three, namely, Miss Sapiathun Mohd Ali agreed with the ac c used that during a moment’s break when S/Sgt Chan (who was rec ording the statement) left the interview room, the ac c used told her that he had given his statement under duress. She asked him for details so that she rec ord them. The ac c used did n o t elaborate. The ac c used explained that he did not do so bec ause at that point S/Sgt Chan returned to the room and so he was afraid to talk to Miss Sapiathun further. 

8\. Weighing all the evidenc e of the witnesses in the trial- within- a- trial I am of the view that the ac c used had raised a reasonable doubt that the statements were not voluntary statements. I need not, and do not make a finding that his allegation was true. Although the learned DPP Miss Tan submitted that the alleged duress or oppression oc c urred on 19 January and should not have operated on his mind on 25 or 26 January, I am of the view that it would be too c lose a c all to make. Every allegation of threat, induc ement or promise must be c onsidered in the c ontext of the individual c ase. Sometimes an identic al threat may operate differently on different ac c used persons, and even on the same ac c used in different c irc umstanc es. Similarly, the length of time an ac t of oppression or duress may linger to intimidate an ac c used person depends on the fac ts of eac h c ase. Counsel referred me to the alleged ac ts of oppression in Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP <span class="citation">[1999] 1 SLR 25</span>. I was the trial judge in that c ase and had admitted a statement even though the ac c used alleged that he was knoc ked on the head by a senior polic e offic er and asked to tell the truth. Miss Tan draws my attention to a c omment by the Court of Appeal in that c ase that asking an ac c used person to tell the truth does not amount to a threat or induc ement. She submits that asking an ac c used to admit the c harge is the same as asking him to tell the truth. I am unable to ac c ept this submission. I think that there is a material and c ritic al differenc e between the two. The statements of the ac c used Kamsari were, therefore, not admitted in evidenc e. 

9\. The evidenc e against the ac c used in this c ase c omes mainly from the c omplainant. There is no rule in law that that would not be suffic ient evidenc e to support a c onvic tion. However, to justify c onvic ting a man of a serious offenc e suc h as rape the evidenc e of the c omplainant must be c onvinc ing and leave the c ourt with no reasonable doubt that it is true. 


10\. The c harge against the ac c used was made by his daughter, then 15 years old. She was more worldly wise than her age suggests. By her own admission she had a boyfriend then, played truant, smoked and engaged in pre- marital sex. Her parents divorc ed in 1992 and she was under the c are of her paternal grandmother. The ac c used was in a drug c entre from 1994 to 1998. 

11\. It c annot be assumed that a girl with suc h a bac kground c annot be raped; but it forms part of the c ontext in whic h the c ourt must determine whether her evidenc e is adequate. 

12\. The c omplainant made three serious allegations against him for molest and rape, oc c urring in three suc c essive days from 11 to 13 November 1998. 

13\. She maintained that she did not c onsent to any of the three ac ts against her. However, in two of the three inc idents, she was, by her own admission, enjoying a c igarette smoke whilst the offenc e was being c ommitted. 

14\. Quite apart from the c asual attitude that her evidenc e c learly imparted, it leads one to seriously question why she did not use her lighted c igarette on her assailant. It is obvious to me that this c omplainant was not a timid person; but even if she was, some explanation ought to have been elic ited from her as to why she did not do so. The c ourt ought not enter the arena and c omplete the lac una, espec ially when the ac c used person was unrepresented. 

15\. The third offenc e was allegedly c ommitted on 13 November 1998, thereafter the c omplainant ran away from home (whic h was, on the prosec ution’s own evidenc e, not the first time she did so). She said she told her boyfriend, her friend Aishah and her mother that evening. Nonetheless, no polic e report was made until 23 November. It is not known what ac c ounted for the delay and therefore its signific anc e, if any, is lost at trial. I would expec t some explanation to ac c ount for the delay but none of the witnesses offered any. 

16\. What is more important, is that when the c omplainant eventually lodged her report, she only alleged that she was raped on 12 November 1998. There was no report of the offenc es of 11 and 13 November. No explanation was given for this inc onsistenc y. 

17\. On the prosec ution’s evidenc e alone, I think that there is a serious doubt as to the guilt of the ac c used. The prosec ution was unable to c reate any material dent in the testimony of the ac c used who denied that he had performed any of the ac ts c omplained of. 

18\. I am not finding as a fac t that the c omplainant c learly lied or that the ac c used was c learly telling the truth; the law does not require me to go that far. It is suffic ient where, as in this c ase, I find the ac c used to be a more reliable witness than the c omplainant, whic h is already more than what he needed to suc c eed in his defenc e. With respec t, I do not find him evasive as the learned DPP submitted I should. I ac c ept his evidenc e that his daughter had seen the lump on his penis sometime before the inc idents. I think that it is reasonably possible. 

19\. Why a daughter would ac c use her father of rape is an important and pertinent question; but we must not forget that it is only a question. It is not evidenc e and, without evidenc e that question bec omes a dangerous statement: that when a c hild ac c uses her father of rape it must be true. The differenc e between the theory of law and the prac tic e of law is that the former is c onc erned with the question "would a man in these c irc umstanc es have c ommitted the offenc e?"; the latter goes further and enquire, "did this man in these c irc umstanc es c ommit the offenc e?". The last question must be answered by a broad but c ritic al review of all the evidenc e; at the end of whic h the c ourt must be satisfied that it is safe or unsafe to c onvic t as the c ase may be. Evidenc e c omprises not only the 


story but the way it is told. 

20\. In this c ase, I am of the view that I c annot safely c onvic t on the evidenc e before me. Ac c ordingly, the ac c used was ac quitted and disc harged on all three c harges.
