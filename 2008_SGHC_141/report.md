Kan Ting Chiu J: 

1       This matter arises from an order made for disc overy of doc uments on the applic ation of the first defendant, Lim Eng Hoc k Peter against the plaintiff, Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd, the developer and operator of the Raffles Town Club. 

2       The plaintiff is suing the first defendant together with three other persons who are former direc tors of the plaintiff. In this ac tion, the plaintiff c laims that the first defendant was the _de facto_ managing direc tor or _de facto_ direc tor of the plaintiff between September 1996 and April 2001. The first defendant and his c o-defendants are all separately represented in these proc eedings. 

3       The plaintiff’s c ase against the first defendant and his c o-defendants is that they failed to disc harge their duties as direc tors of the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s c omplaints c ome under three main heads. First, it was alleged that the first defendant and his c o-defendants devised a sc heme whereby an exc essive number of memberships of Raffles Town Club were issued, and that led to suc c essful c laims by the members against the plaintiff for damages whic h the plaintiff was unable to satisfy. Sec ondly, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants c aused the plaintiff to enter into a management agreement with Europa Holdings Ltd (‘EH’), a c ompany alleged to be in the c ontrol of the first defendant and his c o-defendants, under whic h the plaintiff paid substantial management fees to EH, whic h EH then paid out to the first defendant and his c o-defendants. The plaintiff c laimed that EH had not provided the servic es under the management agreement to the plaintiff for whic h the management fees were paid. Third, the plaintiff alleged that the first defendant and his c odefendants wrongly c aused the plaintiff to pay them substantial sums by way of direc tors’ remuneration, expenses and c onsultanc y fees whic h were not reasonable, justified or in the interests of the plaintiff. This inc luded the payment of $5.7m to the first defendant for expenses, c onsultanc y fees and inc entive fees made between August 1997 and August 2000. 

4       The first defendant’s defenc e is that he was not a _de facto_ managing direc tor of the plaintiff, but was a c onsultant to the c ompany, and that he had not c aused any loss to the plaintiff. His c ase is that when he terminated his involvement with the plaintiff, the plaintiff was financ ially sound, with 


$206m in c ash reserves, short term investments and rec eivables (whic h was ac c epted by the plaintiff ). He c ontends the plaintiff’s funds have been depleted by ac ts and dec isions of the plaintiff taken after his involvement with the c ompany had ended. 

5       He applied for and obtained orders for the disc overy of the plaintiff’s sec retariat and financ ial rec ords up to Marc h 2001 (when he c eased to be involved with the c ompany), and from Marc h 2001 to January 2006 (from the termination of his involvement with the plaintiff to time of the filing of this ac tion). 

6       The plaintiff now ac c epts that it is to make disc losure of the preMarc h 2001 doc uments, but it is appealing against the order for the disc overy of the following doc uments from Marc h 2001 to January 2006:

 (a) all minutes of meetings of direc tors of the plaintiff; 

 (b) all direc tors’ resolutions of the plaintiff; 

 (c ) all minutes of Annual General Meetings and Extraordinary General Meetings of the shareholders of the plaintiff; 

 (d) all audited financ ial statements of the plaintiff; 

 (e) all monthly management ac c ounts of the plaintiff, 

 in respec t of any expenditure or payments over S$500,000.00 made by the plaintiff out of the plaintiff’s c ash and/or assets; and 

 (f ) all doc uments (inc luding c orrespondenc e, agreements, invoic es, payment vouc hers and any other supporting doc uments) relating to the transac tion(s) involving the payment of c onsultanc y fees by the plaintiff to “China exploration”. 

7       Counsel submitted that disc overy of the doc uments (a) to (e) is needed bec ause an essential part of the first defendant’s defenc e is that depletion of the plaintiff’s funds and assets took plac e after he had terminated his relationship with the plaintiff. He argued that to establish the defenc e, the first defendant has to present to the c ourt the depletion of the plaintiff’s funds, the dec isions whic h led to the depletion, and whether the dec isions and the depletion were c onnec ted to his involvement with the plaintiff, and the need to have those doc uments for this purpose. 

8       The doc uments under (f ) relate to c onsultanc y fees paid in 2003-2005 amounting to $7.3m for a projec t in China that the plaintiff c onsidered. These fees were inc urred after Marc h 2003. The plaintiff has admitted the payment of these fees. 

9       Two reasons were given for the disc overy of these doc uments. First, it was to give an understanding of the management of the plaintiff and depletion of its funds, and sec ond, to c ompare this payment, whic h the plaintiff c onsiders a proper payment with the $5.7m c onsultation fees paid to the first defendant over the period August 1997August 2000, whic h the plaintiff finds to be unreasonable and unjustified. 

**The rules on discovery** 

10     The first defendant had applied for the disc overy of the doc uments under O 24 r 5(1) of the 


Rules of Court, whic h governs the disc overy of partic ular doc uments in c ontradistinc tion to r 2(1) whic h applies to the first stage of general disc overy. 

11     Under r 5(3), a doc ument is subjec t to partic ular disc overy if it is: 

 (a) a doc ument on whic h the party relies or will rely; 

 (b) a doc ument whic h c ould — 

 (i) adversely affec t his own c ase; 

 (ii) adversely affec t another party’s c ase; or 

 (iii) support another party’s c ase; and 

 (c ) a doc ument whic h may lead the party seeking disc overy of it to a train of inquiry resulting in his obtaining information whic h may — 

 (i) adversely affec t his own c ase; 

 (ii) adversely affec t another party’s c ase; or 

 (iii) support another party’s c ase. 

12     Partic ular disc overy under r 5(3) differs from general disc overy under r 1(2) in that whereas general disc overy is restric ted to doc uments under c lasses (a) and (b), partic ular disc overy also extends to c lass (c ) doc uments whic h do not c ontain the information under c lass (b), but whic h may lead to a train of inquiry resulting in obtaining of information under c lass (b). 

13     The entitlement to disc overy, whether general or partic ular, is c onditional to the disc overy being nec essary. Order 24 r 7 stipulates that: 

 the Court may, if satisfied that disc overy is not nec essary, or not nec essary at that stage of the c ause or matter, dismiss or, as the c ase may be, adjourn the applic ation and shall in any c ase refuse to make suc h an order if and so far as it is of opinion that disc overy is not nec essary either for disposing fairly of the c ause or matter or for saving c osts. 

14     The operation of the rules of disc overy was explained by the Court of Appeal in _Tan Chin Seng & Ors v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2002] 3 SLR 345</span>: 

 13 [T]he rules governing disc overy have undergone some important c hanges when they were reformed in 1996. Not only was the previous system of mutual disc overy by parties after the c lose of pleadings replac ed by a system of disc overy by orders of c ourt, the applic able test is also different. The previous test, to determine whether doc uments should be disc overed, was governed by the words ‘relating to any matter in question between them in the ac tion’ found in the previous O 24 r 2(1). This test was eluc idated in the often quoted judgment of Brett LJ in the c elebrated c ase Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v Peruvian Guano Co (1882) 11 QBD 55 at 62–63: 

 ... doc uments to be produc ed are not c onfined to those, whic h would be evidenc e either to prove or to disprove any matter in question in the ac tion ... The doc trine seems to me to go farther than that and to go as far as the princ iple whic h I am about to lay down. It seems to 


 me that every doc ument relates to the matters in question in the ac tion, whic h not only would be evidenc e upon any issue, but also whic h, it is reasonable to suppose, c ontains information whic h may — not whic h must — either direc tly or indirec tly enable the party [requiring disc overy] either to advanc e his own c ase or to damage the c ase of his adversary ... 

 A doc ument c an properly be said to c ontain information whic h may enable the party [requiring disc overy] to advanc e his own c ase or to damage the c ase of his adversary; if it is a doc ument whic h may fairly lead him to a train of inquiry, whic h may have either of these two c onsequenc es. 

14     So doc uments whic h were indirec tly relevant by reason of their potential to set off ‘a train of inquiry’ resulting in the disc overy of evidenc e of direc t relevanc e were disc overable. But this somewhat open-ended c riteria often gave rise to diffic ulties in applic ation to partic ular c irc umstanc es, abuses or fishing. It also gave rise to a trend of disc overing huge volumes of insignific ant doc uments. 

15     The c riteria adopted by the new rules are more spec ific. They are set out in O 24 r 1(2): 

 The doc uments whic h a party to a c ause or matter may be ordered to disc over under paragraph (1) are as follows: 

 (a) the doc uments on whic h the party relies or will rely; and 

 (b) the doc uments whic h c ould — 

 (i) adversely affec t his own c ase; 

 (ii) adversely affec t another party’s c ase; or 

 (iii) support another party’s c ase. 

There is, in addition, an overriding princ iple presc ribed in r 7, whic h is, that the disc overy must be ‘nec essary either for disposing fairly of the c ause or matter or for saving c osts’. 

16     Doc uments whic h are now disc overable, other than those on whic h a party relies or will rely (r 1(2)(a)), will be those whic h c ould (1) adversely affec t the party’s own c ase; (2) adversely affec t another party’s c ase; or (3) support another party’s c ase. It should be noted that the word there is ‘c ould’ not ‘would’. So a doc ument whic h has the ‘potential of affec ting’ the party from whom the doc ument is requested, is obliged to disc over the same. 

17     Thus c aution must be exerc ised when c onsidering dec isions whic h were made under the previous rules bec ause, in the words of Jeffrey Pinsler on _Singapore Court Practice_ O 24, ‘a doc ument is no longer disc overable merely bec ause there is some c onnec tion (irrespec tive of the nature of the link) between it and the issue in the c ase’. Doc uments whic h were required to be disc overed under the c onc ept of ‘train of inquiry’ are no longer disc overable under the present O 24 r 1. However, this is not to say that the c onc ept of ‘train of inquiry’ has been removed from the Rules. It has reappeared in r 5 whic h relates to disc overy of spec ific doc uments. 

18     However, it must not thereby be taken that c ases dec ided under the previous rules are no longer pertinent. As was the position under the previous rules, one of the essential prec onditions 


 to be satisfied before disc overy will be ordered is that of ‘relevanc e’. Whether a doc ument would affec t that party’s c laim, or adversely affec t another party’s c ase, or support another party’s c ase, must depend on the issues pleaded in the ac tion. The c ases that shed light on ‘relevanc y’ are just as useful today. 

 19 Some of the princ iples on ‘relevanc y’ established by the c ases are the following. In Thorpe ’s c ase (referred to earlier) it was dec ided that a doc ument was not disc overable if it was to be used only for the purpose of c ross-examination to establish c redibility of witnesses. A disc overed doc ument c an also be blanked out in part if the blanked out portion is irrelevant to the issues of the ac tion: GE Capital Corporate Finance Group v Bankers Trust Co [1995] 2 All ER 993; [1995] 1 WLR 172. The disc overy proc ess should not be allowed to ‘fish’ a c ause of ac tion: see Wright Norman v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR 710</span>. Where an allegation is not pleaded, seeking disc overy of a doc ument to bac k up suc h an allegation c onstitutes fishing: Marks & Spencer plc v Granada TV (unreported, 8 April 1997). 

15     The plaintiff objec ted to the disc overy of the doc uments in question on the grounds that the c lasses of doc uments are too wide and oppressive, and that the doc uments are not nec essary for the fair disposal of the c ase or for saving c osts. 

16     I will refer to the applic ation for the doc uments in (a) to (e) first. The first defendant’s defenc e is that when he ended his involvement with the plaintiff in Marc h 2001, the plaintiff was financ ially sound. His defenc e is that the plaintiff’s subsequent financ ial weakness had resulted from dec isions and ac tions taken after Marc h 2001. These doc uments c ome under r 5(3)(b) and (c ). 

17     Are they too wide and oppressive? That argument was made before me and led me to restric t the disc overy to doc uments in respec t of any expenditure or payments over S$500,000.00 made by the plaintiff out of the plaintiff’s c ash and/or assets. 

18     Width and oppression should be viewed in the c ontext of the c irc umstanc es. Disc overy of _all_ doc uments in the c lasses would be too wide and oppressive, as it would extend to doc uments whic h do not relate to the plaintiff’s financ ial ac tivities, and it may be oppressive if it extends to every expenditure and payment of the plaintiff. The $500,000 qualific ation narrows the disc overy to matters and doc uments whic h had a signific ant impac t on the plaintiff’s financ es. The restric ted disc overy of these doc uments is not too wide or oppressive, and c omes properly under r 5(3). 

19     The doc uments under (f ) are of a different nature. The ‘China exploration’ expenditure is not direc tly in issue as it was inc urred after Marc h 2001. The first defendant was not involved with it, and there was no allegation by the plaintiff that the expenditure was improper or exc essive. However, the doc uments fall under r 5(3)(a) bec ause they enable a c omparison to be made between payments for c onsultanc y servic es made for the ‘China exploration’ projec t over whic h the plaintiff has no c omplaints, and the payments for c onsultanc y servic es rendered by the first defendant, whic h the plaintiff alleges to be unreasonable and unjustified. 

20     Is the disc overy of the doc uments nec essary for disposing fairly of the ac tion or for saving c osts? Taking into c onsideration the substantial c laims, the financ ial resourc es of the parties and the tenac ity with whic h the ac tion has been c onduc ted by the parties, it is very likely that the fac ts and issues will be fully examined and c ontested at the trial. Doc uments relevant to the issues will be identified, and their produc tion will be sought. Doc uments produc ed in the c ourse of a trial c an result in long and unfoc used examination bec ause of c ounsel’s unfamiliarity with the doc uments and lac k of preparation. Another c onsequenc e may be that time has to be given for the doc uments to be studied, and where nec essary, referred to experts. This would disrupt the progress of the hearing and add to 


the length and the c osts of the trial. The disc overy of the doc uments in the c irc umstanc es is nec essary for disposing fairly of the ac tion and for saving c osts.
