**Introduction** 

1       The plaintiff and defendant are parties to a c onstruc tion c ontrac t. The defendant suc c eeded in an adjudic ation against the plaintiff and sought to enforc e the adjudic ation determination as a judgment debt. The plaintiff applied for a stay of the enforc ement proc eedings and c ommenc ed a suit against the defendant, seeking a final determination of the dispute between the parties. The defendant in turn applied for a stay of the suit, alleging that the plaintiff’s c ommenc ement of suc h proc eedings amounted to an abuse of proc ess of the c ourt given that the plaintiff had not made payment of the adjudic ated amount to the defendant. The plaintiff’s response to this allegation was twofold: (a) it was genuinely unable to pay the adjudic ated amount due to its financ ial c irc umstanc es; and (b) it believed that the defendant was itself impec unious, suc h that any amounts paid to the defendant pending the determination of the underlying dispute might prove irrec overable if the plaintiff eventually suc c eeded in that final determination. Out of these proc eedings, two applic ations c ame before me for dec ision. The first was the defendant’s applic ation for a stay of proc eedings in the suit pending the plaintiff’s payment of the adjudic ated amount. The sec ond was the plaintiff’s applic ation for an interim stay on enforc ement pending the hearing of its applic ation for a stay of the enforc ement proc eedings. 

2       The Building and Construc tion Industry (Sec urity of Payments) Ac t (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”) has been the subjec t of a c onsiderable amount of judic ial sc rutiny in rec ent years. Various aspec ts of the Ac t – ranging from the jurisdic tion of adjudic ators and their duties in the c onduc t of the adjudic ation to the setting aside of adjudic ation determinations – have been reviewed by the c ourts, and an inc reasing body of c ase law has ac c rued to guide the c onduc t of the rapidly growing 

number of adjudic ations in Singapore. [note: 1] The applic ations before me primarily c onc erned one of these aspec ts – namely, the right of a losing party in an adjudic ation to seek a final determination of 


the underlying dispute, notwithstanding the fac t that it has not made payment of the adjudic ated amount to the winning party. The question for my dec ision was whether it is an abuse of proc ess for the losing party to c ommenc e proc eedings in c ourt to obtain a final determination despite not having paid the adjudic ated amount, in c irc umstanc es where its non-payment of the adjudic ated amount followed from two reasons: (a) its genuine inability to make suc h payment; and (b) its c onc ern that due to the impec uniosity of the winning party, it will not be able to rec over any amounts paid to the winning party if the underlying dispute is eventually dec ided in its favour. 

3       Muc h of the argument before me c entred on the rec ent dec ision of Foo Chee Hoc k JC in _Lim Poh Yeoh (alias Aster Lim) v TS Ong Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2017] 4 SLR 789</span> (“ _Lim Poh Yeoh_ ”). Having c onsidered the parties’ submissions and evidenc e, I granted the defendant’s stay applic ation but subjec ted the stay to any dec ision made in the plaintiff’s applic ation to grant a stay of enforc ement of the adjudic ation determination pending the disposal of proc eedings in the suit. I also granted the interim stay on enforc ement sought by the plaintiff. 

4       The plaintiff has appealed against my dec ision on the defendant’s stay applic ation and has sought to adduc e further evidenc e on appeal, suc h evidenc e pertaining to the plaintiff’s alleged inability to pay the adjudic ated amount. I therefore explain my dec ision on the law and my findings on the evidenc e that was put before me. 

**Facts and procedural history** 

5       F T Plumbing Construc tion Pte Ltd (“F T”) c arries on the business of plumbing and sanitary works. Authentic Builder Pte Ltd (“AB”) is in the business of building, renovating and remodelling 

residential, c ommerc ial and industrial spac es. [note: 2] 

6       On 3 June 2014, AB was engaged as main c ontrac tor for a housing development projec t. By way of a sub-c ontrac t (“the SubContrac t”), AB engaged F T as its sub-c ontrac tor for works desc ribed as “Supply and Installation of Plumbing & Sanitary Works, Minor Sewer and Water Servic es System” whic h were c omprised in the projec t. For its servic es, AB was to pay F T the c ontrac tual sum 

of $2.8m, exc luding Goods and Servic es Tax (“GST”). [note: 3] 

7       F T c ommenc ed its works in July 2014. [note: 4] On 27 July 2017, AB was served with a c opy of 

F T’s adjudic ation applic ation. [note: 5] The subjec t of the adjudic ation applic ation was F T’s Payment Claim No. 32 of 27 June 2017 (“the Payment Claim”), in whic h F T sought payment of $992,160. (inc lusive of GST) for works done in the period from 25 September 2014 to 27 June 2017. In response to the Payment Claim, AB furnished a Payment Certific ate No. 30 on 24 July 2017 (“the Payment Certific ate”) as its payment response. In the Payment Certific ate, AB did not merely deny F T’s entitlement to payment; it instead c laimed that F T was liable to pay $2,791.31 (inc lusive of GST) to 

it. [note: 6] 

8       On 14 September 2017, the adjudic ator rendered his adjudic ation determination (“the Adjudic ation Determination”). The result was that AB was found liable to pay F T the sum of $888,693.42 (inc lusive of GST). This was to be added to the adjudic ator’s fees (whic h amounted to $33,544.40), the adjudic ation applic ation fee ($642) and interest. I will refer to the total sum that AB was adjudged to pay F T as “the Adjudic ated Amount”. The adjudic ator held that F T had c ompleted the SubContrac t works, save for c ertain as-built drawings and operation manuals whic h he valued at 

$5,000. [note: 7] Another key aspec t of the dispute in the adjudic ation had pertained to variation works allegedly c ompleted by F T and for whic h F T sought payment. In this regard, the adjudic ator found that AB had responded only to one disputed variation item in its Payment Certific ate. As for the 


other disputed variation items, AB had not provided any response amount nor any reason for 

withholding payment. [note: 8] The adjudic ator ac c ordingly dec ided that s 15(3)( _a_ ) of the Ac t prohibited him from c onsidering the reasons proffered by AB during the adjudic ation for withholding payment for those other disputed variation items, given that AB had not inc luded those reasons in the Payment Certific ate. Consequently, the adjudic ator held that F T was entitled to the amounts it 

c laimed for the variation works. [note: 9] He also rejec ted AB’s submission that F T was liable for 

liquidated damages for delay. [note: 10] 

9       On 7 November 2017, F T filed Originating Summons No. 1262 of 2017 (“the OS”), seeking leave to enforc e the Adjudic ation Determination as a judgment pursuant to s 27(1) of the Ac t. The OS was granted by an assistant registrar the next day. Over the c ourse of the next two months, F T proc eeded to c ommenc e various enforc ement proc eedings against AB: 

 (a) Three sets of garnishee proc eedings in respec t of AB’s bank ac c ounts with United Overseas Bank, Malayan Banking Berhad and OverseaChinese Banking Corporation Limited (Summons Nos. 5435, 5436 and 5438 of 2017); 

 (b) An applic ation for AB’s interest in c ertain immovable property to be attac hed and taken in exec ution to satisfy the adjudic ation determination (Summons No. 5535 of 2017) (“the Seizure Applic ation”); 

 (c ) An applic ation for the examination of Ler Peh Choo, a direc tor of AB, to asc ertain whether AB has any property or means (Summons No. 5536 of 2017); and 

 (d) Two further sets of garnishee proc eedings against property developers that F T believed were indebted to AB (Summons Nos. 5858 and 5859 of 2017). 

10     On 28 November 2017, AB c ommenc ed Suit No. 1105 of 2017 (“the Suit”) against F T. The c laims advanc ed by AB in the Suit enc ompassed muc h of what it had previously c anvassed before the adjudic ator. For instanc e, AB c laimed (as it had before the adjudic ator) that F T’s c laims for variation works were improper, that the variation works fell within the sc ope of the SubContrac t works, and/or that the variation works had really been c arried out in order to rec tify defec ts in F T’s SubContrac t 

works. [note: 11] As mentioned at [8] above, the adjudic ator had found that he was prec luded by s 15(3)( _a_ ) of the Ac t from c onsidering these submissions due to AB’s failure to raise them in its payment response. As before, AB disputed the value of the as-built drawings, warranties and manuals that F T had omitted to provide, c laiming that those outstanding doc uments were worth $102, 

(rather than $5,000 as the adjudic ator had dec ided). [note: 12] AB also reiterated its c laim for 

liquidated damages. [note: 13] 

11     On 6 Dec ember 2017, AB filed Summons No. 5571 of 2017 (“SUM 5571”) in the OS, seeking a stay on the exec ution or enforc ement of the Adjudic ation Determination pending the disposal of the proc eedings that AB had c ommenc ed in the Suit. Later that month, it also filed Summons No. 5753 of 2017 (“SUM 5753”), seeking an interim stay on the enforc ement proc eedings pending the hearing of the Main Stay Applic ation. 

12     On 8 January 2018, F T filed Summons No. 166 of 2018 (“SUM 166”) in the Suit. The relief sought by F T was the striking out of AB’s statement of c laim in the Suit or, in the alternative, a stay of the Suit until AB had made full payment of all outstanding sums payable under the Adjudic ation Determination. SUM 5753 and SUM 166 c ame before me c onc urrently for hearing. 


**Parties’ submissions** 

13     The foc us of parties’ submissions before me was on SUM 166; more spec ific ally, on the question of whether proc eedings in the Suit should be stayed or struc k out altogether given that AB had not made payment of the Adjudic ated Amount thus far. I was informed that despite the multiplic ity of garnishee proc eedings c ommenc ed thus far, F T had only managed to retrieve a total of $9,215. from AB’s bank ac c ounts at the time of the hearing. This obviously represented only a frac tion of the sum of more than $920,000 for whic h AB had been adjudged to be liable. 

14     F T’s c entral c ontention in SUM 166 was that AB’s c ommenc ement of the Suit despite its nonpayment of the Adjudic ated Amount c onstituted an _abuse of process_ of the c ourt. Mr Tan Joo Seng, c ounsel for F T, relied heavily on the dec ision of Foo JC in _Lim Poh Yeoh_. Mr Tan argued that the present c ase was “on all fours” with _Lim Poh Yeoh_ and urged me to find – as Foo JC had in _Lim Poh Yeoh_ – that AB’s c onduc t should be rec ognised as an abuse of proc ess, with the c onsequenc e that the c ourt should exerc ise its inherent jurisdic tion to stay the proc eedings until AB had paid the judgment debt. Ac c ording to F T, it is “an abuse of proc ess of [the] c ourt for an unsuc c essful respondent to an adjudic ation determination to c ommenc e a c laim against the c laimant on the same 

c ontrac t without first paying the sum awarded under the determination”. [note: 14] Mr Tan further highlighted that the appeal against Foo JC’s dec ision had subsequently been dismissed by the Court of Appeal (Civil Appeal No. 178 of 2016). I will elaborate on the fac ts and reasoning in _Lim Poh Yeoh_ as well as Mr Tan’s submissions on the judgment in my analysis below. 

15     Mr Patric k Ong, c ounsel for AB, ac c epted that AB had not made payment of the Adjudic ated Amount. But this, ac c ording to Mr Ong, did not nec essarily yield the c onc lusion that AB’s c ommenc ement of the Suit amounted to an abuse of proc ess. Mr Ong drew my attention to s 34(1) ( _a_ ) of the Ac t, whic h establishes that nothing in the Ac t is to affec t any right that a party to a c ontrac t might have to submit a dispute relating to or arising from the c ontrac t to a c ourt or tribunal, or to any other dispute resolution proc eeding. He also highlighted various statements in the legislative debates and c ases on the Ac t regarding the temporary finality of adjudic ation determinations. 

16     Mr Ong vigorously argued that the present c ase c ould be distinguished from _Lim Poh Yeoh_ , and thus that there were no grounds to find that AB had c ommitted an abuse of proc ess. In this regard, Mr Ong had two primary submissions. First, _Lim Poh Yeoh_ did not stand for the proposition that it would always be an abuse of proc ess for an unsuc c essful respondent in adjudic ation to c ommenc e c ourt proc eedings to seek a final determination of the underlying dispute between the parties. A c ruc ial point of distinc tion between the appellant in _Lim Poh Yeoh_ and AB was that – unlike the appellant in that c ase – AB was genuinely unable to make payment of the Adjudic ated Amount and it had not done so for that reason. Therefore – unlike the result in _Lim Poh Yeoh_ – it would not be appropriate for AB’s suit to be stayed. Sec ond, and in any event, AB had proper and suffic ient justific ation for withholding payment. Ac c ording to AB, F T was impec unious and therefore if AB was to pay the Adjudic ated Amount (or whatever amount AB c ould afford to pay) to F T, there was a c hanc e that those monies would prove irrec overable should AB subsequently suc c eed in the Suit. This, Mr Ong pointed out, was also the reason why AB had filed SUM 5571 (whic h, as earlier mentioned, is AB’s applic ation for a stay of enforc ement pending dec ision on the Suit). 

17     Regarding SUM 5753 ( _ie_ , AB’s applic ation for an interim stay on the enforc ement proc eedings in the OS), Mr Ong c ontended that the interim stay was nec essary to preserve parties’ positions pending the determination of SUM 5571. Put shortly, if the multiple enforc ement proc eedings taken out by F T c ontinued to unfold in the intervening period, SUM 5571 c ould well be rendered nugatory. Mr Ong further submitted that irreversible prejudic e would be c aused to AB if, pursuant to the Seizure 


Applic ation whic h had been granted on 12 Dec ember 2017, the immovable property were sold. In response, Mr Tan denied that AB would suffer any suc h prejudic e and submitted that, on the c onverse, it was F T that c ould be prejudic ed if proc eedings in the OS were stayed, sinc e AB might 

begin disposing of its assets during the interim stay. [note: 15] 

18     I reserved my dec ision after hearing parties on 5 February 2018. On 8 February 2018, I made the following orders: 

 (a) On SUM 166, I ordered that the proc eedings in the Suit be stayed until AB made full payment of all outstanding sums payable to F T pursuant to the Adjudic ation Determination, but I subjec ted this order to any dec ision made in SUM 5571 to grant a stay of exec ution or enforc ement of the Adjudic ation Determination pending the disposal of c ourt proc eedings in the Suit. 

 (b) On SUM 5753, I granted an interim stay on the exec ution and enforc ement of the Adjudic ation Determination pending the hearing of SUM 5571. 

The result of my order on SUM 166 is that should an order be made, following the hearing of SUM 5571, that a stay on enforc ement proc eedings in the OS should be imposed pending dec ision on the Suit, then the proc eedings in the Suit should be permitted to c ontinue notwithstanding the fac t that AB had not made full payment of the outstanding Adjudic ated Amount. I will explain why I took the view that this result and these c onsequenc es were appropriate. 

**The issues** 

19     Shortly put, the issue that arose for my dec ision in SUM 166 was whether it is an abuse of proc ess for a losing party in an adjudic ation ( _ie_ , AB) to c ommenc e proc eedings to seek a final determination of the underlying dispute between the parties in c irc umstanc es where it has not made payment of the adjudic ated amount to the winning party ( _ie_ , F T), having omitted to make suc h payment bec ause (a) it is genuinely unable to make suc h payment due to its financ ial c irc umstanc es; and (b) it believes that any amount paid to the winning party would not be rec overable due to the impec uniosity of the winning party, were the losing party to subsequently suc c eed in the litigation of the underlying dispute. I found that the determination of this issue required a c lose examination of the reasoning in _Lim Poh Yeoh_ as well as a number of Australian dec isions on the same or related issues. 

20     SUM 5753 is a dec idedly less c omplex applic ation, and this was reflec ted in the fac t that c onsiderably less time in argument was spent on this matter. The question in SUM 5753 was whether an interim stay on enforc ement should be ordered pending the determination of the main stay applic ation, _ie_ , SUM 5571. 

21     It is appropriate for me to begin with a desc ription of the relevant law, whic h will c onsist of a brief ac c ount of the princ iples on the c ourt’s power to restrain abuse of proc ess, followed by a more detailed explic ation of _Lim Poh Yeoh_ and the exerc ise of those inherent powers in the c ontext of the Ac t. 

**The law** 

**_The court’s inherent power to restrain abuse of process_** 

22     It is settled princ iple that the c ourt possesses inherent powers to make any order as may be nec essary to prevent injustic e or to prevent an abuse of the proc ess of the c ourt: O 92 r 14 of the 


Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”). In “The Inherent Jurisdic tion of the Court” (1970) 23 CLP 23, Sir Jac k Jac ob desc ribed the c ourt’s inherent jurisdic tion as “the reserve or fund of powers, a residual sourc e of powers, whic h the c ourt may draw upon as nec essary whenever it is just or equitable to do so, and in partic ular to ensure the observanc e of the due proc ess of law, to prevent improper vexation or oppression, to do justic e between the parties and to sec ure a fair trial between them”. This ac c ount of the c ourt’s inherent jurisdic tion has been c ited with approval loc ally: see, for instanc e, _Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore_ <span class="citation">[2001] 2 SLR(R) 821</span> at [27] and _Chee Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another_ <span class="citation">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 582</span> (“ _Chee Siok Chin_ ”) at [30]. 

23     The c onc ept of abuse of proc ess has unsurprisingly rec eived a broad definition in the c ase law and ac ademic c ommentary. The Court of Appeal in _Gabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others_ <span class="citation">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649</span> observed at [22] that the c onc ept has been given a wide interpretation and that at its c ore, it “signifies that the proc ess of the c ourt must be used _bona fide_ and properly and must not be abused. The c ourt will prevent the improper use of its mac hinery. It will prevent the judic ial proc ess from being used as a means of vexation and oppression in the proc ess of litigation.” Its c ategories “are not c losed and will depend on all the relevant c irc umstanc es of the c ase”. In _Chee Siok Chin_ at [34], V K Rajah J (as he then was) usefully c ategorised the instanc es of abuse of proc ess into four c ategories: (a) proc eedings whic h involve a dec eption on the c ourt, or are fic titious or c onstitute a mere sham; (b) proc eedings where the proc ess of the c ourt is not being fairly or honestly used but is employed for some ulterior or improper purpose or in an improper way; (c ) proc eedings whic h are manifestly groundless or without foundation or whic h serve no useful purpose; and (d) multiple or suc c essive proc eedings whic h c ause or are likely to c ause improper vexation or oppression. 

24     In the exerc ise of its inherent powers to restrain abuse of its proc ess, one of the options open to the c ourt is to order a stay of proc eedings. In his artic le, Sir Jac k Jac ob desc ribed an abuse of proc ess as “c onnot[ing] that the proc ess of the c ourt must be used properly, honestly and in good faith ... where an abuse of proc ess has taken plac e, _the intervention of the court by stay_ or even dismissal of proc eedings may often be required by the very essenc e of justic e to be done, and so to prevent parties being harassed and put to expense by frivolous, vexatious or groundless litigation” [emphasis added]. It is likewise noted in _Singapore Civil Procedure 2018_ vol 1 (Foo Chee Hoc k gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2018) at para 92/4/4 that in invoking its inherent jurisdic tion, the c ourt may stay c ivil proc eedings whic h it deems to be vexatious, frivolous or likely to c ause an abuse of proc ess of c ourt. 

**_The abusiveness of commencing proceedings despite non-payment of the adjudicated amount_** 

_Lim Poh Yeoh_ 

25     In _Lim Poh Yeoh_ , the plaintiff employed the defendant to c onstruc t two houses. The plaintiff c ommenc ed proc eedings against the defendant, seeking damages for delay and defec tive works, and the defendant in turn c ounterc laimed for the unpaid sum owing to it for the works it had c ompleted. Separately, the defendant applied to enforc e as a judgment debt an adjudic ation determination that had been dec ided in its favour. When that applic ation was granted, the defendant took out various enforc ement measures against the plaintiff, inc luding garnishee proc eedings, an order for examination of judgment debtor and a writ of seizure and sale against the plaintiff’s property. The defendant further issued a statutory demand against the plaintiff and the plaintiff applied unsuc c essfully to set aside the statutory demand (that applic ation was not before Foo JC and did not form part of his dec ision in _Lim Poh Yeoh_ ). 


26     The defendant applied for a stay of the suit c ommenc ed by the plaintiff pending the plaintiff’s payment to the defendant of the judgment debt as well as the c osts ordered against the plaintiff in the enforc ement applic ation and the plaintiff’s unsuc c essful attempt to set aside the statutory demand. An assistant registrar granted the stay and the plaintiff appealed. On appeal, Foo JC ordered that if the plaintiff failed to satisfy the outstanding c osts orders and the judgment debt within one month, all proc eedings in the plaintiff’s suit were to be stayed. 

27     In relation to the plaintiff’s non-payment of c osts, Foo JC rejec ted the plaintiff’s submission that bec ause the c osts orders had been made in proc eedings other than the suit, the suit should not be stayed for non-payment of those c osts. He found at [9] that what was more c ritic al was the fac t that the adjudic ation determination formed the basis of both the enforc ement proc eedings and the suit; put another way, the enforc ement proc eedings “emanated from the same dispute [ _ie_ , the dispute c onc erning the c onstruc tion c ontrac t between the parties] that animated the [suit]”. Foo JC found at [10] that whether a stay should be granted pending payment of c osts would depend on the twin c riteria of prejudic e and justic e. He reasoned as follows: 

 12 In the present c ase, I found that the Plaintiff had the c apac ity and means to pay the outstanding c osts ordered but was simply refusing to do so. The best c ase that Plaintiff’s c ounsel c ould put forward for her during the hearing was to say that “Plaintiff has not said that she c an pay but she has not said that she c annot pay” (see the notes of proc eedings dated 27 September 2016). I note that the assistant registrar, in SUM 6188, had made the similar finding that the Plaintiff was refusing to pay the sums owed. Quite apart from the fac t that the Plaintiff had never onc e asserted that she was unable to pay the outstanding c osts (and the Judgment Debt), her c ourse of c onduc t before me further reinforc ed my view that she had the means to pay but chose to make a mockery of the court process. ... 

 13 At the hearing on 27 September 2016, the Plaintiff’s c ounsel then informed me that all the interloc utory c osts orders in Suit 92 had been satisfied and submitted that sinc e a stay should only be granted where the c osts from interloc utory proc eedings in the same suit had not been paid, the c ourt should not order the stay (notwithstanding that the c osts and the Judgment Debt in OS 381 remained unsatisfied by the Plaintiff). It was evident to me that the Plaintiff was simply picking and choosing which outstanding orders of court to comply with so that she would not contradict or weaken the legal position she was adopting. This brought to light the Plaintiff’s attempt to game the system and there was no reason to believe that the Plaintiff was unable to satisfy the other outstanding orders of court. In this regard, I agreed with the observations of the assistant registrar below that “[i]n effec t, the [P]laintiff will use the power of this Court when it suits her and disregard it when it does not”. 

 [emphasis in original removed; emphasis added] 

28     Foo JC held at [14] that a stay of proc eedings would therefore not c ause prejudic e to the plaintiff, and noted that the situation was unlike that in _Morton v Palmer_ (1882) 9 QBD 89 where Cave J held (at 91) that it would be “entirely c ontrary to justic e that, without being at liberty to exerc ise any disc retion whatever in the matter, the Courts should be c ompelled to say that a man who may have a just c laim should be prevented from pursuing it further bec ause he may be _unable to pay the costs of some interlocutory proceeding_ in whic h he may have failed perhaps from no fault of his own” [emphasis added]. Foo JC then proc eeded as follows (at [15]): 

 The above c ases reminded us of an important safeguard: that the court should be careful not to stifle a genuine claim. Indeed, the law and its partic ular rules sought to hold the ring between parties. However, as against a recalcitrant party who was gaming the system this way, there 


 was no question of stifling a genuine claim. The Plaintiff simply needed to play by the rules and pay up the outstanding costs (which she was able to do) to reac tivate the present proc eedings. In my view, her c onduc t amounted to an abuse of the process of the court and c ould not be c ountenanc ed. I therefore ordered that Suit 92 be stayed if the Plaintiff did not satisfy the outstanding c osts orders within a month. [emphasis added] 

29     Foo JC then turned his attention to the plaintiff’s non-payment of the judgment debt ( _ie_ , the amount that the adjudic ator had found the plaintiff to be liable to pay the defendant). In this regard, Foo JC found that the plaintiff’s c onduc t of the proc eedings likewise c onstituted an abuse of proc ess. He began by highlighting that the judgment debt had originated from an adjudic ation determination, and quoted from the Court of Appeal’s judgment in _W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Osko Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2013] 3 SLR 380</span> (“ _W Y Steel_ ”) at [59], where the Court of Appeal had held – upon a review of c ertain provisions of the Ac t, inc luding those governing adjudic ation review applic ations (s 18) and applic ations to set aside adjudic ation determinations (s 27) – that “where a c laimant suc c eeds in his adjudic ation applic ation, he is entitled to rec eive the adjudic ated amount quic kly and c annot be denied payment without very good reason”. Foo JC observed at [18] that the sc heme of the Ac t was ac c ordingly “based upon suc c essful c laimants being paid speedily”. 

30     The sec ond point Foo JC made likewise flowed from the quoted passage from [59] of _W Y Steel_. It c onc erned s 27(5) of the Ac t, whic h provides as follows: 

 (5) Where any party to an adjudic ation c ommenc es proc eedings to set aside the adjudic ation determination or the judgment obtained pursuant to this sec tion, he shall pay into c ourt as sec urity the unpaid portion of the adjudic ated amount that he is required to pay, in suc h manner as the c ourt direc ts or as provided in the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5), pending the final determination of those proc eedings. 

Foo JC noted that the effec t of s 27(5) was that any respondent in an adjudic ation that wished to c hallenge the outc ome of an adjudic ation determination “must still either pay the adjudic ated amount to the c laimant or pay the unpaid amount into c ourt as sec urity”. He then held as follows (at [19]): 

 ... This point was germane in guiding my dec ision to stay the proc eedings if the Plaintiff did not pay the Judgment Debt. While I noted that the Plaintiff was not in fac t seeking to review the Adjudic ation Determination, and therefore the above c ited provisions did not apply to the Plaintiff, it would be perverse for the reasons herein for her to be allowed to deprive the Defendant of its right to prompt payment. The Plaintiff was effectively choosing not to pay the Judgment Debt in the hope that upon having the matter determined at trial, the court would find in her favour and she would never have to pay this sum to the Defendant. I saw no reason why someone in her position should be better off, for instance, than a respondent who was seeking to challenge the validity of an adjudication determination (who would be compelled to make the payment pursuant to provisions of [the Act] before such a challenge could proceed). In fac t, it c ould be said that it was even more imperative for someone in the Plaintiff’s position to pay the Judgment Debt in the interim sinc e she herself rec ognised the validity of the Adjudic ation Determination. [emphasis added] 

31     Foo JC then reviewed two dec isions of the New South Wales Supreme Court, _Tombleson v Dancorell Constructions Pty Ltd_ [2007] NSWSC 1169 (“ _Tombleson_ ”) and _Nazero Group Pty Ltd v Top Quality Construction Pty Ltd_ [2015] NSWSC 232 (“ _Nazero_ ”), whic h I will desc ribe in greater detail subsequently. In brief, Foo JC found at [20] that the “c ommon theme emanating from these dec isions was that parties should not be allowed to _withhold payment_ of the adjudic ated sum whilst seeking to effec tively overturn the adjudic ation determination at the same time” [emphasis added]. 


32     Foo JC noted at [21] that this c ould be “the first c ase where a party in the Plaintiff’s position _elected not to pay the judgment debt_ pending the determination of their dispute in the underlying c ontrac t” [emphasis added]. He remarked that “suc h unilateral ac tion on the Plaintiff’s part drove a c oac h and horses through the sc heme established under [the Ac t] and c ynic ally defeated its legislative intent”. In c losing, Foo JC held as follows: 

 22 ... it was again signific ant to me that the Plaintiff was ultimately able but unwilling to pay the Judgment debt (as noted above [in the sec tion of the judgment on the Plaintiff’s nonpayment of c osts]). There was, therefore, to my mind no issue of depriving her of ac c ess to the c ourt to have her c ase heard in Suit 92 bec ause it was within her control to pay the Judgment Debt and have the matter revived. 

 23 ... In my view, the c ourt c ould not stand by while the Plaintiff was abusing its proc ess; it was inc umbent upon the c ourt to bring suc h abuse to an end. This was also to disabuse the Plaintiff of any further ideas she might have of circumventing the rules , for instanc e, by refusing to pay the Defendant (pending an appeal) should she fail in Suit 92. 

 24 In the light of the Plaintiff’s deliberate conduct , I therefore found it nec essary to exerc ise the c ourt’s inherent power to stay the proc eedings in Suit 92 until she paid all outstanding c osts ordered by the c ourt and the Judgment Debt in OS 381. As noted above (at [5]), however, I granted her one final indulgenc e to pay these outstanding sums; in default all proc eedings in Suit 92 were to be stayed. 

 [emphasis added] 

_Australian decisions_ 

(1) Tombleson 

33     The relevant legislation in New South Wales is the Building and Construc tion Sec urity of Payment Ac t 1999 (“the NSW Ac t”). Under s 25(1) of the NSW Ac t, an adjudic ation c ertific ate c an be filed as a judgment for a debt and enforc ed ac c ordingly. If the respondent c ommenc es proc eedings to have that judgment set aside, he is required to pay into c ourt as sec urity the unpaid portion of the adjudic ated amount pending the final determination of those proc eedings: s 25(4)(b) of the NSW Ac t. Sec tion 25(4)(b) of the NSW Ac t is therefore _in pari materia_ with s 27(5) of our Ac t (see [30] above). 

34     In _Tombleson_ , the plaintiff c ommenc ed proc eedings in the New South Wales Supreme Court against the defendants, seeking orders in the nature of a writ of c ertiorari quashing the dec ision of the adjudic ator (who was the sec ond defendant). The plaintiff sought dec larations that the determination and the adjudic ation c ertific ate were void, as well as injunc tions preventing the first defendant from taking any ac tion in order to enforc e the determination. In response, the defendant applied for a stay of the proc eedings until the plaintiff had paid into c ourt as sec urity the unpaid portion of the adjudic ated amount. 

35     Patric ia Bergin J (as she then was) granted the stay. She ac c epted at [17] that s 25(4)(b) of the Ac t, whic h required a respondent to pay the unpaid portion of the adjudic ated amount into c ourt pending the determination of the setting-aside proc eedings (see [33] above), did not apply bec ause that provision c onc erned applic ations to set aside judgments and the defendant had not sought an order of that nature. She emphasised at [18], however, that the c ourt would “not only [be] c autious to ensure justic e between the parties, but also to ensure that the legislation under whic h [the] 


applic ation [was] brought [was] _not circumvented_ ” [emphasis added]. Bergin J held as follows (at [19]): 

 The plaintiff is attempting to prevent the defendant from enforcing the judgment by injunc tion rather than seeking to set aside the judgment. ... If the Court is satisfied that suc h an applic ation is for the purpose of getting around or circumventing the provisions of the Act then an order may be made staying the proc eedings on the c ondition that suc h stay will remain unless money is paid into Court. Suc h an approac h may diminish the drafting of innovative pleading to ensure that s 25(4) is not triggered to obtain the benefit of proc eedings into Court whilst the c ontrac tor loses the benefit of the Ac t. [emphasis added] 

Having found that the plaintiff’s pleading sought to avoid the triggering of s 25(4)(b) of the Ac t, she exerc ised her disc retion to stay the proc eedings until the unpaid amount was paid into c ourt. 

(2) Nazero 

36     In _Nazero_ , the plaintiff brought an ac tion against the defendants in the New South Wales Supreme Court, seeking dec larations that an adjudic ation determination was “an abuse of proc esses of the [NSW Ac t]”, that it be quashed and be void and of no effec t; an order restraining the first defendant from seeking to enforc e any judgment based on the adjudic ation determination; and an injunc tion or permanent stay of the enforc ement of the adjudic ation determination. The first defendant in turn applied for an order that the plaintiff pay the unpaid portion of the adjudic ated amount into c ourt as sec urity, and in the alternative, an order staying proc eedings unless the plaintiff made suc h payment into c ourt. In this c ase, the first defendant had not yet filed an adjudic ation c ertific ate as a judgment for a debt. 

37     David Hammersc hlag J held at [26] that although s 25(4) of the NSW Ac t did not apply, it was nonetheless appropriate that proc eedings be stayed unless the plaintiff paid the unpaid portion of the adjudic ated amount into c ourt. He observed at [29] that the c ourt possessed inherent power to stay proc eedings and an “inc idental power” to c ontrol and to ensure the proper and fair use of its jurisdic tion. After desc ribing the dec ision in _Tombleson_ , he reasoned at [40] that the “starting point” in the exerc ise of his disc retion was the “general polic y aims” of the NSW Ac t and the spec ific aims of partic ular pertinent sec tions. A general polic y aim was “to give enforc eable rights to progress payments” and another was “to ensure the speedy and effec tive determination of disputes about them”. At [42] of his judgment, Hammersc hlag J held as follows: 

 The polic y of the [NSW] Ac t, as reflec ted in s 25(4)(b), is that a c laimant is to be given protec tion of payment into c ourt when a respondent seeks, whether by injunc tion or otherwise, to inhibit the claimant’s enforcement of an adjudication in its favour. [emphasis added] 

38     He found that although the defendant had not yet filed an adjudic ation c ertific ate, it was open to the defendant to do so and in suc h event the plaintiff would have “little option but to seek to have the judgment set aside to protec t its position, in whic h event, s 25(4)(b) of the [NSW] Ac t would mandate payment into c ourt”. Hammersc hlag J further held at [44]: 

 It is not apt to desc ribe a requirement to pay into c ourt an amount the subjec t of a statutory obligation to pay into c ourt an amount the subjec t of a statutory obligation to pay, pending a c hallenge to that obligation, as a fetter on the right to make the c hallenge. It may be a practical inhibition, depending on the specific financial circumstances of the challenger. This could be a factor relevant to the exercise of discretion, but in the present case, [the plaintiff] leads no evidence of hardship. [emphasis added] 


(3) Pettersson 

39     In _R v Scott Pettersson; Ex parte Fenshaw Pty Ltd_ [2015] TASSC 33 (“ _Pettersson_ ”), the plaintiff obtained a general order to show c ause in respec t of an adjudic ation determination. In summary, the plaintiff alleged that the adjudic ator lac ked jurisdic tion to determine the applic ation; that the plaintiff had been denied natural justic e; that the adjudic ator had failed to exerc ise his jurisdic tion by failing to determine the adjudic ation applic ation in ac c ordanc e with the Tasmanian Building and Construc tion Industry Sec urity of Payment Ac t 2009 (“the Tasmanian Ac t”), had exc eeded his jurisdic tion in other respec ts and had erred in law. The defendant, who had filed an adjudic ation c ertific ate as a judgment against the plaintiff, applied for a stay of proc eedings c ommenc ed by the plaintiff until it had paid the amount due under the judgment into c ourt or to the defendant. 

40     David Porter J in the Supreme Court of Tasmania granted the stay sought by the defendant. He observed at [19] that although s 27(5)(b) of the Tasmanian Ac t (whic h is _in pari materia_ to s 27(5) of our Ac t) did not apply, the c ourt retained an unfettered disc retion to grant a stay in its inherent jurisdic tion. Porter J reviewed a number of Australian dec isions, inc luding _Tombleson_ and _Nazero_. In relation to _Tombleson_ , Porter J surmised at [22] that “the c ritic al fac tors [in that c ase] were that injunc tive relief was being sought in respec t of enforc ement of the judgment, and there was a _manifest intention to avoid the operation of the [NSW] Act_ ” [emphasis added]. In relation to _Nazero_ , Porter J indic ated at [35] that he would be adopting the approac h taken by Hammersc hlag J, and held that “[a]n additional fac tor _relevant to the exercise of the discretion_ is the _failure of the [defendant] to obtain satisfaction of its judgment_ , _the [plaintiff’s] apparent financial situation_ , and the offer whic h was made of a payment into c ourt in support of its own interloc utory applic ation for an injunc tion whic h was not pursued” [emphasis added]. 

41     Porter J c onc luded at [37]–[38] that ordering a stay was not a step lightly taken, but that having c onsidered the relevant fac tors, proc eedings should be stayed pending the plaintiff’s payment into c ourt of the amount owing under the adjudic ation determination. 

**Stay of the Suit** 

42     In my judgment, when determining whether it is an abuse of proc ess for a plaintiff to c ommenc e proc eedings seeking a final determination of the underlying dispute despite not having made payment of the adjudic ated amount to the defendant, it is nec essary to have regard to the _reason for the non-payment_. This is, on one level, no more than an applic ation of the trite princ iple that when the c ourt asc ertains whether there has been an abuse of proc ess, the c ourt must examine “all the relevant c irc umstanc es of the c ase” (see [23] above). It is also reflec ted in Foo JC’s detailed c onsideration of why the plaintiff in _Lim Poh Yeoh_ had failed to make payment. 

**_Genuine inability to pay_** 

_Analysis of the case law_ 

43     Having c onsidered the fac ts and reasoning in _Lim Poh Yeoh_ , I do not find that this c ase is authority for the proposition that, in c irc umstanc es where the plaintiff (who is the losing party in an adjudic ation) is genuinely unable to pay the adjudic ated amount and therefore does not do so, it would be an abuse of proc ess for the plaintiff to nonetheless c ommenc e proc eedings against the defendant (the winning party in the adjudic ation) to obtain a final determination of the underlying dispute between the parties. I did not ac c ept Mr Tan’s submission that _Lim Poh Yeoh_ stands for the unyielding proposition that it is “an abuse of proc ess of [the] c ourt for an unsuc c essful respondent to 


an adjudic ation determination to c ommenc e a c laim against the c laimant on the same c ontrac t without first paying the sum awarded under the determination” (see [14] above). 

44     It is c ruc ial to note that _Lim Poh Yeoh_ was a c ase in whic h the plaintiff _had_ the ability to pay the judgment debt and the c osts ordered against her, but had _deliberately chosen not to do so_ before c ommenc ing proc eedings against the defendant. This was a point that Foo JC made repeatedly and throughout his judgment, both in relation to the plaintiff’s omission to pay c osts as well as the judgment debt. With regards to c osts, he found that the plaintiff “had the c apac ity and means to pay the outstanding c osts ordered but was simply refusing to do so”. In c hoosing not to pay despite the fac t that “she had the means to pay”, she was “mak[ing] a moc kery of the c ourt proc ess” (see the quoted passages at [27] above). The pith of the plaintiff’s improper c onduc t was her c onsidered strategy to employ the proc esses of the c ourt in a c ontrived and improper manner – in Foo JC’s words, she was “a rec alc itrant party who was gaming the system” and who “simply needed to play by the rules and pay up the outstanding c osts (whic h she was able to do)” (see [28] above). 

45     With regards to the outstanding judgment debt, Foo JC likewise found that the plaintiff was ac ting abusively. She had simply “elec ted not to pay the judgment debt” despite the fac t that she was “ultimately able ... to pay” the sum (see [32] above). For this reason, Foo JC found that there was “no issue of depriving her of ac c ess to the c ourt to have her c ase heard”. 

4       6 _Lim Poh Yeoh_ c an therefore properly be desc ribed as a c ase in whic h the c ourt had found the plaintiff to be ac ting abusively in c ommenc ing proc eedings bec ause her non-payment of the adjudic ated amount followed from a deliberate and wilful dec ision not to do so in spite of her manifest ability to make suc h payment. It is far from c lear whether Foo JC would have found the plaintiff to be guilty of an abuse of proc ess had he been satisfied that she was genuinely unable to make payment and had therefore omitted to do so for that reason alone. It is partic ularly unc lear bec ause of the note of c aution Foo JC sounded at [15] of the judgment, where he stated that it was an “important safeguard” that “the c ourt should be c areful not to stifle a genuine c laim”. He reiterated this at [22] of his judgment, where he c onsidered whether there was any “issue of depriving [the plaintiff ] of ac c ess to the c ourt to have her c ase heard in [the suit that she c ommenc ed]”. On the fac ts before him, however, he found that there was “no question of stifling a genuine c laim” bec ause the plaintiff was merely gaming the system (see [28] above). 

47     Neither do I find that the Australian dec isions – _Tombleson_ , _Nazero_ and _Pettersson_ – provide an unambiguous answer to the question (although valuable guidanc e c an be found in these c ases). This is due in large part to the nature of the orders sought by the plaintiffs in those c ases. That in turn framed the sc ope of the question before the c ourt. The plaintiffs in all these c ases sought relief that direc tly impugned the adjudic ation determination and/or the resultant judgment debt. In other words, the purpose of the proc eedings they c ommenc ed was to nullify the adjudic ation determination and stymie its enforc ement – in substanc e though not in form, to have the adjudic ation determination and/or the judgment _set aside_ – rather than to seek a _final determination_ of the underlying dispute between the parties. The Australian c ourts found that their c onduc t amounted to an attempt to c irc umvent the statutory requirement that they first pay sec urity into c ourt and therefore that they were abusing the proc ess of the c ourt. 

48     For instanc e, in _Tombleson_ , the plaintiff sought orders quashing the adjudic ation determination and injunc tions preventing the defendant’s enforc ement of the adjudic ation determination, despite not having paid the adjudic ated amount. Bergin J essentially found that the abusiveness of the plaintiff’s c onduc t lay in her attempt to c irc umvent s 25(4)(b) of the NSW Ac t, whic h required a respondent to pay sec urity into c ourt pending proc eedings to have the judgment set aside. As desc ribed at [40] above, Porter J had, in _Pettersson_ , c ommented that _Tombleson_ involved a plaintiff that had “a 


manifest intention to avoid the operation of the [NSW] Ac t”. Likewise, the plaintiff in _Nazero_ had applied for the adjudic ation determination to be quashed and the defendant prevented from enforc ing any judgment based on it. Hammersc hlag J held that a c laimant should be given protec tion of payment into c ourt in c irc umstanc es where the respondent was taking ac tion “to inhibit the c laimant’s enforc ement of an adjudic ation in its favour” (see [37] above). In other words, what the plaintiffs in these c ases had sought to do (albeit indirec tly) was to have the adjudic ation determination rendered ineffec tual and its enforc ement prevented – as if the adjudic ation determination and the judgment entered thereupon had been set aside – without having first paid the nec essary sec urity into c ourt. 

49     In my judgment, the fac t that the plaintiffs in those c ases had in substanc e sought to set aside the adjudic ation determinations and/or prevent their enforc ement, rather than to obtain a final determination of the underlying disputes, is a c ritic al point of distinc tion. An applic ation to set aside an adjudic ation determination has a very different nature and c arries very different c onsequenc es from an ac tion to finally determine the rights and obligations between the parties to the c onstruc tion c ontrac t. This flows from the temporary finality of adjudic ation determinations – that is, the c harac teristic that adjudic ation determinations are “final and binding on the parties to the adjudic ation until their differenc es are ultimately and c onc lusively determined or resolved whether by arbitration or litigation”: _Vinod Kumar Ramgopal Didwania v Hauslab Design & Build Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2017] 1 SLR 890</span> at [30]. Even if an adjudic ation determination is set aside, the right of the parties to seek and obtain that ultimate and c onc lusive determination of the merits of their respec tive c ases remains. That is why s 34(1)( _a_ ) of the Ac t presc ribes, c ruc ially, that “[n]othing in this Ac t shall affec t any right that a party to a c ontrac t may have ... to submit a dispute relating to or arising from the c ontrac t to a c ourt or tribunal, or to any other dispute resolution proc eeding”. It is also why, pursuant to s 34(3) of the Ac t, an adjudic ator shall terminate the adjudic ation proc eedings if, before his determination of the dispute, the dispute is determined by a c ourt or tribunal or at any other dispute resolution proc eeding. A determination of temporary finality is unnec essary in the presenc e of a final determination. 

50     Consequently, one c annot draw the c onc lusion that a plaintiff’s c ommenc ement of proc eedings to seek a resolution of the underlying dispute in the absenc e of payment of the adjudic ated amount is an attempt to c irc umvent s 27(5) of the Ac t – and is ac c ordingly an abuse of proc ess – in the same way that an applic ation to quash or nullify adjudic ation determinations in the absenc e of payment of sec urity into c ourt is. That is not to say that c ommenc ement of suc h proc eedings does not or c annot amount to abuse. It is simply to say that one c annot effec tively analogise the two types of proc eedings without falling into error. 

_My approach_ 

51     In my judgment, where a plaintiff has not made payment of the adjudic ated amount bec ause it is genuinely unable to do so as a result of its financ ial situation, its c ommenc ement of proc eedings to obtain a final determination of the underlying dispute in those c irc umstanc es c annot, without more, be c onsidered an abuse of proc ess suc h that the proc eedings should be stayed. 

52     That must be so for a number of reasons. First, where a plaintiff does not make payment bec ause its impec uniosity renders it simply unable to do so, the basis for an allegation of abusive c onduc t falls away. The plaintiff does not pay up not by c hoic e but by c irc umstanc e. It would not be open to the defendant to argue – as it did in _Lim Poh Yeoh_ – that the plaintiff has made a wilful and c onsc ious dec ision to withhold payment from the defendant before c ommenc ing proc eedings, either bec ause of a perc eived entitlement to withhold the sum or an expec tation that it will suc c eed in the final determination. As disc ussed at [44]–[46] above, that was the forc e behind the defendant’s c omplaint in _Lim Poh Yeoh_ that the plaintiff was ac ting abusively. But the thrust of that c omplaint is 


blunted where the plaintiff’s non-payment stems from genuine impec uniosity. In _Diploma Construction (WA) Pty Ltd v KPA Architects Pty Ltd_ [2014] WASCA 91 at [55], the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Western Australia held that “[t]he broad purpose of the [Western Australian Construc tion Contrac ts Ac t 2004, whic h is _in pari materia_ to our Ac t], insofar as it relates to payment disputes, is to ensure that, in c onstruc tion c ontrac ts, progress c laims are paid on time and that princ ipals obliged to pay _do not act as their own judge and jury_ and hold up payment on their own assertion that they have a defec t warranting refusal to pay” [emphasis added]. That objec tion simply does not materialise in the c irc umstanc es that I have desc ribed. 

53     One must return to the definition of an abuse of proc ess of the c ourt – that is, the “improper use of the c ourt’s mac hinery ... as a means of vexation and oppression in the proc ess of litigation”, for instanc e where the proc ess of the c ourt “is not being fairly or honestly used but is employed for some ulterior or improper purpose or in an improper way” (see [23] above). It is not obvious to me that an impec unious plaintiff that c ommenc es proc eedings to obtain a final determination c an be desc ribed as having exploited the c ourt’s proc ess in a manner or for a purpose that is improper or in bad faith. 

54     Sec ond, there is no c onflic t between the imperative of ensuring speedy payment to the vic torious party in adjudic ation, on the one hand, and permitting a genuinely impec unious plaintiff from seeking a final determination of the underlying dispute, on the other. 

55     In an oft-c ited passage from _W Y Steel_ , the Court of Appeal desc ribed the appeal of the philosophy behind the Ac t as follows (at [20]): 

 ... payments, and therefore c ash flow, should not be held up by c ounterc laims and c laims for setoffs that may prove to be spec ious at the end of lengthy and expensive proceedings that have to be undertaken in order to disentangle the knot of disputed claims and cross-claims. [emphasis added] 

In the rec ent dec ision of _Audi Construction Pte ltd v Kian Hiap Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2018] 1 SLR 317</span>, the Court of Appeal reiterated (at [1]) that the aim of the Ac t was to establish “a fast and low c ost adjudic ation system to resolve payment disputes (c iting the speec h of Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng, then Minister of State for National Development, at the sec ond reading of the Building and Construc tion Industry Sec urity of Payment Bill 2004 (Bill 54 of 2004): _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (16 November 2004) vol 78 at c ol 1113), in the light of “the need to ensure that c ontrac tors and subc ontrac tors in the c onstruc tion industry rec eive timely payments for work done and materials supplied”. The goal of fac ilitating speedy payment to preserve c ash flow in the c onstruc tion industry would not be promoted but would instead be undermined by “the grinding detail of the traditional approac h to the resolution of c onstruc tion disputes” ( _Macob Civil Engineering Ltd v Morrison Construction Ltd_ [1999] CLC 739 at [14]). 

56     In c irc umstanc es where a plaintiff is genuinely unable to pay and therefore does not do so before c ommenc ing an ac tion for a final determination, the issue of speedy payment being hindered by the length and expense of proc eedings does not arise. What has oc c urred in this situation is simply that the pursuit of payment by the defendant has run its c ourse and c ome up empty. In other words, the defendant’s inability to have its judgment debt satisfied c annot be attributed to the plaintiff’s stubborn refusal not to pay bec ause of a belief in the merits of its c ase and a desire to prosec ute the matter fully before a c ourt or arbitral tribunal. It is not the “grinding detail of the traditional approac h to resolution of c onstruc tion disputes” that would have formed the obstac le to the defendant’s rec overy of the judgment debt. Rather, the defendant’s attempt to rec over the adjudic ated amount would have been unfruitful bec ause that attempt had been direc ted at an impec unious plaintiff. 


57     In these c irc umstanc es, there would appear to be little justific ation for preventing the plaintiff from proc eeding to seek a final determination. This leads into a third point. As the Court of Appeal noted in _W Y Steel_ at [61], while “the c laimant who suc c essfully sec ures an adjudic ation determination in his favour has a right to be paid ... there is a _competing residual right_ on the part of the respondent to have his c laims ventilated in full in c ourt or in some other dispute resolution proc eeding” [emphasis added]. That is a right that is referenc ed implic itly in s 21(1)( _b_ ) and expressly in s 34(1)( _a_ ) of the Ac t. Those provisions “undersc ore the idea of an unsuc c essful respondent having the right to try to reverse (either in whole or in part) the temporarily final adjudic ation determination”. The Court of Appeal in _W Y Steel_ further highlighted that “[f ]or this right not to be nugatory, a respondent who is initially unsuc c essful must have an avenue open to him that will enable him finally to ac hieve effec tive justic e”. Ac c ordingly, I do not see how prec luding a plaintiff from c ommenc ing or c ontinuing proc eedings where it has shown itself to be unable to make payment would promote or serve the ends of the Ac t. On the c ontrary, it appears to me that that approac h would in fac t fail to give effec t to s 34(1)( _a_ ) and denude the plaintiff’s right to a final determination. 

58     Fourth, it is worth noting that the c ourts in _Nazero_ and _Pettersson_ both found that it was relevant to c onsider the plaintiff’s financ ial situation in determining whether it was appropriate, in the exerc ise of the c ourt’s disc retion, to stay proc eedings pending payment of the adjudic ated amount into c ourt or to the defendant. In _Nazero_ , Hammersc hlag J referred to the plaintiff’s financ ial diffic ulties as “a prac tic al inhibition” that the c ourt might take into ac c ount, although the plaintiff in that c ase had led no evidenc e of financ ial hardship (see [38] above). Porter J reac hed a similar finding in _Pettersson_ , although he also thought it relevant that the defendant had not obtained satisfac tion of its judgment (see [40] above); all of these fac tors were, essentially, to be weighed in the balanc e in determining how the c ourt should exerc ise its disc retion in the c ase. 

59     It is equally worth highlighting that although the abusiveness of the plaintiffs’ c onduc t in seeking to c irc umvent ss 25(4)(b) and 27(5)(b) of the NSW and Tasmanian Ac ts respec tively was c lear – due to the nature of the orders sought in those c ases (as disc ussed at [47]–[50] above) – Hammersc hlag and Porter JJ nevertheless c onsidered that the plaintiffs’ impec uniosity would be relevant to the exerc ise of their disc retion whether to stay the proc eedings. In my view, this is entirely c onsistent with the requirement that in determining whether an abuse of the c ourt’s proc ess has oc c urred, the c ourt must c onsider all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase. 

**_Irrecoverability of paid amounts_** 

60     As desc ribed at [16] above, Mr Ong’s sec ond argument was that AB had not paid the adjudic ated amount bec ause it believed that F T itself was impec unious, and therefore any amount paid to FT might well be irrec overable if AB were ultimately to suc c eed in the final determination. This, ac c ording to Mr Ong, also justified AB’s dec ision to c ommenc e proc eedings despite not having paid the adjudic ated amount, suc h that AB’s c onduc t c ould not be regarded as an abuse of proc ess. 

61     When I pointed out to Mr Ong that the financ ial status of F T was in fac t the primary issue in SUM 5571 ( _ie_ , AB’s applic ation in the OS for a stay of enforc ement pending the disposal of the Suit), whic h AB had filed on the basis that any monies paid to F T before the disposal of the Suit would be irrec overable, and that SUM 5571 was not before me for dec ision, Mr Ong submitted that it would not be nec essary for me to c onsider whether F T was _in fact_ impec unious. Mr Ong took the position that AB’s _belief_ , taken alone and without more, that monies paid to F T would be irrec overable, was suffic ient reason for me to find that AB’s dec ision to c ommenc e proc eedings despite not having paid the adjudic ated amount was not an abuse of proc ess. He therefore did not put before me any evidenc e, or even attempt to argue, that FT was in fac t impec unious. 


62     I found Mr Ong’s argument to be implausible. If that argument were ac c epted, then all it would take for a plaintiff to suc c essfully resist an allegation of abuse of proc ess in c irc umstanc es where it had c ommenc ed proc eedings despite having failed to pay the adjudic ated amount would be for the plaintiff to depose to a _belief_ that it would not be able to rec over sums paid to the defendant, were it subsequently to suc c eed in the final determination. That result would seriously undermine the purpose of the statutory sc heme and frustrate a suc c essful c laimant’s “entitlement to rec eive the adjudic ated amount quic kly and [not] be denied payment without very good reason” (see [29] above). I do not think that an unproven and untested belief that the suc c essful c laimant would not be good for any sums paid to it is a suffic ient reason to deny payment to it altogether pending the final determination of the dispute. 

63     It is nec essary in this regard to c onsider the requirements that must be met by a party that seeks a stay on the enforc ement of an adjudic ation determination. In _W Y Steel_ , the Court of Appeal ac c epted at [60] that “where the adjudic ated amount is paid to a c laimant in serious financ ial distress, there is a c hanc e that the money may not be rec overable by the time the rights of eac h of the parties are finally determined”. However, it is c lear from the Court of Appeal’s dec ision that a mere belief on the part of the applic ant is insuffic ient if it desires to obtain a stay of enforc ement: 

 70 In our judgment, a stay of enforc ement of an adjudic ation determination may ordinarily be justified where there is clear and objective evidence of the successful claimant’s actual present insolvency , or where the c ourt is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that if the stay were not granted, the money paid to the claimant would not ultimately be recovered if the dispute between the parties were finally resolved in the respondent’s favour by a court or tribunal or some other dispute resolution body. ... [emphasis added] 

In other words, it is essential that the applic ant’s belief be tested and proven on the basis of the evidenc e. The Court of Appeal undersc ored this by observing that while it was “prepared to rec ognise the possibility of granting a stay of enforc ement of an adjudic ation determination bec ause of the possibility of a different outc ome emerging eventually, a stay will not _readily_ be granted having regard to the overall purpose of the Ac t, whic h is prec isely to avoid and guard against pushing building and c onstruc tion c ompanies over the financ ial prec ipic e” [emphasis in original]. 

64     In my judgment, the same approac h should be taken to assess a plaintiff’s attempt to resist an applic ation for a stay of proc eedings due to its non-payment of the adjudic ated amount, where the plaintiff’s refusal to pay flows from its belief that it will not be able to rec over any monies paid to the defendant if the dispute between the parties were eventually resolved in its favour. That belief must likewise be tested and proven on the evidenc e. If the position were otherwise, it would be a matter of utmost ease for a plaintiff to justify its non-payment despite being able to pay. It is also diffic ult to ac c ept that the plaintiff’s belief in the defendant’s impec uniosity is _bona fide_ and genuinely held if the plaintiff does not produc e the nec essary evidenc e to show why it holds suc h a belief. 

**_Application to the facts_** 

65     Mr Tan robustly argued that AB was not, in fac t, genuinely unable to make payment of the adjudic ated amount. He referred me to AB’s Statement of Financ ial Position as at 31 Dec ember 2016 

(“the Statement of Financ ial Position”). [note: 16] The Statement of Financ ial Position showed that as at 31 Dec ember 2016, AB had total assets of $26,781,148 and total liabilities of $24,527,636. That meant that AB had net assets of $2,253,512. This was c ompared to the outstanding amount (after 

taking into ac c ount the amounts rec overed by FT in the garnishee proc eedings) of $921,421.94. [note: 17] 


66     Mr Ong had several arguments in response. First, he pointed out that the Statement only showed AB’s ac c ounts in 2016 and did not reflec t AB’s more rec ent financ ial c irc umstanc es. Sec ond, based on AB’s Statement of Profit or Loss and other Comprehensive Inc ome for the Financ ial Year 

ended 31 Dec ember 2016, [note: 18] AB had suffered a net loss of $36,731 in 2016. Third, AB did not 

have any new c onstruc tion projec ts in 2017. [note: 19] The state of AB’s financ es c ould be gleaned 

from the fac t that F T had only managed to garnish $9,215.66 from AB’s bank ac c ounts thus far. [note: 20] 

67     I did not find that these were satisfac tory responses. The only Statement of Financ ial Position plac ed before me was for the financ ial year ended 31 Dec ember 2016, and that doc ument showed that AB had suffic ient assets to pay the Adjudic ated Amount (indeed, the rec orded value of AB’s assets was more than twic e that of the Adjudic ated Amount). Mr Ong informed me that AB was not yet in possession of its 2017 ac c ounts. He did not indic ate when the 2017 ac c ounts would be produc ed. In my judgment, even if AB was unable to put before me a more rec ent set of ac c ounts bec ause those ac c ounts were not yet available to it, it remained open to AB to adduc e other doc umentary evidenc e to shows its alleged debts and liabilities. I found it striking that AB had failed to adduc e _any_ suc h doc umentary evidenc e to support its argument that it was genuinely unable to make payment of the outstanding sums. Indeed, Ler Peh Choo, the deponent of AB’s affidavits, did not annex any doc uments to support his c laims that (a) AB was unable to pay the Adjudic ated Amount; (b) AB did not have any new c onstruc tion projec ts in 2017; and (c ) AB made losses of a few 

million dollars in the projec t involving F T. [note: 21] In my judgment, these were fac tual c laims in relation to whic h one would have expec ted a direc tor of AB to have at least _some_ doc umentation in support. As they stood, they were merely bare assertions on his part. Neither did I ac c ept that AB’s net loss of $36,731 in 2016 was suffic ient, either taken alone or together with the other evidenc e, to prove its impec uniosity. It does not follow from the fac t that a c ompany has made a net loss in a given year that it does not have suffic ient assets to meet its liabilities. 

68     Given the evidenc e before me, I rejec ted AB’s c laim that it was genuinely unable to make payment of the Adjudic ated Amount and therefore had not done so before c ommenc ing proc eedings against F T. Thus its attempt to resist SUM 166 despite its non-payment rested solely on its sec ond argument, whic h c onc erned the alleged irrec overability of any amount paid to F T pending the disposal of proc eedings in the Suit. In that regard – and as desc ribed earlier (see [61] above) – AB did not adduc e any evidenc e of F T’s alleged impec uniosity, nor did Mr Ong seek to c onvinc e me that on the fac ts and evidenc e, F T was impec unious. He ac c epted that that matter was the subjec t of dec ision in SUM 5571. I therefore ordered that proc eedings in the Suit should be stayed, subjec t to any dec ision in SUM 5571 that F T was indeed in suc h dire financ ial c irc umstanc es that it was appropriate to grant a stay of enforc ement pending disposal of proc eedings in the Suit. Upon suc h a dec ision in SUM 5571, proc eedings in the Suit would be permitted to resume bec ause F T’s impec uniosity and the resulting risk of irrec overability would also furnish proper grounds for AB to resist F T’s stay applic ation in the Suit, _ie_ , SUM 166 (see [64] above). 

**Interim stay of enforcement proceedings** 

69     I agreed with Mr Ong that it was nec essary to for an interim stay on enforc ement to be granted in order to preserve parties’ positions pending dec ision on SUM 5571. This was due to the risk that that applic ation might otherwise be rendered nugatory. The enforc ement proc eedings that F T had c ommenc ed (and was entitled to c ommenc e) were both extensive and advanc ed. Mr Ong informed me that following the grant of the Seizure Applic ation on 12 Dec ember 2017 (see [17] above), more than a month had passed sinc e FT’s registration of the order of c ourt for seizure and sale in respec t of AB’s 


immovable property. Therefore, onc e F T had obtained the c onsent of United Overseas Bank (the mortgagee of the immovable property), it c ould immediately proc eed to sell the property pursuant to O 47 r 5( _a_ ) of the Rules of Court. This was not disputed by FT. 

70     Ac c ording to the evidenc e of Ler Peh Choo, the value of the immovable property was around 

$900,000. [note: 22] Mr Ong further argued that given the value of the property and its proximity to the Adjudic ated Amount, FT already had sec urity pending the determination of SUM 5571. 

71     I ac c epted Mr Ong’s submissions. It was not apparent to me that any or any substantial prejudic e would be c aused to F T if I were to grant the interim stay. No evidenc e was provided in support of F T’s allegation that AB would begin disposing of its assets in the intervening period (see [17] above). The extent of the prejudic e would simply be that F T would be kept out of its money for the period of the stay, whic h would not be for a substantial duration. At the time I delivered my dec ision, SUM 5571 was sc heduled to be heard on 19 Marc h 2018, whic h was merely one month and 11 days away. On the c onverse, the potential c onsequenc es for AB if no interim stay were granted appeared to be c onsiderably more serious, as Mr Ong had pointed out. In the c irc umstanc es, I was satisfied that an interim stay should be ordered, suc h stay to extend until the determination of SUM 5571. 

**Conclusion** 

72     For the reasons that I have explained in these grounds, I made the orders set out at [18] above. I further ordered that (a) in respec t of SUM 166, AB was to pay F T c osts fixed at $5,000; and (b) in respec t of SUM 5753, F T was to pay AB c osts fixed at $2,000. Both sets of c osts orders were to be inc lusive of disbursements.
