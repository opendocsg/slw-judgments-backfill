Lee Seiu Kin J: 

1       The plaintiffs are three of the subsidiary proprietors (“SPs”) of Strata Title Plan 1844, a c ondominium known as Airview Towers (“the Development”). On 13 June 2007, SPs c laiming to hold at least 80% of the share values in the Development submitted an applic ation to the Strata Titles Board (“STB”) under s 84A of the Land Titles (Strata) Ac t (Cap. 158, 1999 Rev Ed)(“the Ac t”) for an order for the sale of all the lots in the Development. The plaintiffs are the authorised representatives under s 84A(2) of the Ac t. On 31 Oc tober 2007 the STB dismissed the applic ation. In this Originating Summons, the Plaintiffs appeal under s 98 of the Building Maintenanc e and Strata Management Ac t 2004 (No 47 of 2004) against that dismissal by the STB. The defendant is one of the SPs of the Development and he opposes the c ollec tive sale. 

2       The relevant law in this matter is the Ac t immediately prior to the amendments of 4 Oc tober 2007 and all referenc es to the Ac t shall be to those provisions unless otherwise stated. 

**Background facts** 

3       The fac ts of the matter relevant to the issues before me are as follows. The c ollec tive sale proc ess for the Development was initiated by some of the SPs in early 2006, resulting in the formation of a Sales Committee (“SC”). The SC invited a property c onsultant, DTZ Debenham Tie Leung (SEA) Pte Ltd (“DTZ”), to make a presentation of the intended sale of the Development and a firm of solic itors, M/s Sankar Ow & Partners (“SOP”), to present the intended c ollec tive sale agreement (“CSA”) to all the SPs. This was done on 1 April 2006, when the SPs met with DTZ, SOP and the SC. DTZ representatives explained to the SPs the aspec ts of the proposed c ollec tive sale and SOP explained the terms and c onditions of the proposed CSA. Copies of the CSA and an explanatory note to it were c irc ulated. Thereafter some of the SPs present signed the CSA. As 1 April 2006 was the date that the CSA was first signed, pursuant to paragraph 1A of the Sc hedule to the Ac t (“the Sc hedule”) this marked the c ommenc ement of the permitted time for the purposes of paragraph 1(a) of the Sc hedule, whic h period would end on 31 Marc h 2007. 


4       Thereafter other SPs signed the CSA and on 22 February 2007, DTZ informed the SC that SPs holding 80.9% of the share value in the Development had signed the CSA. A letter dated 22 February 2007 was sent by the SC to all SPs of the Development wherein it was stated that the requisite 80% c onsensus had been obtained and the SC would launc h the Development for sale by tender. On 26 February 2007, DTZ issued a tender and on 30 Marc h 2007, the tender was awarded to the sole tenderer, Bukit Sembawang View Pte Ltd (“the Purc haser”), at the pric e of $202,168,000. The tender doc ument whic h c onstitutes the sale and purc hase agreement was dated 30 Marc h 2007. About two and a half months later, on 13 June 2007, the plaintiffs, on behalf of the c onsenting SPs, applied to the STB in STB No 65 of 2007 for an order under s 84A. 

5       It should be noted that between 31 Marc h 2007 (the last day of the permitted time) and the day the applic ation was made to the STB on 13 June 2007, the SPs of another six units signed the CSA. The applic ation of 13 June 2007 was ac tually made on the basis of the c onsensus of SPs representing 84.9% of the share values, inc luding the SPs of these six units who had signed outside the permitted time, but exc luding two units #12-10 and #04-06, the importanc e of whic h will be apparent shortly. Immediately prior to 31 Oc tober 2007, the date the STB dismissed the applic ation, the SPs of the remaining units that had held out earlier save one c hanged their minds and c onsented to the sale. Therefore the c onsent owners on 31 Oc tober 2007 totaled 99% by share value. The last SP who did not c onsent to the c ollec tive sale was the defendant. 

6       Before the STB, the defendant raised the question whether as at 1 April 2007 the number of SPs who had signed the CSA had reac hed the requisite 80% threshold. The plaintiffs’ c ase was that as at 30 Marc h 2007, 80.96% had signed the CSA. It would appear that the plaintiffs had ac c epted that the six units in respec t of whic h the SPs had signed the CSA after the expiry of the permitted time c ould not be c ounted. However this would have reduc ed the perc entage to 78.96%. The plaintiff took the position that the two units desc ribed in the previous paragraph, unit #12-10 and unit #04-06, c ould be inc luded as part of the c onsenting owners and therefore c ounted as among those who were making the applic ation to the STB. With these two units, the perc entage rose above the threshold, to 80.96%. 

7       The fac ts with respec t to the aforesaid two units are as follows. At the start of the permitted time on 1 April 2006, the SPs of unit #12-10 were Tan Soon Lai and Shirely Wee (“the Tans”) and the SPs of unit #04-06 were Nio Toh Nee and Lam Yee Ling (“the Nios”). The four of them signed the CSA between 1 and 4 April 2006. However, unknown to the SC, on 2 Oc tober 2006 the Tans transferred unit #12-10 to a c ompany, Stream Peak International Pte Ltd (“Stream Peak”), of whic h Tan Soon Lai is a direc tor and a substantial shareholder. The Tans did not inform the SC of this bec ause they had regarded the transac tion as an internal transfer. As a result the CSA was not exec uted by any agent of Stream Peak. In the c ase of unit #04-06, the Nios sold it to a c ouple (“the Sharmas”) and c ompleted the sale on 27 Dec ember 2006. The Nios notified the SC of the sale in November 2006 and the SC had instruc ted DTZ to arrange for the Sharmas to sign the CSA pursuant to Clause 6.1. thereof. However, due to an inadvertenc e, this was not done. Upon disc overing these omissions, DTZ proc ured the signatures of Stream Peak and the Sharmas to the CSA on 18 June 2007, i.e. after the permitted time. 

8       The appeal turns entirely on the question whether these two units c ould be c ounted for the purpose of asc ertaining the perc entage in s 84A(1). It is not disputed that without these two units, the threshold requirement of 80% would not be met. Sinc e the applic ation to the STB was, in the end, made by the SPs of these units representing 80.96% (whic h inc ludes the aforesaid two units, but exc ludes the six units in whic h the SPs had signed out of time), I shall hereafter refer to these 


SPs as “the Applic ants”. 

**The issue** 

9       The starting point is s 84A(1) of the Ac t, the relevant part of whic h provides as follows: 

 84A. —(1) An applic ation to a Board for an order for the sale of all the lots and c ommon property in a strata title plan may be made by — 

 (a) ... ; or 

 (b) the subsidiary proprietors of the lots with not less than 80% of the share values where 10 years or more have passed sinc e the date of the issue of the latest Temporary Oc c upation Permit on c ompletion of any building c omprised in the strata title plan or, if no Temporary Oc c upation Permit was issued, the date of the issue of the latest Certific ate of Statutory Completion for any building c omprised in the strata title plan, whic hever is the later, 

 who have agreed in writing to sell all the lots and c ommon property in the strata title plan to a purc haser under a sale and purc hase agreement whic h spec ifies the proposed method of distributing the sale proc eeds to all the subsidiary proprietors (whether in c ash or kind or both), subjec t to an order being made under subsec tion (6) or (7). 

As the Development is more than 10 years old, the matter falls under paragraph (b) of s 84A(1), in whic h the threshold is 80%. 

10     However under s 84A(3), the Applic ants are prec luded from making an applic ation under s 84A(1) unless they have c omplied with the requirements in the Sc hedule to the Ac t. Sec tion 84A(3) provides as follows: 

 (3) No applic ation may be made under subsec tion (1) by the subsidiary proprietors referred to in that subsec tion unless they have c omplied with the requirements spec ified in the Sc hedule and provided an undertaking to pay the c osts of the Board under subsec tion (5). 

The relevant portions of the Sc hedule are as follows in paragraphs 1 and 1A: 

**1.** Before making an applic ation to a Board, the subsidiary proprietors referred to in sec tion 84A(1) ... shall — 

 (a) exec ute within the permitted time but in no c ase more than 12 months before the date the applic ation is made, a c ollec tive sale agreement in writing among themselves (whether or not with other subsidiary proprietors or proprietors) agreeing to agree to c ollec tively sell — 

 (i) in the c ase of an applic ation under sec tion 84A , all the lots and c ommon property in a strata title plan; or 

 ... 

 1A. For the purposes of this Sc hedule — 

 (a) the permitted time in relation to a c ollec tive sale agreement exec uted or to be exec uted by subsidiary proprietors or proprietors referred to in sec tion 84A (1), 84D(2) or 84E (3), means a period — 


 (i) starting from the date the first subsidiary proprietor or proprietor, or his duly appointed attorney, as the c ase may be, signs the c ollec tive sale agreement; and 

 (ii) ending not more than 12 months after the date the first subsidiary proprietor or proprietor, or his duly appointed attorney, as the c ase may be, signs the c ollec tive sale agreement; and 

 (b) the c ollec tive sale agreement shall be regarded as exec uted notwithstanding that it is exec uted on separate c opies thereof and at different times. 

 [emphasis added] 

11     Paragraph 1 of the Sc hedule states that before making an applic ation to the STB, the SPs referred to in s 84A(1) ( _viz_ the Applic ants) shall exec ute a CSA within the permitted time. From the definition in paragraph 1A(a), the “permitted time” in this c ase is the period from 1 April 2006 (being the date of the first signature on the CSA) to 31 Marc h 2007 (being 12 months after the date of the first signature). 

12     Under s 3 of the Ac t, “subsidiary proprietor” is defined as “the registered subsidiary proprietor for the time being” of the relevant unit. Thus, the problem in this c ase is that, by the date of applic ation, the SPs of unit #12-10 and unit #04-06 were Stream Peak and the Sharmas but they had not signed the CSA within the permitted time, i.e. between 1 April 2006 and 31 Marc h 2007. It would therefore appear that the requirement in paragraph 1 of the Sc hedule has not been c omplied with. As mentioned above, without the share values assoc iated with these two units the c ombined share values would fall below the 80% threshold. 

13     The issue before me essentially is whether, pursuant to s 84A(3), suc h non-c omplianc e prec luded the Applic ants from making the applic ation under s 84A(1) and therefore the STB was c orrec t in dismissing it. 

**Plaintiffs’ first submission** 

14     The plaintiffs’ first submission was that the omission of the exec ution of the CSA by Stream Peak and the Sharmas is irrelevant as the previous SPs, namely the Tans and the Nios, had exec uted the CSA within the permitted time. Counsel for the plaintiffs pointed out that s 84A(15) provides that “subsidiary proprietor” inc ludes a suc c essor in title and therefore there was c omplianc e with paragraph 1 of the Sc hedule. 

15     The referenc e point in s 84A is the making of the applic ation to the STB in subsec tion (1). All referenc es to subsidiary proprietors are based on this event. Thus subsec tion (1)(b) refers to “subsidiary proprietors of the lots with not less than 80% of the share values” and subsec tion (3) speaks of “the subsidiary proprietors referred to in [subsec tion (1)]”. Read with the definition of subsidiary proprietor in s 3 as being “the subsidiary proprietor for the time being”, there is no question that the referenc es to subsidiary proprietor in s 84A are to the SP at the time of the applic ation to the STB and not a predec essor SP. The same referenc e obtains in paragraph 1 of the Sc hedule, i.e. “the subsidiary proprietors referred to in sec tion 84A(1) ... shall (a) exec ute within the permitted time ... a c ollec tive sale agreement ...”. Therefore the requirement in paragraph 1 to exec ute the CSA within the permitted time does not pertain to the Tans and the Nios who were not SPs by the time the applic ation to the STB was made on 13 June 2007. In relation to the two units that we are c onc erned with, it is Stream Peak and the Sharmas who are the SPs and who have to c omply with paragraph 1. 


16     The sec ond argument c onc erning s 84A(15) c an be very simply disposed of. This subsec tion provides as follows: 

 For the purposes of this sec tion, “subsidiary proprietor” inc ludes a suc c essor in title. 

Stream Peak and the Sharmas are the SPs who are required to exec ute the CSA. The Tans and the Nios are not their suc c essors in title but are in fac t their predec essors in title. Henc e they are not, for the purposes of s 84A, “subsidiary proprietors”. 

**Plaintiffs’ second submission** 

17     The plaintiffs’ sec ond submission was that the c ourt should take a purposive approac h to the matter rather than a tec hnic al one. Therefore although Stream Peak and the Sharmas had not exec uted the CSA within the permitted time, the following fac ts should c ompel the c ourt to hold that there was substantial c omplianc e: 

 (i) at all material times, more than 80% of the SPs by share value wanted the c ollec tive sale as the transfers by the Tans to Stream Peak and by the Nios to the Sharmas were done on the basis that the transferees c onsented to the c ollec tive sale; 

 (ii) by the time the STB dec ided on the matter, the SPs of all the units save one, c omprising 99% of the total share values, were agreeable to the c ollec tive sale; 

 (iii) as there were c ontrac tual provisions in the CSA obliging a party selling his unit during the permitted time to proc ure the agreement of the purc haser to exec ute the CSA, and the sale and purc hase agreements in relation to the two units required the purc hasers to exec ute the CSA, equity would bind Stream Peak and the Sharmas to the provisions of the CSA. The c ourt would issue an order for spec ific performanc e if they should refuse to transfer their property to the Purc haser pursuant to the sale and purc hase agreement and CSA. 

18     In relation to point (iii), the plaintiffs point to the following provisions in c lause 6.1 of the CSA: 

 6.1 Eac h of the Sellers hereby represents, warrants, c ovenants and/or irrevoc ably agrees (as the c ase may be) as follows :

 ... 

 6.1.2 that as at the date of exec ution of this Agreement by Eac h of the Sellers, His Unit is not the subjec t of any option to purc hase, sale, agreement or c ontrac t to sell or any assignment or transfer by whatever means; 

 6.1.3 not to do any of the following from the date of exec ution of this Agreement by Eac h of the Sellers in respec t of His Unit :

 (a) grant an option to purc hase 

 (b) sell 

 (c ) agree or c ontrac t to sell 

 (d) assign or transfer by whatever means; 


 unless third party/parties having suc h benefit thereof shall also, subjec t to the Sale Committee’s Approval, join as a party to this Agreement by signing the same forthwith (notwithstanding that the Agreement shall only bind suc h person(s) after c ompletion thereof ); Provided that that partic ular Seller shall indemnify the other Sellers for any c laims, losses, damages and/or otherwise arising therefrom; ... 

19     There is no question that the word “exec ute” in paragraph 1(a) of the Sc hedule, with referenc e to the CSA, means the signing of that agreement by a party with intent to give it legal effec t _vis-àvis_ all parties to it. The plaintiffs submit that in the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, the c ourt should adopt a purposive approac h and interpret that c ondition as being satisfied in relation to the two units under c onsideration. 

**Part VA of the Act** 

20     In order to determine this question, it is nec essary to c onsider the objec tive behind Part VA of the Ac t. This was enac ted in 1999 to fac ilitate c ollec tive sale of a development under a Strata Plan notwithstanding that there is no unanimity for the sale by all SPs. In _Ng Swee Lang v Samuel Bernard Sassoon_ <span class="citation">[2008] SGCA 7</span> ( _Ng Swee Lang_ ), the Court of Appeal elaborated on this polic y in the following manner at [5] [7]: 

 5 Before we deal with these grounds of appeal, we should understand the polic y c onsiderations applic able to the c ollec tive sale of c ondominiums and flats in Singapore. The c ollec tive sale, under whic h all the units and the c ommon property in a c ondominium development or a bloc k of flats (“subjec t property”) may be sold if a suffic ient number of subsidiary proprietors agree to it ..., is a pec uliar feature of the property market in Singapore. It is a statutory c onstruc t to give effec t to the Government’s polic y to fac ilitate urban renewal by enabling old apartment bloc ks to be redeveloped by the private sec tor. Initially, a c ollec tive sale c ould take plac e only if the subsidiary proprietors of all the lots in the subjec t property c onsented to the sale. However, due to rapid c hanges in the ec onomic and environmental landsc ape of Singapore, the Government dec ided to modify its polic y on c ollec tive sales by relaxing the stric t statutory c onditions applic able to suc h sales. At the sec ond reading of the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Bill (Bill 28 of 1998) (“the Bill”) to enac t these c hanges (“the Sec ond Reading”), the Minister of State for Law said (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (31 July 1998) vol 69 (“ Singapore Parliamentary Debates ”) at c ol 601): 

 I had informed this House on 19th November last year [ ie , 1997] that [the] Government would be amending the law to make it easier for en-bloc sales to take plac e. The c urrent position is that a single owner, for whatever reason, c an oppose and thwart a sale. [The] Government has rec eived many appeals and feedbac k from frustrated owners whose desires to sell their flats or c ondominiums en-bloc have been so thwarted. As a result, these buildings c annot take advantage of enhanc ed plot ratios to realise their full development potential, whic h would have c reated many more housing units in prime 999-year leasehold or freehold areas for Singaporeans. A sec ondary benefit is that these developments, espec ially in the older ones, c ould have been rejuvenated through the en-bloc proc ess. 

 I said that the law would be amended to remove the need for unanimous c onsent. ... [I]n land-sc arc e Singapore, suc h an approac h was even more imperative as it would make available more prime land for higher-intensity development to build more quality housing in Singapore. ... I highlighted the fac t that safeguards would be put in plac e to protec t the interests of the minority owners. 


 6 The new sc heme outlined above was enac ted by the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Ac t 1999 (Ac t 21 of 1999) (“the 1999 Amendment Ac t”). It modified two main qualifying c onditions for a c ollec tive sale. The first c onc erns the age of the subjec t property; the sec ond c onc erns the proportion of the subjec t property’s share value and the total area of the lots held by majority owners. These two c onditions are reflec ted in s 84A(1) of the Ac t as follows: 

 (a) if the subjec t property is less than ten years old, the majority owners must hold not less than 90% of the share values and not less than 90% of the total area of all the lots in the subjec t property; 

 (b) if the subjec t property is ten years old or more, the majority owners need only hold not less than 80% of the share values and not less than 80% of the total area of the lots in the subjec t property. 

 7 The 1999 Amendment Ac t also introduc ed a large number of proc edural steps and substantive safeguards to protec t the interests of minority owners, suc h as ensuring that they are kept fully informed by the subjec t property’s c ollec tive sale c ommittee of the progress of the sale and any developments in relation thereto. ... The basic idea of the c ollec tive sale sc heme is to enable majority owners to sell the subjec t property to a purc haser without the c onsent of the minority owners, subjec t to the approval of the Board. Onc e the Board has approved the c ollec tive sale applic ation, the Board’s order binds all the minority owners and they, together with the majority owners, are under an obligation to transfer their respec tive lots and the c ommon property to the purc haser in ac c ordanc e with the terms of the sale and purc hase agreement ... 

21     To this I should add that the legal regime brought into forc e by the enac tment of Part VA of the Ac t is a derogation of an individual’s right over any property that is held by way of a Strata Title issued under the Ac t or in some form of c ommon ownership. If the c onditions set out in Part VA are met, then a SP c an, in effec t, be c ompelled to transfer his property to another person notwithstanding that he does not c onsent to it. From the Parliamentary debates during the passage of the Bill, it c an be seen that the legislature had weighed the c ost of deprivation of the rights of the individual against the public interest in fac ilitating urban renewal in land sc arc e Singapore. It is also c lear that safeguards were built into the Part VA regime in order to ensure that the interests of the minority would be preserved. During the sec ond reading debate of the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Bill, the Minister of State for Law said (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Offic ial Report (31 July 1998) vol 69 (“Singapore Parliamentary Debates”) at c ol 635): 

 So the c orollary to that is that we should not c harac terise majority owners ... that they are greedy, they are avaric ious, all they want is to make money. I think it is not fair on majority owners, if it is what they are waiting for. But it does happen that Government's ac tions result in c ertain people getting ric her, getting a windfall. So shall we begrudge that? I would say no. Shall we fac ilitate it? Well, if it results in a public interest being met, whic h is the c reation of more homes for Singaporeans, a lot of them in prime freehold areas, then I will say yes, provided, of c ourse, there are suffic ient safeguards, and the interests of all parties are taken into ac c ount. And this indeed is the approac h we take in the Bill, if you look at the spec ific c riteria in the Bill taking into ac c ount all the objec tions of the minority, all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, all the interests of the parties. [emphasis added] 

22     At the beginning of the debate the Minister of State for Law had said that the safeguards are in the proc edures as well as the substantive powers of the STB. He elaborated at c ol 603 (Singapore Parliamentary Debates): 


 ... there will be adequate safeguards to protec t the interests of minority owners. These safeguards are found in the proc edures as well as in the substantive powers of the Strata Titles Board. 

 Let me first touc h on the proc edures. The majority owners will first enter into a c onditional sale and purc hase agreement to sell to a purc haser, subjec t to their obtaining an order from the Strata Titles Board. Thereafter, they must give notic e of the proposed en-bloc sale in the newspapers. They must also separately serve notic e of the proposed en-bloc sale on all interested parties, inc luding the owners, mortgagees and c hargees of the minority owners as well as on the management c orporation. This notic e must be ac c ompanied by a c opy of the advertisement published in the newspapers, the c onditional sale and purc hase agreement, the valuation report and the buyer's statutory dec laration stating his relationship, if any, to the owners. The c onditional sale and purc hase agreement must state the pric e and method of distributing the sale proc eeds. The majority owners must then apply to the Strata Titles Board for an order of sale, enc losing the doc uments mentioned earlier. The minority owners and their mortgagees or c hargee would then have 21 days to file their objec tions, if any, with the Board. 

 These proc edures will ensure that all relevant parties will have adequate notic e of the sale and its terms, in order to dec ide whether or not to lodge objec tions with the Strata Titles Board. I should add that no applic ation needs to be made to the Strata Titles Board if all the owners agree to the sale. In other words, applic ation to the Board is not a pre-requisite to all en-bloc sales but only when there is no unanimous c onsent. 

23     The Minister of State for Law desc ribed the position at the time, in whic h unanimous c onsent would be required for a c ollec tive sale to go through. He highlighted the c ase of Kim Lin Mansions and the unsatisfac tory state of affairs it had engendered at c ol 602 (Singapore Parliamentary Debates): 

 The c urrent requirement of unanimous c onsent is untenable. The c ase of Kim Lin Mansions whic h was rec ently highlighted in the press brings this out c learly. Community living, whic h is the heart of living in a c ondominium, all but disappears when owners have to drag out their disagreement in c ourt, inc urring huge financ ial outlays in the proc ess. There is unc ertainty; there is delay; there is ac rimony. Also, as more developments age and inc ur large upgrading and repair bills, opting for en-bloc sale will inc reasingly bec ome a viable option. But the existing law whic h requires unanimous c onsent makes it extremely diffic ult, if not impossible, to realise en-bloc sales. [emphasis added] 

24     This is an important statement for it shows that it must be a primary objec tive of the Bill to avoid owners dragging their disagreement to c ourt with the attendant unc ertainty, delay, ac rimony and huge c osts in terms not only of legal fees but also of human misery. Indeed that would have been a major reason why the Bill intended for a proc edure that would vest finality in a dec ision of the STB and for an appeal to be permitted only on a point of law. As the Minister of State said at c ol 604 (Singapore Parliamentary Debates): 

 Let me now elaborate on the role of the Board, in partic ular, how it ac ts as a safeguard. The Board will first satisfy itself that the required c onsent has been obtained and that presc ribed proc edures have been c omplied with. It will not review or intervene to determine the terms of sale. Essentially, its role is to determine that the proposed sale is bona fide and an arm's length transac tion so that the proposed sale c an proc eed. It will do this by c onsidering the minority's objec tions, the interests of all the owners, all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase and the sc heme and intent of the en-bloc provisions in the Bill. The Board will look at the sale pric e, method of distributing the sale proc eeds to ensure that the minority owners are treated no less favourably 


 than the majority, and the relationship of the purc haser to the owners, to ensure that there is no c ollusion. If the Board dec ides that the transac tion is bona fide and an arm's length transac tion, the sale will proc eed. Otherwise, the sale c annot proc eed and the majority owners would have to rework their proposal if they still wish to sell en-bloc. The Board will not rewrite the agreement for the parties. 

 The Board will c onsider, as I have said, all the objec tions filed by the minority owners, their mortgagees and c hargees. Some minority owners may raise objec tions whic h are personal in nature or pec uliar to their own c irc umstanc es, eg, he has bought his unit rec ently at a muc h higher pric e than that paid for by the other owners, or he has spent a large amount on renovations. Others may raise objec tions based on sentimental reasons, eg, he has lived in the development for a long time and does not wish to move out. The Board will mediate in these situations. It is expec ted that skilful mediation will overc ome many of these objec tions. If mediation fails, the sale will nevertheless proc eed as long as the transac tion is bona fide and at arm's length, unless there are exc eptional c irc umstanc es to warrant the Board assuming a more pro-ac tive role; for example, the sale proc eeds are lower than the purc hase pric e he had paid for the unit or are insuffic ient to redeem the outstanding mortgage or c harge on the unit. This is based on the underlying assumption that none of the owners in an en-bloc sale should lose out financ ially. 

 Sir, the Board's dec ision will be final. An appeal c an be made to the High Court only on a point of law, or where there is alleged irregularity in the proc ess. Owners will be prec luded from applying to the c ourt under sec tion 78 of the Ac t to terminate a strata development if they are not granted an order from the Board for an en-bloc sale or are unable to sec ure the required majority c onsent, unless there are exc eptional extenuating c irc umstanc es suc h as the majority owners refusing to pay for repairs to prevent a building from being unsafe. In other words, sec tion 78 will remain in the Ac t but is used for very spec ific c irc umstanc es. There will therefore be finality. 

 [emphasis added] 

25     For this to be ac hieved it must be the intention of the legislature that where a c ondition is expressed in c lear terms, there c an be no sc ope for the argument that the STB must look beyond the express provision and undertake the onerous task of c onsidering all sorts of submissions of fac t and law in order to divine the true intention of Parliament. It c annot be the intention of the legislature that, in respec t of any provision that is expressed in c lear terms, the STB would be asked to interpret it in any other manner. The STB is not a c ourt of law and c ertainly not equipped to make a determination on subtle questions of law. The effec t of permitting any derogation from provisions that are c lear on their terms – and I should add, so c lear in the present c ase that the professionals who advise the sales c ommittee omit mention of them at their professional peril – would be to engender appeals to c ourt from the dec ision of the STB no matter what dec ision it makes. It bears emphasising that this would result in owners dragging their disagreement to c ourt with the attendant unc ertainty, delay, ac rimony and huge c osts in terms not only of legal fees but also of human misery. Indeed, this is exac tly what has happened in more than a few c ases involving suc h c ollec tive sales. Subsidiary proprietors, espec ially if they reside in the properties proposed for sale, are understandably c onc erned and c an be expec ted to go to any lengths to preserve their rights. Some stand to make enormous monetary gains; for others, the issue is not purely monetary but emotional as well. Therefore in relation to provisions that are c lear on their terms, the approac h should be to give full effec t to those terms. As it is there is enough ambiguity in the legislation see _Ng Swee Lang_ at [9]: 

 9 Although the c ollec tive sale sc heme is relatively straightforward, unfortunately, the legislation 


 giving effec t to it – viz , Pt VA of the Ac t – is not free from diffic ulty. The provisions of Pt VA have given rise to muc h litigation between minority owners and majority owners, and even among majority owners themselves. In this appeal, the meaning and effec t of s 84A of the Ac t is c ontested by both parties. ... 

26     As the Court of Appeal remarked, Part VA has spawned muc h litigation, no doubt at great c ost to all c onc erned. Indeed, beyond mere pec uniary c ost lies the strain of the unc ertainty to every family entangled in proposed c ollec tive sales. In the fac e of a proposal for c ollec tive sale, an SP must dec ide on the c ourse of ac tion. Is the property market likely to rise, stay level or fall within the time frame of the sale? Depending on his outlook, he has to dec ide whether to buy now in replac ement or later or not to replac e at all. If he resides in the property, the dec ision is all the more pressing. This dec ision proc ess is made more diffic ult if there is greater unc ertainty as to whether the c ollec tive sale will go through. A regime that promotes greater c ertainty would go a long way towards alleviating the pec uniary and human c ost of the exerc ise. 

**Is compliance mandatory?** 

27     I turn then to examine whether the non-c omplianc e in question prec ludes the Applic ants from making the applic ation to the STB under s 84A. In Ng Swee Lang’s c ase, the Court of Appeal held that the failure to spec ify the proposed method of distributing the sale proc eeds in the sale and purc hase agreement was not fatal to the applic ation. The dec ision c onc erned the interpretation of s 84A(1) of the Ac t whic h, in that c ase, provided as follows: 

 (1) An applic ation to [the] Board for an order for the sale of all the lots and c ommon property in a strata title plan may be made by — 

 ... 

 (b) the subsidiary proprietors of the lots with not less than 80% of the share values and not less than 80% of the total area of all the lots (exc luding the area of any ac c essory lot) where 10 years or more have passed sinc e the date of the issue of the latest Temporary Oc c upation Permit on c ompletion of any building (not being c ommon property) c omprised in the strata title plan ... 

 who have agreed in writing to sell all the lots and c ommon property in the strata title plan to a purc haser under a sale and purc hase agreement whic h spec ifies the proposed method of distributing the sale proc eeds to all the subsidiary proprietors (whether in c ash or kind or both), subjec t to an order being made under subsec tion (6) or (7). 

 [emphasis added] 

28     The question was whether, on a proper c onstruc tion of s 84A(1), the omission of the method of distribution of sale proc eeds in the sale and purc hase agreement would require the STB to dismiss the applic ation. It bears noting that the distribution method was set out in the CSA and was known to all parties inc luding the minority owners. The Court of Appeal upheld the adoption by the judge below of the modern approac h towards statutory interpretation, whic h was to c onsider the sc heme and purpose of the Ac t, weighing the importanc e of the partic ular requirement in the c ontext of the purpose and c onsidering whether the legislature would have intended the c onsequenc es of a stric t c onstruc tion, having regard to the prejudic e to private rights and the c laims of the public interest. The Court of Appeal said at [23]: 

 23 ... All [the Judge] meant to say was that the modern approac h is to c onsider whether it is the 


 intention of Parliament to invalidate any ac t done in breac h of a statutory provision. Applying this approac h to the fac ts of the present appeal, we should ask whether Parliament intended the non-stipulation of the distribution method in the S&P Agreement to deprive the respondents of the c apac ity to make the Applic ation. We agree fully with the Judge’s approac h. 

29     The Court of Appeal proc eeded to analyse the language of s 84A(1), and said at [32]: 

 32 A c lose examination of s 84A(1), read in its proper c ontext, makes it c lear that the jurisdic tional or prec edent fac ts in this subsec tion (the absenc e of whic h would lead the Board to disapprove a c ollec tive sale applic ation) are referable only to the age of the subjec t property as well as the share values and the total area of the lots held by the majority owners. The referenc e in the same subsec tion to spec ific ation of the distribution method, whic h is the nub of the appellants’ argument, is redundant and unnec essary as it has already been provided for in s 84A(3) read with the First, Sec ond and Third Sc hedules to the Ac t, the effec t of whic h will be c onsidered later. In our view, the referenc e was inc luded ex abundanti cautela. 

30     The Court of Appeal also said at [35] that this was a truly tec hnic al objec tion that had not c aused any prejudic e to the minority owners. However the situation was different as regards c omplianc e with the provisions in the Sc hedule whic h is governed by the express provision in s 84A(3). The c ourt said at [34]: 

 34 The language of s 84A(1) may be c ompared with that of s 84A(3), whic h provides expressly that “no applic ation may be made” under s 84A(1) by the subsidiary proprietors referred to in that subsec tion ( ie , the majority owners) unless they have c omplied with the requirements spec ified in the First, Sec ond and Third Sc hedules to the Ac t and have provided an undertaking to pay the c osts of the Board under s 84A(5). In the c ase of s 84A(3), the c onverse proposition is true as a matter of logic – ie , a c ollec tive sale applic ation may be made only if the majority owners have c omplied with all the requirements of s 84A(3). This point is c ruc ial as, in the present c ase, the Applic ation c omplied fully with the requirements of s 84A(3) read with the First, Sec ond and Third Sc hedules to the Ac t. Sec tion 84A(3) c overs all the requirements in s 84A(1), other than the spec ific ation of the distribution method. If, therefore, majority owners may (in the sense of being entitled to) make a c ollec tive sale applic ation to the Board under s 84A(3) where all the requirements of that subsec tion have been c omplied with, there would be no reason for Parliament to deprive them of the same right under s 84A(1) merely bec ause of a failure to c omply with the provision in that subsec tion ( ie , s 84A(1)) that the sale and purc hase agreement must set out the distribution method. In this respec t, s 84A(3) is c onsistent with the legislative intent that the sale and purc hase agreement is to be made between the majority owners and the purc haser and that the minority owners do not have to be party to the said agreement. As far as the purc haser is c onc erned, he is only obliged to pay the vendors ( ie , the subsidiary proprietors of all the units in the subjec t property) a c ollec tive pric e for the entire subjec t property to c omplete the purc hase thereof. The spec ific ation of the distribution method is not a relevant term of the sale and purc hase agreement. It may well be that, in some c ollec tive sales, the purc haser might be prepared to pay the owners who c onsent to the sale their share of the sale pric e separately, espec ially where there are no minority owners. But that is not a requirement presc ribed in the First Sc hedule. [emphasis added] 

31     The Court of Appeal was dealing with the version of the Ac t after the amendments of 4 Oc tober 2007, whic h has four sc hedules, whereas the version prior to that had only one sc hedule. However the substantive provisions are the same as well as the princ iple. Sec tion 84A(3) of the version of the Ac t under c onsideration before me (also set out above at [10]) provides as follows: 


 (3) No applic ation may be made under subsec tion (1) by the subsidiary proprietors referred to in that subsec tion unless they have c omplied with the requirements spec ified in the Sc hedule and provided an undertaking to pay the c osts of the Board under subsec tion (5). [emphasis added] 

32     As held by the Court of Appeal, an applic ation under s 84A(1) for c ollec tive sale may only be made if the majority owners (meaning the Applic ants) have c omplied with the requirements of the Sc hedule. The Sc hedule itself c ontains a large number of provisions and bears reproduc tion in full: 

 REQUIREMENTS UNDER SECTION 84A, 84D OR 84E

**1A.** For the purposes of this Sc hedule — 

(a) the permitted time in relation to a c ollec tive sale agreement exec uted or to be exec uted by subsidiary proprietors or proprietors referred to in sec tion 84A (1), 84D (2)or 84E (3), means a period — 

 (i) starting from the date the first subsidiary proprietor or proprietor, or his duly appointed attorney, as the c ase may be, signs the c ollec tive sale agreement; and

(b) the c ollec tive sale agreement shall be regarded as exec uted notwithstanding that it is exec uted on separate c opies thereof and at different times. 

**2.** The notic e referred to in paragraph 1( _e_ ) to be served by registered post shall be served on an affec ted party — 

(a) where the party is a subsidiary proprietor of a lot in the strata title plan, at the address as shown on the strata roll;

(c ) where the party is a mortgagee, c hargee or other person with an estate and interest in the lot or flat whose interest is notified on the land-register, at the address on the strata roll or last rec orded address at the Registry of Titles or Registry of Deeds; and 

(d) where the party is a management c orporation, at its address rec orded on the folio of the land-register c omprising the c ommon property. 

**3.** The advertisement referred to in paragraph 1( _d_ ) shall inc lude —

(d) brief details of the sale proposal; and 

(e) the plac e at whic h the affec ted parties c an inspec t doc uments for the c ollec tive sale. 

**4.** An applic ation to a Board shall be made by the subsidiary proprietors referred to in sec tion 84A (1) or the proprietors referred to in sec tion 84D (2) or 84E (3) within 14 days of the public ation of the advertisement referred to in paragraph 1 ( _d_ ), enc losing — 

(a) the doc uments spec ified in paragraph 1( _e_ ); 

(b) a statutory dec laration made by the representatives appointed under sec tion 84A (2) or their solic itors stating — 

 (i) the date the permitted time for the c ollec tive sale agreement started; 

 (ii) the date on whic h c ollec tive sale agreement referred to in paragraph 1 ( a ) was last exec uted by any subsidiary proprietor or proprietor referred to in sec tion 84A (1), 84D (2)or 84E (3), as the c ase may be; 

 (iii) the date or dates on whic h the notic e or notic es referred to in paragraph 1( b ) were affixed; and

(c ) a list of the names of the subsidiary proprietors who have not agreed in writing to the sale, their mortgagees, c hargees and other persons (other than lessees) with an estate or interest in the lots or flats whose interests are notified on the land-register; and 

(d) suc h other doc ument as the Board may require. 

**5.** The Board shall, within 5 days of the filing of an objec tion, serve a c opy of it by registered post on the representatives appointed under sec tion 84A (2) and their solic itors, if any. 


**6.** The subsidiary proprietors referred to in sec tion 84A (1) or the proprietors referred to in sec tion 84D (2) or 84E (3) shall, after making an applic ation to the Board, c ause a c opy of the applic ation to be registered under the Ac t, the Land Titles Ac t (Cap. 157) or the Registration of Deeds Ac t (Cap. 269), as the c ase may be. 

**7.** The subsidiary proprietors referred to in paragraph 6 shall, if an order for sale is granted by the     Board under sec tion 84A, 84Dor 84E, register the order of the Board in ac c ordanc e with the Ac t, the Land Titles Ac t or the Registration of Deeds Ac t (Cap. 269), as the c ase may be, or if the order for sale is not granted by the Board, apply to c anc el the applic ation registered under paragraph 6. 

**8.** For the purposes of this Sc hedule, “affec ted parties” means — 

 (a) the subsidiary proprietors referred to in sec tion 84A (1) or the proprietors referred to in sec tion 84D (2) or 84E (3); 

 (b) the subsidiary proprietors of the lots or the proprietors of the flats who have not agreed in writing to the sale, and any mortgagee, c hargee and other person (other than a lessee) with an estate or interest in the lot or flat whose interest is notified on the land-register; 

 (c ) the proprietor of the land under sec tion 84E, his mortgagee, c hargee or other person with an estate or interest in the land whose interest is notified on the land register; and 

 (d) the management c orporation, where applic able. 

33     It c an be seen that the requirements in the Sc hedule fall into two c ategories. The first c ategory c omprises those requirements that, if not c omplied with before the applic ation is made, may easily be c ured by subsequent c omplianc e and a refiling of the applic ation. For example, under paragraph 1(d), if the sales c ommittee had not advertised the partic ulars of the applic ation in approved newspapers at the time the applic ation was filed, this may be c ured by c ausing the advertisements to be duly published and making a fresh applic ation. Into this c ategory fits most of the requirements in the Sc hedule. The sec ond c ategory pertains to those requirements whic h c annot be c ured by mere refiling bec ause the time for c omplianc e has lapsed. The primary example of this c ategory is paragraph 1(a) whic h requires the Applic ants to: 

 exec ute within the permitted time ... a c ollec tive sale agreement in writing among themselves ... agreeing to agree to c ollec tively sell ... all the lots and c ommon property ... [emphasis added] 

The reason that this omission c annot be c ured by a simple refiling is due to the definition of “permitted time”. Paragraph 1A of the Sc hedule provides that this is a period that c ommenc es from the date that the first SP signs the CSA and ends not more than 12 months after that. The period is fixed with referenc e to date of the first signature (whic h in the present c ase is 1 April 2006). Any signature after the 12 month period, i.e. after 31 Marc h 2007, would not be in c omplianc e with this requirement. The only way to c ure this is to start the proc ess all over again with a new CSA. There is only one other requirement in the Sc hedule that belongs to the sec ond c ategory, that is c ontained in paragraph 1(b). Again this is due to the referenc e there to the start of the permitted time. 

34     The question I have to dec ide is whether, on the modern approac h to statutory interpretation endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _Ng Swee Lang_ , it was the intention of Parliament for s 84A(3) to operate to invalidate the applic ation if there was no c omplianc e with the requirement in paragraph 1(a) of the Sc hedule. 


35     The plaintiffs have submitted that the SPs of the two units had agreed all along to the CSA and the failure to ac tually put their signatures on it was due to mistake or inadvertenc e and is therefore a mere tec hnic ality. The plaintiffs also point out that as at the date of the hearing by the STB, the SPs of 99% share value wanted the sale to proc eed and only the SP of one unit, representing less than 1% share value, refused to sell. These are c ompelling arguments indeed but to suc c umb to suc h arguments would, in my view, defeat the safeguards put in plac e by the legislature to protec t the minority. I have set out above the gist of the Parliamentary debate on the matter. The sc heme of Part VA was laid out before Parliament and there was c onsiderable debate by members partic ularly c onc erning how this was a derogation of property rights of the individual. In the end Parliament passed the Bill in its present form. The legislature had c onsidered that the protec tion enshrined in the legislation c onstitutes an appropriate balanc e between the individual rights it has taken away and c ommunal interests it has promoted. It is therefore not for the c ourt to water down the protec tion afforded by the legislation in its present form in favour of the majority, vast though it may be. 

36     The legislature had c arefully c rafted a sc heme, in the form of paragraph 1(a) of the Sc hedule, whereby the Applic ants would have up to 12 months from the date of the first signature to persuade SPs to sign up and c ommit themselves to the terms of the CSA. There is also a further requirement for the Applic ants to apply to the STB within 12 months of the final exec ution (this pertains to the provision “but in no c ase more than 12 months before the date the applic ation is made”). Altogether, therefore, the c ollec tive sale proc ess is envisioned to last not longer than 24 months from the date of the first signature to the applic ation. The legislation also required the SC to report, at eight-week intervals, in the four offic ial languages, the number of SPs who have adhered to the CSA within that period and the new perc entage of adherents. 

37     Although there is nothing in the Parliamentary debates that direc tly explains the purpose of the requirements of paragraph 1(a) of the Sc hedule, it has nevertheless been expressly stated by the Minister of State for Law that the “safeguards are found in the proc edures” (Singapore Parliamentary Debates c ol 603). Further, it is not diffic ult to divine the reason for these safeguards. Timing is important bec ause the longer the proc ess is dragged out, the greater the likelihood that market c onditions will c hange. 

38     To take the plaintiffs’ position would mean that so long as 80% or more agree to sell by the time of the hearing before the STB, then the STB should make the order for sale. That would in effec t c ast out the sc heme passed by Parliament. It would also negate the safeguards that it had enac ted after muc h debate and deliberation. Therefore it is not possible to say that the non-c omplianc e with paragraph 1(a) in the present c ase is a mere tec hnic ality. 

**Conclusion** 

39     I have established that the requirement in paragraph 1(a) of the Sc hedule is set out in c lear terms. It expressly provides that, before making an applic ation to the STB the SPs (defined in s 3 as SPs for the time being) of lots having at least 80% share values “shall exec ute within the permitted time ... a c ollec tive sale agreement.” The SPs in relation to the two units had not done so. It is provided in s 84A(3) that the Applic ants may not make an applic ation under s 84A(1) unless they have c omplied with the requirements set out in the Sc hedule. This was held by the Court of Appeal in _Ng Swee Lang_ to be a substantive prohibition. I have c onsidered the legislative debate during the passage of the Bill and c onc luded that Parliament had intended a proc ess that is simple and expeditious, partic ularly in respec t of any provision that is expressed in c lear terms. I have c onsidered that the requirement in paragraph 1(a) is a substantive c ondition put in plac e by the legislature to protec t the legitimate rights of the minority. In view of the foregoing, I c annot say that it was not the intention of Parliament to invalidate the applic ation upon breac h of paragraph 1(a) of the 


Sc hedule. 

40     Ac c ordingly, the plaintiffs must fail in their appeal against the dismissal by the STB of their applic ation.
