**Ang Cheng Hock JC:** 

**Introduction** 

1       This was an appeal against the dec ision of an Assistant Registrar who dismissed the applic ant’s applic ation for an extension of an interim order that had been granted under s 45(1) of the Bankruptc y Ac t (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (the “Ac t”) (“the Registrar’s Appeal”). After hearing arguments, I dismissed the Registrar’s Appeal. The applic ant has appealed against my dec ision. I now set out the grounds of my dec ision. 

**Facts** 

**_Background to the application_** 

2       The bac kground to this matter has been extensively set out in _Re Aathar Ah Kong Andrew_ [2018] SGHC 124, a dec ision by Valerie Thean J where the approval whic h the c reditors of the applic ant had given to a voluntary arrangement proposed by the applic ant was revoked. I will only set out the fac ts insofar as they are relevant to the Registrar’s Appeal that was heard by me. 

3       The applic ant desc ribed himself as an investor in several businesses and markets over many years. His primary investments were in private equity, bonds and listed stoc ks in sec tors suc h as 

c ommodities and healthc are in Singapore and Indonesia. [note: 1] He has been deep in debt sinc e 2015, if not earlier, bec ause of the dec line in worldwide c ommodity pric es and a plunge that year in the share pric es of listed healthc are equities in whic h he had invested. Financ ial institutions from whic h he had obtained financ ing and to whic h he had provided guarantees pulled their lines of c redit and c alled on him to fulfil his obligations. One of them, Citibank Singapore Limited (“Citibank”), filed a bankruptc y applic ation against him in February 2016. 


4       In May 2016, the applic ant made an applic ation under s 45(1) of the Bankruptc y Ac t for an interim order in c onnec tion with a proposal he wanted to make to his c reditors for a voluntary arrangement whic h would have the effec t of a c ompromise in satisfac tion of debts amounting to approximately S$191m. He proposed to pay these c reditors a total amount of S$1.5m in three tranc hes over 26 months. He had sec ured an interest free loan from a business assoc iate to fund the payment. 

5       The interim order was granted on 24 May 2016. The effec t of an interim order is set out in s 45(3) of the Ac t, whic h provides that: 

 (3) An interim order shall have the effec t that, during the period for whic h it is in forc e – 

 ( a ) where the interim order is in respec t of an individual debtor – 

 (i) no bankruptc y applic ation may be made or proc eeded with against the debtor; and 

 (ii) no other proc eedings, exec ution or other legal proc ess may be c ommenc ed or c ontinued against the person or property of the debtor without the leave of the c ourt ... 

6       The Ac t requires that proposals for voluntary arrangement inc lude the appointment of a person c alled a “nominee”, who has c ertain statutory duties suc h as to prepare a report on the debtor’s proposal for submission to the c ourt. The nominee for the applic ant’s voluntary arrangement was an ac c ountant. He duly submitted his report on the applic ant’s proposal as required under the Ac t. The c ourt permitted a c reditors’ meeting to be c alled. The c reditors’ meeting was c haired by the nominee but the applic ant did not attend. This resulted in an another meeting where the applic ant was asked to attend so that he c ould address issues raised by some c reditors. At this adjourned c reditors’ meeting, the voluntary arrangement was approved by the requisite majority of the c reditors. 

7       Several c reditors who had voted against the approval of the voluntary arrangement then applied to c ourt for the approval to be set aside. Their applic ations were granted by an Assistant Registrar on 8 Marc h 2017. His grounds of dec ision are reported in _Re Aathar Ah Kong Andrew_ [2017] SGHCR 4. 

8       The applic ant appealed against this dec ision, but withdrew his appeal on the date sc heduled for the hearing of the appeal. He then filed an applic ation on 21 June 2017 for _another_ interim order under s 45(1) of the Ac t on the basis that he was making a new proposal to his c reditors for a voluntary arrangement. Under this new proposal, the applic ant would now pay a total of S$3m, whic h he would borrow, to his c reditors in five tranc hes over 50 months. This proposal now c overed c reditors to whom the applic ant owed a total amount of approximately S$317m. For this sec ond proposal, the applic ant appointed a senior lawyer as his nominee. 

9       On 11 July 2017, the c ourt granted the interim order. This was the interim order in question whic h the applic ant was applying to extend in the Registrar’s Appeal before me. But before I c ome to that applic ation, it is important to rec ount what transpired in relation to this sec ond proposal for a voluntary arrangement. 

10     The nominee submitted his report in September 2017. The first c reditors’ meeting was held on 5 Oc tober 2017. This meeting was adjourned after questions were raised by c reditors on various issues. The c reditors voted on the proposal at the adjourned c reditors’ meeting on 19 Oc tober 2017. On 20 and 25 Oc tober 2017, the nominee wrote to the c reditors to inform them that the voluntary arrangement had been approved by the requisite majority of c reditors. In the proc ess of asc ertaining 


whether the threshold had been c rossed, the nominee ac c orded no value to c ertain litigation c laims and he admitted a c reditor’s c laim of approximately S$20m whic h he had previously adjudic ated as being unsupported by doc uments. 

11     Four c reditors, who had objec ted to the voluntary arrangement, then filed applic ations under s 54 of the Ac t to set aside the c reditors’ approval of the voluntary arrangement. These were (i) CIMB Sec urities (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“CIMB”); (ii) Citibank; (iii) KGI Sec urities (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“KGI”); and (iv) OUE Lippo Healthc are Limited (“OUELH”), formerly known as International Healthway Corporation Ltd. 

12     The applic ations were heard in the first instanc e by Valerie Thean J on 14 Marc h 2018. After hearing parties, Thean J held that s 54(1)( _b_ ) of the Ac t was satisfied in that there were material irregularities in the c onduc t of the c reditors’ meeting, arising from the nominee’s dec isions and the applic ant’s lac k of disc losure. The judge ac c ordingly set aside the approval for the voluntary arrangement at the hearing and direc ted that no further c reditors’ meetings be held. As mentioned earlier, the grounds of Thean J’s dec ision are in _Re Aathar Ah Kong Andrew_ [2018] SGHC 124. 

13     The applic ant appealed against Thean J’s dec ision. He felt it nec essary to file a total of four appeals – Civil Appeal Nos 60 to 63 of 2018 – bec ause eac h of the c reditors named at [11] above had filed a separate applic ation to set aside the c reditors’ approval, all of whic h had been allowed. Following this, the applic ant then filed the applic ation seeking an extension of the interim order made on 11 July 2017 until the determination of his four appeals by the Court of Appeal. The extension sought was pursuant to s 45(4) of the Ac t. 

**The parties’ cases** 

**_The hearing below_** 

14     The applic ation for an extension of the interim order was heard on 5 June 2018 by an Assistant Registrar. Before the Assistant Registrar, the applic ant argued that his appeals to the Court of Appeal against the dec ision of Thean J would be rendered nugatory if the interim order was not extended. This was bec ause he might be made a bankrupt before the appeals were heard. If so, the applic ant would have to seek the leave of the Offic ial Assignee (the “OA”) before he c ould proc eed with the appeals, and leave might not be forthc oming bec ause the c laims against him exc eeded S$300m. Even if leave were granted by the OA, this might c ause delays to the hearing of the appeals bec ause it was submitted by c ounsel for the applic ant that “the OA does not work very fast”. The applic ant also argued that he would have to put up more sec urity than the S$80,000 (S$20,000 for eac h appeal) he had already provided. This is bec ause he would have to provide sec urity for his c ounsel’s c osts as well. Finally, it was argued that the applic ant might not be able to fully utilise his expertise in financ e and his work experienc e if he were made a bankrupt as he would lose his c redibility and might not be granted permission to leave Singapore for work. 

15     CIMB and OUELH objec ted to the applic ation, while Citibank and KGI took no position on the matter. The objec ting c reditors argued that the applic ant had not shown any spec ial c irc umstanc es for the c ourt to grant an extension of the interim order. It was pointed out that there was no evidenc e to suggest that the OA would not grant leave for the applic ant to proc eed with his appeals if he were to be made bankrupt before the appeals were heard. It was also argued that there would be prejudic e to the c reditors if an extension of the interim order were granted bec ause it had been more than two years sinc e Citibank’s bankruptc y applic ation was filed, but the applic ant had still not been made a bankrupt and his debts c ontinued to inc rease. Worse, the applic ant had been allowed to c ause his c reditors to inc ur more legal c osts while at the same time refusing to pay all the 


outstanding c osts orders arising from the two failed voluntary arrangements. 

16     The Assistant Registrar dismissed the applic ation for extension of the interim order. He was of the view that the applic ant had not shown good reasons to justify its extension, and that the appeals would not be rendered nugatory if the applic ant was made bankrupt. The Assistant Registrar also rejec ted the argument that the applic ant would not be able to utilise his expertise in financ e and his work experienc e bec ause the OA c ould grant the applic ant permission to travel for his work. 

17     As for prejudic e to the c reditors, the Assistant Registrar ac c epted that suc h prejudic e was real given that there had been a long delay sinc e bankruptc y proc eedings were first c ommenc ed against the applic ant. Further, the applic ant was refusing to satisfy the outstanding c osts orders against him despite being prepared to furnish a not inc onsiderable amount as sec urity for his four appeals in relation to the sec ond failed voluntary arrangement. 

**_The Registrar’s Appeal_** 

18     Being dissatisfied with the dec ision of the Assistant Registrar, the applic ant appealed. 

19     The applic ant made c ertain new arguments before me. First, it was pointed out that Part V of the Ac t dealing with voluntary arrangements did not apply to an individual debtor who is an undisc harged bankrupt. Sec tion 44 of the Ac t states in its material part: 

 This Part not applicable to undischarged bankrupts 

44\. This Part shall not apply – 

 ( a ) to any individual debtor who is an undisc harged bankrupt; ... 

Ac c ording to the applic ant, if he were made a bankrupt before the hearing of his appeals, the Court of Appeal would dismiss his appeals without going into their merits on the ground that, as an undisc harged bankrupt, he c ould no longer avail himself of this sc heme of voluntary arrangements provided under the Ac t. 

20     Sec ond, the applic ant also argued that the Assistant Registrar erred in applying the princ iples relating to stay of exec ution pending appeals in dec iding whether to extend the interim order under s 45(4) of the Ac t. The applic ant had previously satisfied the c onditions for making an interim order under s 48(1) of the Ac t and the interim order had ac c ordingly been granted on 11 July 2017. The applic ant argued that nothing had c hanged sinc e 11 July 2017 despite Thean J’s dec ision to revoke the c reditors’ approval of the voluntary arrangement. This is bec ause the Court of Appeal will c onduc t a rehearing of the matter when it hears the applic ant’s appeals. Ac c ordingly, the purpose of the interim order, whic h is to fac ilitate c onsideration of the proposed voluntary arrangement, was still being met pending the appeals to the Court of Appeal. In short, the applic ant argued that an interim order should _always_ be extended pending an appeal against a dec ision by the c ourt to revoke the c reditors’ approval of the voluntary arrangement proposal. 

21     CIMB and OUELH opposed the applic ation but there was a divergenc e in their arguments before me. 

22     Counsel for CIMB c ontinued to argue that the c ourt c ould in its disc retion grant an extension of the interim order under s 45(4) of the Ac t even after Thean J’s dec ision and that the applic able princ iples whic h govern how this disc retion was to be exerc ised were those relating to the grant of a 


stay of exec ution pending an appeal. The applic ant had not shown that the fac ts justified an extension of the interim order. There were no spec ial c irc umstanc es. Thus, the extension of the interim order should not be granted. 

23     On the other hand, c ounsel for OUELH argued that the applic ant’s relianc e on s 45(4) of the Ac t was misc onc eived bec ause that provision only applies to a making of the interim order at the first instanc e when a debtor intends to make his proposal for the voluntary arrangement. Henc e, the applic ation should be dismissed on that basis that the c ourt had no power under s 45(4) to extend the interim order at this stage of the matter. But, alternatively, even if the c ourt c ould exerc ise a disc retion under s 45(4) to extend the interim order in question, it should not do so for various reasons, inc luding that the applic ant’s proposal had already been found to be not serious or viable, and also that it would prejudic e the c reditors’ right to proc eed with exec ution or bankruptc y proc eedings against the applic ant. This is espec ially given the long delay sinc e the applic ant admitted to being insolvent. 

**Issues to be determined** 

24     The broad issues before me were thus as follows: 

 (a) Did the c ourt have the power under s 45(4) to extend an interim order granted under s 45(1) of the Ac t at this stage of the proc eedings? 

 (b) If the answer to (a) is the affirmative, what were the princ iples that apply to whether suc h an extension should be granted? 

 (c ) On the fac ts of this c ase, should the interim order granted on 11 July 2017 be extended pending the determination of the applic ant’s appeals to the Court of Appeal? 

**_The extension of interim orders under s 45(4) of the Act_** 

25     In my view, the statutory provisions c learly delineate the c ourt’s role and powers in relation to the grant of interim orders in the c ontext of voluntary arrangements. I thus begin by outlining the relevant statutory framework under the Ac t. 

26     As already mentioned above, Part V of the Ac t deals with voluntary arrangements. 

27     Sec tion 45 of the Ac t gives the c ourt the power to make an interim order where an insolvent debtor intends to make a proposal for a voluntary arrangement to his c reditors. While an interim order is in forc e, bankruptc y applic ations c annot be made or proc eeded with against the debtor. Further, no other proc eedings c an be started or c ontinued against the debtor or his property without leave of the c ourt. However, s 45(4) makes c lear that this moratorium is in plac e only for a fixed time: 

 (4) An interim order shall c ease to have effec t 42 days after the making thereof unless the c ourt otherwise direc ts. 

28     The c onditions whic h must be satisfied before the c ourt will c onsider granting an interim order are set out in s 48(1). First, the debtor intends to make a proposal for a voluntary arrangement. Sec ond, no previous applic ation must have been made c onc erning the debtor in the prec eding 12 months. Third, the nominee appointed by the debtor is qualified and willing to ac t. Sec tion 48(2) sets out the c ourt’s disc retion and the purpose of suc h an interim order. It states: 


 (2) The Court may make an interim order if it thinks that it would be appropriate to do so for the purpose of fac ilitating the c onsideration and implementation of the debtor’s proposal. 

29     Thereafter, there are two main events that would normally follow—the preparation of a report by the nominee for submission to the c ourt, and the c onvening of a c reditor’s meeting to c onsider the debtor’s proposal. 

30     The nominee must within the time before the interim order c eases to have effec t, that is, 42 days from the granting of the order, submit his report to the c ourt: s 49(1) of the Ac t and Rule 78(1) of the Bankruptc y Rules (Cap 20, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (the “Bankruptc y Rules”). In fac t, when the c ourt grants the interim order, it will also fix a date for the c ourt’s c onsideration of the nominee’s report, whic h will be a date not later than when the interim order would c ease to have effec t: Rules 73(1) and (2) of the Bankruptc y Rules. However, if the nominee requires more time to prepare his report, he may apply to the c ourt to extend the interim order. This is provided for in s 49(4), whic h states: 

 (4) The c ourt may, on the applic ation of the nominee, extend the period for whic h the interim order has effec t so as to allow the nominee to have more time to prepare his report. 

31     The c ourt will, in the exerc ise of its disc retion, assess the reasons put forward by the nominee as to why an extension is required and how long the extension should be. In this c ase, the nominee had applied to extend the interim order whic h would have c eased to have effec t on 22 August 2017 for four weeks bec ause he needed more time to review the doc uments provided to him by the applic ant to support his statement of affairs. These doc uments were desc ribed as being “fairly voluminous”. The c ourt c onsidered the reasons and ordered an extension of 4 weeks until 12 September 2017. 

32     If the report is not submitted by the nominee within the time required, the c ourt has a disc retion to extend or renew the interim order for suc h period it thinks fit, on the applic ation of the debtor: s 49(3) of the Ac t. Suc h an extension must obviously be for the purpose of giving more time for the nominee to c omplete and submit his report. 

33     Next, on rec eipt of the nominee’s report, if the c ourt in its disc retion is satisfied that a meeting of the debtor’s c reditors should be summoned to c onsider the proposal for the voluntary arrangement, the c ourt “shall direc t that the period for whic h the interim order has effec t shall be extended for suc h further period as it may think fit, for the purpose of enabling the debtor’s proposal to be c onsidered by the debtor’s c reditors”: s 49(5) of the Ac t. This is bearing in mind that Rule 81(1) of the Bankruptc y Rules requires the c reditors’ meeting to take plac e on a date not less than 14, nor more than 28, days from the date on whic h the nominee’s report is submitted to the c ourt. 

34     If, on the other hand, the c ourt does not find that it would be appropriate for a meeting of the c reditors to be summoned, it may disc harge the interim order: s 49(6) _(b)_ of the Ac t. This might happen, for example, if the c ourt finds that there is no reasonable prospec t of the proposal being approved by the c reditors. 

35     If a c reditors’ meeting is summoned, the c reditors present may approve the proposed voluntary arrangement by a spec ial resolution. Any adjournment of the c reditors’ meeting may only be for a maximum of 14 days from the date of the first meeting, and any suc h adjournment must be reported to the c ourt: Rules 86(1) and (2) of the Bankruptc y Rules. Further, if upon expiry of 14 days from the date of the first meeting, the proposal has still not been approved by the requisite majority, it is deemed to be rejec ted: Rule 86(3) of the Bankruptc y Rules. 


36     The nominee has the duty under s 52(1) of the Ac t to report the result of the voting to the c ourt. He must do so within four days of the date of the meeting: Rule 88(1) of the Bankruptc y Rules. If the meeting has dec lined to approve the debtor’s proposal, the c ourt may disc harge the interim order: s 52(2) of the Ac t. 

37     However, if the c reditors’ meeting has approved the proposal, then the voluntary arrangement will take effec t and bind all the c reditors entitled to vote at the meeting: s 53(1) of the Ac t. In suc h a sc enario, s 53(2) also provides that: 

 (2) Subjec t to sec tion 54, the interim order in forc e in relation to the debtor shall c ease to have effec t at the end of 28 days from the date the report was made to the c ourt under sec tion 52. 

38     The story does not always end with the approval of the proposal by the c reditors. Sec tion 54 of the Ac t provides an avenue for any dissenting c reditor (or even the debtor or his nominee) to apply for a review of the dec ision of the c reditors’ meeting on one of two grounds, either that (i) the voluntary arrangement unfairly prejudic es the interests any of his c reditors (or the debtor); or (ii) there has been some material irregularity at or in relation to the meeting. Dovetailing with the time frame set out at s 53(2), suc h an applic ation for review must be made within 28 days from the date the report of the voting result was made to the c ourt: s 54(3) of the Ac t. 

39     Sec tion 54(2) of the Ac t provides that the c ourt, on hearing an applic ation for a review of the dec ision of the c reditors’ meeting, may in its disc retion (i) revoke or suspend the c reditors’ approval, and or (ii) direc t a further meeting of the c reditors to c onsider any revised proposal the debtor may make, or in the c ase of a material irregularity, to rec onsider the debtor’s original proposal. Critic ally, sec tion 54(5) of the Ac t then states: 

 Upon giving a direc tion under subsec tion (2)( b ) [i.e., direc ting a further c reditors’ meeting to be c alled], the c ourt may, if it thinks just, extend the validity of any interim order in relation to the debtor for suc h period as it may think fit. 

40     My review of the statutory provisions desc ribed above led me to two key observations. 

41     First, the interim order is intended to func tion as a _temporary_ moratorium. Read together, ss 45(4) and 48(2) indic ate that the purpose of the interim order is to allow the c reditors some time to c onsider and, if thought fit, to approve the debtor’s proposal. Indeed, when Parliament extended the period for whic h an interim order has effec t from 28 days to 42 days by way of the Bankruptc y (Amendment) Ac t 1999, it was explained that this amendment was to “allow more time for the debtor to put up a proposal and inc rease the c hanc es of Voluntary Arrangements suc c eeding” ( _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (18 August 1999) vol 70, c ol 2185. (Assoc iate Professor Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law)). In _In re A Debtor (No. 83 of 1988)_ [1990] 1 WLR 708, Sc ott J too remarked, in relation to similar provisions found in the United Kingdom’s Insolvenc y Ac t 1986, that “the general intention of [suc h] legislative provisions was to provide a _short period_ during whic h the affairs of the debtor c ould be looked into by an independent insolvenc y prac titioner, and to provide time for a voluntary arrangement regarding the affairs of the debtor to be c onsidered by the debtor’s c reditors” [emphasis added] (at 710). It was thus c lear to me that the interim order is intended to exist only for a limited purpose and to operate only for a limited period of time to ac hieve its purpose. This is ac tually unsurprising sinc e the effec t of an interim order is a serious inc ursion into the rights of c reditors to proc eed against a debtor to rec over what is owed. 

42     Sec ond, it appeared to me that Parliament had intended for the entire proc ess, from the making 


of the interim order until the time when the voluntary arrangement is either approved by the c reditors and takes effec t or where the c reditors’ approval is revoked by the c ourt, to be expeditious and c losely supervised by the c ourt. This is c lear from the tight timeframes and limiting of spec ific situations under whic h the interim order may be extended. 

43     The first situation in whic h an extension of the interim order may be granted is where the nominee in the c ourse of his work determines that he requires more time to prepare his report to the c ourt: s 49(3) and s 49(4). The sec ond situation is where the c ourt is satisfied, on reviewing the nominee’s report, that a c reditors’ meeting should be c onvened to c onsider the debtor’s proposal: s 49(5). But, even then, the c ourt exerc ises tight supervision by determining the spec ific period for whic h the interim order should be extended. When exerc ising its disc retion under s 49(5) to determine the period of extension of the interim order, the c ourt will look at when it would be prac tic able for the c reditors to have a meeting with the nominee. It is c lear, therefore, that the protec tion afforded by the moratorium was not intended to stretc h indefinitely into the future, but only to suc h an extent nec essary to ensure that the c reditors have a c hanc e to properly c onsider the voluntary arrangement proposal. In this c ase, after reviewing the nominee’s report, the c ourt c onsidered when the nominee would be able to hold the meeting with the applic ant’s c reditors before dec iding to extend the interim order to 24 Oc tober 2017. 

44     I also add that a tight leash is kept right from the start. At the initial stage, when the c ourt grants the interim order under s 45(1) of the Ac t, the default position is that the order will only have effec t for a 42day period: s 45(4) of the Ac t. This 42day period is for the proposal for the voluntary arrangement to be prepared, if it has not already been done, and for the appointed nominee to then study the proposal and prepare his report to the c ourt. To make the assessment in his report as to whether a c reditors’ meeting should be c alled, the nominee would need to c arefully review the debtor’s assets and liabilities, as well as the detailed terms of the proposed voluntary arrangement. Henc e, s 49(2) of the Ac t requires the debtor to furnish to the nominee doc uments in relation to these matters. 

45     However, _before_ the order is made under s 45(1), if it already c lear to the debtor that it is likely that more than 42 days is needed for all the above steps to be done, for example, in situations where the debtor has an extensive number of c reditors, different c lasses of c reditors or if the terms of the voluntary arrangement are partic ularly c omplic ated, he may in his applic ation for the interim order ask that the interim order be effec tive for a period longer than 42 days: s 45(4) of the Ac t. If the c ourt ac c epts the reasons provided by the debtor, it may ac c ordingly determine that the interim order should have a lifespan of longer than 42 days. Thus, the c ourt exerc ises a c lose supervision, even at the initial stage, over whether the interim order should have a longer effec t than the default 42 days, and if so, for how long. 

46     The c ourt also has the power to lift the protec tion of the moratorium granted by the interim order if it finds that the debtor has not furnished required doc uments and information to the nominee or that the proposed voluntary arrangement is not a serious or viable one (see s 49(6)). This shows the level of supervision exerc ised by the c ourt over the voluntary arrangement proc eedings, and that Parliament must have been c onc erned about unnec essarily delaying the rights of c reditors to proc eed to enforc e their legal rights in the c ase of a debtor’s proposal whic h may, for example, lac k any reasonable c hanc e of being approved. 

47     That this is the c onc ern was made even c learer by the provision relating to revoc ation of c reditors’ approvals, where the third and final situation is set out as to when the interim order may be ext ended. If and when the c ourt exerc ises its powers under s 54(2) of the Ac t to revoke the c reditors’ approval for the debtor’s proposed voluntary arrangement, a spec ific provision exists for the 


c ourt, if it thinks fit, to extend the validity of the interim order, _but only_ when the c ourt has direc ted a further c reditors’ meeting to be c onvened to c onsider a revised proposal from the debtor, or to rec onsider the debtor’s original proposal: s 54(2)( _b_ ). In this c ase, Thean J did not order a further c reditors’ meeting to be held. In fac t, quite the opposite, she direc ted that no further c reditors’ meeting be held. 

48     Given the statutory framework as I have desc ribed above, I found it quite impossible to ac c ept the applic ant’s argument that he c ould simply invoke s 45(4) of the Ac t and obtain an extension of the interim order of 11 July 2017 _until his appeals to the Court of Appeal are determined_. In my judgment, the power of the c ourt under s 45(4) to direc t that the interim order c ontinues in effec t beyond the default of 42 days arises only when the c ourt grants the interim order at the first instanc e. The purpose of the c ourt granting a longer duration for the interim order is to permit the nominee to have more time for the preparation of his report to the c ourt. The nominee’s ability to apply to the c ourt for an extension of the interim order under s 49(4) to submit his report does not detrac t from the applic ant being able to make a similar applic ation under s 49(3) if the nominee has failed to submit its report within the time given for him to do so. But, after the nominee’s report is submitted to the c ourt, the two subsequent oc c asions where there is a possible need to extend the interim order so as to c ontinue the moratorium are governed by spec ific provisions in the Ac t: s 49(5), whic h is for a c reditors’ meeting to be c alled to c onsider the proposal for the voluntary arrangement, and s 54(5), whic h is for a further c reditors’ meeting to be c alled after the c ourt’s revoc ation of the c reditors’ approval obtained at the first meeting. 

49     I was unable to ac c ept the applic ant’s submission that s 45(4) of the Ac t is a _general_ provision whic h allows the c ourt to extend the effec t of the interim order _at any stage_ , inc luding the present one when the c ourt has already exerc ised its power to revoke the c reditor’s approval and dec lined to direc t another c reditors’ meeting to be c alled. Suc h a position would be inc onsistent with the statutory regime whic h sets out the life span of interim order at eac h stage of the voluntary arrangement proc eedings. 

50     For the above reasons, I found that the c ourt does not have a general power under s 45(4) of the Ac t to grant an extension of the interim order in a situation suc h as this, where the c reditors’ approval for the applic ant’s voluntary arrangement has been revoked by the c ourt. 

51     However, it does not follow from my c onc lusion above that, if Citibank were to restore its bankruptc y applic ation against the applic ant for hearing before the determination of his appeals to the Court of Appeal, the c ourt would nec essarily be required to make the bankruptc y order sought. As I pointed out to the applic ant’s c ounsel during the hearing of the Registrar’s Appeal, it was open to him to bring the attention of the c ourt hearing the bankruptc y applic ation to the existenc e of the pending appeals, and ask that the c ourt stay the proc eedings until the appeals are determined. Suc h a possibility is provided for at s 64(1) of the Ac t, whic h provides that: 

 (1) The c ourt may at any time, for suffic ient reason, make an order staying the proc eedings on a bankruptc y applic ation, either altogether or for a limited time, on suc h terms and c onditions as the c ourt may think just. 

52     Of c ourse, I was not fac ed with suc h a situation bec ause there was no indic ation by Citibank at the hearing of the Registrar’s Appeal before me that it had intended to restore its bankruptc y applic ation for hearing pending the resolution of the appeals. If that were to happen, the applic ant c ould attempt to persuade the c ourt to grant a stay under s 64(1) of the Ac t. In c onsidering whether to grant suc h a stay, the c ourt will c onsider the reasons furnished by the applic ant as to why a stay should be granted and exerc ise its disc retion ac c ordingly. Even if the c ourt grants a stay, this may be 


subjec t to any c onditions that the c ourt deems just to impose. 

53     Given my finding that s 45(4) of the Ac t did not give the c ourt the general power to extend the interim order at this stage of the voluntary arrangement proc eedings, this was suffic ient for me to dismiss the Registrar’s Appeal and uphold the Assistant Registrar’s dec ision to disallow the applic ation for an extension of the interim order. But, given that both CIMB and the applic ant had proc eeded on the basis that s 45(4) of the Ac t allowed the c ourt, if it thought fit, to extend the interim order even in a c ase where the c ourt had revoked the c reditors’ approval and direc ted no further c reditors’ meetings to be c alled, I found it appropriate to c onsider whether I would have exerc ised my disc retion under s 45(4) to extend the interim order, in the event that I was wrong to find that the c ourt had no suc h general power to give suc h extensions. 

**_Whether an extension of the interim order under s 45(4) of the Act should be made at this stage of the proceedings_** 

54     The applic ant’s position was that the c ourt should grant an extension of the interim order bec ause the dec ision of Thean J was being c hallenged on appeal, and an appeal to the Court of Appeal operated as a rehearing of the matter. Thus, just as the interim order was in effec t until Thean J c ould dispose of the applic ations to revoke the c reditors’ approval, it should c ontinue until the disposal of the appeals against Thean J’s dec ision. 

55     I found this to be a rather fac ile position to take. It ignored the fac t the High Court had fully c onsidered the arguments from the parties before dec iding to revoke the c reditors’ approval. It was tantamount to suggesting the High Court dec ision should be stayed as a matter of c ourse just bec ause the applic ant had c hosen to appeal the dec ision. Suc h an approac h was inc onsistent with the princ iple that any dec ision of the High Court is a final one and should be c ompiled with, even if there is an appeal, unless the c ourt has granted a stay pending the appeal. 

56     I took the view that the position taken by CIMB was one that is more c onsistent with princ iple. Ac c ording to c ounsel for CIMB, given that the extension of the interim order had the effec t of suspending the effec t of the dec ision of Thean J, the princ iples that should apply to the applic ation to extend the interim order should be those applic able to the granting of a stay of exec ution of a judgment pending an appeal. The test is therefore whether there are spec ial c irc umstanc es whic h would justify the extension of the interim order. I was prepared to ac c ept that these were appropriate princ iples to apply if the c ourt had the power under s 45(4) of the Ac t to extend the interim order at this stage of the voluntary arrangement proc eedings. 

57     It is well established that spec ial c irc umstanc es will be shown if the applic ant’s appeals to the Court of Appeal will be rendered nugatory if the interim order is not extended. The applic ant’s argument is that, if he were made a bankrupt before his appeals are heard by the Court of Appeal, his appeals would be thrown out on the threshold point that the voluntary arrangement regime c ould no longer apply to him. Henc e, it was argued that his appeals would be nugatory. 

58     I rejec ted this argument. The question before the Court of Appeal in the four appeals will be whether the c reditors’ approval was rightly revoked by the judge below. If the Court of Appeal disagrees with the judge and finds that the c reditors’ approval should not have been revoked, it must follow that the Court of Appeal’s view is that the voluntary arrangement should have been permitted to take effec t. In suc h c irc umstanc es, the Court of Appeal c an undoubtedly exerc ise its powers to revoke any bankruptc y order that has been made against the applic ant. I was unc onvinc ed by the applic ant’s argument that the Court of Appeal will be powerless to make any orders in relation to the voluntary arrangement in suc h c irc umstanc es. 


59     The applic ant also argued that he might not be able to proc eed with his appeals should be made a bankrupt bec ause he would need to obtain the OA’s approval if he wished to proc eed and that might not be forthc oming. However, there was no evidenc e to suggest to me that the OA’s approval would not be granted in suc h c irc umstanc es. Ac c ording to the applic ant, the legal fees and expenses in relation of the voluntary arrangement proc eedings and the applic ant’s appeals are being funded by a wellwisher. There was no indic ation that this funding arrangement would no longer be available to the applic ant if he bec ame a bankrupt but still wanted to proc eed with his appeals. Further, were the appeals to be suc c essful, any bankruptc y order against the applic ant would be revoked. That must be a weighty c onsideration for the OA in dec iding whether to permit the applic ant to proc eed with his appeals. For these reasons, I was not able to disc ern why the OA would withhold his approval to the appeals being proc eeded with. 

60     In my judgment, therefore, the applic ant had not established that there were spec ial c irc umstanc es that would justify the extension of the interim order until the determination of the appeals. 

61     In any event, both CIMB and OUELH argued that I should take into ac c ount the applic ant’s c onduc t in c ontinuing to prejudic e his c reditors by refusing to pay the outstanding c osts orders made against him and yet c ontinuing with legal proc eedings whic h would c ause his c reditors to inc ur even more c osts and expense. 

62     OUELH pointed out that there was $12,000 of unpaid c osts due to it under various c ourt orders whic h the applic ant had simply refused to pay. As for CIMB, the unpaid c osts were in the amount of $25,000 stretc hing bac k to c osts orders made in the proc eedings relating to the first voluntary arrangement whic h failed. Yet, the applic ant was able to c ontinue to fund his appeals, inc luding the provision of $80,000 in sec urity for the appeals. It was argued that the applic ant was attempting to “game the system” by pic king and c hoosing whic h rules of c ourt and orders to c omply with. 

63     The applic ant’s answer was not that he c ould not find funding to pay these outstanding c osts, but rather that making suc h payments to CIMB and OUELH would be to unfairly prefer them over his other c reditors. This, in turn, would provide ammunition for another c reditor to apply for a revoc ation of the c reditors’ approval under the princ iples stated in _Cadbury Schweppes plc v Somji_ [2001] 1 WLR 615 (“ _Cadbury Schweppes_ ”). 

6       4 _Cadbury Schweppes_ was a dec ision of the English Court of Appeal. The petitioner in that c ase was a c reditor who opposed an individual voluntary arrangement proposed by the debtor. The petitioner c ontended that majority approval for the arrangement had been obtained by sec ret c ollateral payments made with the debtor’s knowledge to two other initially dissentient c reditors. The petitioner thus applied under the provisions of the United Kingdom’s Insolvenc y Ac t 1986 (the “ Ac t”) for, _inter alia_ , a bankruptc y order on the ground that the arrangement was void or that there was a material omission in the terms of the proposal to the c reditors. 

65     Anthony Boswood QC, sitting as a deputy judge of the Chanc ery Division, found that there had been a sec ret deal to influenc e the vote of two other c reditors at the c reditors’ meeting and that, if that fac t had been known, it would have c hanged the vote. He granted the bankruptc y order sought by the petitioner. The Court of Appeal upheld the judge’s dec ision. It was of the view that the question of material omission had been c orrec tly answered by c onsidering whether, had the truth been told, it was objec tively likely to have made a material differenc e to the way in whic h the c reditors c onsidered and assessed the terms of the proposal at the c reditors’ meeting. Sinc e some c reditors had been induc ed to vote their approval to the proposal only by a sec ret c ollateral advantage not disc losed to others, the Court of Appeal agreed with the judge below that the 


information presented at the meeting was false, misleading or c ontained a material omission. This satisfied sec tions 264(1) _(c)_ and 276(1) _(b)_ of the 1986 Ac t whic h permitted a c reditor otherwise bound by the individual voluntary arrangement to present a bankruptc y petition in the c ase of, _inter alia_ , any materially false or misleading information, or material omissions in suc h information, made available to c reditors at the meeting. There are no equivalent of these provisions in our bankruptc y legislation. 

66     As would be already obvious from my rec ounting of the fac ts and ruling in _Cadbury Schweppes_ , that c ase is of little relevanc e to the situation of the applic ant insofar as the unpaid c osts orders are c onc erned. It provided no justific ation for the applic ant to withhold the payment of c osts to his c reditors under the outstanding c osts orders. Any suc h payments c ould not form any basis for a c reditor to subsequently apply to revoke the c reditors’ approval, if his appeals to the Court of Appeal were to suc c eed. The applic ant would simply be c omplying with orders made by the c ourt. 

67     I found the applic ant’s c onduc t in relation to the unpaid c osts orders to be relevant in determining whether the interim order should be extended. Effec tively, the applic ant was seeking the c ourt’s assistanc e to extend the protec tion of the moratorium afforded by the interim order so that he c ould c ontinue with proc eedings in relation to the voluntary arrangement, but yet he was thumbing his nose at the c osts orders made in favour of his c reditors in these same proc eedings. 

68     Even if one was to assume that the applic ant c annot get funding to pay the outstanding c osts orders, it is still a relevant fac t that the c reditors have not been paid. These c reditors will suffer prejudic e bec ause they c ontinue to inc ur c osts in relation to the voluntary arrangement proc eedings while at the same time being unable to enforc e their rights by way of bankruptc y proc eedings or other exec ution proc eedings. Suc h a state of affairs should not be simply ignored by the c ourt as the applic ant appears to suggest that I do. 

69     For the above reasons, even if I had a disc retion under s 45(4) of the Ac t to extend the interim order, I would not have found it appropriate to exerc ise my disc retion to do so. 

70     I should add that, at the start of the hearing of the Registrar’s Appeal before me, c ounsel for the applic ant had applied for an adjournment of the hearing on the basis that Justic e Hoo Sheau Peng was about deliver her dec ision in Originating Summons No 380 of 2017 (“OS 380/2017”), a c laim brought by OUELH (then known as International Healthway Corporation Ltd) against (i) The Enterprise Fund III Ltd, (ii) VMF3 Ltd, and (iii) Value Monetization III Ltd for dec larations that c ertain c ontrac ts and transac tions entered into between those parties were voidable under s 76A(2) of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). Ac c ording to the applic ant, the dec ision in that c ase would have an impac t on whether OUELH’s c laim against him was still valid and thus whether OUELH was still a c reditor of his. This, in turn, was relevant to the merits of his appeals against Thean J’s dec ision bec ause one of the grounds for the judge’s dec ision to revoke the c reditors’ approval of the voluntary arrangement was that the nominee had wrongly attributed a nil value to OUELH’s unliquidated c laim against the applic ant. 

71     The adjournment applic ation was c ontested by both CIMB and OUELH. Counsel for OUELH disputed the c ontention that the dec ision in OS 380/2017 would be determinative of OUELH’s c laim against the applic ant by drawing my attention to yet another ac tion, Suit 441 of 2016, where OUELH (then known as International Healthway Corporation Ltd) had brought a c laim against the applic ant for, _inter alia_ , c onspirac y and where the c laim was quantified at S$35m. Counsel informed me that the suit was going ahead and proc eeding to trial in 2019. 

72     Signific antly though, on the applic ant’s point that his adjournment applic ation should be granted 


bec ause the merits of his appeals would be a relevant fac tor in the exerc ise of the c ourt’s disc retion to extend the interim order, both c ounsel for CIMB and OUELH informed me that they were not taking the position that the appeals were definitely futile and that, in any event, the strength of the appeals was not relevant to the question of whether the interim order was to be extended. Given the position taken by CIMB and OUELH, I refused the applic ation to adjourn and proc eeded with the hearing of the Registrar’s Appeal. 

73     OUELH’s stand that the merits of the appeals were not relevant to the exerc ise of any disc retion whether to extend the interim order, however, meant that I ac c orded no weight to several of OUELH’s arguments in the Registrar’s Appeal that touc hed on the merits of the appeals. These arguments were (i) that the voluntary arrangement proposed by the applic ant was not serious or viable, (ii) that his proposal would not generate any real return for his unsec ured c reditors, (iii) that the proposed voluntary arrangement failed to c omply with the presc ribed requirements of the Ac t in that the applic ant failed to provide suffic ient information as to his sourc e of funding and how these funders were to be repaid, and (iv) that the nominee had made serious errors in the c alc ulations of the votes for the final approval of the voluntary arrangement. I understood from c ounsel that these were all matters that will be raised as issues in the four appeals to the Court of Appeal. 

**Conclusion** 

74     For the above reasons, I dismissed the Registrar’s Appeal. In summary, I found that the c ourt did not have the power, as c ontended by the applic ant, to extend the interim order of 11 July 2017 under the s 45(4) of the Ac t. But, if I am wrong and the c ourt does have suc h power, I would nonetheless not have exerc ised my disc retion to extend the interim order in the c irc umstanc es of this c ase.
