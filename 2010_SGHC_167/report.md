**Introduction** 

1       The present appeals arose from the appellants’ c onvic tion and sentenc e by a Distric t Judge (t he “DJ”) in _Public Prosecutor v Goh Kah Heng alias Shi Ming Yi and Another_ <span class="citation">[2009] SGDC 499</span> (the “GD”) and in _Public Prosecutor v Goh Kah Heng alias Shi Ming Yi and Another_ <span class="citation">[2009] SGDC 500</span> (the “GD on Sentenc e”). The appellants (“SMY” and “RY”) were c onvic ted after a 23-day trial in the Distric t Court. 

**The charges** 

2       Originally, SMY fac ed ten c harges but the prosec ution proc eeded with only four relating to the grant of a $50,000 loan to RY. SMY c laimed trial to and was c onvic ted on the following four c harges: 

 (a) DAC 31694/2008 ( “SMY’s First Charge”) 

 ... that you, on 17 May 2004, in Singapore, being an offic er of Ren Ci Hospital and Medic are Centre (“Ren Ci”), namely its Chief Exec utive Offic er, did engage in a c onspirac y with one Raymond Yeung Chi Hang (“Raymond”) to falsify a paper belonging to Ren Ci wilfully and with intent to defraud, and in pursuanc e of that c onspirac y and in order to the doing of that thing, Goh Bee Choo, a c lerk of Ren Ci, prepared a payment vouc her no. PV200405-082 whic h falsely stated that a loan of $50,000 was made by Ren Ci to Mandala Buddhist Cultural Centre, whic h ac t was c ommitted in c onsequenc e of your abetment, and you have thereby c ommitted an offenc e punishable under s.477A read with Sec tion 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. 

 (b) DAC 31695/2008 (“SMY’s Sec ond Charge”) 

 ... that you, on 17 May 2004, in Singapore, being an offic er of Ren Ci Hospital and Medic are Centre (“Ren Ci”), being entrusted with dominion over funds of Ren Ci, did dishonestly 


 misappropriate $50,000 of Ren Ci’s funds, to wit, by approving a loan of $50,000 to one Raymond Yeung Chi Hang (“Raymond”), whic h loan Raymond was not entitled to, and you have thereby c ommitted an offenc e punishable under Sec tion 406 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. 

 (c ) DAC 31696/2008 (“SMY’s Third Charge”) 

 ... that you, on 18 Dec ember 2007, in Singapore, in purported c omplianc e with a requirement imposed by the Charities Ac t, Chapter 37 (the “Ac t”), did knowingly provide information whic h was false in a material partic ular to the Commissioner of Charities (the “Commissioner”), to wit, you furnished an oral statement on affirmation to Ms Penelope Lepeudry and Mr Ng WanSing Winst on, offic ers of Ernst and Young Assoc iates Pte Ltd who had been duly appointed by the Commissioner to c onduc t the Inquiry into Ren Ci Hospital and Medic are Centre (“Ren Ci”) under Sec tion 8 of the Charities Ac t (“the Ac t”) that the loan of $50,000 by Ren Ci to Mandala Buddhist Cultural Centre (“Mandala”) on 17 May 2004 was for Mandala to purc hase wood, whic h information you knew was false, and you have thereby c ommitted an offenc e under Sec tion 10(1) (a) and punishable under Sec tion 10(3) of the Ac t. 

 (d) DAC 31697/2008 (“SMY’s Fourth Charge”) 

 ... that you, sometime around January 2008, in Singapore, did engage with one Raymond Yeung Chi Hang (“Raymond”) in a c onspirac y to knowingly provide the Commissioner of Charities (the “Commissioner”) with information whic h was false in a material partic ular, and in pursuanc e of that c onspirac y and in order to the doing of that thing, a letter purportedly from Bei Jing Jing Hai Shan Artifac t Co. Ltd (China) stating that it had delivered two statues worth $16,000 to Mandala Buddhist Cultural Centre (“Mandala”) and that Mandala had balanc e of 25m^3 of wood was delivered to the Commissioner, whic h information you knew was false, whic h you intended the Commissioner to use for the purpose of disc harging his func tions under Sec tion 8 of the Charities Ac t, Chapter 37 (the “Ac t”), and you have thereby c ommitted an offenc e under Sec tion 10(1)(b) of the Ac t read with Sec tion 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 and punishable under s.10(3) of the Ac t. 

3       RY was c harged with and c laimed trial to two c harges (DAC 31688 and DAC 31689 of 2008) whic h were related to two of the c harges that SMY fac ed, namely, SMY’s First Charge and Fourth Charge respec tively, as follows: 

 (a) DAC 31688 of 2008 (“RY’s First Charge”) 

 ... that you, on 17 May 2004, in Singapore, did engage in a c onspirac y with one Goh Kah Heng @ Shi Ming Yi, namely its Chief Exec utive Offic er, to falsify a paper belonging to Ren Ci Hospital and Medic are Centre (“Ren Ci”) wilfully and with intent to defraud, and in pursuanc e of that c onspirac y and in order to the doing of that thing, Goh Bee Choo, a c lerk of Ren Ci, prepared a payment vouc her no. PV200405-082 whic h falsely stated that a loan of $50,000 was made by Ren Ci to Mandala, whic h ac t was c ommitted in c onsequenc e of your abetment, and you have thereby c ommitted an offenc e punishable under Sec tion 477A read with Sec tion 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, 1985 Revised Edition. 

 (b) DAC 31689 of 2008 (“RY’s Sec ond Charge”) 

 ... that you, sometime around January 2008, in Singapore, did engage with one Goh Kah Heng @ Shi Ming Yi in a c onspirac y to knowingly provide the Commissioner of Charities (the “Commissioner”) with information whic h was false in a material partic ular, and in pursuanc e of 


 that c onspirac y and in order to the doing of that thing, a letter purportedly from Bei Jing Jing Hai Shan Artifac t Co. Ltd (China) stating that it had delivered two statues worth $16,000 to Mandala Buddhist Cultural Centre (“Mandala”) and that Mandala had balanc e of 25m^3 of wood was delivered to the Commissioner, whic h information you knew was false, whic h you intended the Commissioner to use for the purpose of disc harging his func tions under Sec tion 8 of the Charities Ac t, Chapter 37 (the “Ac t”), and you have thereby c ommitted an offenc e under Sec tion 10(1)(b) of the Ac t read with Sec tion 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, 1985 Revised Edition and punishable under Sec tion 10(3) of the Ac t. 

**Background** 

4       SMY was the Chairman and Chief Exec utive Offic er of Ren Ci Hospital and Medic are Centre (“Ren Ci”) while RY was his personal exec utive. 

5       Ac c ording to the prosec ution, RY was someone “very c lose and dear” to SMY and the “c lose and personal relationship” between them was pivotal to a proper apprec iation of the fac ts of this c ase. The prosec ution alleged that RY was able to obtain the said $50,000 loan without doc umentation and repayment terms prec isely bec ause of this relationship. It was also bec ause of this relationship that the loan was not repaid until E & Y emerged on the Ren Ci sc ene, that SMY tried to c over up the loan and lied to the Inquiry (see [65] below) and to the Commerc ial Affairs Department (“CAD”). Similarly, it was this relationship that explained why RY tried to shield SMY from responsibility during the trial. 

6       SMY met RY in Hong Kong sometime in 2000. SMY went out of his way to sec ure RY’s employment at Ren Ci in 2001. When RY’s applic ation for an employment pass was rejec ted in April 2001, SMY nevertheless offered him a job at Ren Ci in May that year. The job offer (to be SMY’s assistant) was ac c epted by RY, with RY’s salary being paid by SMY via an inc rease in SMY’s salary. SMY also went to meet offic ials at the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) to appeal against the rejec tion of RY’s applic ation for an employment pass. He further made personal appeals to two Members of Parliament on RY’s behalf. RY’s employment pass was finally approved only in November 2004. 

7       SMY indulged RY with supplementary c redit c ards whic h RY used liberally. RY, an Australian c itizen and permanent resident of Singapore and Mac ao, stayed with SMY in various c ondominiums when RY was in Singapore. They went on holidays together and even purc hased two properties in Melbourne, Australia, jointly. One property was bought in 2002 while the other was bought in 2004. Eac h property apparently c ost more than A$1 million. SMY also bought a BMW c ar for RY’s personal use in Melbourne. Counsel for RY explained that RY’s name was inc luded in the Australian properties bec ause one of the owners had to be an Australian c itizen. 

8       On 17 May 2004, RY gave instruc tions to Ren Ci’s financ e manager to prepare a c ash c heque (the “Cash Cheque”) for $50,000 and a payment vouc her (the “Payment Vouc her”) reflec ting a loan of the same amount from Ren Ci to Mandala Buddhist & Cultural Centre (“Mandala”). Mandala was a partnership business between SMY and one Wee Beng Seng, sanc tioned by Ren Ci, whic h was supposed to help generate inc ome for Ren Ci. SMY signed the Cash Cheque and Payment Vouc her. The Cash Cheque was later enc ashed by a staff of Ren Ci on RY’s behalf. RY took the c ash and brought it to Hong Kong subsequently. This amount was reflec ted in Ren Ci’s ac c ounts as a loan to Mandala but there was no c orresponding entry in Mandala’s books showing the rec eipt or disbursement of this $50,000. The money was never given to Mandala. This anomaly was unc overed during the audit of Ren Ci’s books by Ernst & Young (“E & Y”) following a c orporate governanc e review initiated by the Ministry of Health (“MOH”) in the middle of 2006, after the events surrounding the National Kidney Foundation (“NKF”) had taken plac e. On 12 June 2007, RY tendered his resignation

from Ren Ci. 

9       On 7 November 2007, a formal inquiry (the “Inquiry”) under s 8 of the Charities Ac t (Cap 37, 2007 Rev Ed) was initiated by MOH to look into RC’s affairs. During the c ourse of the Inquiry, SMY gave evidenc e to the members of the Inquiry on 18 Dec ember 2007 that the $50,000 was a loan for Mandala to purc hase wood, something whic h was untrue. 

10     On 2 January 2008, the Commissioner of Charities asked SMY to provide doc umentary evidenc e of the purc hase of wood. Pursuant to this order, a letter (the “BJJHS Letter”) purportedly from Bei Jing Jing Hai Shan Artifac t Co Ltd (China) (“BJJHS”) was given to the Commissioner. The BJJHS Letter stated that it had delivered two statues worth $16,000 to Mandala and that there were 25m³ of surplus wood. This was not true as the statues were in fac t purc hased and paid for by a different entity. In February 2008, the CAD c onduc ted a raid on Ren Ci. In Marc h 2008, the CAD c alled up SMY and RY for interviews. 

**The proceedings in the District Court** 

**_SMY’s First Charge and RY’s First Charge_** 

11     SMY’s First Charge and RY’s First Charge c entred on the Payment Vouc her dated 17 May 2004, [note: 1] evidenc ing a loan of $50,000 from Ren Ci to Mandala. 

12     The prosec ution argued that RY took the loan direc tly from Ren Ci as Mandala did not have the funds to make the loan. As RY was not a staff of Ren Ci in May 2004, he was not entitled to suc h a loan but, in the light of the relationship between the two men, SMY approved the loan promptly nonetheless without even disc ussing the terms of repayment. The Payment Vouc her was false in stating that there was a loan from Ren Ci to Mandala. There was no doc umentation of the loan in Mandala as no loan was made to it, c ontrary to what was stated in the Payment Vouc her. 

13     The defenc e argued, however, that there was a “bac k-to-bac k” staff loan from Ren Ci to Mandala and from Mandala to RY. If this were the c ase, the Payment Vouc her would not be false. SMY assumed that RY would arrange the nec essary doc umentation. RY’s defenc e was that he totally forgot to doc ument the loan in Mandala. The defenc e’s evidenc e relating to the purpose of the loan was somewhat hazy. It was either for RY to make an urgent payment for his house in Hong Kong pending the approval of his housing loan or was for RY to help a friend in Hong Kong make an urgent payment to some renovation c ontrac tors. 

14     The elements of SMY’s First Charge were set out by the DJ in the GD at [189191]. For the offenc e under sec tion 477A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed), the prosec ution had to prove that: 

 SMY was an offic er of Ren Ci at the material time; 

 he ac ted wilfully with intent to defraud; and 

 he did so by falsifying the Payment Vouc her. 


## 180. 

## 180. 

Given that the c harge was one of abetment by c onspirac y, it was not nec essary to show that SMY was the one who gave explic it instruc tions to falsify the payment vouc her; it was suffic ient to show that SMY and RY had agreed to the falsific ation of the Payment Vouc her. 

15     The DJ found that there was no bac k to bac k loan and that Ren Ci did not in fac t lend $50, to Mandala on 17 May 2004 (GD at [148-161]). In partic ular, when the Cash Cheque for the amount was enc ashed, the money was given to RY who kept it at home for five days, from 17 May 2004 to 22 May 2004, before flying to Hong Kong with it. Thus the money did not go to Mandala at all. There was ample time for RY to doc ument the loan before flying off but he failed to do so. Furthermore, RY was questioned extensively during the rec ording of his statements on the nature of the loan and had many opportunities to mention that it was a bac k-to-bac k loan. Instead, he “c onfirmed at P16and P17-271 that it was his plan to borrow money from Ren Ci and have it rec orded under Mandala’s name” (GD at [150.6]). Therefore, the Payment Vouc her whic h desc ribed the $50,000 as a “loan to Mandala” was false. 

16     The DJ further found that SMY and RY both had the requisite intent to defraud. SMY and RY were aware that the $50,000 was not a loan to Mandala and the desc ription on the Payment Vouc her whic h SMY had signed was false. As mentioned above, RY admitted that he planned to borrow money from Ren Ci and have it rec orded under Mandala’s name. SMY never mentioned a bac k-to-bac k loan in his 26 and 27 Marc h 2008 statements to the CAD but went bac k to the CAD to mention the bac k-tobac k loan for the first time on 31 Marc h 2008. However, he had trouble answering when questioned why there was a bac k-to-bac k loan sinc e RY was not a staff of either Ren Ci or Mandala (GD at [92]). The DJ further found the explanation as to why RY had allegedly asked for a loan from Mandala instead of Ren Ci to be lac king in c redibility. If RY and SMY felt that RY was entitled to a Mandala staff loan as they c laimed that he was managing Mandala, they should also have felt that RY was entitled to a Ren Ci staff loan. If so, RY should have asked for a Ren Ci staff loan rather than a Mandala one, sinc e Ren Ci had the funds and had in plac e an existing prac tic e of granting staff loans and a financ e and human resourc es department to fac ilitate the granting of the loan (GD at [150.8]). 

17     The DJ therefore held that the elements of SMY’s First Charge and RY’s First Charge were satisfied, sinc e SMY had agreed with RY c onc erning the preparation of the false doc ument. Further to this agreement, RY asked for the Payment Vouc her to be prepared and SMY signed it, with both knowing that there was in truth no loan to Mandala. 

**_SMY’s Second Charge_** 

18     The elements of the Sec ond Charge were laid out by the DJ in the GD at [180] as follows: 

 SMY was entrusted with dominion over Ren Ci’s funds, namely the funds in the ac c ount from whic h the $50,000 was drawn using the c ash c heque. 

 SMY had dishonestly misappropriated the $50,000 when he approved the loan of $50,000 to RY. 

19     The DJ observed that it was not disputed that SMY was entrusted with Ren Ci’s funds. The DJ further added that, in view of his finding that RY was not entitled to rec eive a $50,000 loan from Ren Ci or Mandala, the element of misappropriation was satisfied (GD at [181-183]). 

20     The DJ had earlier found, in the GD at [110]-[140], that RY was not entitled to rec eive the $50,000 loan from Ren Ci or from Mandala. In partic ular, RY did not have an employment pass that would have allowed him to work for Ren Ci on 17 May 2004. With regards to Mandala, besides the fac t 


## 192. 

## 192. 

that RY’s lac k of an employment pass would have prevented him from being employed by Mandala, Mandala’s ac c ounts revealed that there was only one salaried employee at that time, Ong Keok. RY was not even on Mandala’s payroll. It was also c lear that the mandate given to SMY to run Mandala was that it was an investment to generate profits for Ren Ci. This was based on, among other things, minutes of a 7 November 1996 Management Committee meeting whic h stated that Ren Ci relied on SMY to run Mandala for Ren Ci’s benefit and all profits generated by Mandala would be returned to 

Ren Ci. [note: 2] 

21     The DJ also found that the following evidenc e supported the prosec ution’s c ase. The manner in whic h the $50,000 loan was given, in marked departure from the proc edure adopted for the previous st aff loans given out by Ren Ci, strongly suggested that SMY and RY knew that the granting of the loan was wrong and thought it nec essary to hide it from the Ren Ci financ e department (GD at [123][130]). Contrary to RY’s argument that the lac k of doc umentation was due to the urgent need for the loan, the DJ noted that RY’s behaviour suggested otherwise, in partic ular the fac t that he waited until 22 May 2004 before flying to Hong Kong and depositing the c ash in his bank ac c ount two days later (GD at [131]-[135]). The lac k of a repayment plan also suggested that the loan was not proper (GD at [136]-[140]). 

22     On the element of dishonesty, the DJ held that this requirement was satisfied as SMY knew that by his ac tions of signing the Cash Cheque and Payment Vouc her, RY was obtaining a wrongful gain in the form of $50,000 that he was not entitled to and at the same time, Ren Ci would be, at the very least, temporarily deprived of the money. The DJ therefore found that the elements of the Sec ond Charge were satisfied. 

**_SMY’s Third Charge and Fourth Charge and RY’s Second Charge_** 

23     The DJ set out the elements of SMY’s Third and Fourth Charges and RY’s Sec ond Charge, in the GD at [192]. I quote: 

 SMY (and RY where appropriate) knowingly provided information to the Commissioner of Charities whic h was false in a material partic ular. 

 The information was either intended to be used by the Commissioner to disc harge his func tions under the [Charities] Ac t (DAC 31696/2008), or that it was provided in purported c omplianc e with the Commissioner’s order of 2 January 2008 (DAC 31697/2008). 

24     The DJ found that at the time of these offenc es, RY had already informed SMY that he was going to use the story that $50,000 had been used to purc hase wood and that SMY knew the story and the BJJHS Letter’s c ontents were untrue (GD at [86], [164-168]). The DJ also found that SMY knowingly provided false information to the Inquiry on 18 Dec ember 2007, that RY arranged for the preparation of a false doc ument (the BJJHS Letter) and SMY produc ed this pursuant to the order of the Commissioner, knowing that it was a false doc ument (GD at [193]). Ac c ordingly, the DJ was satisfied that the elements of SMY’s Third Charge and Fourth Charge and RY’s Sec ond Charge were satisfied. 

25     The DJ also thought that SMY’s c laim that he had forgotten about the loan was not plausible (GD at [177]-[179]). In partic ular, SMY had given RY a number of supplementary c redit c ards and kept trac k of the c redit c ard bills and RY’s repayment of the same. It was therefore odd that SMY was able to do this but c ould forget about the $50,000 loan. 

**The Sentences**

 (b) 

 (c ) 

 (d) 

26     After finding that the elements of the c harges were satisfied and c onvic ting SMY and RY on their respec tive offenc es, the DJ proc eeded to c onsider the sentenc es to impose. 

27     In relation to SMY, the DJ noted that the offenc es involved an abuse of his authority and a betrayal of the trust reposed in him as CEO and Chairman of Ren Ci (GD on Sentenc e at [23]-[28]). Donors expec ted their money to be put to good use. When the Inquiry began, SMY made things worse by giving false evidenc e to the Commissioner of Charities. SMY even gave false evidenc e under affirmation. The aggravating fac tors above were balanc ed against SMY’s rec ord of public servic e and c ontributions to soc iety and the effec t the c onvic tion would have on his position at Ren Ci and other organizations. The DJ also took into ac c ount the fac t that SMY was not the benefic iary of the $50,000. 

28     In relation to RY, the DJ c onsidered it signific ant that RY rec eived a benefit as a result of the offenc e (GD on Sentenc e at [29]-[30]). Furthermore, in relation to the provision of the false letter, a c ustodial sentenc e was merited sinc e the objec t of the offenc e was to c over up wrongdoing. These fac tors were balanc ed with the fac t that he was a first offender. 

29     In relation to both SMY and RY, the DJ took into ac c ount the fac t that suc h offenc es affec ted not just a single c harity but all c harities, as far as the public ’s trust and c onfidenc e were c onc erned. The DJ reasoned that the sentenc es imposed therefore had to suffic iently deter similar offenc es. 

30     The DJ sentenc ed SMY as follows (GD on Sentenc e at [32]): 

 SMY’s First Charge6 months’ imprisonment 

 SMY’s Sec ond Charge4 months’ imprisonment 

 SMY’s Third Charge4 months’ imprisonment; and 

 SMY’s Fourth Charge2 months’ imprisonment 

The DJ ordered the sentenc es for SMY’s First Charge and Third Charge to run c onsec utively for a total sentenc e of 10 months’ imprisonment. SMY is on bail pending appeal. 

31     The DJ sentenc ed RY as follows (GD on Sentenc e at [32]): 

 RY’s First Charge7 months’ imprisonment 

 RY’s Sec ond Charge2 months’ imprisonment 

The DJ ordered both sentenc es to run c onsec utively, resulting in a total sentenc e of nine months’ imprisonment. RY is also on bail pending appeal.

**SMY’s appeal against conviction** 

**_SMY’s First Charge_** 

32     Counsel for SMY argued that the prosec ution had failed to establish the following elements beyond reasonable doubt: 

 that RY c ommitted an offenc e under sec tion 477A of the Penal Code in that there was no proof that RY had the intention to defraud Ren Ci when he requested and made arrangements for the loan; 

 that the Payment Vouc her was false, i.e. that the loan was not one from Ren Ci to Mandala; and 

 that on all the fac ts in the c ase, an inexorable and irresistible inferenc e should be drawn that SMY had c onspired with RY to falsify the Payment Vouc her to state that the loan was one from Ren Ci to Mandala, with the intention to defraud Ren Ci. 

I shall first address the sec ond argument, followed by the first and third arguments together sinc e they are related. 

_Was the Payment Voucher false?_ 

33     In support of this point, c ounsel for SMY argued that (i) RY had requested a loan from Mandala, (ii) the Mandala loan was rec orded in Ren Ci’s books as a loan from Ren Ci to Mandala, and (iii) the Mandala loan was rec orded as part of the total outstanding sum owed by Mandala to Ren Ci in audit 

c onfirmations by Mandala to Ren Ci dated 21 June 2005 [note: 3] (signed by SMY), 24 April 2006 [note: 4] (signed by RY) and 18 May 2007 [note: 5] (signed by RY). 

34     Counsel submitted that when RY first approac hed SMY for a loan on 17 May 2004, he asked to borrow $50,000 from Mandala. SMY was not aware at that point if Mandala had adequate c ash to lend the said amount to RY as SMY had never managed Mandala from the start. It was only when RY returned with the Cash Cheque and Payment Vouc her for SMY’s approval that SMY realised that Mandala did not have adequate funds to lend RY the $50,000. Therefore, the money had to c ome from Ren Ci as a loan to Mandala. 

35     However, as the DJ noted, the money did not go to Mandala at all. RY kept the c ash in his home for five days before flying to Hong Kong and depositing it into his ac c ount. RY admitted that his plan was to borrow money from Ren Ci and rec ord it under Mandala’s name. Quite interestingly, in 2007, RY repaid the loan to Ren Ci rather than to Mandala. Moreover, no mention of any bac k-to-bac k 

loan was made in RY’s note to Ren Ci’s financ e department. [note: 6] 

36     The evidenc e indic ated that SMY knew that there was no bac k-to-bac k loan. SMY did not mention the bac k-to-bac k loan in his initial statements to the CAD. SMY had admitted that a bac k

to-bac k loan was not a proper way to give a loan to RY. [note: 7] Further, as the DJ found, the justific ation by SMY and RY for the loan c oming from Mandala, instead of direc tly from Ren Ci, lac ked 


## (1) 

## (2) 

## (3) 

c redibility (GD at [150]-[151]). 

37     The loan was never rec orded in Mandala’s books. Counsel for SMY attempted to explain this glaring inc onsistenc y by pointing to the audit c onfirmations for Ren Ci. The audit c onfirmations were 

stated by Mr Winston Ngan, PW 2, at the trial below [note: 8] , to be c onsistent with the desc ription of the loan as a loan for $50,000 from Ren Ci to Mandala. However, the audit c onfirmations were c onsistent with Ren Ci’s ac c ounts but not with those of Mandala. They also stated a global figure without individual breakdowns. Mandala merely c onfirmed that the global amount owed by Mandala to Ren Ci was c orrec t, even though the alleged loan to RY did not appear in its rec ords. In these c irc umstanc es, the audit c onfirmations c ould not be said to be evidenc e of the existenc e of a bac kto-bac k loan from Ren Ci to Mandala and then to RY. 

38     It is trite law that an appellate c ourt will be slow to interfere with the trial judge’s finding of fac t. As Yong Pung How CJ held in _Chua Yong Khiang Melvin v PP_ [1999] 2 SLR (R) 1108 at [31]: 

 It is settled law that an appellate c ourt will defer to the trial judge's finding of fac t: see PP v Hla Win <span class="citation">[1995] 2 SLR(R) 104</span> at [38]. There is a sound rationale for this. The trial judge enjoys the advantage of observing the demeanours of the witnesses. In dec iding who to believe, he takes into c onsideration all relevant fac tors involved, with the advantage of his observations. An appellate c ourt therefore does not lightly disturb suc h findings, unless they c an be shown to be plainly wrong, against the weight of the evidenc e or that the trial judge has not taken proper advantage of his having seen and heard the witnesses: Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP <span class="citation">[1997] 2 SLR(R) 253</span> and Krishna Jayaram v PP <span class="citation">[1989] 2 SLR(R) 21</span>. 

On the evidenc e, I see no reason to disturb the DJ’s findings that there was no bac k-to-bac k loan and that the Payment Vouc her was false. 

_Did SMY conspire with RY to falsify the Payment Voucher wilfully with the intent to defraud?_ 

39     The offenc e of abetment by c onspirac y is found in sec tion 107(b) of the Penal Code: 

 107. A person abets the doing of a thing who — 

 ... 

 (b) engages with one or more other person or persons in any c onspirac y for the doing of that thing, if an ac t or illegal omission takes plac e in pursuanc e of that c onspirac y, and in order to the doing of that thing... 

The requirements for the offenc e of abetment by c onspirac y were spelt out in _Lee Yuen Hong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[2000] 1 SLR(R) 604</span> at [38]: 

 On a c harge of abetment by c onspirac y, the Prosec ution has to establish the following elements: 

 the person abetting must engage, with one or more other persons, in a c onspirac y; 

 the c onspirac y must be for the doing of the thing abetted; and 

 an ac t or illegal omission must take plac e in pursuanc e of the c onspirac y in order to the doing of that thing. 


40     Proof of an agreement between the parties c an be inferred from the words and ac tions of the parties, as elaborated upon in _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Choon Poh_ <span class="citation">[1993] 3 SLR(R) 302</span> at [20]. I quote: 

 One method of proving a c onspirac y would be to show that the words and ac tions of the parties indic ate their c onc ert in the pursuit of a c ommon objec t or design, giving rise to the inferenc e that their ac tions must have been c o-ordinated by arrangement beforehand. These ac tions and words do not of themselves c onstitute the c onspirac y but rather c onstitute evidenc e of the c onspirac y. 

The inferenc e of a c onspirac y was c larified by Yong CJ in _Er Joo Nguang and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[2000] 1 SLR(R) 756</span> at [35]: 

 So far as proof goes, c onspirac y is generally a matter of inferenc e, deduc ed from c ertain ac ts of the ac c used parties, done in pursuanc e of an apparent c riminal purpose in c ommon between them. Both the surrounding c irc umstanc es and the c onduc t of the parties before and after the alleged c ommission of the c rime will be useful in drawing an inferenc e of c onspirac y... An inferenc e of c onspirac y would be justified only if it is inexorable and irresistible, and ac c ounts for all the fac ts of the c ase. 

41     After examining the evidenc e in the c ase at hand, I agree with the DJ’s finding that there was an agreement between SMY and RY to falsify the Payment Vouc her. Adopting the test in _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Choon Poh_ (above at [40]) to the c ase at hand, the words and ac tions of SMY and RY c learly illustrated their “c onc ert in pursuit of a c ommon objec t or design”, the c ommon objec t being the falsific ation of the Payment Vouc her. This was evident from RY’s instruc tion to the financ e department to rec ord the 50,000 as a loan to Mandala in the Payment Vouc her and SMY’s subsequent authorization of the Payment Vouc her. RY’s statement to the CAD c onfirmed that he gave the instruc tion to the financ e department and that SMY agreed to rec ord the $50,000 as a loan to 

Mandala. [note: 9] SMY admitted to the CAD that he knew that the loan was a personal loan to RY 

when he approved and signed the Cash Cheque. [note: 10] 

42     There c ould be no doubt that SMY and RY had engaged in the c onspirac y wilfully. Furthermore, the DJ found that SMY and RY had the intent to defraud. I agree with the approac h adopted by the DJ in following _Public Prosecutor v Chow Wai Lam_ <span class="citation">[2006] SGDC 1</span> at [47]-[52] with respec t to the definition of “intent to defraud”. The proper approac h should be to examine all the fac ts and c irc umstanc es surrounding the relevant transac tion to determine whether or not there was an intent to defraud. Both SMY and RY knew that there was no bac k-to-bac k loan and that the loan was a personal one to RY, not a loan from Ren Ci to Mandala. Yet they went on to mask the $50,000 as a loan to Mandala. The intent to defraud was therefore present. 

43     Given that (i) SMY and RY engaged in a c onspirac y to falsify the Payment Vouc her, (ii) SMY and RY did so wilfully and with intent to defraud (as per the requirements of sec tion 477A Penal Code) and (iii) the Payment Vouc her was falsified, all three requirements for the offenc e of abetment by c onspirac y, as laid out in _Lee Yuen Hong v Public Prosecutor_ (above at [39]), were satisfied with respec t to the offenc e under sec tion 477A. I therefore affirm the c onvic tion of SMY and RY in relation to SMY’s First Charge and RY’s First Charge respec tively. 

_SMY’s Second Charge_ 

44     The Sec ond Charge involved the offenc e of c riminal breac h of trust. This is defined in 


sec tion 405 of the Penal Code: 

 Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or c onverts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direc tion of law presc ribing the mode in whic h suc h trust is to be disc harged, or of any legal c ontrac t, express or implied, whic h he has made touc hing the disc harge of suc h trust, or wilfully suffers any other person to do so, c ommits “c riminal breac h of trust”. 

In _Tan Tze Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">[1997] 1 SLR(R) 876</span>, Yong CJ stated at [36] that in order to c onstitute the offenc e of c riminal breac h of trust, the ac c used had to be “(a) entrusted with the property, and he had to have (b) dishonestly misappropriated the property”. Yong CJ added at [37] that to misappropriate means “to set apart or assign to the wrong person or wrong use”. 

45     Counsel for SMY argued that the granting of a loan was always a disc retionary matter, subjec t to SMY’s approval, sinc e no one, whether a staff or a volunteer, was entitled to any loan. The Management Committee had unc onditionally left authority with SMY to dec ide whether to grant a loan or not. Thus, SMY’s authority to grant any loan was not affec ted by RY’s employment status. The size of a loan would not have any bearing on SMY’s authority to grant a loan; rather it would be one of the fac tors that was relevant when SMY dec ided whether the loan should be approved or not. 

46     Counsel for SMY further argued that the examples of previous loans granted by Ren Ci did not mean that there was a standing polic y on loans bec ause no formal polic y was in plac e. Rather, the evidenc e at trial was that eac h and every loan by Ren Ci would be c onsidered on a c ase-by-c ase basis. 

47     Counsel for SMY argued that the Management Committee had left the day-to-day affairs of Ren Ci and Mandala entirely to SMY. SMY’s unc hallenged testimony at trial was that the Management Committee never had any formal disc ussion setting out any guidelines for loans to staff nor had the Management Committee talked about any prohibitions on the granting of a loan to a person who, though not a staff, had c ontributed to Ren Ci. Thus, the Appellant was of the honest belief that he was authorised to grant the loan. 

48     SMY’s responsibilities in Ren Ci had inc reased and he required a personal assistant to help him with his duties here and to travel with him to his many offic es in Hong Kong and Taiwan. SMY c ontended that MOM offic ials in 2001 had intimated that, even though RY’s applic ation for an employment pass was not approved, if RY’s salary was paid through SMY’s salary, people might just c lose one eye. This was of c ourse denied by the MOM witness during the trial as MOM offic ials would not c ondone infringement of manpower law and would never advise people on how to break the law. In any event, c ounsel for SMY argued, RY was in substanc e and in truth an employee of Ren Ci at the time of the loan in May 2004. He was running Mandala, he was openly performing duties as a staff of Ren Ci and his name appeared in the minutes. 

49     Counsel for SMY further submitted that RY did not ask for a personal loan but requested to borrow money from Mandala to pay for his house in Hong Kong and said he would repay the money onc e his housing loan was approved. It was ironic al that all this had to happen as SMY c ould have easily raised the money requested from supporters. RY told him that he would rec ord the loan in Mandala’s books but unfortunately did not. 

50     The lac k of any dishonest intention, c ounsel submitted, was supported by the fac t that the loan was rec orded in Ren Ci’s ac c ounts and the various audit c onfirmations. Further, given that SMY 


 (a) 

 (b) 

 (c ) 

 (d) 

was a partner in Mandala and was personally liable for any loans extended by Ren Ci to Mandala, no loss was oc c asioned to Ren Ci at any time by the granting of the $50,000 loan. 

51     The DJ rightly observed that the testimony showed that Ren Ci had only granted loans to staff in the form of salary advanc es and its Human Resourc es staff had never c ome ac ross an applic ation by a volunteer for a loan (GD at [19]). Clearly, on the fac ts, RY was not a staff of Ren Ci at the material time although SMY obviously treated him as one despite the known legal impediment. The fac t that RY’s salary had to be paid indirec tly through SMY’s inc reased salary showed that SMY wanted to employ RY even if the law said no. Furthermore, any funds loaned from Ren Ci to Mandala had to be used to run Mandala’s business only. Ms Chan Ching Oi (PW 7), the Honorary Sec retary of the Management Committee of Ren Ci, c onfirmed that loans made to Mandala had to be used to sponsor Mandala’s business and was not meant for third parties. Had Ms Chan been aware that the $50,000 was not rec eived by Mandala but by a third party, she would not have approved the loan. [note: 11] Therefore there c learly was a misappropriation, as the funds were diverted to the wrong 

person and for a wrong use. 

52     The next element of the offenc e is the element of “dishonesty”. “Dishonesty” is defined in sec tion 24 of the Penal Code as follows: 

 Whoever does anything with the intention of c ausing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly. 

“Wrongful gain” is defined in sec tion 23 as: 

 gain by unlawful means of property to whic h the person gaining it is not legally entitled 

while “wrongful loss” is defined in the same sec tion as: 

 loss by unlawful means of property to whic h the person losing it is legally entitled. 

53     I agree with the reasoning of the DJ (GD at [187]) that the element of dishonesty was satisfied as SMY was aware that by signing the Cash Cheque and the Payment Vouc her, RY was obtaining a wrongful gain in getting a $50,000 loan that he was not entitled to and Ren Ci was deprived of the money. The following fac tors strongly suggested that SMY intended to c ause gain to RY by unlawful means and loss to Ren Ci by unlawful means: 

 the $50,000 loan was granted in a manner that was markedly different from previous loans granted by Ren Ci; 

 the loan was misleadingly stated to be a “Loan to Mandala” on the Payment Vouc her; 

 SMY attempted to c over up the fac t that the $50,000 was given to RY as a loan, through, among other things, providing doc uments to E & Y in an attempt to show that the $50, had been used to purc hase statues; [note: 12] and 

 SMY lied to the CAD initially but later admitted that he knew the $50,000 was a personal loan to RY at the time it was made. 


54     Even if an ac c used intends a misappropriation to be temporary only, this is suffic ient to satisfy the element of dishonesty. This was eluc idated by Abdoolc ader J in _PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris_ [1977] 1 MLJ 180 (and endorsed by Yong Pung How CJ in _Lee Yuen Hong v PP_ at [46]-[48]): 

 "[dishon esty in the context of criminal breach of trust] must be held to have been established even though the deprivation may have been only for a short period and there may not have been any intention on the part of the ac c used to have any permanent gain to himself or c ause any permanent loss to the person entitled to the property ". 

Yong CJ went on to add, at [48]: 

 Temporary misappropriations whic h are seemingly innoc uous and do not c ause any loss to the employer should not be permitted by the law in any event. Even though [the ac c used] may have intended to return the disputed sum ... at the time the disputed sum was handed over to the appellant , he was nevertheless dishonest at law. 

 [emphasis in original] 

As suc h, it is immaterial to SMY’s Sec ond Charge that the money was taken and repaid to Ren Ci eventually (and even then, only when the issue of the missing funds was being looked into). 

55     Counsel for SMY pointed out that SMY donated $50,000 to Ren Ci on 30 August 2005 and that RY repaid the loan by paying $10,000 to Ren Ci on 4 January 2007 and another $40,000 on 7 Marc h 

2007\. In Oc tober 2007, SMY was still unaware that the missing $50,000 was in fac t the Mandala loan to RY and therefore felt c ompelled to reimburse RY for the $50,000 that he had paid to Ren Ci earlier that year as he thought that RY had to c ome up with his own money to make good the missing $50,000. SMY felt bad that the money went missing during his watc h. SMY therefore gave $50,000 to RY in Oc tober 2007 bec ause of this. RY took $1,000 in c ash and deposited the rest into his ac c ount. Counsel therefore asked rhetoric ally whether SMY’s ac tions were c onsistent with a person who wanted to c ause wrongful loss to Ren Ci. 

56     I asked whether this meant that RY was dishonest towards his benefac tor and boss bec ause he knew that he was merely repaying his loan and yet ac c epted the c ompensation of $50,000 from SMY. Counsel for RY replied that RY did not dare c ome c lean at that point in time bec ause he knew that he had forgotten to rec ord the loan in Mandala’s books and did not want Ren Ci to bec ome another NKF saga. 

57     In my opinion, RY’s explanation for this sounded extremely hollow. There was no indic ation that his relationship with SMY had c hanged by 2007 that he would effec tively lie to someone so c lose to him and so c onc erned for his wellbeing. If it was a mere administrative slip-up and there was nothing surreptitious at all about the loan, surely RY would not be c heating SMY of $50,000 in this manner. What the two men were doing with the fund transfers was something known only to them. After all, their very c lose relationship extended to financ ial matters as well. This was amply demonstrated by the joint purc hases of the Australian properties early in their relationship and by the provision of supplementary c redit c ards by SMY for RY. As for the donation in 2005 by SMY, while that is c ommendable, it does not nec essarily follow that a person who donated money to a c harity in August 2005 c ould not have also misused its funds in May 2004. 

58     Further, as alluded to earlier, the repayments by RY to Ren Ci c ame about only after E & Y had started probing the c harity’s financ ial situation. The repayments were also more than two and a half

years after the loan was given in May 2004. Suc h a sc enario surely makes one wonder whether and when the loan would be repaid if no investigations had taken plac e. Despite RY’s c laim that the loan c ame from Mandala, he nevertheless saw it proper to repay Ren Ci direc tly. 

59     In my view, all these ac tions by the two men reinforc ed rather than negated the finding of dishonesty. I have already said that the audit c onfirmations c ould not be evidenc e of the alleged bac ktobac k loan as the c onsolidated amount showed no indic ation that there was suc h a loan. I therefore agree with the DJ and affirm the c onvic tion in respec t of SMY’s Sec ond Charge. 

**_SMY’s Third Charge_** 

60     Counsel for SMY argued that while SMY knew the general purpose of the Mandala loan when he granted it on 17 May 2004, he later believed that RY had made repayment sometime in 2004 or 2005 onc e his housing loan was approved as he trusted RY to do so. The possibility of the loan still being outstanding esc aped his mind during the interview with E & Y on 18 Dec ember 2007. Only in or around January 2008, after RY had informed him of the truth about the loan did it dawn on SMY that the “missing” $50,000 was the Mandala loan. 

61     Before addressing c ounsel’s arguments, it is nec essary to first turn to the law. The Charities Ac t (the “Ac t”), in sec tion 3(1)(a), provides for the appointment of a Commissioner of Charities. The objec tives of the Commissioner, as spelt out in sec tion 4(1) of the Ac t, are: 

 to maintain public trust and c onfidenc e in c harities; 

 to promote c omplianc e by c harity trustees with their legal obligations in exerc ising c ontrol and management of the administration of their c harities; 

 to promote the effec tive use of c haritable resourc es; and 

 to enhanc e the ac c ountability of c harities to donors, benefic iaries and the general public. 

The general func tions of the Commissioner inc lude (see sec tion 4(2)) of the Ac t: 

 to determine whether institutions are or are not c harities; 

 to enc ourage and fac ilitate the better administration of c harities; 

 to identify and investigate apparent misc onduc t or mismanagement in the administration of c harities; 

 to take remedial or protec tive ac tion in c onnec tion with misc onduc t or mismanagement in the administration of c harities; 

 ... 

62     The Commissioner is vested, through sec tion 8 of the Ac t, with a power to institute inquiries c onc erning a c harity. Sec tion 8(2) provides that the Commissioner may c onduc t suc h an inquiry himself or appoint a person to do so and report to him. Sec tion 8(3) states that the Commissioner or a person appointed by him to c onduc t the inquiry may by order require any person: 

 to furnish ac c ounts and statements in writing with respec t to any matter in question at the inquiry, being a matter on whic h that person has or c an reasonably obtain information, or to 


 (b) 

 (c ) 

 (a) 

 (b) 

 return answers in writing to any questions or inquiries addressed to him on any suc h matter, and to verify any suc h ac c ounts, statements or answers by statutory dec laration; 

 to furnish c opies of doc uments in his c ustody or under his c ontrol whic h relate to any matter in question at the inquiry, and to verify any suc h c opies by statutory dec laration; and 

 to attend at a spec ified time and plac e and give evidenc e or produc e any suc h doc uments. 

Sec tion 8(4) states that for the purposes of the inquiry, evidenc e may be taken on oath and the person c onduc ting the inquiry may, for that purpose, administer oaths or alternatively require the person examined to make a dec laration of the truth of the matters about whic h he is examined. 

63     Sec tion 9 grants the Commissioner the power to c all for doc uments and to searc h rec ords for the purpose of disc harging his func tions under the Ac t. Sec tion 10(1), the provision c ited in SMY’s Third Charge and Fourth Charge, c reates the offenc e of supplying the Commissioner with information whic h is false or misleading in a material partic ular. It reads: 

 Any person who knowingly or rec klessly provides the Commissioner with information whic h is false or misleading in a material partic ular shall be guilty of an offenc e if the information is provided — 

 in purported c omplianc e with a requirement imposed by or under this Ac t; or 

 otherwise than as mentioned in paragraph ( a ) but in c irc umstanc es in whic h the person providing the information intends, or c ould reasonably be expec ted to know, that it would be used by the Commissioner for the purpose of disc harging his func tions under this Ac t. 

Sec tion 10(4) c larifies that referenc es to the Commissioner in sec tion 10 inc lude referenc es to any person c onduc ting an inquiry under s 8. Finally, sec tion 10(3) states that any person guilty of an offenc e under sec tion 10 shall be liable to a fine of up to $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exc eeding one year or both. 

64     Regulation 2(1) of the Charities (Sec tor Administrators) Regulations (Cap 37, Sec tion 40C, 2007 Ed) allows the Commissioner to delegate to any Sec tor Administrator (as defined in sec tion 40A of the Ac t) any func tion or power under the Ac t in relation to c harities. Pursuant to that power, the Commissioner delegated his powers under the Charities Ac t to the MOH to be exerc ised in relation to c harities within the health sec tor. 

65     Turning to the fac ts of the c ase, the MOH instituted the Inquiry on 7 November 2007 under sec tion 8(1) of the Ac t in relation to, among other matters, the issuanc e of the Cash Cheque of 

$50,000. [note: 13] The MOH further appointed c ertain offic ers from MOH and E & Y to c onduc t the Inquiry and make a report of the findings. On 18 Dec ember 2007, SMY provided an oral statement to E & Y on affirmation stating that the $50,000 was used by Mandala to purc hase wood for sc ulpting 

Buddha statues. [note: 14] SMY’s admission to the CAD that he knew that the loan was a personal loan to RY when he approved and signed the Cash Cheque meant that he knowingly provided E & Y with information whic h was false in a material partic ular, as SMY knew that the story about the $50, being used by Mandala to purc hase wood was untrue. The information was provided as part of the Inquiry and was therefore provided in purported c omplianc e with sec tion 8(3) of the Ac t. 

66     Counsel for SMY submitted that 2004 and the following years were an extremely hec tic time for SMY. He was personally involved in many fund-raising projec ts and religious ac tivities and the Mandala loan to RY was c ompletely forgotten by him. I note that SMY had the time to travel to Australia with 


RY to purc hase a penthouse in Melbourne (one of the two properties referred to earlier) in September 2004 despite his busy sc hedule. As the DJ also pertinently observed, it was not plausible that SMY was able to keep trac k of RY’s repayment of the c redit c ard bills but c ould forget altogether about the $50,000 loan. SMY and RY were in c lose and c onstant c ontac t with eac h other c onc erning work and their personal financ ial matters. 

67     It was quite inc redible that SMY never onc e asked RY after May 2004 whether he had obtained the Hong Kong housing loan and whether he had repaid the $50,000 or any portion thereof to Mandala. Even if the loan did slip his mind for a while, when the heat of the Inquiry started getting more intense, it was not possible that SMY would not try to rec ollec t what the missing $50,000 c ould be, by meeting his staff members and/or c hec king the relevant doc uments. Further, it must be remembered that in February 2007, Ren Ci had given information to MOH that the said amount was expended on c upboards and fittings. Then in Marc h 2007, Ren Ci gave information to MOH that the missing $50,000 was expended on merc handise, another inc orrec t assertion. With the story about the $50,000 c onstantly evolving in the fac e of a serious query from the authorities, SMY’s seeming indifferenc e and total relianc e on what RY told him without verific ation was c ompletely at odds with someone holding suc h a responsible position in the c harity. 

68     I also find it absurd that RY would be so forgetful about doc umenting suc h a unique loan of indeterminate duration that he c ompletely forgot to rec ord it in Mandala’s books over the years. After all, there was no evidenc e that Mandala had so many business ac tivities that RY’s attention was totally diverted away from the loan. If SMY and RY were right in saying that the audit c onfirmations from Ren Ci inc luded the said loan, then they c ould not have signed the audit c onfirmations without remembering the alleged loan to Mandala. I also find it inc redible that RY would be so fearful of owning up to a simple administrative error, if error it be, of forgetting to rec ord a loan in the books that he would hide that fac t from SMY, someone he was obviously c lose to professionally and personally. In my view, it was true that SMY and RY were worried about the fallout from the NKF saga but it was in t he c ontext of them having misused Ren Ci’s funds for a personal loan (with no repayment or other terms) for someone not entitled to it and their c onc ern that this financ ial misdeed and blatant breac h of employment law would be disc overed. Their efforts to plaster over an alleged innoc ent administrative lapse raised so many questions that they appeared to me to be digging a 20-foot tunnel to bury a small ant. 

69     In the c irc umstanc es, I agree with the DJ that SMY was guilty of the offenc e under sec tion 10(1)(a) of the Ac t. 

**_SMY’s Fourth Charge_** 

70     Counsel for SMY submitted that SMY was not aware, when the BJJHS Letter was forwarded to E & Y, that the $50,000 was not used to purc hase wood from China. RY c onfirmed that he did not disc uss with nor inform SMY that he would be speaking with Zhang Jin Hai (PW 14) to have the BJJHS Letter issued. Zhang Jin Hai c onfirmed that SMY had no part to play in the issuanc e of the BJJHS Letter and that he dealt only with RY in relation to the issuanc e of the BJJHS Letter. There was no evidenc e of SMY’s partic ipation in any c onspirac y for the preparation of the BJJHS Letter. After RY c onfessed to SMY sometime towards the end of January 2008, SMY agreed to c ontinue RY’s lie on the wood story as he feared that the error on RY’s part in failing to rec ord the $50,000 loan would have a negative impac t on Ren Ci. 

71     After SMY provided the oral statement on affirmation to E & Y, Lynda Soong, the Head of the 

Inquiry, issued an order [note: 15] (t he “Order”) dated 2 January 2008 under sec tion 8(3) of the Ac t requesting that SMY produc e doc uments evidenc ing the valuation of the two statues allegedly bought 


by Mandala with the $50,000. Pursuant to the Order, E & Y interviewed SMY and rec eived a written 

statement [note: 16] by SMY dated 4 January 2008 stating that the wood and Buddha statues were purc hased from BJJHS in China and that the total c ost of the two statues was $16,000 with 25m³ of timber left over. SMY was asked to furnish doc uments in support of this. Sometime in January 2008, E 

& Y rec eived a letter [note: 17] on the letterhead of BJJHS addressed to Mandala, stating that two wooden Buddha statues, c osting $16,000 in total had been shipped to Singapore on 13 August 2007 and that there was a balanc e of 25m³ of wood. 

72     The law relating to the offenc e of abetment by c onspirac y has been disc ussed above. There was ample evidenc e to infer a c onspirac y on the part of SMY and RY to knowingly provide E & Y with information that was false in a material partic ular. RY c onfessed that it was his idea to c ome up with 

the exc use that the $50,000 was used to buy wood and statues from BJJHS. [note: 18] He told the exc use to SMY who agreed to help him with the c over up. Ac c ording to RY, SMY knew that the letter was a fake but was merely helping RY c over up. SMY admitted furnishing the BJJHS Letter to E & Y and that at the time the doc uments were submitted, SMY was aware that the statues were not 

purc hased by Mandala. [note: 19] Thus, the words of SMY and RY indic ated c onc erted ac tion between them in pursuit of a c ommon aim from whic h a c onspirac y c ould be inferred. The ac tions of SMY and RY also supported the inferenc e of a c onspirac y. Following a request by E & Y to SMY for further doc uments in support of his written statement dated 4 January 2008, RY approac hed Zhang Jin Hai who drafted the BJJHS Letter ac c ording to RY’s instruc tions and faxed it to RY. This letter was subsequently provided to E & Y by one of Ren Ci’s staff. The BJJHS Letter c ontained information that was strikingly similar to what was required by E & Y. This c ould not have been possible without c onc erted ac tion between RY and SMY. 

73     Pursuant to that c onspirac y, the BJJHS letter was handed over to E & Y. As suc h, all the elements of a c onspirac y between SMY and RY to knowingly provide E & Y with information that was false in a material partic ular were satisfied. The DJ was therefore c orrec t in finding that SMY was guilty of the offenc e under sec tion 10(1)(b) of the Ac t as well. 

74     My remarks c onc erning SMY’s Third Charge apply equally to SMY’s Fourth Charge. In my opinion, SMY c ould not have forgotten about the loan. It follows that all the information that he gave to the Inquiry was provided by him with full knowledge of what the truth was and that the truth was not in the said information. If he realized the falsity of the information only after it had been furnished to the Inquiry, I see no reason why he would not want to rec tify the error immediately. After all, it was allegedly a simple administrative slip-up on the part of one of his former staff members. Whic h of the following is infinitely worse? A slip-up with no loss to the c harity (as the loan had been fully repaid by RY by Marc h 2007) or c ontinue a blatant falsehood perpetrated by a former staff member (RY tendered his resignation in June 2007)? For a man of SMY’s status and experienc e, I have no doubt he would have c hosen the c orrec t path if he was truly unaware of the falsehood when he tendered the information. RY was obviously hoping to exonerate SMY from the false information c harges under the Ac t by the muc h too c oinc idental assertion that he finally revealed the truth to SMY in late January 2008, after SMY had given the false information to the Inquiry. 

75     On the totality of the evidenc e before me, I agree with the findings of the DJ regarding SMY’s c onvic tion on all four c harges and ac c ordingly dismiss SMY’s appeal against c onvic tion. I shall now address RY’s appeal against c onvic tion. 

**RY’s appeal against conviction** 

**_RY’s First Charge_** 


 (a) 

 (b) 

 (c ) 

 (d) 

76     Counsel for RY argued that the $50,000 loan was a _bona fide_ loan. RY attempted to c over up the matter only bec ause he had forgotten to rec ord the loan in Mandala’s books and was worried and sc ared about this omission. RY remembered at all times that he had taken a loan from Mandala. He intended to repay the loan from the proc eeds of sale of his shares but as the pric e of the shares was low, he wanted to wait and repay the entire loan in one payment. 

77     Counsel further argued that the repayment of $50,000 by SMY to RY in late 2007 (as evidenc ed 

by a deposit of $49,000 [note: 20] in RY’s bank ac c ount, with RY retaining $1,000 for his use) was evidenc e of the absenc e of a c onspirac y to falsify the Payment Vouc her as it showed that SMY had forgotten that the missing $50,000 was the loan that RY had taken in 2004. The fac t that RY ac knowledged and signed the audit c onfirmations was indic ative of RY’s lac k of fraudulent intent with regard to the $50,000. 

78     Furthermore, c ounsel submitted, the c lose and personal relationship between RY and SMY would explain why: 

 SMY approved the bac k-to-bac k loan without muc h disc ussion with RY; 

 SMY trusted and left it to RY to make the entry in Mandala’s books; 

 SMY trusted RY to make repayment of the loan onc e his housing loan was approved; and 

 SMY did not trac k the repayment of the loan as c losely as he should have. 

79     As disc ussed above, I agree with the findings of the DJ that there was no bac k-to-bac k loan. Further, the evidenc e c learly showed that SMY and RY c onspired to falsify the Payment Vouc her. I have already explained in relation to SMY’s appeal why I did not ac c ept SMY’s and RY’s evidenc e regarding this offenc e. 

80     Ac c ordingly, I dismiss the appeal against c onvic tion on RY’s First Charge. 

**_RY’s Second Charge_** 

81     Counsel for RY argued that RY had stated in his evidenc e in c hief and under re-examination [note: 21] that there were material errors in his statements to the CAD [note: 22] on 26 Marc h 2008. RY 

c larified that SMY only knew about the BJJHS Letter at the end of January 2008 and that RY did not inform SMY about the preparation and obtaining of the BJJHS Letter. The formation of the story about the wood only c ame about sometime in July 2007 and thus it was impossible for RY to have approac hed SMY c onc erning the c over up towards the end of 2006 or in the early part of 2007. It was submitted that there was therefore no c onspirac y between SMY and RY to c over up the Mandala loan. 

82     The above points were dealt with by the DJ in the GD at [85]-[86]. The fac t that SMY knew about the c over up before he gave the oral statement to E & Y was also c onsistent with the other fac ts in the c ase. Muc h of what I have stated in respec t of SMY’s Third Charge and Fourth Charge 


 (a) 

 (b) 

applies equally to RY’s Sec ond Charge. I have already stated that I disbelieved that RY would travel so far down the road of falsehood over an allegedly innoc ent slip-up whic h had oc c asioned no loss to the c harity. I therefore dismiss the appeal against c onvic tion with respec t to RY’s Sec ond Charge. 

83     I now turn to SMY’s and RY’s appeals against their respec tive sentenc es. 

**SMY’s appeal against sentence** 

84     The Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) as it stood before 1 February 2008 applies to this c ase. Sec tion 477A Penal Code provides for imprisonment of up to seven years or fine or both while sec tion 406 Penal Code provides for imprisonment of up to three years or fine or both. Sec tion 10(3) of the Ac t presc ribes punishment of a fine not exc eeding $5,000 or imprisonment not exc eeding one year or both. Sec tion 109 Penal Code provides that whoever abets any offenc e shall, if the ac t abetted is c ommitted in c onsequenc e of the abetment, and no express provision is made by the Penal Code for the punishment of suc h abetment, be punished with the punishment for the offenc e. 

85     The sentenc es imposed on SMY and RY have been set out at [30] and [31] above. 

86     Counsel for SMY argued that the sentenc e imposed by the trial judge was manifestly exc essive in view of: 

 SMY’s good c harac ter and servic e to the public ; and 

 the c ontribution by SMY of his time, effort and financ es over the past 15 years to start and sustain Ren Ci, a hospital for the needy, c hronic ally ill. 

It was submitted that SMY had a long and distinguished rec ord of public , soc ial and c haritable servic e and had personally helped thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands, of Singaporeans who walked through the doors of Ren Ci in the c ourse of his c harity and religious work. 

87     Counsel also argued that public interest did not demand a c ustodial sentenc e. SMY had to endure great embarrassment and trauma due to the public ity generated by the trial. Counsel further argued that even if the c ourt was of the view that a c ustodial sentenc e was nec essary, in the light of the “c lang of the prison gates” princ iple as applied in _Knight v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 720</span>, a symbolic , short c ustodial sentenc e of 1 day would suffic e. Counsel submitted that SMY’s work had a muc h wider direc t public outreac h and c ontribution than the type of public servic e rendered by the appellant in _Knight v Public Prosecutor_ , who, in any event, was legally trained and knew the legal position when he c ommitted his offenc es. 

88     Counsel referred to _T T Durai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[2007] SGDC 334</span> where the ac c used was tried on one c harge under sec tion 6(c ) of the Prevention of Corruption Ac t. There, a distric t c ourt ac c epted that the ac c used worked extensively for the NKF and kidney dialysis patients and that suc h c ontributions made by a person to soc iety ought to be taken in the balanc e bec ause they showed erstwhile good c harac ter. Counsel submitted that SMY’s offenc e of c riminal breac h of trust was essentially a tec hnic al breac h of the law and that any imprisonment term imposed on SMY should not be more severe than the 3 months’ imprisonment in _T T Durai v Public Prosecutor_. 

89     It was further argued that although the funds in Ren Ci c ame from public donations, a heavy sentenc e would disc ourage people from serving on c haritable bodies and c ause them to c hoose the 


more luc rative work in private entities. Moreover, SMY had already seen shame and embarrassment and had to suffer the further indignity of being parodied and ridic uled on stage. Referenc e was made t o _Wuu David v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[2008] 4 SLR 83</span> where Chan Sek Keong CJ said that for one-off offenders, prosec ution for the offenc e would in itself provide some form of general deterrenc e in most c ases and that in some c ases, the shame and embarrassment to family and friends c ould have a more powerful effec t than the sentenc e itself. Counsel submitted that a fine instead of imprisonment c ould be ordered under sec tion 477A Penal Code and pointed out that the false information c harges were ac tually c ompoundable. 

90     The prosec ution argued that the “c lang of the prison gates” princ iple did not apply to SMY as he had used his position of eminenc e to c ommit the offenc es. As stated by Yong CJ in _Wong Tiew Yong and Another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[2003] 3 SLR(R) 325</span> at [58]: 

 the fac t that [the appellant] had abused this very position of eminenc e to c ommit the offenc es took him out of the exc eptional c ategory of persons to whom the princ iple applies. [The appellant] c ould not argue that, sinc e he fit this exc eptional c ategory very neatly, he c ould therefore avail himself of the princ iple. Suc h an argument moc ks the rationale behind the “c lang of the prison gates” princ iple. As a matter of logic , suc h an argument must fail. A person who had abused his status of eminenc e to c ommit an offenc e should not then be allowed to use that very status to his advantage. 

91     An appellate c ourt may c orrec t sentenc es where (a) the sentenc ing judge has erred as to the proper fac tual basis for the sentenc e; (b) the sentenc ing judge has failed to apprec iate the material plac ed before him; (c ) the sentenc e imposed is wrong in princ iple and/or law; or (d) the sentenc e imposed is either manifestly exc essive or manifestly inadequate: _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ [2006] 4 SLR (R) 653 at [13], c ited in _Whang Sung Lin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[2010] SGHC 53</span> at [40]. A sentenc e is said to be manifestly exc essive or inadequate when “the sentenc e is unjustly lenient or severe, as the c ase may be, and requires substantial alterations rather than minute c orrec tions to remedy the injust ic e”: _Public Prosecutor v Siew Boon Loong_ <span class="citation">[2005] 1 SLR(R) 611</span> at [22]. 

92     The DJ took into ac c ount SMY’s rec ord of public servic e and c ontributions to soc iety and ac knowledged that in some areas, SMY’s efforts went beyond those of a normal CEO (GD on Sentenc e a t [23]-[28]). However, the DJ also took into ac c ount the fac t that the offenc es involved an abuse of authority and a betrayal of the trust plac ed in SMY as CEO and Chairman of Ren Ci. This has been rec ognised by the c ourts as a serious aggravating fac tor that might outweigh fac tors whic h would otherwise go towards mitigation: _Balakrishnan S and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[2005] 4 SLR(R) 249</span> at [137]. Furthermore, SMY gave false information in an attempt to c over up the offenc es whic h inc reased the seriousness of the offenc es. 

93     I ac c ept that misuse of funds in a c haritable organization is a serious offenc e and that the amount involved in this c ase was not a small one. There was restitution but only when the authorities began to look into Ren Ci’s financ ial matters. While no one has the right to demand that SMY live an asc etic life and forego modern fac ilities, it was c ertainly not right for SMY to have treated Ren Ci’s funds the way he did in this c ase. However, it is public knowledge that SMY has risked life and limb in the muc h public ised efforts to raise funds for Ren Ci. He did not have to perform the dangerous stunts himself but c hose to do so nonetheless. The sc eptic would of c ourse sc off at his efforts as the manifestation of an egoistic , public ity-seeking man. That would be entirely unfair and unkind. How many among us are willing to undertake those risks to satisfy our egos? If some c omment sarc astic ally that the funds raised were abused by SMY anyway, it must be remembered that what has been proved in this c ase is that the amount of $50,000, and that amount only, was dispensed as an 


unauthorised loan. There are outstanding c harges against SMY but they are not the subjec t of this c ase and have not been proved. I emphasize that I c onsider the sentenc es in this c ase on only the fac ts adduc ed here and nothing beyond. I do not think it is disputed that the millions of dollars raised from public donations have been utilised by Ren Ci over the years for poor and c hronic ally ill people. 

94     In the sentenc ing proc ess, the c ourt is sometimes fac ed with the arduous task of dec iding the punishment for a dishonourable ac t c ommitted by an otherwise honourable person. In William Shakespeare’s _Julius Caesar_ , Mark Antony famously said: 

 The evil that men do lives after them, 

 The good is oft interred with their bones, 

 .... 

In my opinion, one wrongdoing does not have to be so overwhelming that the many good deeds are c ompletely forgotten and interred with the bones. Even the prosec ution has fairly and c orrec tly ac c epted that SMY did a lot of good for Ren Ci. 

95     While the DJ was c orrec t in noting that the c ourt has to balanc e the offender’s ac hievements against the seriousness of the offenc e (GD on Sentenc e at [19]), I think he ac c orded too little weight to SMY’s c ontributions to soc iety, in partic ular, the well-being of the poor and c hronic ally ill in Ren Ci. It was essentially a c ase of c riminal breac h of trust attended by the related offenc e of trying to mask the unauthorised loan and later by the offenc es of giving false information under the Ac t when the misdeed was being investigated. A c ustodial sentenc e is warranted here as there was no admission of the wrongdoing and efforts had been made by both SMY and RY to present a false pic ture to the authorities. The restitution of the $50,000 also c ame about only after the authorities started looking into Ren Ci’s rec ords. However, an aggregate of 10 months’ imprisonment for SMY, a sentenc e higher than that imposed on the rec ipient of the money who obviously was equally involved in the whole episode and whose c redentials were nowhere as sterling as SMY’s, appears to me to be manifestly exc essive. 

96     The false information c harges involved the “knowingly” limb rather than the “rec klessly” one. They are therefore more serious in nature. However, the c ulpability for SMY’s Third Charge and for SMY’s Fourth Charge are not really different – both c harges c onc ern giving false information under the Ac t , with the only distinc tion being the mode of suc h information. The latter was a c ontinuation of the earlier falsehood. The sentenc e in respec t of SMY’s Third Charge therefore should not be twic e that for SMY’s Fourth Charge. Ac c ordingly, I alter the imprisonment term for SMY’s Third Charge from 4 months to 2 months, the term imposed by the DJ for SMY’s Fourth Charge. 

97     Further, I order the imprisonment terms for SMY’s Sec ond Charge (4 months) and Third Charge (now 2 months) to run c onsec utively, making an aggregate of 6 months’ imprisonment. The imprisonment terms for the other two c harges (6 months and 2 months respec tively) are to run c onc urrently with the two c onsec utive terms. SMY’s appeal against sentenc e is therefore allowed in that the aggregate imprisonment term is now 6 instead of 10 months. 

**RY’s appeal against sentence** 

98     Counsel for RY submitted that the sentenc e passed by the DJ was manifestly exc essive as he had failed to ac c ord proper weight to the following mitigating fac tors: 


 (a) 

 (b) 

 (c ) 

 RY was a first time offender; 

 RY c ontributed signific antly to the Buddhist sc ene in Singapore and other jurisdic tions; and 

 RY’s good c harac ter, with several persons having provided letters of c harac ter referenc e attesting to this. 

99     One has to take into ac c ount the fac t that it was RY who asked for a loan and rec eived a benefit as a result of the offenc e. He and SMY then tried to c over up the wrongdoing. But for the investigations into Ren Ci’s ac c ounts, one wonders whether or when the loan would be repaid to Ren Ci. While RY was c onvic ted on only two c harges, the evidenc e showed that he was ac tively and c ompletely involved in the wrongdoing and attempted c over-up from beginning to end. He was also instrumental in getting the untrue BJJHS Letter even after his resignation from Ren Ci. Moreover, RY’s c ontributions to Ren Ci and to soc iety paled in c omparison with SMY’s. In view of these fac tors, it c ould not be said that the aggregate imprisonment term of nine months imposed by the DJ was unjustly severe. I therefore dismiss RY’s appeal against sentenc e. 

100    Finally, I thank all c ounsel involved in these appeals for their very helpful written and oral submissions.
