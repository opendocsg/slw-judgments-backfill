**Facts** 

This is an appeal against the dec ision of the Senior Assistant Registrar in whic h he dismissed the applic ation of the defendant bank for judgment against the plaintiff, Ow, under the c ounterc laim pursuant to O 27 r 3. The bank had c ounterc laimed against Ow for the repayment of the outstanding balanc es and interest in a fac ility. The bank applied for judgment on the basis that Ow had admitted that he was liable to the bank for the amount he had used to disc harge an overdraft fac ility. 

**Held, dismissing the appeal:** 

(1) Order 27 r 3 relates to admissions of fac t, whether in the pleadings or otherwise. If the liability turns on a question of law or mixed law and fac t, admissions of fac t alone c annot determine the matter (see 16); _Shunmugam Jayakumar v Jeyaretnam_ <span class="citation">[1997] 2 SLR 172</span> applied. 

(2) Although Ow had admitted to drawing down the sum in question, he had pleaded that the bank was prec luded from rec overing from him in view of the alleged breac hes of the Banking Ac t and MAS Notic es. If he is right on this issue, then he would not be liable. To give judgment for the bank against Ow would determine this issue (see 17). 

(3) In an applic ation under Order 27 r 3, the c ourt would only c onsider whether there is a c lear admission of any fac t that would entitle the other party to suc h judgment as he may be entitled to upon those admissions. The c ourt would not examine the likelihood of suc c ess of any pleading – unlike in an applic ation under Order 14. Order 27 r 3 is intended to provide an immediate judgment based on c lear admissions of fac t and there is no sc ope for any c onsideration of the verac ity of the pleadings unless it is c learly untenable (see 17); _Rankine v Garton Sons & Co_ Ltd [1979] 2 All ER 1185 applied.

## Judgment 

### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

1       This is an appeal against the dec ision of the Senior Assistant Registrar in SIC 602105/2001 in whic h he dismissed the applic ation of the Defendant ("the Bank") for judgment against the Plaintiff ("Ow") under the Bank’s c ounterc laim in the sum of $10,767,707.18 under O 27, r 3 of the Rules of Court. On 8 January 2002, after hearing c ounsel for the parties, I dismissed the Bank’s appeal with c osts. On 6 February the Bank filed a notic e of appeal against the whole of my dec ision and I now give my written grounds of dec ision. 

**Statement of Claim** 

2       The following are the salient points pleaded by Ow in his Statement of Claim. The Bank is inc orporated in Switzerland and has a branc h in Singapore. Ow had been a c ustomer of the Bank sinc e 23 April 1997, when he signed a Fac ility Agreement with the Bank in whic h he obtained a multic urrenc y overdraft fac ility of up to the equivalent of US$10 million ("the Fac ility"). At that time Ow had an overdraft ac c ount with the Bank of Americ a ("BOA"). The sole purpose of this exerc ise was to obtain a Singapore dollar loan at a lower rate of interest than what he was paying in his BOA overdraft. His dealings with the Bank were c onduc ted through Ho Yong Chong ("Ho"), an employee of the Bank at the material time. Prior to the opening of the Fac ility, Ho had represented to him that he c ould draw down on the Fac ility entirely in Singapore dollars notwithstanding that it was struc tured as a multi-c urrenc y fac ility. At all material times the Bank, through Ho, was fully aware that Ow wished to draw down on his loan in Singapore dollars in order to disc harge his outstanding BOA overdraft whic h was in Singapore dollars. The Fac ility, whic h was sec ured by a mortgage over his wife’s property, was opened in relianc e upon Ho’s representations. 

3       On 28 July 1997 Ow, intending to draw down on the Fac ility to fully disc harge his BOA overdraft whic h stood at approximately $10 million, went to see Ho about this. After c hec king with the Bank’s Credit Manager, Ho advised Ow that the Bank did not have suffic ient Singapore dollars at the time and only $3 million had been approved for drawdown. The balanc e sum c ould be drawn down in US dollars. Ho had represented to Ow at the time that, as the Bank was obliged to provide him with Singapore dollars under the Fac ility, it would shortly c onvert the US dollar drawdown into Singapore dollars. In relianc e of this assuranc e, Ow proc eeded with the drawdown partly in Singapore dollars and partly in US dollars and used it to disc harge the BOA overdraft whic h stood at $10,767,707.18. 


4       The Bank subsequently refused to c onvert the US dollar c omponent of the drawdown to Singapore dollars despite his repeated requests on various dates in 1997 and 1998. The Bank gave the reason that it did not have suffic ient Singapore dollars available to c onvert the whole of his drawings. When the 1997 ec onomic c rises hit in late 1997, Ow found that the amount purportedly outstanding in the foreign c urrenc y c omponent of his drawings inc reased dramatic ally. The Fac ility Agreement provided for the drawdown to be within 80% of the value of the mortgaged property. Due to the c urrenc y fluc tuation and falling property values, the Bank c onstantly pressured him to reduc e the overdraft to keep it within the limit. 

5       Ow further pleaded that another of the Bank’s offic ers, Davartz, had asked him to introduc e new c ustomers to the Bank. In partic ular Davartz asked whether he c ould meet Ow’s two sons, who were based in Johore Bahru, to disc uss the opening of a Share Trading Ac c ount. Ow arranged for them to meet in Johore Bahru on 25 September 1997. Thereafter Ow’s sons opened a Share Trading ac c ount with the Bank. Ow said that the express agreement or understanding was that this ac c ount would be separate and distinc t from his ac c ounts. The Bank subsequently reneged on that understanding and sought to treat the shares deposited by his sons as sec urity for the Fac ility. His sons applied in the Malaysian c ourts for an injunc tion restraining the Bank from disposing their shares to settle Ow’s debts. An injunc tion was granted. However the Bank breac hed the injunc tion and sold the shares in Oc tober 1999. This matter is the subjec t of legal proc eedings in Malaysia. 

6       On 29 July 1999 the Bank agreed to c onvert into Singapore dollars up to the equivalent of $ million of the foreign c urrenc y c omponent of the drawdown. The Bank refused to c onvert the entire foreign c urrenc y c omponent. However on 30 August 1999 the Bank agreed to full c onversion. 

7       On 1 September 1999 the Bank made a written demand for Ow to make full payment of the sums of about $11.15 million and 558 million. The Bank gave Ow two options, either pay the sum of US$1. million by 6 September, or sign a mandate to the Bank to authorise it to realise all assets deposited and c harged to it, without spec ifying what those assets were or whether they inc luded the shares deposited by his sons in respec t of their Share Trading Ac c ount. Ow did not ac c ept either option. The Bank’s solic itors, M/s Khattar Wong & Partners ("KWP"), sent a letter dated 8 September 1999 in whic h they gave notic e of termination of the Fac ility and demanded full payment of the sums set out above. 

8       On 8 Oc tober 1999 KWP wrote to Ow’s wife demanding payment of the said sums. On 20 Oc tober, KWP served a notic e on the mortgaged property requiring the oc c upiers to quit and deliver vac ant possession within one month. On 3 Dec ember 1999 the Bank c ommenc ed an ac tion in respec t of the mortgaged property in OS 1883/1999 in respec t of the following sums: 

 Princ ipal advanc ed up to 12 Oc tober 1999: 

### $19,743,516. 

 Princ ipal repaid: $ 3,867,554. Princ ipal outstanding on 3 Dec ember 1999: 

### $15,993,367. 

 Interest outstanding on 3 Dec ember 1999: 

### $ 37,595. 

 Total outstanding on 3 Dec ember 1999: 

### $16,030,962. 

9       Ow c laimed that he had suffered loss and damage arising from the Bank’s failure to provide him with Singapore dollars for his initial drawdown in July 1997 and its subsequent failure to c onvert the foreign c urrenc y c omponent to Singapore dollars. Ow prayed for a dec laration that he was only liable to pay the Bank an amount represented by the Singapore dollar equivalent of his first drawdown on 28 July 


1977 together with interest thereon less all sums paid into the ac c ount. 

10     On 4 July 2000 Ow amended the Statement of Claim to inc lude the pleading that in entering into the Fac ility Agreement, the Bank was in breac h of s 29(1)(a) of the Banking Ac t as well as Monetary Authority of Singapore ("MAS") Notic es 1001 and 1012 relating to limits on c redit fac ilities to a single borrower. This amendment was made after further disc overy by Ow’s solic itors of doc uments from the Bank. Ow pleaded that suc h breac h rendered the Fac ility Agreement illegal and this prec luded the Bank from making any c laim whatsoever against him in respec t of the Fac ility. He prayed for a dec laration that the Bank was prec luded from c laiming against him as a result of this breac h. 

**Defence and Counterclaim** 

11     The Bank pleaded as follows in its Defenc e and Counterc laim. The Fac ility Agreement was expressly stated to be a multi-c urrenc y ac c ount. Ho had not made any of the representations alleged by Ow. The Bank had no obligation under the Fac ility Agreement to obtain suffic ient Singapore dollars for Ow to drawdown on. All foreign c urrenc y drawdowns were made by Ow willingly and he had made use of the Fac ility to engage in c urrenc y spec ulation. 

12     In respec t of the alleged breac hes of the Banking Ac t and MAS Notic es, the Bank pleaded at no time had it c ommitted any suc h breac hes. 

13     The Bank c ounterc laimed against Ow for the repayment of the outstanding balanc es in the Fac ility whic h, on 14 Dec ember 1999 stood at $15,875,962.77 in respec t of the princ ipal and $170,374.69 in respec t of unpaid interest. The Bank also c laimed further interest from 14 Dec ember 1999 and expenses and legal c osts on an indemnity basis. 

**Application under O 27, r 3** 

14     The Bank’s present applic ation is under O 27, r 3 of the Rules of Court whic h provides as follows: 

 Judgment on admission of facts (O 27, r 3) 

3\. Where admissions of fac t are made by a party to a c ause or matter either by his pleadings or otherwise, any other party to the c ause or matter may apply to the Court for suc h judgment or order as upon those admissions he may be entitled to, without waiting for the determination of any other question between the parties, and the Court may give suc h judgment, or make suc h order, on the applic ation as it thinks just. 

15     Counsel for the Bank, Mr Tay, submitted that Ow had pleaded that he had drawn down the sum of $10,767,707.18 on 28 July 1997 to disc harge the BOA overdraft ac c ount. Therefore Ow had admitted that he was liable to the Bank for at least that sum. 

16     Order 27, r 3 relates to admissions of fac t, whether in the pleadings or otherwise. If the liability turns on a question of law or mixed law and fac t, admissions of fac t alone c annot determine the matter – see _Shunmugam Jayakumar v Jeyaretnam_ <span class="citation">[1997] 2 SLR 172</span> at 35 & 36. Therefore where a defendant admits to negligenc e but denies c ausation there is no admission of liability – see _Blundell v Rimmer_ [1971] 1 All ER 1072 whic h is approved by the Court of Appeal in _Rankine v Garton Sons & Co Ltd_ [1979] 2 All ER 1185. There must be _"a clear admission of facts in the face of which it is_ 


_impossible for the party making it to succeed"_ _per_ Sargant J. in _Ellis v Allen_ [1914] 1 Ch. 904 at p.909. In that c ase the defendant’s c ounsel was not able to show how, with the admissions made, the defendant would be able to suc c eed in defending the ac tion. Sargant J. gave judgment against the defendant saying (at p.909): 

 "I c annot c onc eive any c irc umstanc es whic h the defendant Allen c ould rely on as a defenc e to the ac tion, having regard to the admissions made by the letter, and I hold that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment against him under [this rule]" 

17     In the present c ase, although Ow had admitted to drawing down the sum in question he had, c ruc ially, pleaded that the Bank was prec luded from rec overing from him in view of the alleged breac hes of the Banking Ac t and MAS Notic es. If he is right on this issue, then he would not be liable. To give judgment for the Bank against Ow would determine this issue. In an applic ation under this rule the c ourt would only c onsider whether there is a c lear admission of any fac t that would entitle the other party to suc h judgment as he may be entitled to upon those admissions. The c ourt would not examine the likelihood of suc c ess of any pleading – unlike in an applic ation under O 14. Order 27, r 3 is intended to provide an immediate judgment based on c lear admissions of fac t and there is no sc ope for any c onsideration of the verac ity of the pleadings unless it is c learly untenable. In _Rankine v Garton Sons & Co Ltd_ , Stephenson LJ. said at p.1190: 

 "... the plaintiff is seeking immediate judgment on admissions of fac t, and under the express terms of the rule under whic h he seeks it the c ourt has to be satisfied that he is entitled to it, and to be entitled to it he has to prove both elements of his c ause of ac tion; and nothing short, it seems to me, of a c lear admission of liability, both of negligenc e c ausing the ac c ident and of damage resulting from the ac c ident c aused by the negligenc e, is enough to satisfy the requirements of the rule and to entitle him to judgment. If he c annot point to an admission in c lear terms of both the nec essary ingredients of his c ause of ac tion, he c annot get an interloc utory judgment. He must wait until the judge tries the issue of damages ..." 

18     In the premises, I dismissed the Bank’s appeal with c osts.
