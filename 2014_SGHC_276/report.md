**Lee Kim Shin JC:** 

**Introduction** 

1       The Singapore Swimming Club (“the Club”) represents itself as “The Premier Family Club” in Singapore. The objec ts of the Club are to promote and provide fac ilities for, amongst other ac tivities, swimming. In rec ent years however, the Club has found itself swimming in a sea of litigation. Exc luding the present proc eedings, all proc eedings c onnec ted with the subjec t matter of the present proc eedings and all proc eedings c ommenc ed in the State Courts, the Club has been named a party to seven unrelated sets of proc eedings in the High Court brought by members of the Club sinc e 2008. 

2       There must be something in the water. 

3       In the present proc eedings, Freddie Koh (“the Plaintiff”) c laims that he is entitled to be indemnified by the defendant, the Club, for all damages and litigation c osts inc urred by him in a defamation suit c ommenc ed against him in 2009. The Plaintiff’s c laim is based on a resolution passed in 2009 by the management c ommittee of the Club, of whic h the Plaintiff was then the President. I will refer to the management c ommittee of the Club as “the MC”. 

4       The Club denies that the Plaintiff is entitled to the indemnity whic h he c laims on various grounds. The Club also c ounterc laims for the rec overy of the sums that it had previously paid out pursuant to the aforesaid MC resolution. Its c ounterc laim is based on another set of resolutions passed at a member’s extraordinary general meeting held in 2012. 

5       Values, intentions and sentiments, however long established or firmly held, are aspec ts of 


human nature that may c hange over time. To the extent these aspec ts are expressed as polic ies or princ iples approved as resolutions of a legal entity, it follows that resolutions of suc h nature may be amended, revoked or c ompletely reversed to reflec t a c hange in thinking. This present dispute involves a c hange in an established polic y of the Club and the legal c onsequenc es that follow. 

6       I delivered oral judgment on 12 Dec ember 2014. These are my detailed grounds. 

**Background** 

**_Key players_** 

7       I first set out a list of the key persons involved in the present dispute. 

8       The Plaintiff’s tenure as President of the Club lasted from May 2008 to Marc h 2012. During this time, the c omposition of the MC c hanged. Two periods are signific ant. 

9       The first is the period between May 2008 and May 2009 when the MC c omprised the following 12 persons (“the 2008 MC”): 

 (a) the Plaintiff as President; 

 (b) Mic hael Ngu as Vic e-President; 

 (c ) Tan Wee Tin as Honorary Treasurer; and 

 (d) various other c ommittee members, namely, Eric Ng, Loreen Teo, William Kwok, Ng Kok Seong, Ashok Sharma, Shahul Hassan, Mike Chia, Theresa Kay and Gary Oon. 

10     The sec ond is the period between May 2011 and Marc h 2012 when the MC c omprised the following 11 persons (“the 2011 MC”): 

 (a) the Plaintiff as President; 

 (b) David Poh as Vic e-President; 

 (c ) Tan Wee Tin as Honorary Treasurer; and 

 (d) various other c ommittee members, namely, Eric Ng, Loreen Teo, William Kwok, Ng Kok Seong, Soh Kee Hoc k, Lim Khee Lim, Jane Loh and Andy Tang. 

11     The other key persons in the dispute are: 

 (a) Chua Hoe Sing, the Club’s c urrent President; 

 (b) Khoo Boo Beng (“BB Khoo”), a former general manager of the Club; and 

 (c ) Jennifer Wee, the Club’s financ ial c ontroller from 31 January 2008 to the present. 

12     In the present proc eedings, the Plaintiff was represented by Mr Paul Seah (“Mr Seah”). Mr Tan Chee Meng SC (“Mr Tan”) represented the Club. 

13     The c onstitutional doc ument of the Club whic h sets out, _inter alia_ , the powers of the MC, is 


known as the Rules of the Club, and will hereafter be referred to as “the Club’s Rules”. 

**_The defamation suit_** 

14     The present proc eedings have their origins in Suit 33 of 2009 (“Suit 33”). This was a defamation ac tion c ommenc ed in the High Court against the Plaintiff by four members of the MC that prec eded the 2008 MC (respec tively “the Suit 33 Plaintiffs” and “the 2007 MC”). The alleged defamation arose from two statements made by the Plaintiff at separate MC meetings, whic h were subsequently published on the Club’s notic e board in Oc tober and November 2008. 

15     The thrust of these statements c onc erned the 2007 MC’s dec ision to purc hase a new water system for the Club’s swimming pools. In making the purc hase, the 2007 MC had relied on a provision in the Club’s Financ e Operating Manual (“the FOM”), whic h allowed the MC to approve unbudgeted expenditure on the basis of it being an “emergenc y” before having the expenditure ratified at the next Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Club. 

16     The 2008 MC was elec ted at the Club’s AGM on 25 May 2008 (“the 2008 AGM”). When the expenditure for the water system was put forward for ratific ation at the 2008 AGM, a motion was instead c arried for a Spec ial AdHoc Audit Committee (“the Audit Committee”) to be formed to investigate the said expenditure. The Audit Committee later submitted its report to the 2008 MC. The Audit Committee found that the expenditure was of an emergenc y nature and that the 2007 MC had not breac hed any Club proc edures. 

17     Subsequently, the Honorary Treasurer of the 2008 MC, Tan Wee Tin, found several doc uments whic h were not disc losed to the Audit Committee. These doc uments c ontained information whic h was inc onsistent with representations made by the 2007 MC at the 2008 AGM. After further investigations, Tan Wee Tin reported his findings at two MC meetings on 29 Oc tober and 26 November 2008. 

18     At the MC meeting on 29 Oc tober 2008, the Plaintiff made the first statement suggesting that the 2008 MC should c orrec t a “misrepresentation of the fac ts made by the [2007 MC] to influenc e the ratific ation of the expenditure at the [2008 AGM]”. At the subsequent MC meeting on 26 November 2008, the Plaintiff made the sec ond statement whic h c onsisted of several allegations inc luding that, “[i]t c ould be a c ase of misrepresentation of fac ts to the [2008 AGM] to get ratific ation for a c apital expenditure for a water system that c ould not be justified under the urgent/emergenc y reason”. 

19     Both the first and sec ond statements were rec orded in the minutes of the respec tive MC meetings whic h were then published on the Club’s notic e board, in ac c ordanc e with Club prac tic e. 

20     On 22 Dec ember 2008, the Suit 33 Plaintiffs, through their solic itors, WongPartnership LLP (“WongPartnership”), sent a letter of demand to the Plaintiff. The letter of demand alleged that the statements made by the Plaintiff were defamatory of the Suit 33 Plaintiffs. It was further alleged that the Plaintiff had falsely and malic iously defamed the Suit 33 Plaintiffs. It was demanded that the Plaintiff, amongst other things, apologise and undertake not to repeat the defamatory statements and c ompensate the Suit 33 Plaintiffs for the damage to their reputation. 

**_Events preceding the 14 January 2009 MC meeting_** 

21     On 23 Dec ember 2008, BB Khoo, ac ting on Eric Ng’s instruc tions, emailed the Club’s insuranc e brokers, Ac c laim Insuranc e Brokers Pte Ltd (“Ac c laim”), to enquire whether the Plaintiff’s c ase would be c overed by the Club’s existing Direc tors & Offic ers Liability Insuranc e Polic y (“the insuranc e polic y”) that had just been renewed in Oc tober 2008. Eric Ng was then the Rules and Membership 


Chairman of the 2008 MC. On 26 Dec ember 2008, Ac c laim replied to state that the insurer had not determined the polic y liability. 

22     On 29 Dec ember 2009, Ac c laim sent another email to BB Khoo to highlight that the Plaintiff’s c ase might fall within the “Insured v Insured” exc lusion c lause under the insuranc e polic y (“the Insured v Insured Exc lusion”). The effec t of the Insured v Insured Exc lusion was that the insuranc e polic y would not c over a c ase where both the party suing and the party being sued fell within the definition of an “insured” person under the polic y. Ac c laim noted in its email that the definition of “insured” c overed all past, present and future MC members, and therefore, the Plaintiff and the Suit 33 Plaintiffs would both fall under that definition. 

23     BB Khoo forwarded Ac c laim’s email to Eric Ng and the Plaintiff on 30 Dec ember 2008. On the same day, Eric Ng replied to BB Khoo stating as follows: 

 We would let the members know that in this instanc e the Club would not be c overed by its insuranc e polic y bec ause this is an ac tion taken against the present MC by the previous one. It is fully understandable that the polic y would exc lude suc h ac tions. Regardless of the insuranc e c over the Club would still have to defend its MC. 

 It is good to let the members know who is wasting their money. 

24     On 12 January 2009, Suit 33 was filed against the Plaintiff. The Suit 33 Plaintiffs’ princ ipal c laim was that the Plaintiff had falsely and malic iously made the statements whic h were defamatory of them. In his defenc e, the Plaintiff denied that the meaning of the statements were defamatory. Even if they were, the Plaintiff averred that they were justified. 

25     On 13 January 2009, the insurer wrote to Ac c laim to state its position that the Plaintiff’s c ase fell within the Insured v Insured Exc lusion. On the same day, Ac c laim forwarded a c opy of the insurer’s letter to BB Khoo and the Plaintiff via email. 

26     In the midst of these events, the Plaintiff, Eric Ng and another 2008 MC member, William Kwok, met with Mr Hri Kumar Nair SC of Drew & Napier LLP (“D&N”) regarding the Plaintiff’s representation in Suit 33. The Plaintiff, Eric Ng and William Kwok agreed that Mr Nair should be engaged to ac t for the Plaintiff. Pertinently, however, D&N required the Club to c onfirm that it would indemnify the Plaintiff for his legal c osts in Suit 33 before D&N would agree to ac t for him. 

**_The passing of the Indemnity Resolution_** 

27     An MC meeting was held on 14 January 2009 (“the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting”). During this meeting, the 2008 MC first disc ussed the issue of the Club’s insuranc e c overage under its renewed polic y. Suit 33 was disc ussed next. The latter disc ussion was c onc erned, in partic ular, with the issue of whether the Club should c over its MC members in the event that they were sued for ac ts done in their c apac ity as MC members. The 2008 MC then unanimously adopted and approved the following resolution: 

 After some disc ussion, MC affirmed that the Club will assume all and any liability in the defense of and awards against any member of the Management Committee (“MC”) inc luding but not limited to defense c osts, legal c osts and expenses inc luding inc identals in respec t of any legal ac tion, demand or c laim brought against the Management Committee (whether in part or whole) as a result of the MC or individual MC member disc harging its, his or her duties and responsibilities for and on behalf of the Club as offic e bearers inc luding any c laims for any errors and omissions 


 resulting from the disc harge of its, his or her said duties and responsibilities 

Both parties in the present proc eedings referred to this resolution as the “Indemnity Resolution”. I will retain this term in these grounds. 

28     It should be noted that there are two key disputes of fac t in these proc eedings regarding the c irc umstanc es under whic h the Indemnity Resolution was passed: 

 (a) The first c onc erns a letter whic h was sent to the Club by 10 Club members on 14 January 2009, just before the MC meeting held on the same date (“the 14 January 2009 Members Letter”). In that letter, the 10 Club members expressed the view that the Club should not be liable for the tortious ac ts of its MC members; and that Club funds should not be used to pay for the Plaintiff’s legal c osts, expenses or damages in Suit 33. The 10 Club members also asked that their letter be forwarded to the 2008 MC. It is disputed whether this was in fac t done. 

 (b) The sec ond c onc erns the Insured v Insured Exc lusion under the Club’s insuranc e polic y. The parties disputed whether this exc lusion was disc ussed at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting and whether the 2008 MC, apart from the Plaintiff and Eric Ng, knew of this exc lusion before adopting the Indemnity Resolution. 

29     The minutes of the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting, whic h c ontained the Indemnity Resolution, were put up on the Club’s notic e board. Thereafter, the Club proc eeded to pay various sums in relation to the Plaintiff’s defenc e in Suit 33 and the further proc eedings prec ipitated by it. In this regard, when payments were to be made, the Plaintiff would generally forward the relevant invoic e to Jennifer Wee, the Club’s financ ial c ontroller. Jennifer Wee would then prepare the nec essary c heque or c ashier’s order for Tan Wee Tin’s approval, as Honorary Treasurer, in ac c ordanc e with the Club’s FOM. 

**_OS 469 The challenge to the Indemnity Resolution_** 

30     On 22 April 2009, a member of the Club, Poh Pai Chin, filed Originating Summons No 469 of 2009 (“OS 469”) against the 2008 MC members who had passed the Indemnity Resolution, with the exc eption of Gary Oon, Theresa Kay and Mike Chia. The Club was later joined as a defendant on 3 August 2009. 

31     Poh Pai Chin sought: 

 (a) a dec laration that on a proper interpretation of the Club’s Rules, Club funds c ould not be used to pay the Plaintiff’s legal c osts in Suit 33; 

 (b) a dec laration that the Indemnity Resolution was void and ultra vires the Club’s Rules; 

 (c ) a dec laration that the defendants’ authorisation for Club funds to be used to pay the Plaintiff’s legal c osts in Suit 33 was void and ultra vires the Club’s Rules; 

 (d) an order that the defendants repay the Club all the funds whic h had been used to pay the Plaintiff’s legal c osts in Suit 33; and 

 (e) an order that the defendants be restrained from using Club funds to pay the Plaintiff’s legal c osts in Suit 33. 

32     Without diving too deep into the fac ts of OS 469, it is important to note that one of the main 


fac tual issues whic h surfac ed in OS 469 related to the 14 January 2009 Members Letter. In this regard, Gary Oon filed an affidavit on Poh Pai Chin’s behalf, deposing that the letter had not been c irc ulated at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting, and that he would not have authorised the use of the Club’s funds for the Plaintiff’s defenc e in Suit 33 had the letter been made known to him. Against this, Ashok Sharma and BB Khoo filed affidavits for the defendants in whic h they both deposed that the letter was c irc ulated at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. Ashok Sharma also deposed that the Indemnity Resolution was passed _because_ the Club was not c overed by insuranc e in respec t of the Plaintiff’s defenc e in Suit 33. He stated that the Club had obtained insuranc e c overage in furtheranc e of the Club’s longstanding polic y to indemnify the Club and its offic e bearers in respec t of legal proc eedings taken against them. However, the insuranc e polic y c ontained the Insured v Insured Exc lusion, whic h exc luded any insuranc e c overage for Suit 33. Pursuant to the Club’s polic y of indemnifying offic e bearers, the 2008 MC therefore passed the Indemnity Resolution in ac c ordanc e with their powers. 

33     OS 469 was dismissed by the High Court on 24 August 2009 without written grounds being issued. Poh Pai Chin did not appeal. 

**_The 2009 AGM_** 

34     The Club’s members were informed about OS 469 at the Club’s AGM on 24 May 2009 (“the 2009 AGM”). This arose in the c ontext of a motion to refer Gary Oon and Theresa Kay to the Club’s Disc iplinary Committee for writing to Poh Pai Chin’s solic itors in c onnec tion with OS 469. The c omplaint in the motion was that Gary Oon and Theresa Kay had, without first c onsulting with the other 2008 MC members, informed Poh Pai Chin’s solic itors that they had both not authorised the use of Club funds for the Plaintiff’s defenc e in Suit 33 when the 2008 MC had, in fac t, unanimously passed the Indemnity Resolution. 

35     During the disc ussion of this motion at the 2009 AGM, the Plaintiff informed the Club’s members that it had always been the Club’s prac tic e and polic y to use Club funds to defend its MC members if they were sued in the c ourse of disc harging their duties and responsibilities. Gary Oon took the c onverse position and told the members that defamation was a voluntary ac t and c ould not be said to have been done in the disc harge of duties as an MC member. He therefore said that defamation should not be c overed by Club funds. 

36     Thereafter, a member of the Club, Mr Rajsingham, proposed a motion that the general meeting re-affirm the Indemnity Resolution in the following terms: 

 That the House affirms the Management Committee’s resolution that the Club indemnifies all Management Committee members, Sub Committee members, Disc iplinary Panel/Committee members, and Ad Hoc Committee members who, in the disc harge of their duties and responsibilities for and on behalf of the c lub are sued, the Club funds will be used to defend them, an indemnity whic h has been the prac tic e of the Club. 

The minutes of the 2009 AGM show that a vote was taken, there were no objec tions and the general meeting unanimously adopted the re-affirmation of the Indemnity Resolution. 

37     However, the Suit 33 Plaintiffs and two other members of the Club c hallenged the re-affirmation of the Indemnity Resolution at the 2009 AGM in Originating Summons No 826 of 2009. The High Court found the re-affirmation to be null and void on the ground that it was not a matter spec ified on the agenda for the 2009 AGM and that this amounted to a breac h of the Club’s Rules. 

**_The 2010 AGM_** 


**_The 2010 AGM_** 

38     The Indemnity Resolution again c ame up for disc ussion at the Club’s AGM on 23 May 2010 (“the 2010 AGM”). Prior to the 2010 AGM, the Club’s 2009/2010 Annual Report was distributed to the Club members. The Club’s audited ac c ounts for the financ ial year ending 31 January 2010, whic h were exhibited in the 2009/2010 Annual Report, indic ated that the Club had spent $508,000 on legal and professional fees during that financ ial year. 

39     This prompted two members, namely, Franc es Wong and Chew Siong Lim, to request a breakdown of this expenditure item at the 2010 AGM. The minutes of the 2010 AGM state that the breakdown was projec ted on the sc reen during this AGM. It showed that the bulk of the expenditure, in the sum of $403,000, had gone towards the Plaintiff’s defenc e in Suit 33. 

40     Thereafter, the use of the Club’s funds for the Plaintiff’s defenc e in Suit 33 was debated in some detail by the members at the 2010 AGM. It is rec orded that the following was explained to the members: 

 (a) a further $350,000 had been set aside in the Club’s budget for use in Suit 33 for the financ ial year ending 31 January 2011; 

 (b) in the event that the Club (or to be more ac c urate, the Plaintiff ) lost Suit 33, the Club would have to bear the total c osts and damages itself bec ause it was not c overed by insuranc e; and 

 (c ) it would be diffic ult to predic t what the total c osts of the Plaintiff’s defenc e in Suit 33 would be. 

After this debate, the Annual Report and Ac c ounts were c onfirmed and adopted by the members without objec tions. 

**_The High Court judgment in Suit 33_** 

41     Suit 33 was dismissed by the High Court on 29 Oc tober 2010, with written grounds reported as _Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and others v Koh Sin Chong Freddie_ <span class="citation">[2010] SGHC 324</span>. By its dec ision, the High Court found that the statements made by the Plaintiff were defamatory of the Suit 33 Plaintiffs based on their natural and ordinary meaning. However, the High Court found that the Plaintiff had justified the gist of the defamatory sting. The parties in Suit 33 filed appeals against those parts of the High Court’s dec ision whic h were adverse to them, the Suit 33 Plaintiffs’ appeal being Civil Appeal No 210 of 2013 and the Plaintiff’s appeal being Civil Appeal No 213 of 2013 (c ollec tively, “the Suit 33 Appeals”). 

**_The 2011 AGM_** 

42     As was done previously, the Club’s 2010/2011 Annual Report was distributed to the Club’s members prior to the Club’s AGM on 22 May 2011 (“the 2011 AGM”). Notably, under the part of the report dealing with the Club’s financ es, Tan Wee Tin updated the members on the c osts that the Club had inc urred in relation to Suit 33. It was noted that the Plaintiff’s defenc e in Suit 33 had c ost the Club $920,370 up to 31 January 2011. The report also set out the bac kground to Suit 33 and summarised the High Court’s dec ision. The notes to the financ ial statements for the financ ial year ended 31 January 2011 also indic ated that the Club had spent $551,000 on legal and professional fees during that financ ial year. 


43     It appears from the minutes that there was no disc ussion relating to Suit 33 at the 2011 AGM. However, as the members had done in the previous year, the Annual Report and Ac c ounts were c onfirmed and adopted without objec tions. 

**_The CA Judgment in Suit 33_** 

44     The Court of Appeal’s judgment for the Suit 33 Appeals was delivered on 21 November 2011. Its written grounds c an be found in _Chan Cheng Wah Bernard v Koh Sin Chong Freddie and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2012] 1 SLR 506</span> (“the CA Judgment”). The Court of Appeal allowed the Suit 33 Plaintiffs’ appeal and dismissed the Plaintiff’s c ross-appeal. The Court of Appeal found that the statements were defamatory and had not been justified. 

45     The Court of Appeal then went on to c onsider whether the statements were made on an oc c asion of qualified privilege, even though the issue was not c anvassed in the Suit 33 Appeals. The Court of Appeal found that the statements were made on an oc c asion of qualified privilege, but that this defenc e was defeated by the Plaintiff’s malic e in making the statements. On the issue of malic e, the Court of Appeal observed that: 

 65 ...Notwithstanding the fac t that the Audit Committee had exonerated the [2007 MC] of any wrongdoing in relation to the expenditure and had maintained its stand even after the Treasurer had drawn its attention to the doc uments found in the offic e of the Previous GM, [the Plaintiff ] c ontinued his “witc h-hunt”. This whole episode smac ked of nit-pic king or fault-finding, or worse, that [the Plaintiff ] had an agenda of his own against [the Suit 33 Plaintiffs], c ulminating in the utteranc e of the two statements whic h are the subjec t of the present defamation suit. 

 ... 

 94 ...[N]otwithstanding that the Audit Committee c harged by the 2008 AGM to look into the expenditure had exonerated the [2007 MC], [the Plaintiff ] and the rest of the [2008 MC] were determined to embark on a “witc h-hunt” against the [Suit 33 Plaintiffs] by c onduc ting their own investigations into the expenditure, and repeatedly beseec hing the Audit Committee to amend the Audit Report, despite the Audit Committee’s repeated refusal to do so... it is evident that the [2008 MC], inc luding [the Plaintiff ], had, from the beginning, dec ided to indic t the [Suit 33 Plaintiffs] of wrongdoing, and was determined to proc eed to do so themselves when they failed to persuade the Audit Committee to their position. 

 ... 

 96 ...[W]e are satisfied that [the Plaintiff’s] dominant motive for publishing the Statements was to injure [the Suit 33 Plaintiffs], whether out of personal spite or as follow-up ac tions after having made ratific ation of the expenditure an elec tion issue during the 2008 AGM. Indeed, there is overwhelming evidenc e that [the Plaintiff ] was determined, on the pretext that the expenditure was irregular, to soil the reputation of [the Suit 33 Plaintiffs] in the eyes of the members of the Club. Therefore the defenc e of qualified privilege is not available to [the Plaintiff ] on ac c ount of malic e. 

**_Events following the CA Judgment_** 

_The re-affirmations of the Indemnity Resolution_ 

46     Shortly after the CA Judgment was delivered, a spec ial c onfidential MC meeting was c onvened, 


on 14 Dec ember 2011, to disc uss the verdic t in the Suit 33 Appeals (“the 14 Dec ember Spec ial Meeting”). It should be noted that the MC’s c omposition at this time was different from when the Indemnity Resolution was passed (see [9]–[10] above), in that five members of the 2011 MC were not in the 2008 MC. Only six members of the 2011 MC attended this meeting as the other five were overseas, on medic al leave, or in the Plaintiff’s c ase, exc used from attending bec ause the subjec t matter of the meeting related to him. 

47     During the 14 Dec ember Spec ial Meeting, it was noted that D&N had asked the Club to rec onfirm its indemnity to the Plaintiff should they be asked to represent the Plaintiff in the hearing on assessment of damages for Suit 33. The 2011 MC was of the view that there was no need to provide a further indemnity. It was noted that the Indemnity Resolution remained in effec t and the Club’s ability to provide suc h an indemnity had been upheld when c hallenged in OS 469. Further, the 2011 MC unanimously agreed that the Club should provide an indemnity to all members who served on the MC or its sub-c ommittees. 

48     On 19 Dec ember 2011, a further spec ial c onfidential MC meeting was c onvened. This time, 10 of the 11 members of the 2011 MC attended. The 2011 MC members, with the exc eption of the Plaintiff who was exc used from attending on this item, were asked to c onfirm their agreement with the dec isions and ac tions taken at the 14 Dec ember Spec ial Meeting. They did so unanimously. 

49     On 18 January 2012, the Club rec eived a requisition for an Extraordinary General Meeting (“the EOGM”) from 538 Club members. The requisition was for the purpose of passing the following three resolutions (c ollec tively, “the EOGM Resolutions”): 

 (a) that the Club seeks return from the Plaintiff of all monies paid by the Club inc luding legal c osts and expenses arising out of or in c onnec tion with Suit 33 and the Suit 33 Appeals; 

 (b) that no Club funds be authorised to pay for the legal c osts, expenses and/or damages arising out of or in c onnec tion with Suit 33 and the Suit 33 Appeals; and 

 (c ) that the members have no c onfidenc e in the Plaintiff. 

50     The requisition for the EOGM had been sparked off by the CA Judgment. In partic ular, the requisitioning members noted the Court of Appeal’s finding that the Plaintiff had ac ted with malic e and took the view that the statements made by the Plaintiff c ould not be said to have been made in the disc harge of his duties as an offic e bearer of the Club. Henc e, it was asserted that the Club was not bound to pay the legal c osts and damages oc c asioned by Suit 33. 

51     On the very same day that the Club rec eived the requisition for the EOGM, a spec ial c onfidential MC meeting was c onvened on an urgent basis. Having disc ussed the requisition, the 2011 MC dec ided to re-affirm the Indemnity Resolution. The minutes of the meeting state that: 

 2.5 [The Plaintiff ] invited MC members to express their views on the requisition for the EOGM. The MC viewed that the Indemnity Resolution remained legally valid. At the Spec ial Confidential MC Meeting held on 18 January 2012, the MC was unanimous in upholding the princ iple of the Club to indemnify all c ommittee members if they are sued in the c ourse of duty to the Club. The MC reaffirmed the validity of the indemnity resolution on 14 January 2009 that the Club pays for the defense of [the Plaintiff ] in the Defamation Suit 33. The MC was unanimous in that they did not support the three resolutions proposed by the requisitions. 

_The payment of $1,021,793._ 


52     On 14 February 2012, whic h was after the EOGM was requisitioned but before the EOGM was held, the Club made payment of $1,021,793.48 to the Suit 33 Plaintiffs for their c osts in Suit 33 and the Suit 33 Appeals. The events leading to this payment are not really disputed and may be briefly stated as follows. 

 (a) On 31 January 2012, the Plaintiff’s then solic itors, Bajwa & Co, sent a letter to the Plaintiff and the Club to inform them of the outc ome of the taxation of the Suit 33 Plaintiffs’ c osts in Suit 33 and the Suit 33 Appeals. The Plaintiff forwarded this email to the rest of the 2011 MC on 2 February 2012. 

 (b) On 3 February 2012, WongPartnership sent a letter to Bajwa & Co to demand payment of the Suit 33 Plaintiffs’ c osts. Bajwa & Co forwarded this letter to the Plaintiff on 10 February 2012 via email. Bajwa & Co’s advic e in their email was in the following terms: 

 ... 

 4) As there is no stay of the c ost order, the said sums are payable otherwise will keep mounting. 

 5) Sinc e we are not reviewing the appeal c ost, there is no reason not to pay it now. 

 6) For the trial c osts we have file [sic ] for review but even then there is no harm in paying now and getting a refund if the amount is reduc e [sic ]. 

 7) We will leave it to you to dec ide. 

 (c ) The Plaintiff, in turn, forwarded Bajwa & Co’s email to Tan Wee Tin and Jennifer Wee on 13 February 2012. The Plaintiff indic ated in the email to Jennifer Wee that: 

 ... 

 As the amounts are due on 31 January 2012, and interest is payable, we should take the lawyer’s advic e and settle the amounts payable now to avoid ac c ruing interest. 

 We c an still get a refund for the trial c osts if we suc c eed to get the c osts reduc ed subsequently at the appeal. 

 Please c onsult with the Treasurer on this matter and if payment is to be made, on booking into whic h ac c ount payment year sinc e the payment was due on 31 January 2012, ie in the last financ ial year. 

 (d) On 13 February 2012, Tan Wee Tin reminded Jennifer Wee to make the payment as soon as possible to avoid ac c ruing interest. The next day, Jennifer Wee rec eived an email from Eric Ng suggesting that the monies be put in esc row pending the outc ome of the review of taxation. Eric Ng’s c onc ern was that there might have been c ollec tion issues between the Club and the Suit 33 Plaintiffs should the c osts order be subsequently varied by the c ourt. However, as Jennifer Wee did not rec eive further instruc tions to hold bac k the c heque, she prepared a payment vouc her and a c heque for $1,021,793.48 whic h was approved and signed by Tan Wee Tin on the same day. 

_The EOGM_ 


53     The EOGM was held on 4 Marc h 2012 and the EOGM Resolutions were passed. The Club thereafter c eased paying further sums in respec t of the Plaintiff’s legal c osts and damages in Suit 33 and the Suit 33 Appeals. Instead, the Plaintiff paid the outstanding sums personally. 

_Events after the EOGM_ 

54     Subsequently, two further matters arising from Suit 33 and the Suit 33 Appeals c ame to be heard by the High Court. First, the review of the taxation of the c osts of trial in Suit 33 was heard on 30 Marc h 2012. It was ordered that c osts be taxed down suc h that the Plaintiff was to pay $602, (and GST on this sum) to the Suit 33 Plaintiffs. Following that, the assessment of damages in Suit 33 was heard on 15 May 2012. The High Court eventually ordered that the Plaintiff pay $420,000 in damages to the Suit 33 Plaintiffs plus c osts of $18,000 for the assessment hearing; its grounds of dec ision c an be found in _Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and others v Koh Sin Chong Freddie_ [2012] SGHC 

193\. Both the Plaintiff and the Suit 33 Plaintiffs filed appeals, Civil Appeal No 63 of 2012 and Civil Appeal No 68 of 2012 respec tively, against the assessment of damages. 

55     On 18 June 2012, the Suit 33 Plaintiffs issued a statutory demand against the Plaintiff for the sum of $440,168.69, being the sum of $420,000 awarded in damages plus the $18,000 awarded for the c osts of the assessment hearing plus interest up till 18 June 2012. The Plaintiff thereafter filed Originating Summons (Bankruptc y) No 35 of 2012/Q (“OSB 35”) on 29 June 2012 to set aside the statutory demand. The Plaintiff also applied for a stay of the exec ution of the High Court’s orders in Suit 33 pending his appeal to the Court of Appeal against the High Court’s assessment of damages. The stay was granted on 31 August 2012 on c ondition that the Plaintiff furnish $300,000 as sec urity. OSB 35 was subsequently withdrawn by c onsent, with the Plaintiff paying $400 in c osts to the Suit 33 Plaintiffs. 

56     Civil Appeal Nos 63 and 68 of 2012 were heard on 18 Marc h 2013. On appeal, the Court of Appeal varied the High Court’s orders as follows: 

 (a) the Plaintiff was to pay the Suit 33 Plaintiffs $200,000 in damages, with interest on the said sum to run from the date of assessment in the High Court to the date of payment at the rate of 3% per annum; 

 (b) eac h party was to bear his own c osts for the appeals as well as for the assessment of damages in the High Court; 

 (c ) the c osts of the trial for Suit 33 was fixed at $200,000 plus disbursements fixed at $80,000; 

 (d) the c osts of the Suit 33 Appeals was fixed at $45,000 inc lusive of disbursements, to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Suit 33 Plaintiffs; and 

 (e) the surplus amount paid by the Plaintiff for the c osts of Suit 33 was to be refunded to the Plaintiff with interest at the rate of 3% per annum to run from the date the money was paid to the date it was refunded. 

**The present action** 

57     The present ac tion has its origins in two separate ac tions, namely, Originating Summons No 309 of 2012 (“OS 309”), filed by the Plaintiff against the Club on 28 Marc h 2012, and Suit No 510 of 2012/X (“Suit 510”), filed by the Club against the Plaintiff on 18 June 2012. Pursuant to orders made 


by an Assistant Registrar on 27 July 2012, OS 309 was c onverted into a writ ac tion and c onsolidated with Suit 510 to c omprise the present suit, Suit No 634 of 2012 (“Suit 634”). 

58     In Suit 634, the Plaintiff makes three princ ipal c laims for relief: 

 (a) a dec laration that the Indemnity Resolution is valid and binds the Club; 

 (b) a dec laration that the EOGM Resolutions are ineffec tual to vary and/or alter the Plaintiff’s right to be indemnified under the Indemnity Resolution for c osts and damages inc urred by him in respec t of Suit 33 and its related ac tions; and 

 (c ) an order that the Club pay the Plaintiff the sum of $248,900.91 and the c osts and expenses of defending OSB 35 (see [55] above) pursuant to the Indemnity Resolution. 

The sum of $248,900.91 in item (c ) above c omprises sums whic h the Plaintiff personally paid in respec t of his legal c osts and damages in Suit 33 and its related proc eedings, that is, $41,010.50 in legal fees paid to Bajwa & Co and $200,000 in damages paid to the Suit 33 plaintiffs plus interest at $7,890.41. 

59     The Club denies that the Plaintiff is entitled to the relief he c laims. In addition, the Club c ounterc laims for the sum of $1,520,685.44 (and pre-judgment interest on this sum at 5.33% per annum from 18 June 2012) c omprising: 

 (a) $1,033,810.35 paid prior to the CA Judgment delivered on 21 November 2011; and 

 (b) $486,875.09 paid after the CA Judgment delivered on 21 November 2011. 

These c omprise various sums paid by the Club in respec t of the Plaintiff’s legal c osts in Suit 33 and its related proc eedings. 

**Issues** 

60     Based on parties’ arguments, the issues before me broadly are as follows: 

 (a) the effec t of the EOGM Resolutions on the Indemnity Resolution; 

 (b) whether the Indemnity Resolution is void or voidable for material non-disc losure; 

 (c ) whether the Indemnity Resolution is voidable for breac h of fiduc iary duties by the Plaintiff and/or the other MC members; and 

 (d) whether the Club had paid the Plaintiff’s legal c osts under a mistake. 

**The Effect of the EOGM Resolutions on the Indemnity Resolution** 

**_The legal character of the Indemnity Resolution_** 

61     Before turning to the parties’ arguments proper, there is a preliminary issue whic h needs to be addressed. This c onc erns the legal c harac ter of the Indemnity Resolution, and more spec ific ally, whether the Indemnity Resolution is a c ontrac t as between the Plaintiff and the Club. Neither party addressed this issue squarely; although both parties at some point in submissions seemed to suggest that the Indemnity Resolution did have c ontrac tual forc e. 


62     As will bec ome evident below, the legal c harac ter of the Indemnity Resolution is important in two respec ts: 

 (a) The first relates to whether the Club c ould revoke the Indemnity Resolution by way of the EOGM Resolutions. 

 (b) The sec ond relates to the princ iples to be applied in the interpretation of the Indemnity Resolution. 

63     In analysing this preliminary issue, it is helpful to first c onsider the Club’s legal personality. 

64     The Club is an uninc orporated assoc iation and it is not a legal entity in and of itself. The Club is instead a c reature of the c ontrac t as between its members, and whic h is enc apsulated in the Club’s Rules: see _In re Sick and Funeral Society of St John’s Sunday School, Golcar_ [1973] Ch 51 at 60; _McGuire Graeme and others v Rasmussen John and others_ <span class="citation">[1998] 1 SLR(R) 892</span> at [13]; _Petrie Christopher Harrisson v Jones Alan and others_ <span class="citation">[2005] 2 SLR(R) 387</span> (“ _Petrie Christopher Harrisson_ ”) at [18]. The Club’s Rules govern the relationship between the members and define their rights, duties and liabilities. 

65     Given the private nature of the c ontrac t between the members, it has been observed that an uninc orporated assoc iation is run by the members for the members, with no outside c ontrol: see David Ashton and Paul W Reid, _Ashton and Reid on Club Law_ (Jordans, 2005) (“ _Ashton and Reid on Club Law_ ”) at para 1-09. However, it is c ommonly the c ase that the general management and the day-today operations of an uninc orporated assoc iation are left to a c ommittee. Taking the example of the present c ase, the MC manages the Club pursuant to Rule 21(a)(i) of the Club’s Rules. Rule 21(j), in turn, defines the MC’s powers in the following terms: 

 The Management Committee shall have the power to set and dec ide on all polic ies and matters relating to the Club. The Management Committee may not ac t c ontrary to the dec isions of the General Meeting made in ac c ordanc e with the rules in this Constitution and always remains subordinate to the General Meetings. The day-to-day administration of the Club shall be delegated to the General Manager and his Management Team. 

66     In this regard, the power exerc ised by the c ommittee of an uninc orporated assoc iation is a _delegated power_. In other words, the right of eac h and every voting member to dec ide how the uninc orporated assoc iation is to be managed and run is vested in the c ommittee. To this end, c ommittee members are c onsidered to be agents or servants of their assoc iations, and therefore, responsible to and subjec t to the c ontrol of the members of the assoc iation. Flowing from this, it is axiomatic that the c ommittee is to exerc ise its powers for the benefit of the uninc orporated assoc iation as a whole: _Woodford and another v Smith and another_ [1970] 1 WLR 806 at 816. I should also note that it was c ommon ground in these proc eedings that the MC owes fiduc iary duties to the Club’s members. 

67     Against this bac kground, I return to the issue I had raised earlier, that is, whether the Indemnity Resolution is a c ontrac t as between the Plaintiff and the Club. This turns on the more general issue of what is the legal effec t of resolutions passed by c ommittees or members of uninc orporated assoc iations. Surprisingly, there seems to be little c lear authority on the issue. 

68     In its simplest form, a resolution may be defined a “formal determination by an organised meeting”: see N E Renton, _Guide for Meetings and Organisations Volume 2: Guide for Meetings_ (LBC 


Information Servic es, 7th Ed, 2000) at para 4.1. In other words, resolutions are formal dec isions of an entity, be it a c ompany or some other assoc iation of persons. Importantly, however, it is also observed in Tan Cheng Han ed, _Walter Woon on Company Law_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2009) (“ _Walter Woon on Company Law_ ”) at para 6.69, albeit in the c ontext of resolutions passed by the organs of a c ompany, that whilst “a resolution may be a dec ision of the c ompany, it does not _ipso facto_ amount to a c ontrac t”. The authors c ite two c ases as authority for this proposition, to whic h I now turn to c onsider in some detail. 

69     The first is the dec ision of the Malaysian High Court in _Lam Eng Rubber Factory (M) Sdn Bhd v Lim Beng Yew & Ors_ [1994] 3 MLJ 405 (“ _Lam Eng Rubber_ ”). In that c ase, the plaintiff c ompany c laimed repayment of various sums of money that it had allegedly advanc ed to the defendants, who were shareholders of the plaintiff. In this regard, the plaintiff relied on a direc tors’ resolution to the effec t that the c ompany would advanc e sums totalling RM 360,000 to the defendants as interest-free loans. The plaintiff c ontended that the resolution amounted to a c ontrac t in writing and therefore, under s 91 of the Malaysian Evidenc e Ac t 1950 (Ac t 56), extrinsic evidenc e c ould not be admitted to c ontradic t its terms. In rejec ting this argument, KC Vohraj J observed as follows at 409: 

 I fail to see how the resolution can be considered as a contract between the plaintiff company and its new shareholders. That the doc ument shows that it is a resolution signed by three direc tors stating that the c ompany do hereby make an advanc e to the direc tors and shareholders does not indic ate that it is a c ontrac t. Nowhere in [the resolution] is it shown that there was an offer to lend money by the plaintiff company and that the offer was accepted by the defendants. More spec ific ally, there is nothing in the resolution whic h shows that at the request of the defendants the plaintiff advanc ed and the defendants borrowed ... c ertain sums of money as averred in para 5 of the statement of c laim. I fail to see how either s 91 or s 92 of the Evidenc e Ac t 1950 c an be invoked.[emphasis added] 

70     This aspec t of _Lam Eng Rubber_ was subsequently approved by the Malaysian High Court in _EON Bank Bhd v KSU Holdings Bhd_ [2011] 8 MLJ 498. There, the plaintiff bank c laimed against the defendant c ompany for spec ific performanc e of a c orporate guarantee whic h the defendant had allegedly given to the plaintiff. Although a guarantee doc ument had been sent to the defendant, this was never exec uted. Instead, the plaintiff relied on a board resolution of the defendant authorising it to provide the guarantee as evinc ing the relevant c ontrac t. Hanipah Farikullah JC found that suc h relianc e was misplac ed as the resolution was not a c ontrac t. Having c ited the above passage in _Lam Eng Rubber_ , Farikullah JC c ontinued (at [57]–[59]): 

 [57] Applying the dec ision in [ Lam Eng Rubber Factory (M) Sdn Bhd ], it is c lear that the resolution is an internal document of the defendant authorising and empowering the defendant to do and carry out matters stipulated therein. It does not however require or c ompel the defendant to do or c arry out any of the matters stated therein. 

 [58] Thus, it would therefore be c learly wrong in law for this court to accept the plaintiff’s contention that the resolution is an undertaking given by the defendant to the plaintiff capable of being specifically enforced ... 

 [59] By law the resolution has no legal binding effec t vis-a-vis the c ompany, the defendant in this c ase, and a third party, the plaintiff in this c ase. It does not create any legal relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. 

 [emphasis added] 


71     The sec ond dec ision c ited in _Walter Woon on Company Law_ is that of the Singapore High Court i n _Goh Kim Hai Edward v Pacific Can Investment Holdings Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1996] 1 SLR(R) 540</span> (“ _Goh Kim Hai Edward_ ”). The issue in that c ase was whether the plaintiff’s employment c ontrac t with the defendant c ompany had been renewed by a board resolution in the following terms: 

 That the employment c ontrac t of the c hairman, Mr Edward Goh, subjec t to the terms and c onditions and amendments as c ontained therein, renewed for another two years be and is hereby c onfirmed and ratified. 

72     Judith Prakash J was of the view that it had not. She observed as follows (at [57]–[58]): 

 57 From my reading of the resolution, it is c lear that, at the least, what the board did was to ac c ept the SERC's rec ommendation that the plaintiff's c ontrac t be extended on the terms whic h they had proposed, ie the original terms plus a modific ation of the bonus c lause. The acceptance of the recommendation did not, however, of itself constitute the new contract between the plaintiff and the defendants. It c ould not do so despite the somewhat pec uliar way the resolution was worded and the use of the word "ratified'. In fac t, as the plaintiff himself agreed there was nothing there to ratify sinc e in January 1992 the SERC presented a rec ommendation rather than a purported c ontrac t as it had done in Oc tober 1989. Also the board was advised by its solic itors at the meeting held on 27 Marc h 1992 that in the c ontext of the resolution the word "ratified" meant no more than "c onfirmed" and added nothing to the effec t of the resolution. This advic e was ac c epted by the board (inc luding the plaintiff and Mr Pang) without demur and led to Mr Rohan withdrawing his prior demand for the c orrec tion of the resolution by the deletion of the words "and ratified" based on his stand that he c ould not have agreed to have ratified what he had not seen. 

 58 As the defendants submitted, the relevant resolution did not, and could not, fall within the category of resolutions which have an immediate legal effect. Rather it was the more usual sort of resolution which requires communication or some other act in relation to it to be done before it becomes part of a transaction which is legally binding. That this was so was rec ognised by the plaintiff's submission that Mr Pang had been authorised to implement the dec ision and had done so by way of the renewal letter. If the resolution itself had been c apable of c onstituting the c ontrac t there would have [been] no nec essity to authorise anyone to take any implementation ac tion. 

 [emphasis added] 

73     Finally, referenc e may be made to the dec ision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in _Ex parte Forster; Re University of Sydney_ [1964] NSWR 1000. There the view was stated that: 

 A resolution may serve to define, ‘for the time being’ at any rate, a policy or principle intended to be followed in dealing with some class of subject matter. We say ‘for the time being’ bec ause, unlike a by-law or regulation, a resolution may be rescinded or varied by another resolution. [emphasis added] 

74     I agree with the observations made in the above authorities. In my view, the authorities c an be distilled into the following set of princ iples: 

 (a) resolutions are formal dec isions made by an entity; 

 (b) resolutions do not have legal effec t in and of themselves : 


 (i) a resolution is not a c ontrac t as between the members of the entity themselves or between the entity and third parties; 

 (ii) a resolution may however be binding as between the members if the c onstitutional doc uments of the entity or a statutory provision provides it to be so; 

 (iii) legal rights and obligations may be independently c reated if the entity ac ts pursuant to the resolution and enters into legally binding transac tions; and 

 (c ) resolutions, unlike a c ontrac t, may be resc inded or amended at any time. 

75     Applying these princ iples to the present c ase, I am of the view that the Indemnity Resolution did not have c ontrac tual forc e as between the Plaintiff and the Club so as to entitle the Plaintiff to an _irrevocable_ right to be indemnified by the Club for the legal c osts and damages he had inc urred in Suit 33 and its related proc eedings. Rather, the Indemnity Resolution was a statement of the Club’s polic y and intent to defend its offic e bearers against legal proc eedings brought against them in relation to ac ts done in the disc harge of their duties as offic e bearers. This is borne out by the following fac ts: 

 (a) In the minutes of the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting it was rec orded that: 

 (c ) ... [The Plaintiff ] was being sued for what he did and said as President of the Club and Chairman of the MC meeting. As suc h the Club is duty bound to defend its elec ted offic ers who are being sued for disc harging their duties as elec ted offic ers without whic h no member would serve in the MC or any of its Sub Committees. 

 (d) [Eric Ng] also explained that the Club bought the [insuranc e polic y] to c over its Management Committee, exec utive staff and sub c ommittee members to mitigate its losses in the event of suc h liabilities oc c urring. However if for any reason suc h liability insuranc e c over is not available, the Club would still have to defend its offic ers 

 (b) Likewise, the minutes of the 17 February 2009 MC meeting rec ord that: 

 (c ) [Gary Oon] was reminded that at the last MC meeting, barely a month ago, the MC had unanimously agreed on the polic y to indemnify all MC, Sub Committee and Disc iplinary Committee members for any legal proc eedings against them while ac ting in the interest of the Club in the disc harge of their responsibilities and duties for the Club... 

 (c ) Finally, during the 2009 AGM, the Plaintiff explained to the members that it had always been the prac tic e and polic y of the Club that Club funds be used to defend its MC and other c ommittee members if they were sued in the c ourse of disc harging their duties and responsibilities. 

76     In my judgment, it is c lear from the above that the Indemnity Resolution, _by itself_ , did not give the Plaintiff an irrevoc able c ontrac tual right to be indemnified by the Club. 

**_Payments made by the Plaintiff after the EOGM Resolutions were passed_** 

77     In c losing submissions, Mr Seah submitted that the EOGM Resolutions do not vary the Club’s obligation to indemnify the Plaintiff. Mr Seah submitted that sinc e delegated power had been exerc ised by the 2008 MC in passing the Indemnity Resolution, its dec ision c annot be c hallenged in the absenc e of spec ial provision in the Club’s Rules. In this regard, Mr Seah relied on a passage in 


Madeline Cordes _et al, Shackleton on the Law and Practice of Meetings_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2011) (“ _Shackleton_ ”) where the view is stated at para 9-04 that: 

 General or exec utive c ommittees are those appointed by bodies suc h as c lubs and assoc iations to manage their affairs and to deal with all matters whic h it would not be appropriate to deal with in a general meeting, and are similar to boards of direc tors of c ompanies. Exec utive c ommittees of c ompanies tend to deal with the day-to-day running of the business, department heads often being members of suc h c ommittees, with the board of the c ompany dealing with more strategic matters. Having been appointed as a governing body and generally given full powers to deal with all matters delegated to them, their decisions cannot, in the absence of special provision in the constitution, be varied or set aside by a general meeting of the parent body. [footnotes omitted and emphasis added] 

78     In my judgment, insofar as Mr Seah was c ontending that the Club is obliged to pay the Plaintiff’s legal c osts and damages in Suit 33 notwithstanding the EOGM Resolutions, the above passage in _Shackleton_ does not assist his c ase. First, as was disc ussed at [61]–[76] above, the Indemnity Resolution is not a c ontrac t as between the Plaintiff and the Club. To put this in simple terms, the Indemnity Resolution, by itself, does not c ontrac tually oblige the Club to pay the Plaintiff’s legal c osts and damages. 

79     Sec ond, it is c lear from the passage in _Shackleton_ that the general proposition that the dec isions of a c ommittee c annot be set aside by the general meeting is subjec t to any c ontrary provision in the c onstitutional doc uments. In the present c ase, suc h a provision exists by virtue of Rule 21(j) of the Club’s Rules (see [65] above). Rule 21(j) provides that the MC “may not ac t c ontrary to the dec isions of the General Meeting” and is always “subordinate to the General Meeting”. These phrases speak for themselves. In the absenc e of a binding indemnity c ontrac t between the Club and the Plaintiff, I am of the view that the Club was entitled to c hange its mind and resolve to c ease paying the Plaintiff’s legal c osts and damages after the EOGM Resolutions were passed. The MC c ould not thereafter ac t c ontrary to those EOGM Resolutions. 

80     Mr Seah raised an alternative submission that the Club is estopped from denying that the Plaintiff is entitled to rely on the Indemnity Resolution. To the extent that Mr Seah sought to rely on the doc trine of estoppel (whether by representation or by c onvention) to buttress his c laim that the Plaintiff has a right to be reimbursed for payments whic h the Plaintiff made personally after the EOGM Resolutions were passed (as opposed to being used as a defenc e to the Club’s c laim for the rec overy of the payments whic h the Club had made), his c ontentions do not hold water. 

81     As I observed earlier, the Plaintiff does not have a c ontrac tual right to be indemnified by the Club. Henc e, to allow him to rely on the doc trine of estoppel in the manner whic h he proposes would be tantamount to the use of the doc trine as a sword in the sense of a free-standing c ause of ac tion and not merely as a shield. So far, the Singapore c ourts have not ac c epted that the doc trine of estoppel may be used in this way (see for example _Sea-Land Service Inc v Cheong Fook Chee Vincent_ <span class="citation">[1994] 3 SLR(R) 250</span> at [23]; _OMG Holdings Pte Ltd v Pos Ad Sdn Bhd_ <span class="citation">[2012] 4 SLR 201</span> at [72]; _Rudhra Minerals Pte Ltd v MRI Trading Pte Ltd (formerly known as CWT Integrated Services Pte Ltd)_ <span class="citation">[2013] 4 SLR 1023</span> at [52]). 

**_Payments made by the Club before the EOGM Resolutions were passed_** 

82     The Plaintiff’s arguments however, stand on firmer ground in relation to the Club’s ability to rec over sums whic h it had already paid towards the Plaintiff’s legal c osts. In that situation, the Club, through the MC, had ac ted pursuant to the Indemnity Resolution and made suc h payments on the 


Plaintiff’s behalf. Even though the Indemnity Resolution does not have c ontrac tual forc e as between the Plaintiff and the Club, and to that end, the Club had paid the Plaintiff’s legal c osts voluntarily, as a matter of both princ iple and polic y, I do not see how the Club c an simply c hange its mind about having made those payments and rec over those payments through its own private ac t, by passing the EOGM Resolutions. In my view, the Club must go further and establish a distinc t c ause of ac tion at law whic h permits the rec overy of sums whic h it had already paid towards the Plaintiff’s legal c osts. It follows from the analysis above that the EOGM Resolutions do not automatic ally entitle the Club to rec over suc h sums. 

**Grounds for Recovery** 

**_The Club’s case_** 

83     I now turn to c onsider the Club’s arguments as to why it is entitled to rec over the sums it paid pursuant to the Indemnity Resolution. In c losing submissions, Mr Tan made three princ ipal arguments. 

84     First, Mr Tan submitted that the Plaintiff and his “c ronies” in the 2008 MC had c onc ealed the 14 January 2009 Members Letter, and the fac t that the Plaintiff’s defenc e in Suit 33 fell under the Insured v Insured Exc lusion in the Club’s insuranc e polic y, from the other 2008 MC members at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. Ac c ording to Mr Tan, the Indemnity Resolution was passed under a fundamental mistake arising from the dec eption of the Plaintiff and his “c ronies” in the 2008 MC, and therefore, the Indemnity Resolution is void or voidable at the Club’s instanc e. Alternatively, Mr Tan submitted that the Indemnity Resolution should be voidable at the Club’s instanc e given the Plaintiff’s “sharp prac tic e” in proc uring the Indemnity Resolution. 

85     Sec ond, Mr Tan submitted that the Indemnity Resolution was voidable due to various breac hes of fiduc iary duties on the part of the Plaintiff and his “c ronies” in the 2008 MC. In partic ular, it was alleged that: 

 (a) at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting, the Plaintiff had ac tively partic ipated and influenc ed the 2008 MC in passing the Indemnity Resolution, in breac h of the Club’s Rules and the Plaintiff’s fiduc iary duties; 

 (b) the Plaintiff and his “c ronies” had a vested interest in passing the Indemnity Resolution. The Indemnity Resolution was passed to c over the Plaintiff’s liabilities in Suit 33. Further, the Plaintiff’s “c ronies” may also have been implic ated in the defamatory statements as they were present during the MC meetings when the defamatory statements were made. Therefore, the Indemnity Resolution was not passed in the Club’s interests; 

 (c ) the Plaintiff and his “c ronies” had breac hed their fiduc iary duties to the Club in re-affirming the Indemnity Resolution even after the Court of Appeal had found, in the CA Judgment, that the Plaintiff had ac ted with malic e in making the defamatory statements; and 

 (d) the Plaintiff had breac hed his fiduc iary duties by proc uring payment of his legal c osts despite knowing that he would not be c overed by the Indemnity Resolution bec ause of his own malic e. 

86     Third, Mr Tan submitted that even if the Indemnity Resolution remains valid, it was only intended to c over offic e bearers ac ting in the proper disc harge of their duties. In this regard, Mr Tan submitted that bec ause the Plaintiff had ac ted with malic e when he made the defamatory statements, he c annot be said to have ac ted in the proper disc harge of his duties and he is therefore 


not entitled to rely on the Indemnity Resolution. Henc e, Mr Tan said, the Club had paid the Plaintiff’s liabilities in respec t of Suit 33 under a mistake and is entitled to restitution of the sums it paid under the law of unjust enric hment. 

87     Two preliminary observations should be made at this junc ture. 

_Consistency with the Club’s pleaded case_ 

88     First, it seems to me that the Club’s c ase in c losing submissions was different from its pleadings. To begin with, it is not apparent from the Club’s Defenc e and Counterc laim that its c ore c ase is that the Plaintiff and his “c ronies” in the 2008 MC had breac hed their fiduc iary duties when passing the Indemnity Resolution in the various ways whic h the Club had alleged in c losing submissions. Instead, the Club’s pleaded position was narrower and simply that the other members of the 2008 MC had a vested interest in passing the Indemnity Resolution bec ause of the risk of them being implic ated in Suit 33; and further, that the Plaintiff had breac hed his fiduc iary duties by proc uring payments of his legal c osts when he knew that he was not c overed by the Indemnity Resolution bec ause of his malic e. 

89     In the Club’s Counterc laim, there was also no prayer for a dec laration that the Indemnity Resolution was void or voidable, whether for mistake, unc onsc ionability or for breac h of fiduc iary duties, nor was there a prayer for relief in the form of equitable resc ission (of the Indemnity Resolution and the payments made pursuant to it). Rather, the Club’s Counterc laim was ostensibly pleaded solely as a c laim in unjust enric hment for restitution of payments made by the Club. I will return to the spec ific issues arising from the Club’s pleadings later in these grounds. 

_The Club’s allegation that certain members of the 2008 MC and the 2011 MC were the Plaintiff’s “cronies”_ 

90     Next, a c ommon thread running through the Club’s c losing submissions is that c ertain members of the 2008 and 2011 MC were the Plaintiff’s “c ronies”. In partic ular, the impression whic h this seeks to c onvey is that these MC members had ac ted in c onc ert with the Plaintiff and had advanc ed his interests over the interests of the Club. In my view, the Club’s position is untenable for the following reasons. 

91     First, the Club did not plead this as a fac t. Instead, the Club only pleaded that the other 2008 MC members had a vested interest in passing the Indemnity Resolution bec ause of the risk of them being implic ated in Suit 33. In my view, there is a fundamental differenc e between saying that the other 2008 MC members had a vested interest in passing the Indemnity Resolution in this sense, and saying that they were ac ting in c onc ert with the Plaintiff and advanc ing his interests. 

92     Sec ond, the Club did not identify in c losing submissions who these alleged “c ronies” were; and more importantly, whether these MC members were in fac t the Plaintiff’s “c ronies”. I note in this regard that seven of the 12 members of the 2008 MC were not c alled as witnesses in this Suit 634. Without their evidenc e, I am not in a position to impute any sinister motives in passing the Indemnity Resolution to eac h and every one of them. 

93     Third, the Club’s submissions largely gloss over the fac t that the c omposition of the 2011 MC, whic h had re-affirmed the Indemnity Resolution at three separate MC meetings after the CA Judgment (see [46] – [51] above), was different from the c omposition of the 2008 MC whic h had passed the Indemnity Resolution. This is signific ant bec ause: 


## 16. 

## Q: 

## A: 

 (a) there were five newly elec ted members of the 2011 MC who were not members of the 2008 MC. These new 2011 MC members would have no fear of being implic ated in Suit 33, and they would not have had a vested interest in ensuring that the Indemnity Resolution remained in forc e to protec t the Plaintiff; and 

 (b) the Club has not proven that the members of the newly c onstituted 2011 MC were also the Plaintiff’s c ronies. In this regard, I do not think it is open to the Club to barely assert (without any evidenc e), as it has done in c losing submissions, that the new members of the 2011 MC had a vested interest in protec ting the Plaintiff and the rest of the 2008 MC bec ause of their c lose relationships with the 2008 MC members who had nominated them. 

94     Along the same lines, the Club also submitted that the minority in the 2008 MC were bullied and intimidated into agreeing with the Plaintiff and his “c ronies” at MC meetings. To make good this submission, the Club relied on statements made by Theresa Kay and Gary Oon at the 2009 AGM, whic h were rec orded in the minutes of this AGM. 

95     As regards Theresa Kay’s statement, I find that it is inadmissible hearsay as she was not c alled as a witness at trial and I therefore say nothing further on it. 

96     As for Gary Oon’s statement, the minutes of the 2009 AGM rec ord it as follows: 

 [Gary Oon] pointed out that it was c lear he and Ms Theresa Kay were under undue duress to agree to allow [the] Club’s funds to be used. He asked was it so wrong to express what he thought was right for the Club. He said that the atmosphere at MC meetings ever sinc e the start of this MC being on board had been ac rimonious and often times disc ussions were very heated and voic es were raised, whic h was unc alled for, and on oc c asions even he felt intimidated. In that sort of c irc umstanc es, when a vote was c alled for surely the majority would win. However, as a MC member he owed a fiduc iary duty to ac t in the best interest of the Club, and agreeing to allow Club’s funds for use for the defense [sic ] of its President in an alleged defamation was c ertainly not ac ting in the interest of the Club... 

97     I am mindful that Gary Oon’s statements at the 2009 AGM were made in response to the motion to c ensure him at this AGM (see [34] above), for not c onsulting with the 2008 MC before replying to the 14 January 2009 Members Letter. His statements at this AGM may therefore have been motivated by self-preservation. 

98     Moreover, the evidenc e does not support Gary Oon’s assertion that he was under “undue duress” to agree to the Indemnity Resolution. The agreed transc ripts of the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting show the 2008 MC freely disc ussing the Indemnity Resolution at some length. Pertinently, they show Gary Oon ac tively partic ipating in the disc ussion and enquiring whether the law allowed the 2008 MC to pass the Indemnity Resolution. Furthermore, Gary Oon did not objec t to the Indemnity Resolution when it was passed. Instead, he only did so belatedly, after rec eiving the 14 January 2009 Members Letter. In c ross-examination, Gary Oon c onc eded that he had _changed his mind_ bec ause of the 14 January 2009 Members Letter: 

 Mr Oon, if I understand you c orrec tly, what you are essentially saying here is you would have c hanged your mind, maybe made an objec tion to the [Indemnity Resolution] if you had seen the letter, c orrec t? 

 Yes. 


## Q:

## Q: 

## A: 

## Q: 

 What is c lear from this exc hange is that you knew full well that the [2008 MC] was asked if anyone had an objec tion, and you did not have an objec tion. Correc t? 

 At that point, yes. 

99     In his affidavit, Gary Oon also referred to a 2008 MC meeting on 17 February 2009 (“the 17 February 2009 MC Meeting”) and a c hain of emails whic h prec eded that MC meeting as an instanc e where he was “overwhelmingly shot down” by the other members of the 2008 MC. The diffic ulty with Gary Oon’s evidenc e in this respec t is that it ignores the reasons why the other 2008 MC members had expressed irritation with him. In this regard, Gary Oon had sought to amend the minutes of the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting to read that: 

 (a) no votes were taken on the Indemnity Resolution and it thus c ould not be said that the 2008 MC had unanimously agreed to it; 

 (b) making defamatory allegations was the responsibility of the MC member c onc erned and the Club should not be responsible for it; and 

 (c ) Gary Oon had disagreed that the Club should assume all liability in the defenc e of suc h c ases. 

100    During the 17 February 2009 MC Meeting, Gary Oon likewise objec ted to the c onfirmation of the minutes of the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting on the basis that the Indemnity Resolution was not passed unanimously. 

101    In my view, Gary Oon was attempting to re-write history by raising the tec hnic al objec tion that the Indemnity Resolution was not passed unanimously as no vote had been taken, and instead, the 2008 MC members had been asked whether they had any objec tions to the Indemnity Resolution. This informal manner of voting ac c orded with past prac tic e at MC meetings and Gary Oon knew this. It is plain on the evidenc e that Gary Oon did not objec t to the Indemnity Resolution at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. In the c irc umstanc es there was no reasonable basis for Gary Oon to c laim during the 17 February 2009 MC Meeting that the Indemnity Resolution was not passed unanimously. Pertinently, in c ross-examination, Gary Oon ac c epted that the other MC members were irritated with his attempts to amend the minutes of the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting to reflec t statements whic h he had not made during that meeting, and when he c ould have properly raised these matters later in the 17 February 2009 MC Meeting under “matters arising” and not in the c onfirmation of the previous meeting’s minutes: 

 What is the purpose of minutes of a meeting, Mr Oon? 

 ... 

 It is to rec ord what goes on at the meeting. 

 Indeed. If you have never said anything of this sort, it should have no plac e in the minutes of the meeting, c orrec t? 

 Well, yes, you c an. 

 That is why the rest of the MC members were very irritated with you, c orrec t?

 Then there was an exc hange of emails that followed this amongst the [2008 MC]... 

... 

 I will not go through all of them, but you would agree with me that generally they express surprise and irritation at your proposed amendments? 

 Yes. 

 I just wanted to show you one of the responses, at page 152, it is from Mr Tan Wee Tin. 

He says: 

“Gary. 

Having ac ted as sec retary of both public -listed and private c orporations, one does not need to refer to Shac kleton law for a start. 

A member attending and speaking at any meeting is entitled to amend by adding or deleting words from his statements to render c larity or eliminate ambiguity. 

Proc edurally, going beyond is unac c eptable whether c oming from hindsight or whatever side you may wish to put forth. 

_Of course the attendee concerned can voice his views under “Matters arising” at this meeting._ 

All is therefore not lost.” 

_Mr Tan is simply saying that you should not be putting forth your views in minutes. If you want to, you can brick [sic] them up in – bring them up in matters arising, correct?_ 

 Yes. 

 That is a perfec tly reasonable thing to say, c orrec t? 

 Yes. 

 And you should have no reason to be angry with Mr Tan for saying this? 

 No I am not angry, that’s why I didn’t reply. 

 Thank you. You see, this series of emails is not an attempt by the [2008 MC] to gang up on you and shut you out. They were simply calling you to order because you were trying to insert things into the minutes that you did not say at the last meeting. Do you agree or disagree? 

 I agree. 

 And when you got into a little quarrel with them at the start of the next meeting on this subjec t, they were also irritated that you – at you bec ause you tried to insert these things 


## A: 

 into the minutes. Agree? 

 Perhaps that’s how they feel. 

 [emphasis added] 

102    In the c irc umstanc es, I find that the Club has not proven its c laim that the minority in the 2008 MC were bullied and intimidated into passing the Indemnity Resolution by the Plaintiff and his “c ronies” in the 2008 MC. 

**_Whether the Indemnity Resolution was passed under a fundamental mistake or procured by sharp practice_** 

103    I turn to the Club’s first ground for the rec overy of payments the Club had made for the Plaintiff’s legal c osts. This is that the Plaintiff and his “c ronies” had c onc ealed the 14 January 2009 Member Letter and the Insured v Insured Exc lusion from the other 2008 MC members at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. In effec t, the Club’s c ase was that the Indemnity Resolution was passed by the 2008 MC under a fundamental mistake, or alternatively, the Indemnity Resolution was proc ured by sharp prac tic e or unc onsc ionable c onduc t on the Plaintiff’s part. Therefore, the Club submitted, the Indemnity Resolution was void, or alternatively, voidable at the Club’s instanc e. 

104    As previously noted at [88] and [89] above, it is not c lear from the Club’s Defenc e and Counterc laim that the Club was seeking to have the Indemnity Resolution, and the payments made pursuant to it, invalidated on this ground. In partic ular, the Club only pleaded that the Plaintiff did not bring the 14 January 2009 Members Letters and the Insured v Insured Exc lusion to the attention of the other 2008 MC members when he had knowledge of these matters. The Club did not further plead an operative mistake on the part of the other 2008 MC members in passing the Indemnity Resolution. Nor did the Club furnish partic ulars of unc onsc ionable c onduc t on the part of the Plaintiff and his “c ronies”. Moreover, the Club’s Defenc e and Counterc laim did not pray for relief in the form of equitable resc ission. Be that as it may, I need not say more on this point of pleading bec ause I find the Club’s c ontentions untenable on substantive grounds (see [124]–[153] below). 

_Res judicata_ 

105    As a preliminary objec tion, Mr Seah submitted that the Club was prec luded from raising the fac tual issues of the Plaintiff’s failure to disc lose the 14 January 2009 Members Letter and the Insured v Insured Exc lusion during the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting, by the doc trine of issue estoppel, or alternatively, the extended doc trine of _res judicata_. 

The law on _res judicata_ and issue estoppel 

106    The doc trine of _res judicata_ c omprises two related c onc epts. The first is c ause of ac tion estoppel, whic h, broadly speaking, prevents re-litigation of the same c ause of ac tion between the same parties. Cause of ac tion estoppel did not feature in the proc eedings before me. I therefore say nothing further on it. 

107    The proc eedings before me c onc erned the sec ond c onc ept of issue estoppel instead. Issue estoppel may arise even if the earlier dec ision did not determine the same c ause of ac tion being sued upon in the later proc eedings; issue estoppel applies so long as the earlier dec ision determined _an issue_ that was an essential step in the reasoning of that earlier dec ision. Should this issue prove to be relevant in later proc eedings between the same parties, further c onsideration of that issue may be 


forec losed: _Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others_ <span class="citation">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453</span> (“ _Goh Nellie_ ”) at [18]. 

108    Four requirements must be met before issue estoppel will arise ( _Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation of Strata Title Plan No 301_ <span class="citation">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 157</span> (“ _Lee Tat_ ”) at [14]–[15]): 

 (a) there must be a final and c onc lusive judgment on the merits; 

 (b) that judgment must be of a c ourt of c ompetent jurisdic tion; 

 (c ) there must be identity between the parties to the two ac tions that are being c ompared; and 

 (d) there must be an identity of subjec t matter in the two proc eedings. 

109    In the present c ase, parties did not dispute that the first two requirements were met and their arguments c entred on the third and fourth requirements instead. I will therefore only set out the princ iples in relation to the third and fourth requirements. 

110    With regard to the third requirement, namely, identity between the parties, the c ourts have not taken a narrow view of what this means. Instead, the c ourts have looked past the form to c onsider whether, in substanc e, the parties involved in the two sets of proc eedings were effec tively the same (see _Lee Tat at [14] and Goh Nellie_ at [33]). As Lord Diploc k observed in _Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police_ [1982] AC 529 at 541, issue estoppel may arise in c ivil ac tions between “the same parties or their privies”. 

111    As for the fourth requirement of identity of subjec t matter, this turns on two fac tors. The first is that the issue in question must have been raised and argued in the earlier proc eedings ( _Goh Nellie_ at [38]). The sec ond is whether the previous determination of the issue in question was fundamental (and not merely c ollateral) to the previous dec ision so that the previous dec ision c annot stand without that determination ( _Goh Nellie_ at [35]). 

112    If issue estoppel does not arise, bec ause there is no identity between the parties or the subjec t matter of the earlier dec ision and the later proc eedings, a party may also rely on the extended doc trine of _res judicata_ , whic h is otherwise known as the defenc e of an abuse of proc ess (see _Goh Nellie_ at [19] and [23]). 

113    The extended doc trine of _res judicata_ is a matter of weighing c ompeting interests. The c ourts are c onc erned with ensuring finality in judic ial dec isions and preventing a party from being unjustly hounded given the earlier history of the matter. The question is whether the issue ought to have been raised with reasonable diligenc e in the previous proc eedings. However, the mere fac t that the issue was not raised in the earlier proc eedings does not nec essarily render raising the issue in the later proc eedings abusive. Thus the c ourts must c onsider whether it is in fac t an abuse of proc ess to raise the issue only at the later proc eedings (see generally _Goh Nellie_ at [52]). 

Applic ation to the present c ase 

114    With regard to the third requirement of issue estoppel, whic h is identity between the parties, I am of the view that the parties to OS 469 and to this Suit 634 were different. First, Poh Pai Chin is not a party to Suit 634. Sec ond, and more importantly, the Club took a position in OS 469 whic h was aligned with its c o-defendant, the Plaintiff, against a member of the Club. Affidavits had been filed on behalf of all the defendants in OS 469 and they stated, amongst other things, that the Indemnity 


Resolution was valid and _intra vires_ the Club’s Rules, and that the 2008 MC and the Club c ould authorise the payment of the Plaintiff’s legal expenses. The underc urrent running through the affidavits filed by the defendants was that the Club, through the 2008 MC, had intended to pay the Plaintiff’s legal expenses. 

115    In this Suit 634, however, the Club’s interests and the Plaintiff’s interests are diametric ally opposed. While the Plaintiff is seeking to uphold the Indemnity Resolution, the Club is now opposing it in view of the EOGM Resolutions. The Club no longer wants to pay the Plaintiff’s legal expenses, and is further attempting to c law bac k payments it had already made. In effec t, the Club has adopted an opposing position bec ause the Club is now run by a different MC from the 2008 MC. The privies of the Club are different, and henc e the position the Club now adopts is different too. I am not c onvinc ed t hat , _in substance_ , there is identity between the Club in OS 469 and the Club in this Suit 634. Therefore, the third requirement to establish issue estoppel is not met. 

116    With regard to the fourth requirement of issue estoppel, whic h is identity in subjec t matter, I am also not satisfied that this is made out. The c entral issue in OS 469 was whether the Indemnity Resolution was _intra vires_ the Club’s Rules. In other words, OS 469 turned on whether it was within the 2008 MC’s power, as derived from the Club’s Rules, to pass the Indemnity Resolution in the first plac e. Poh Pai Chin had relied on the 14 January 2009 Members Letter to argue that point. 

117    The issue in this Suit 634 is different. Here, no question of _ultra vires_ arises. The Club ac c epts that it was within the 2008 MC’s power, under the Club’s Rules, to pass the Indemnity Resolution. However, the Club argues that the 2008 MC’s dec ision to do so has been vitiated on the grounds of mistake or unc onsc ionability. The Club relies on the 14 January 2009 Members Letter and the Insured v Insured Exc lusion to make out its c ase on these grounds. 

118    I am mindful that it was disputed in the affidavits filed in OS 469 whether the 14 January 2009 Members Letter had been disc losed to the 2008 MC during the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. Poh Chai Chin and Gary Oon deposed that it was not whilst Ashok Sharma and BB Khoo deposed that it was. However, based on the outc ome in OS 469, it is unc lear whether the 14 January 2009 Members Letter was fundamental to the dec ision there, suc h that the dec ision c ould not stand without that determination (see _Goh Nellie_ at [35]). 

119    As mentioned earlier, OS 469 was c entred on the issue of _ultra vires_. In that c ontext, it may be surmised that the interpretation of the Club’s Rules would have been the foremost issue. The 14 January 2009 Members letter would only bec ome a relevant c onsideration if the Club’s Rules required the 2008 MC to take the 10 members’ wishes into ac c ount. Bec ause OS 469 was dismissed without written grounds being delivered, it is unc lear how the c ourt arrived at its dec ision. There are two possibilities: 

 (a) the c ourt may have found that the 2008 MC was not required to take members’ wishes into c onsideration. In that c ase, the c ourt c ould have dismissed OS 469 on the basis that the 2008 MC was ac ting within its power in passing the Indemnity Resolution – no finding on the 14 January 2009 Members Letter would have been nec essary; or 

 (b) the c ourt may have found that the 2008 MC was required to take members’ wishes into c onsideration. The c ourt would then have also had to find that the 14 January 2009 Members Letter was in fac t disc losed and c onsidered by the 2008 MC before passing the Indemnity Resolution. 

As the dec ision in OS 469 c ould have been arrived at in either of the two sc enarios above, I c annot 


be satisfied that the issue of whether the 14 January 2009 Members Letter had been disc losed during the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting was fundamental to the c ourt’s dec ision. 

120    In any event, the Insured v Insured Exc lusion was not even raised and argued by Poh Pai Chin in OS 469 as a basis for invalidating the Indemnity Resolution (see _Goh Nellie_ at [38]). 

121    In the c irc umstanc es, I am not satisfied that the requirement of identity of subjec t matter is met. It follows that the Plaintiff’s c ontentions regarding issue estoppel must fail. 

122    The question then is whether it would nonetheless be an abuse of proc ess for the Club to be allowed to raise the non-disc losure of the 14 January 2009 Members Letter and the Insured v Insured Exc lusion in this Suit 634, suc h that it would engage the wider doc trine of _res judicata_. In my judgment, there is no abuse of proc ess bec ause: 

 (a) the Club is now prosec uting an ac tion whic h involves allegations by the Club of wrongdoing by its previous MC. The fac t is that the 2008 MC may have c aused the Club to take positions in OS 469 whic h were aligned with their own interests; 

 (b) OS 469 was an ac tion c ommenc ed by an individual member of the Club and not the Club itself. Poh Pai Chin elec ted to run his c ase to invalidate the Indemnity Resolution on the basis of ultra vires alone. Poh Pai Chin’s elec tion to do so should not be held against the Club. Further, even if Gary Oon should reasonably have raised the non-disc losure of the Insured v Insured Exc lusion as a basis for invalidating the Indemnity Resolution in OS 469, this should not prec lude the Club from doing so now; and 

 (c ) it is impossible to asc ertain prec isely what was determined in OS 469 in the absenc e of written grounds. 

123    In my view, therefore, the Club is not prec luded from c anvassing these issues of fac t in this Suit 634. I will now turn to c onsider eac h of these issues, starting with the Insured v Insured Exc lusion. 

_Was the Insured v Insured Exclusion discussed at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting?_ 

124    Based on the agreed transc ripts of the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting, it would appear that the meeting proc eeded without any mention of the Insured v Insured Exc lusion. Referenc e to the Club’s insuranc e polic y during the disc ussion on the Indemnity Resolution was made in a different c ontext. The following points summarise the 14 January 2009 MC meeting in this regard: 

 (a) the Plaintiff was being sued for defamation and although the c laim was against him personally, the statements had been made in his c apac ity as the President of the Club; 

 (b) as a matter of Club polic y, all MC members should be protec ted by an indemnity from the Club for ac ts done in their disc harge of their duties to the Club by virtue of their positions; 

 (c ) the insuranc e polic y obtained by the Club was in furtheranc e of suc h a Club polic y, and, even if the insuranc e polic y did not c over c ertain ac ts, the Club should nevertheless provide c overage for MC members; 

 (d) the indemnity by the Club would be for any sort of ac tion that c ould be brought against the MC members and not just defamation ac tions; 


 Eric Ng: ... we are talking about the Club defending the MC for -when they are being sued in the c ourse of exec uting their duties and responsibilities. 

 [the Plaintiff]: You see, here we might not get insuranc e c overage, all right. 

 Eric Ng: Yah. [the Plaintiff]: So you are now implying that bec ause we have insuranc e c overage, we are c overed. Eric Ng: Yah, c orrec t. 

 [the Plaintiff]: What if we are fac ed with a situation, c ome renewal, they say, “I’m sorry, I don’t want to insure Singapore Swimming Club” -

 Eric Ng: I -

 [the Plaintiff]: -but the Club still has to c over the MC, whoever the MC, it may not be me. It c ould be, you know, Mr A, Mr B, who c omes to the MC. 

 (e) there was nothing, legally, that prevented the MC from passing an indemnity resolution and it would be for the MC to dec ide; and 

 (f) the Club’s funds would be used for this indemnity. 

125    Eric Ng also testified at trial that the disc ussion was c onduc ted in suc h a manner so as to foc us on the Indemnity Resolution and not the Club’s insuranc e polic y. Bec ause of that, the Insured v Insured Exc lusion was not spec ific ally mentioned. Eric Ng had proc eeded on the basis that in the event the Club’s insuranc e polic y did not apply, all offic e bearers would nevertheless be c overed by an indemnity from the Club. This was repeated to the 2008 MC members at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting more than onc e. 

126    This is c orroborated by what the Plaintiff had said in relation to insuranc e c overage (or the lac k thereof) at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting: 

Based on my reading of the evidenc e, the Plaintiff was effec tively saying that the Club should still c over the c osts of defending MC members whether or not there was insuranc e c overage. 

_Was the 2008 MC aware of the Insured v Insured Exclusion?_ 

127    It is c ruc ial to the Club’s c ase that the other 2008 MC members, apart from the Plaintiff and Eric Ng, did not know about the Insured v Insured Exc lusion. If they knew about the Insured v Insured Exc lusion but did not mention it, then the Insured v Insured Exc lusion c ould not have been material to, or have affec ted, their dec ision making. This point was not made explic itly c lear by the Club. On the other hand, the Plaintiff argued that the other 2008 MC members knew of the Insured v Insured Exc lusion on or before the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. 

128    In my view, the respec tive c ases of both parties were lac king in one key respec t: the evidenc e of _all_ 2008 MC members. This is not a c ase where the objec tive evidenc e from the agreed transc ripts and the meeting minutes speak for themselves. On its fac e, the objec tive evidenc e did not reveal any disc ussion on the insuranc e polic y’s limitations or, more spec ific ally, the Insured v Insured Exc lusion. Yet, it seemed to me at the same time during the trial that at least some 2008 MC Members knew about the Insured v Insured Exc lusion by the time of the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. In any event, 


I propose to say no more on this given my c onc lusion below that the Insured v Insured Exc lusion was not material to the passing of the Indemnity Resolution, and that the Indemnity Resolution was not passed under a fundamental mistake. 

_Was the 14 January 2009 Members Letter disclosed at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting?_ 

129    The Club also asserted that the 14 January 2009 Members Letter was not disc losed to the members of the 2008 MC at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. 

130    The 14 January 2009 Members Letter was not mentioned in the agreed transc ripts or the minutes of the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. This is also c orroborated by the agreed transc ripts for the subsequent 17 February 2009 MC Meeting where Gary Oon asked why the letter had not been c irc ulated at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting and BB Khoo had c onfirmed that the letter had not been c irc ulated. At this junc ture, it is pertinent to note that BB Khoo was the rec ipient of the said letter and the non-disc losure of the said letter is thus attributable to him. In this regard, I observe that there is no evidenc e that the Plaintiff or Eric Ng had direc ted him to not disc lose the said letter at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. 

131    In my judgment, it is plain on the evidenc e that the 14 January 2009 Members Letter was not disc losed at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. I also note that Mr Seah did not assert the c ontrary in c losing submissions. 

_Were the non-disclosures material?_ 

132    I now c ome to the materiality of the non-disc losures. As seen from above, the 14 January 2009 Members Letter and the Insured v Insured Exc lusion were not disc losed or disc ussed by the 2008 MC at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. However, for the Club to prove its c ase that the Indemnity Resolution is void or voidable, the Club must go further and prove that the non-disc losures were material to the passing of the Indemnity Resolution. 

133    I will first c onsider the materiality of the Insured v Insured Exc lusion to the passing of the Indemnity Resolution. As I had mentioned above, I c ould not determine whether all the 2008 MC members knew (or did not know) about the Insured v Insured Exc lusion by the time they attended the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. However, based on the evidenc e before me, I am of the view that the 2008 MC members must have known about the Insured v Insured Exc lusion and its effec t by the time Ashok Sharma’s affidavit was filed in OS 469, that is, by 12 June 2009. This was an affidavit filed on behalf of the 2008 MC members (exc luding Theresa Kay, Mike Chia and Gary Oon) and these 2008 MC members must therefore be taken to have known of its c ontents. As for Gary Oon, he testified in c ross-examination that he had found out about the Insured v Insured Exc lusion sometime in May 2009. 

134    In his affidavit filed in OS 469, Ashok Sharma deposed that the Insured v Insured Exc lusion was one of the reasons why the Indemnity Resolution was passed. Pertinently, none of the other 2008 MC members who were involved in OS 469 had raised any objec tion to this aspec t of Ashok Sharma’s affidavit or c ontended that they did not know that the Insured v Insured Exc lusion would exc lude Suit 33 from insuranc e c overage. I also note that apart from Gary Oon, no 2008 MC member raised any suc h objec tion at any MC meeting at any time after 12 June 2009 or for the purpose of this Suit 634, or in any other forum. As for Gary Oon, even though he found out about the Insured v Insured Exc lusion earlier, in May 2009, he did not mount any objec tions to the Indemnity Resolution on this basis, and further, he did not address the issue of non-disc losure of the Insured v Insured Exc lusion in OS 469 or at the EOGM. Rather, the first time Gary Oon raised the issue was in this Suit 634. 


135    Furthermore, it should be emphasised that the Indemnity Resolution was purportedly passed by the MC 2008 to affirm the Club’s polic y of indemnifying its offic e bearers when they were sued in the c ourse of exec uting their duties and responsibilities. In that regard, the insuranc e polic y was relevant in the sense that the insuranc e polic y was a means, but c ertainly not the sole means, of giving effec t to the Club’s polic y. Where insuranc e c over was absent or lac king for c ertain liabilities, the Club would nevertheless still indemnify its offic e bearers. Pertinently, none of the 2008 MC members disc ussed limitations to the Club’s indemnific ation. On the c ontrary, the Indemnity Resolution was intentionally worded to c over all MC members, present or future, for all ac ts of the MC members done in the disc harge of their duties, and for any amount. 

136    In the premises, I do not think that the disc losure of the Insured v Insured Exc lusion at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting would have materially affec ted the 2008 MC members’ dec ision in passing the Indemnity Resolution. 

137    The observations above are similarly applic able to the 14 January 2009 Members Letter. I note Gary Oon’s evidenc e that he would have objec ted to the passing of the Indemnity Resolution if the 14 January 2009 Members Letter had been disc losed to him at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. Bec ause of his objec tions, it was eventually rec orded in the minutes of the 17 February 2009 MC Meeting that “at his own behest the [insuranc e polic y] c overage would not inc lude [Gary Oon] for all defamation suits. An amendment would be made to the insuranc e polic y”. However, even if Gary Oon had objec ted, his objec tion would not have been material to the passing of the Indemnity Resolution as it was only one member’s objec tion in the fac e of the majority of the 2008 MC, all of whom did _not_ raise similar objec tions to the passing of the Indemnity Resolution at the 17 February 2009 MC Meeting, even though they all knew about the existenc e of the 14 January 2009 Members Letter by that time. 

138    The following observations also inform my c onc lusion that the non-disc losure of the 14 January 2009 Members Letter was not material to the passing of the Indemnity Resolution. 

139    First, the points that were made in the 14 January 2009 Members Letter had already been c anvassed in the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. The said letter made the following points: 

 (a) the Plaintiff was being sued in Suit 33 for defamation; 

 (b) uninc orporated assoc iations like the Club c ould not be liable for the tortious ac ts of its offic ials or c ommittee members; 

 (c ) therefore, and in the interest of the Club, the members requested that Club funds would not be used to financ e the Plaintiff’s defenc e as doing so would be improper; and 

 (d) if funds had been used, steps ought to be taken to rec over the monies. 

140    Comparing the points made in the 14 January 2009 Members Letter (see [139] above) to what had been disc ussed above at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting (see [124] above), points (a) and (b) of the letter had been raised at the meeting: the 2008 MC members knew that the Plaintiff was being sued for defamation and, additionally, took the view that the Club c ould pass resolutions to indemnify MC members if they so wished to. As a result of the view that the 2008 MC had adopted, points (c ) and (d) of the said letter did not arise for disc ussion. In my view, no new points were raised in the 14 January 2009 Members Letter that had not been c onsidered by the 2008 MC at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting, apart from the fac t that 10 members of the Club were objec ting to the Indemnity Resolution being passed. 


141    Sec ond, at the 17 February 2009 MC Meeting, Gary Oon had made a separate point that defamation was a “voluntary ac t”, so “the person should be responsible for what he says”. In effec t, Gary Oon’s point was that the c apac ity in whic h the MC member had made the statements did not matter and that all liability arising pursuant to a defamation suit should be borne by that member personally. However, this point was not made by Gary Oon at the earlier 14 January 2009 MC Meeting, whilst Eric Ng had made it abundantly c lear that the c apac ity of the person did matter as the Club would only c over liability that oc c urred in the disc harge of the MC member’s duties and responsibilities (see [124] above). 

142    Third, Gary Oon’s real objec tion to the Indemnity Resolution after the disc losure of the 14 January 2009 Members Letter was to having the Indemnity Resolution c over defamation ac tions. Although he had tried to argue that the passing of the Indemnity Resolution was not unanimous, the basis for his objec tion was having the Indemnity Resolution c over defamation ac tions and not that the Indemnity Resolution should be revoked in its entirety. In other words, Gary Oon still wanted to have an indemnity from the Club for other ac ts undertaken as an MC member. This is evident in the minutes of the 17 February 2009 MC Meeting where he was exc luded, at his request, “for all defamation suits” and at the 2009 AGM where he onc e again made the point that the Club funds should not be used for defamation suits. The 14 January 2009 Members Letter thus swayed Gary Oon’s original dec ision in passing the Indemnity Resolution in so far as it c overed defamation ac tions, but it did not c hange his dec ision that an Indemnity Resolution should still be adopted by the 2008 MC, albeit in a more limited manner. 

143    Fourth, as disc ussed at [67]–[76] above, the Indemnity Resolution c ould have been resc inded at any time so long as the requisite majority of the 2008 MC members voted to do so at a subsequent MC meeting. However, this step was never taken by the 2008 MC even though the 2008 MC would have had known of the 14 January 2009 Members Letter by 17 February 2009 at the latest. 

144    In c onc lusion, I find that the non-disc losure of the 14 January Members Letter was immaterial to the outc ome of the Indemnity Resolution. From the evidenc e, it was material to only one person in the 2008 MC (Gary Oon) and even then, Gary Oon only sought to limit the sc ope of the Indemnity Resolution and not to have it revoked in its entirety. No ac tion was taken by any other member of the 2008 MC to move for the revoc ation of the Indemnity Resolution. Furthermore, a single member’s opposition to the Indemnity Resolution would have made no differenc e to the Indemnity Resolution being passed. 

_Were the 2008 MC members deceived?_ 

145    The Club made the further point that the Plaintiff and Eric Ng had proc ured the passing of the Indemnity Resolution through sharp prac tic e and unc onsc ionable c onduc t. In this regard, however, the Club’s c ase remained premised upon the 2008 MC having passed the Indemnity Resolution on a mistaken basis. The Club did not rely on a free-standing doc trine of unc onsc ionability, whic h in any event, I note it did not plead. As the Club has failed to prove that the non-disc losures were material to the passing of the Indemnity Resolution, the Club’s arguments based on unc onsc ionability similarly have no trac tion. Nevertheless, I make the following brief observations. 

146    First, the Club relied on the question posed by Theresa Kay during the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting to argue that Eric Ng and the Plaintiff had misrepresented to the other 2008 MC members that there were no exc lusions applic able to Suit 33 under the Club’s insuranc e polic y: 


 Theresa Kay: Chairman, c an I just c onfirm? The -I think we renewed the polic y this year, right, I think there’s some exc lusion for some of the MC, right? 

 Eric Ng: No, there is not. 

 ... Theresa Kay: All are c overed? 

 Eric Ng: Yes, yes. 

 ... 

 Eric Ng: All MC are c overed. Why I said that – there’s no exc lusion. [The Plaintiff]: It was agreed that those who are involved in the Suit against the Club in the last one, if they take out the suit again, then it’s not c overed. 

147    I do not think that the Plaintiff and Eric Ng were trying to give the impression that the insuranc e polic y would c over every situation, inc luding a defamation c laim by former MC members (as was the c ase in Suit 33). Suc h a reading takes the evidenc e out of c ontext. Theresa Kay was referring to the ‘Spec ific Matters Exc lusion’ c lause in the insuranc e polic y where defamation c laims brought by members _specifically named_ in the c lause against the Club were exc luded from any insuranc e c overage. The Plaintiff in response c larified that if those same persons sued the Club again, the Club would not be c overed by the insuranc e polic y. This was c orroborated by Eric Ng’s testimony at trial. 

148    Sec ond, the Club argued that the Plaintiff told the 2008 MC that the Insured v Insured Exc lusion applied only in a situation where a c urrent MC member c ommenc ed proc eedings against another. In this regard, they relied on the Plaintiff’s statement during the 17 February 2009 MC Meeting that the insuranc e polic y “does not c over MC members versus MC members... that means you versus me is not c overed”. The Club argued that this was a misrepresentation as the Insured v Insured Exc lusion also extended to c laims brought by past MC members. I am unable to ac c ept the Club’s submission, whic h I note, was ac tually Gary Oon’s interpretation of what the Plaintiff had said. The Plaintiff’s ac tual words do not seem to me to bear suc h a meaning. 

149    Third, the Club argued that Mic hael Ngu thought that one of the reasons why the 2008 MC passed the Indemnity Resolution was bec ause there was insuranc e c overage in respec t of Suit 33 and the Club would therefore not be exposed to exc essive c osts and/or damages. The Club sought to rely on Mic hael Ngu’s affidavit (but filed on the Plaintiff’s behalf) in OS 309, where he said: 

 Our view was that funding the defamation suit was not harmful to the interests of the Club. This is bec ause [Eric Ng] explained to the MC at the MC meeting that the Club had purc hased direc tors and offic ers insuranc e to c over the MC, its exec utive staff and sub-c ommittee members. It was noted that the Club should still be responsible even if suc h insuranc e was unavailable. 

150    I do not agree with the Club’s interpretation of Mic hael Ngu’s affidavit. While Mic hael Ngu did say that the Club had purc hased an insuranc e polic y, he had added that the Club would still be responsible even if suc h insuranc e was unavailable. I do not think that the words here mean that the 2008 MC were under the impression that the Club would only be paying the exc ess over and above 


 [The Plaintiff]: Yah, so what [Eric Ng] says is that even the 50,000, the Club has to bear it. 

 Ashok Sharma: I agree, but bec ause you are doing it in the exec ution of your offic ial duties – 

 ... 

 Ashok Sharma: Even if there was no D&O for a fee, the Club is liable to protec t you for any defamation suit that are [sic ] brought against you in the exec ution of your duty. 

 ... 

 Eric Ng: Yah... you know, we make it very c lear, that this MC rec ognises the fac t, so that, you know, we all know that if the next time or anyone gets sued, you know that you are protec ted by the Club. That’s what this is, this Club gives reaffirmation in, that’s all. 

what the insuranc e polic y was c overing. The last sentenc e of the quote speaks for itself. I therefore do not ac c ept the Club’s interpretation. 

151    Fourth, the Club argued that the Plaintiff gave the impression that the Club was only exposed to liability for $50,000, whic h was the deduc tible under the insuranc e polic y. I ac c ept that the Plaintiff did mention that there was a $50,000 deduc tible at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. However, the Plaintiff’s c omment must be read in c ontext of the disc ussion. First, it should be noted that the issue of the deduc tible was raised in relation to Ashok Sharma’s query as to whether the MC c ould (by passing the Indemnity Resolution) exc eed the indemnity provided by the insuranc e polic y. Immediately after the issue of the deduc tible was raised, there was the following exc hange: 

It is c lear from the above exc hange that the Plaintiff was only saying that the Club would still have to pay $50,000 even if the insuranc e polic y applied. His statement did not go so far as to imply that this was the only payment that the Club would be responsible for. On the c ontrary, it is c lear from the exc hange that followed that the Club remained liable to indemnify MC members even where no insuranc e c overage was available. 

152    Fifth, the Club alleged that the Plaintiff had dec ided to c onc eal the Insured v Insured Exc lusion after seeking legal advic e on it. At this junc ture, I think it apposite to set out the c hain of events that followed the Club’s rec eipt of the insurer’s letter on 13 January 2009, whic h stated that the insuranc e polic y would not c over Suit 33 (see [25] above). On the same day but prior to the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting, the Plaintiff sought advic e on this issue from Legal Solutions LLC, a law firm on the Club’s panel of lawyers. Legal Solutions LLC replied on the following day, opining that the Insured v Insured Exc lusion would apply to Suit 33. On 17 January 2009, BB Khoo replied to Ac c laim (the insuranc e broker), c opying the Plaintiff, Eric Ng and other persons, stating that the Club did not agree with the insurer’s interpretation of the Insured v Insured Exc lusion and would seek a legal opinion on the c orrec t interpretation. On 18 January 2009, the Plaintiff replied to Legal Solutions LLC stating that the Club had taken the view that the insuranc e polic y would c over Suit 33 and that the Club looked to Legal Solutions LLC “to obtain the insurer[’s] c onc urrenc e of the same”. 

153    Essentially, the Club’s argument is that bec ause the Plaintiff had disagreed with Legal Solutions LLC, the insurer and Ac c laim on the interpretation of the Insured v Insured Exc lusion, this was c onsistent with his alleged intention to c onc eal the lac k of insuranc e c overage from the other 2008 


MC members. I do not see how the Club’s argument advanc es its c ase. As noted above, the Club’s c ase on the issue of mistake turns, _primarily_ , on whether the non-disc losure of the Insured v Insured Exc lusion was material to the passing of the Indemnity Resolution and not on the Plaintiff’s motivations in failing to disc lose the Insured v Insured Exc lusion at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting. 

154    As mentioned earlier, the disc ussion during this MC meeting was foc used on the role of the Indemnity Resolution in affirming the Club’s polic y to indemnify MC members for liabilities arising in c onnec tion with the performanc e of their duties and responsibilities as offic e bearers. The sc ope of the insuranc e c overage therefore c arried less signific anc e. Further, I note that at no time did Eric Ng or the Plaintiff represent that the insuranc e polic y would c over eac h and every ac tion of MC members. On the c ontrary, they were c onc erned with emphasising that the Club should c over all MC members regardless of whether the insuranc e polic y similarly did so. 

_Conclusion_ 

155    In the c irc umstanc es, I find that the non-disc losures were not material to the passing of the Indemnity Resolution. There is therefore no basis for me to find that the Indemnity Resolution is void or voidable on the basis of fundamental mistake or unc onsc ionability. 

**_Whether the Indemnity Resolution is voidable for breach of fiduciary duties_** 

156    I c ome to c onsider the Club’s next ground for the rec overy of payments made pursuant to the Indemnity Resolution. This is that the Indemnity Resolution is voidable for various breac hes of fiduc iary duties by the Plaintiff and the other 2008 MC members. To rec apitulate, the Club’s submissions on the point are as follows: 

 (a) the Plaintiff breac hed his fiduc iary duties, as well as Rule 31 of the Club’s Rules, by partic ipating in the disc ussion on the Indemnity Resolution at the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting, when he had a vested interest in the Indemnity Resolution; 

 (b) the Indemnity Resolution was passed to c over the Plaintiff’s liabilities in Suit 33. The Plaintiff’s “c ronies” also had a vested interest in the Indemnity Resolution bec ause there was a real risk of them being implic ated in Suit 33. Henc e, the 2008 MC passed the Indemnity Resolution in the Plaintiff’s interests, as well as their own interests, and not in the Club’s interests; 

 (c ) the 2011 MC re-affirmed the Indemnity Resolution in self-interest and not the Club’s interest; and 

 (d) the Plaintiff breac hed his fiduc iary duties by proc uring payments of his legal c osts when he knew he was not c overed by the Indemnity Resolution bec ause of his own malic e. 

157    This is an opportune junc ture to reiterate my earlier observation (at [88]–[89] above) that it is not evident from the Club’s Defenc e and Counterc laim that the breac hes of fiduc iary duties it now alleges were a c entral plank of its c ase, as they now appear to be in c losing submissions. In partic ular, it is not apparent from the Club’s pleadings that the Club was relying on the alleged breac hes of fiduc iary duties as a basis for invalidating the Indemnity Resolution, and the payments made pursuant to it, if at all. Be that as it may, I will c onsider eac h of the Club’s arguments in turn and deal with spec ific issues relating to the Club’s pleadings where they arise. 

_The Plaintiff’s participation in the discussion on the Indemnity Resolution_ 


## 21. 

## 22. 

158    The Club’s pleadings made absolutely no mention of the allegation that the Plaintiff had breac hed his fiduc iary duties and Rule 31 of the Club’s Rules by partic ipating in the disc ussion on the Indemnity Resolution. The material part of Rule 31 reads as follows: 

 The President, Vic ePresident or any member elec ted as Chairman of a meeting of general members, Management Committee, SubCommittee, Ad Hoc Committee, shall not preside over the disc ussions, partic ipate or vote on any resolution of whic h he is personally involved in any way whatsoever. 

159    In this regard, Mr Seah had objec ted to Mr Tan leading evidenc e on this point at trial as a basis for invalidating the Indemnity Resolution. In response, Mr Tan indic ated that he was not relying on the point to c hallenge the validity of the Indemnity Resolution but rather, he was relying on it to establish a c onspirac y between the 2008 MC members to pass the Indemnity Resolution. It is therefore surprising that the Club has taken the point in c losing submissions in the manner whic h it has. In my view, the Club is prec luded from doing so. 

_The 2008 MC’s vested interest in the Indemnity Resolution_ 

160    In its Defenc e and Counterc laim, the Club pleaded that the 2008 MC were in a position of c onflic t of interest when they passed the Indemnity Resolution. This was bec ause they had all been present at the 2008 MC meetings where the Plaintiff had made the defamatory statements and may therefore be seen as having indirec tly endorsed the statements. Furthermore, the 2008 MC was also involved in the subsequent investigations into the new water system purc hased by the 2007 MC whic h formed the basis of the Plaintiff’s defenc e of justific ation in Suit 33. 

161    In c losing submissions, on the other hand, the Club submitted that the Plaintiff and his “c ronies” had passed the Indemnity Resolution in the Plaintiff’s interests, as well as their own interests, and not in the Club’s interests. 

162    It seems to me that the Club’s c losing submissions represent a deviation from its pleaded c ase. The Club’s pleaded c ase appeared to be premised upon the 2008 MC being in a potential c onflic t of interest position when they passed the Indemnity Resolution bec ause they eac h stood to personally benefit from it. The Club did not plead that the members of the 2008 MC had ac tually preferred their own interests, or the Plaintiff’s interests, over those of the Club when they passed the Indemnity Resolution. If they had, the Club did not identify whic h members had done so in its pleaded c ase. 

163    In any event, I am not satisfied that the Club has disc harged its burden of proving that the 2008 MC had passed the Indemnity Resolution in self-interest or in the Plaintiff’s interest. In this regard, it is striking that the Club’s own witness, Gary Oon gave the following evidenc e in his affidavit of evidenc e in c hief (“AEIC”) as to the 2008 MC’s motivations in passing the Indemnity Resolution: 

 I rec all [Eric Ng] explaining to the MC members that the nature of Suit 33 was effec tively against Freddie’s offic e, as he was exerc ising his duties and responsibilities as an MC member. Therefore, at that time during the disc ussion, the MC members were working under the assumption that the Defamatory Statements were made in the proper disc harge of Freddie’s duties as President of the Club and Chairman of the MC meeting. 

 In my mind, the Indemnity Resolution was thus to protec t MC members when properly disc harging their duties and responsibilities as an MC member. In stating that the Club should defend an MC member being sued for exec uting his duties and responsibilities as an MC member, [Eric Ng] also stated that this was different if an MC member was being sued for a 


 personal reason. 

This is far removed from the Club’s allegations in c losing submissions that the 2008 MC had passed the Indemnity Resolution in bad faith to advanc e the Plaintiff’s interests as well as their own interests. 

164    Further, I note again that seven of the 12 members of the 2008 MC were not c alled as witnesses in these proc eedings. Without their evidenc e, I am in no position to dec ide what were their motivations in passing the Indemnity Resolution. This effec tively leaves the Club’s c ase hanging on its c ase theory in c losing submissions that c ertain members of the 2008 MC were the Plaintiff’s c ronies, and together with the Plaintiff, they had intimidated and hoodwinked the remaining 2008 MC members into passing the Indemnity Resolution. As I found above (at [90]–[102]), this c ase theory does not hold water. 

165    I am mindful, however, that even if the 2008 MC did not ac tually prefer their own interests or the Plaintiff’s interests over the Club’s interests when they passed the Indemnity Resolution, they may nevertheless have been in a position of c onflic t of interest bec ause they eac h stood to benefit from the Indemnity Resolution (see in this regard, the disc ussion at [172]–[173] below). I raised this issue with the parties during the c ourse of oral submissions on 21 July 2014 and I invited parties to file further submissions on this narrow point. Both parties did so. 

166    In these further submissions, Mr Seah c onc eded that as fiduc iaries, the 2008 MC members owed a duty to the Club not to put themselves in a position where their interest _might_ c onflic t with those of the Club. However, Mr Seah said that it does not follow that the Indemnity Resolution should be voidable at the Club’s instanc e. Mr Seah submitted that the passing of the Indemnity Resolution was analogous to the MC dec iding to purc hase a direc tors and offic ers liability polic y for the Club in order to c over liabilities that had been inc urred by the MC in the disc harge of their duties and responsibilities. In both c ases, the MC members would be in a potential c onflic t of interest position as they stood to benefit from the expenditure of Club funds. Mr Seah pointed out that it had always been the Club’s prac tic e to authorise the MC to purc hase insuranc e to c over the liabilities of offic e bearers. Ac c ording to Mr Seah, the Club’s prac tic e in this regard would similarly apply to the MC passing a resolution whic h permitted Club funds to be used to defend MC members who were sued for ac ts done in the disc harge of their duty. 

167    Mr Tan likewise agreed that no c onflic t of interest would ordinarily arise if the MC passed a resolution indemnifying MC members ac ting in the proper disc harge of their duties. However, Mr Tan submitted that the present c ase was different bec ause the entire 2008 MC might have been implic ated in the Plaintiff’s defamation of the Suit 33 Plaintiffs. In _that_ sense, Mr Tan said that the 2008 MC stood to benefit from the Indemnity Resolution and a c onflic t of interest did arise. 

168    With respec t, I am unable to agree with either party’s submissions. To begin with, I do not follow Mr Seah’s analogy between the MC passing the Indemnity Resolution and the MC purc hasing insuranc e. In the c ase of insuranc e, the Club’s liability would be c learly defined and limited. Conversely, the Indemnity Resolution entailed the possibility of the Club being liable to pay the legal c osts and damages of its offic e bearers without limitation. In my view, the Club’s past prac tic e of authorising the MC to purc hase insuranc e for MC members using Club funds c annot be c onstrued as similarly giving the MC the authority to pass the Indemnity Resolution. 

169    At the same time, I do not agree with the distinc tion whic h Mr Tan purports to draw in his submissions. In my view, both fac tual sc enarios posited by Mr Tan would involve a potential c onflic t of interest. The differenc e is one of degree. In this regard, it should be noted that the rule prohibiting c onflic ts of interest is an inflexible one; the rule prohibits both ac tual and potential c onflic ts of 


interest. If the fiduc iary wishes to avoid being liable to his princ ipal, he must obtain his princ ipal’s fully informed c onsent. 

170    This aspec t of the prohibition against a fiduc iary plac ing himself in a position of c onflic t of interest is apparent from _George Bray v John Rawlinson Ford_ [1896] AC 44 where Lord Hersc hell stated (at 51): 

 It is an inflexible rule of a Court of Equity that a person in a fiduc iary position, suc h as the respondent’s, is not, unless otherwise expressly provided, entitled to make a profit; he is not allowed to put himself in a position where his interest and duty c onflic t. It does not appear to me that this rule is, as has been said, founded upon princ iples of morality. I regard it rather as based on the c onsideration that, human nature being what it is, there is danger, in such circumstances, of the person holding a fiduciary position being swayed by interest rather than by duty, and thus prejudicing those whom he was bound to protect. It has therefore been deemed expedient to lay down this positive rule. [emphasis added] 

171    The following passage in Nic holas Briggs _et al_ , _Modern Law of Meetings_ (Jordans, 3rd Ed, 2013), in respec t of a direc tor’s duty to the c ompany (but equally applic able to the present situation) also highlights the stric tness of the prohibition (at para 12.83): 

 Direc tors stand in a fiduc iary relation to the c ompany, and under the general rules relating to suc h a relationship a direc tor c annot (in absenc e of express provisions in the artic les) have a personal interest, whether direc tor or indirec t, in any ac tual or proposed transac tion or arrangement to be entered into by the c ompany without the sanc tion of the c ompany in general meeting or under some dispensation in the artic les. So a direc tor is prec luded from dealing on behalf of the c ompany with himself, and from entering into any engagement in whic h he has a personal interest that c onflic ts ( or may possibly conflict ) with the interest of the c ompany unless c ertain c onditions are satisfied. [emphasis added] 

172    In the c ourse of further submissions, Mr Seah referred to _Goh Kim Hai Edward_ where Judith Prakash J observed (at [114]): 

 ... The purpose of a direc tor’s ac tion must be to benefit the c ompany and not any partic ular individual. If the ac tion does benefit both the c ompany and an individual, the ac tion is not a breac h of duty as long as the c onsiderations whic h led to its enac tment were c hiefly c onsiderations of the interests of the c ompany. If, however, the main c onsideration is benefiting the individual, then the ac tion is taken for an improper purpose. 

Mr Seah argued that the 2008 MC’s c hief c onsideration in passing the Indemnity Resolution was to protec t offic e bearers ac ting in the disc harge of their duties, so as to enc ourage people to serve on the MC. The 2008 MC members therefore did not breac h their fiduc iary duties in passing the Indemnity Resolution. 

173    Even if I were to ac c ept Mr Seah’s assertion as to the 2008 MC’s motivations in passing the Indemnity Resolution, the above c ited passage in _Goh Kim Hai Edward_ does not assist his c ase. There, Prakash J was disc ussing a direc tor’s (or more generally, a fiduc iary’s) duty to ac t honestly, in the c ompany’s best interest and for a proper purpose. Although there is some overlap between this duty and a direc tor’s duty to avoid c onflic ts of interest, it is important to remain c ognisant of the differenc es between the two. On this point, the following passage in _Walter Woon on Company Law_ at para 8.39 is instruc tive: 


 [The rule prohibiting c onflic ts of interest] is related to the rule that a direc tor must ac t in the interest of the c ompany. The two often overlap, for when a director makes his interests paramount, invariably he will not be acting in the best interests of his company. For prac tic al purposes, the rule c an be simply stated: unless he has provided full disc losure and obtained the informed c onsent of the c ompany, a direc tor who ac quires a benefit in c onnec tion with his offic e is ac c ountable to the c ompany for that benefit. [emphasis added] 

From this it is evident that whilst a fiduc iary who ac tually prefers his self-interests will not be ac ting in his princ ipal’s interests, it is not the c ase that a fiduc iary who ac ts in his princ ipal’s interests will never be in a c onflic t of interest position. The prohibition against c onflic ts of interest (real or otherwise) seeks to protec t against the danger (or possibility) of fiduc iaries being swayed by selfinterest. It need not also be established that the fiduc iary had _actually_ preferred his own interests over those of his princ ipal. 

174    I am therefore of the view that the 2008 MC was in a position of c onflic t of interest when they passed the Indemnity Resolution bec ause they eac h stood to benefit from the Indemnity Resolution. There was also nothing in the Club’s Rules permitting the 2008 MC to pass the Indemnity Resolution, suc h as might have signified the members’ c onsent to the 2008 MC passing suc h a resolution. In the c irc umstanc es, both princ iple and prudenc e required the Indemnity Resolution to be put before a general meeting of the Club’s members, for approval by the members, or ratified by them, after it was passed by the 2008 MC. 

175    In my judgment, however, it does not follow that the Indemnity Resolution should be voidable at the Club’s instanc e on this ground based on c onflic t of interest bec ause I find that the Club had impliedly affirmed the Indemnity Resolution through its inac tion over the intervening years. In this regard, the following fac ts (whic h have been narrated in greater detail at [29]–[43] above) merit mention: 

 (a) The minutes of the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting, whic h set out the Indemnity Resolution, were posted on the Club’s notic e board for dissemination to all Club members. 

 (b) On 22 April 2009, a member of the Club, Poh Pai Chin, filed OS 469 against the Club to c hallenge the validity of the Indemnity Resolution. 

 (c ) The Indemnity Resolution and OS 469 c ame up for disc ussion by the members during the 2009 AGM. During the 2009 AGM, the Plaintiff informed the Club’s members that it was always the Club’s prac tic e and polic y to use Club funds to defend its MC members if they were sued in the c ourse of disc harging their duties as offic e bearers. 

 (d) The Indemnity Resolution was again disc ussed by the Club members during the 2010 AGM. This arose from a request by two members for a breakdown of an item in the Club’s audited ac c ounts for the financ ial year ending 31 January 2010 whic h showed that $508,000 had been spent on legal and professional fees. During the 2010 AGM, Tan Wee Tin explained to the members that: (a) a further $350,000 had been set aside for Suit 33 in the Club’s budget for the year ending 31 January 2011; (b) in the event that the Club lost, the Club would have to bear the total c osts and damages itself bec ause it was not c overed by insuranc e; (c ) the total c osts of the Plaintiff’s defenc e would be diffic ult to predic t. After this disc ussion, the Club’s members c onfirmed and adopted the audited ac c ounts for the year ending 31 January 2010 without objec tions. 

 (e) In the Club’s 2010/2011 Annual Report, Tan Wee Tin updated the members on the legal 


 COURT: But is it your position or is it not your position that the indemnity resolution applies to this day. 

 A: Oh, I mean, if, based on all these doc umentation, bec ause there were nondisc losure on the exc lusion, exc lusion c lauses. So when MC agree on this indemnity resolution, they’re not fully aware of all this exc lusion -exc lusion terms. So in that respec t, I think that the resolution is not valid. 

 c osts the Club had inc urred in respec t of Suit 33. It was noted that the Plaintiff’s defenc e in Suit 33 had c ost the Club $920,370 up to 31 January 2011. The Club’s audited ac c ounts whic h were exhibited in the Annual Report indic ated that the Club had spent $551,000 on legal and professional fees during that year. The Club’s members c onfirmed and adopted the audited ac c ounts for the financ ial year ending 31 January 2011 at the 2011 AGM without objec tions. 

 There was no merit in the Club’s allegation that payments of the Plaintiff’s legal c osts were surreptitiously hidden under the item “offic e administration” in the Club’s audited ac c ounts. Jennifer Wee testified in c ross-examination that this was always Club prac tic e. Further, and in any event, this did not prevent two members from asking for a breakdown of the expenditure during the 2010 AGM. 

176    The nature of the EOGM Resolutions also bears disc ussion here. To rec apitulate, the EOGM Resolutions were as follows: 

 (a) that the Club seeks return from the Plaintiff of all monies paid by the Club inc luding legal c osts and expenses arising out of or in c onnec tion with Suit 33 and the Suit 33 Appeals; 

 (b) that no Club funds be authorised to pay for the legal c osts, expenses and/or damages arising out of or in c onnec tion with Suit 33 and the Suit 33 Appeals; and 

 (c ) that the members have no c onfidenc e in the Plaintiff as the Club’s President. 

177    Notably, the EOGM Resolutions did not purport to revoke the Indemnity Resolution, even though it may have been obvious to the Club’s members that the Plaintiff and the rest of the 2008 MC were in a c onflic t of interest position when they passed the Indemnity Resolution. Indeed, during the EOGM, a member of the Club, Chew Swee Leng, expressed doubts about the validity of the Indemnity Resolution bec ause he regarded the Indemnity Resolution as having been passed by the 2008 MC in self-interest. The minutes of the EOGM rec ord Chew Swee Leng as saying that “it was c ommon sense that [the 2008 MC members] are disqualified from voting the same resolution where they have an interest”. 

178    In c ross-examination, Chua Hoe Sing, the Club’s c urrent President, also agreed that the Indemnity Resolution _remained valid_ notwithstanding the EOGM Resolutions, provided there was a proper disc harge of duty by the MC member c onc erned. This is c onsistent with the Club’s pleaded c ase that the Plaintiff’s malic e in defaming the Suit 33 Plaintiffs took him outside the sc ope of the Indemnity Resolution and that the Club had paid his legal c osts under a mistake. 

179    I note that on re-examination, Chua Hoe Sing sought to bac ktrac k from his earlier position by c laiming that the Indemnity Resolution was invalid bec ause the Plaintiff had failed to disc lose the Insured v Insured Exc lusion. When I gave him the opportunity to c larify the apparent inc onsistenc y in his evidenc e, his explanation was as follows: 


 COURT: No. If you, in your proper exerc ise of your duties as president, were to be sued today, will you rely on the indemnity resolution? 

 A: Sorry, if in my c apac ity I’ve been sued -

 COURT: Yes. 

 A: --will I rely on the indemnity resolution? 

 COURT: Yes. A: But as I said, if that exclusion clause, insurance coverage everything is very, very clear, yes, I will rely on it, as a proper discharge of my duty. 

 [emphasis added] 

I do not find Chua Hoe Sing’s explanation to be satisfac tory. In my view, Chua Hoe Sing was shaping his evidenc e in re-examination to re-align it with the Club’s c ase at trial. 

180    It seems to me that by the 2010 AGM at the very latest, the Club’s members: 

 (a) knew of the Indemnity Resolution; 

 (b) knew that the Indemnity Resolution had been passed by the 2008 MC in c irc umstanc es where they stood to benefit from it; 

 (c ) knew that Suit 33 was exc luded from the Club’s insuranc e c overage; and 

 (d) knew that the Club’s funds were being used to pay the Plaintiff’s legal c osts in Suit 33. 

Despite this knowledge, the members _took no steps_ to revoke the Indemnity Resolution on the ground of c onflic t of interest although they undoubtedly had the right to do so. In my judgment, the Club’s members had impliedly affirmed the Indemnity Resolution even if the c irc umstanc es were suc h that the 2008 MC was in a position of c onflic t of interest when the Indemnity Resolution was passed. I therefore hold that the Club is prec luded from now asserting that the Indemnity Resolution should be resc inded on the ground of c onflic t of interest. 

181    In this regard, I find the dec ision of the English Court of Appeal in _Re Conveyances Dated 13th June 1933, 17th August 1933 and 2nd September 1950; Abbatt v Treasury Solicitor and Others_ [1969] 3 All ER 1175 (“ _Abbatt_ ”) to be instruc tive. In _Abatt_ , the c lub’s rules did not c ontain a power to amend or c hange the rules. Over the years, the c lub purc hased several piec es of land whic h were held for the members by trustees. Subsequently, the c lub c hanged its name and adopted a new set of rules. The new rules were sent to all the then members and no one objec ted to the new set of rules. The c lub c arried on in the same way although its membership widened. Some years later, the trustees sought to sell a portion of the land whic h they held on trust for the c lub and an issue arose as to title, _ie_ , whether the property held on trust belonged only to the then members of the c lub prior to its name c hange and the adoption of a new set of rules or whether it belonged to the new members of the c lub. The trial judge held that the property belonged to the old members bec ause there had been a fundamental c hange in the c lub’s c onstitution and the new c lub was a different entity from the old one. 


182    In overturning the trial judge’s dec ision on the issue, Lord Denning MR held (at 1177): 

 In the sec ond plac e, the assoc iation of persons who formed the c lub was the same immediately after the c hange as it was before. It was the same uninc orporated, indeterminate, loose assoc iation of people who enjoyed the benefits of the c lub in the same way. It took to itself a different name and dressed itself up in different c lothes. But, flesh and bones, it was the same body. Soon afterwards it put on weight. It expanded its membership. But all of them, new members and old, c ontinued it as before, living the same life. The property was held for the benefit of the new members just as muc h as the old. There was no fundamental c hange. It is true that the old rules c ontained no express power to amend or alter them. But I should have thought it was implied that the members c ould, on notic e, by a simple majority in general meeting, amend or alter the rules. In any event, however, if at such a meeting a majority purport to amend or alter the rules, and the others take no objection to it—but instead by their conduct acquiesce in the change —then those rules bec ome binding on all. It is like partners who by c onduc t ac quiesc e in a c hange of their partnership deed...or shareholders who by their c onduc t assent to an ac t done by the direc tors beyond their powers... It may be impossible to show that every member of the club knew of the change of rules, but that does not matter. As Brett J said in [ Phosphate of Lime Co. v. Green (1871), LR 7 CP at 63]: 

 " It is sufficient to shew the facts were made known to the shareholders, into the effect of which they might and ought to have inquired, and to which they ought to have objected at the time, unless they intended to adopt the transaction ." 

 In this c ase the new rules were sent round to all the members of the British Legion club. If any of them wished to object, they ought to have objected then. No one did. No one has objected from that time to this. No one objects now. In those c irc umstanc es there has been quite c learly assent by all the members to the c hange. I hold that the title to these properties is validly vested in the trustees as named in the present deed of trust, not in trust for the old British Legion members of 1954, but in trust for all the present members of the Old Castle Club of Ludgershall. I think the judge was in error. I would allow the appeal ac c ordingly. 

 [footnotes omitted and emphasis added in bold italic s] 

183    Applying the above reasoning to the present c ase, even if the 2008 MC was in a c onflic t of interest position when they passed the Indemnity Resolution, I find that the members of the Club had nevertheless affirmed the Indemnity Resolution through their subsequent inac tion. 

_The re-affirmations of the Indemnity Resolution after the CA Judgment_ 

184    In c losing submissions, Mr Tan submitted that the 2011 MC had breac hed their fiduc iary duties to the Club when they re-affirmed the Indemnity Resolution at three separate MC meetings after the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment in Suit 33 (see [46] – [51] above). Given the Court of Appeal’s finding that the entire 2008 MC was determined to embark on a “witc h-hunt” against the Suit 33 Plaintiffs, Mr Tan argued that the risk of the 2008 MC being implic ated bec ame more real. Ac c ordingly, the 2011 MC had re-affirmed the Indemnity Resolution in self-interest and not the Club’s interest. 

185    In my view, there are three main diffic ulties with Mr Tan’s submissions: 

 (a) The Club did not plead that the 2011 MC members had breac hed their fiduc iary duties by re-affirming the Indemnity Resolution. 


## 4.3.2 

## 4.3.2 

 (b) Without the evidenc e of the other members of the 2011 MC, it is diffic ult, if not impossible, for the Club to prove the 2011 MC’s intention in re-affirming the Indemnity Resolution. 

 (c ) I go bac k to several points I had made earlier in relation to the 2011 MC (see [93] above). These relate to the fac t that the c omposition of the 2008 MC was different from the c omposition of the 2011 MC; five of the 11 members of the 2011 MC were not members of the 2008 MC. These five members had no fear of being implic ated in Suit 33. Yet, they had voted in favour of re-affirming the Indemnity Resolution. In this regard, the Club’s assertion that the five new members of the 2011 MC had a vested interest in protec ting the Plaintiff and the rest of the 2008 MC bec ause of their c lose relationships with the 2008 MC members who had nominated them is a bare assertion that was not proven by any evidenc e. 

186    Therefore, even if the Club is permitted to rely on these unpleaded matters, whic h I find that it is not, the Club has not, in my view, disc harged its burden of proving that the 2011 MC had reaffirmed the Indemnity Resolution in self-interest. In the c irc umstanc es, the Club’s c ontentions on this issue must fail. 

_The Plaintiff’s breach in procuring payment of his legal costs_ 

187    This brings me to the Club’s c ontention that the Plaintiff had proc ured payment of his legal c osts in breac h of his fiduc iary duties to the Club. In this regard, the breac h was said to lie in the fac t that the Plaintiff had proc ured the payments knowing that they did not fall within the sc ope of the Indemnity Resolution bec ause of his own malic e. 

188    To prove its c laim, the Club primarily relied on Jennifer Wee’s evidenc e. Jennifer Wee deposed in her AEIC that under the Club’s FOM, the Club’s President and Honorary Treasurer were responsible for supervising the day to day financ ial management of the Club. She said that when payments for the Plaintiff’s legal c osts were to be made, the Plaintiff would provide her with the relevant invoic e, together with “instruc tions” that payment be made. She would then prepare the nec essary payment vouc her and c heque or c ashier’s order for Tan Wee Tin’s approval as Honorary Treasurer. She c laimed that she had ac ted without further instruc tions from Tan Wee Tin bec ause he was already c opied on the Plaintiff’s emails to her. She also c laimed that none of the payments made in this manner were questioned by Tan Wee Tin. Jennifer Wee’s AEIC therefore gave the impression that the dec ision to make payments of the Plaintiff’s legal c osts was effec tively made by the Plaintiff himself. However, the evidenc e in Jennifer Wee’s AEIC did not c ohere with the evidenc e whic h emerged at trial. 

189    First, it is apposite to briefly set out the proc edure for payments made by the Club. For payments made before 12 April 2011, c l 4.3.2 of the Club’s previous FOM provided that: 

 All c heques shall be signed by the General Manager or in his absenc e, the Head of Financ e and c ountersigned by the Hon. Treasurer or in his absenc e, the President, or in his absenc e, the Vic e-President. 

For payments made on or after 12 April 2011, c l 4.3.2 of the Club’s revised FOM provides: 

 All c heques shall be jointly signed in ac c ordanc e to the bank mandate of one signature eac h from [the Club’s Manager and Financ ial Controller] and one signature from [the Club President, Vic e-President, Honorary Treasurer or one spec ified MC member]. 

It is not disputed that the Plaintiff did not sign the c heques for payment of his legal c osts; the c heques were signed by Jennifer Wee and Tan Wee Tin instead. Henc e, it is c lear that the Plaintiff did

not have _de jure_ c ontrol over payment of his legal c osts. 

190    The evidenc e also does not support the inferenc e that the Plaintiff nonetheless retained or exerc ised some form of _de facto_ c ontrol over the dec ision to pay his legal c osts. In this regard, Jennifer Wee suggested in her AEIC that the Plaintiff had instruc ted her to make the payments in emails he sent to her. However, a plain reading of the language used in the Plaintiff’s emails c ontradic ts Jennifer Wee’s assertions. For example: 

 (a) On 16 July 2009, the Plaintiff sent Jennifer Wee an email attac hing an invoic e from D&N whic h said “Dear [J]ennifer, Attac hed is the invoic e from [D&N] for you to follow up”. 

 (b) On 27 Marc h 2010, the Plaintiff sent Jennifer Wee an email regarding the payment of the fees of his expert witness in Suit 33 whic h said, “Dear Jennifer, Please get the approval to pay Mr Yeo for his expert servic es in regards to the suit S33/2009”. 

 (c ) On 8 July 2010, the Plaintiff forwarded to Jennifer Wee an email from D&N, regarding a payment due to the Suit 33 Plaintiffs, and said, “Dear Jennifer, The enc losed email is selfexplanatory. Please do the nec essary and advise D&N ac c ordingly”. 

 (d) On 25 August 2010, the Plaintiff again forwarded to Jennifer Wee an email from D&N regarding the payment of D&N’s fees and said, “Dear Jennifer, Please take note”. 

 (e) On 25 November 2010, the Plaintiff sent an email to Tan Wee Tin whic h said, “Dear Wee Tin,...The MC have agreed (with the exc eption of TJ) who is out of town, that I instruc t [D&N] to proc eed with filing of the Notic e of Appeal as advised by them in the Email below. Please arrange for the sec urity deposit of $20,000 to be remitted to [D&N] ASAP”. 

 (f ) On 5 January 2012, the Plaintiff forwarded to Jennifer Wee, an email from D&N regarding the payment of D&N’s fees and said “Please ac tion”. 

 (g) On 16 January 2012, the Plaintiff forwarded to Jennifer Wee an email from D&N regarding the payment of D&N’s fees, and said “Fyi and follow up please”. 

 (h) On 26 January 2012, the Plaintiff forwarded a c opy of Bajwa & Co’s bill to Jennifer Wee and said “Pse do e nec essary”. 

191    I do not see how the Plaintiff’s emails to Jennifer Wee c an be c onstrued as the Plaintiff instruc ting or approving payments of his legal c osts. Instead, they support the Plaintiff’s position that he was only forwarding invoic es to Jennifer Wee requesting her further ac tion. Jennifer Wee agreed with this proposition when it was put to her in c ross-examination: 

 I’m going to put something to you, Ms Wee, and you c an agree or disagree. I’m going to put to you that it is not quite ac c urate to say that Freddie Koh gave you express instruc tions to make payments to his lawyers. Agree or disagree? 

 Express as in writing, because it’s implied or express. So when email say “Please do the nec essary”, it’s an email, it’s an email in writing. 

 That’s what you mean by express instruc tions? 

 Yes.

 [emphasis added in italic s] 

192    It is also pertinent to note that Jennifer Wee (as well as Tan Wee Tin) did provide an explanation as to why the Plaintiff did not approve payments for his own legal c osts. They explained that the Plaintiff would have been in a c onflic t of interest position if he did so and that this was not permitted under c l 4.1 of the Club’s FOM (whic h remained unc hanged). Clause 4.1 reads: 

 No person, whether employee or offic ial of the Club shall approve any payments of any amount for himself. 

193    In my judgment, it is c lear on the evidenc e that both Jennifer Wee and Tan Wee Tin had relied on the Indemnity Resolution, and not any purported instruc tions from the Plaintiff, when approving payments of the Plaintiff’s legal c osts. Moreover, in the following instanc es, the MC had expressly disc ussed and/or approved the payment of spec ific legal c osts: 

 (a) On 18 August 2010, the 2010 MC approved payment of the sums of $25,613.51, $100,386.49 and $127,613.03 to D&N for work done. 

 (b) On 24 November 2010, the 2010 MC approved payment of the sum of $20,000, being the 


 sec urity deposit for the filing of a notic e of appeal in Suit 33. 

 (c ) On 24 August 2011, the 2011 MC approved the payment of the sum of $20,000 to D&N as partial payment for work done. The MC also noted that the Club had previously paid the sum of $50,000 to D&N as a deposit. 

 (d) On 28 September 2011, the 2011 MC approved payment of D&N’s bill of $120,000 without having it taxed. 

 (e) On 14 Dec ember 2011, the 2011 MC dec ided to appoint Bajwa & Co to ac t for the Plaintiff in the taxation of c osts in Suit 33, the assessment of damages in Suit 33 and in a new suit c ommenc ed against the Plaintiff by former MC members of the Club. Pursuant to the 2011 MC’s dec ision, the Club paid the sums of $15,000, $30,000 and $6,000 to Bajwa & Co. 

 (f ) On 4 November 2011, the 2011 MC members were asked for their approval for the amounts of $15,000 and $15,925.88 from the deposit held by D&N to be off-set against D&N’s bills. Thereafter, there was some disc ussion between the 2011 MC members as to whether suc h approval was required for payment of disbursements. 

194    In this regard, I note that Jennifer Wee’s evidenc e on the issue was evasive. During c rossexamination, she said on several oc c asions that the Indemnity Resolution did not c onstitute a blanket approval for payment. At other times however, Jennifer Wee agreed that the Indemnity Resolution was, in her mind, a standing order when she had c aused the Club to make payment. In my view, Jennifer Wee was shaping her evidenc e to fit the Club’s c ase whilst attempting to avoid putting herself in the invidious position of being in breac h of her duties to the Club as its financ ial c ontroller by blindly approving payments of the Plaintiff’s legal c osts on the basis of the Plaintiff’s instruc tions _alone_. 

195    In c losing submissions, the Club also alleged that Tan Wee Tin had taken a “bac k-seat” when it c ame to making payments of the Plaintiff’s legal c osts. Mr Tan c ontended that sinc e Tan Wee Tin had not given instruc tions for payments to be made, the only other person who c ould do so was the Plaintiff. Mr Tan said that the evidenc e showed that the Plaintiff had in fac t done so. 

196    In my judgment, the Club’s c ontentions are untenable. As disc ussed at [189]–[194] above, the evidenc e establishes that the Plaintiff had neither instruc ted nor approved the payment of his legal c osts. Instead, Jennifer Wee and Tan Wee Tin had c aused the Club to make the payments in relianc e on the Indemnity Resolution, and on some oc c asions, spec ific MC approvals. Furthermore, the Club did not plead or adduc e any evidenc e at trial to prove that Tan Wee Tin or Jennifer Wee were ac ting at the Plaintiff’s behest when they c aused payments to be made for the Plaintiff’s legal c osts. 

197    I should also note that the Club’s pleaded c ase was that the Plaintiff had breac hed his fiduc iary duties to the Club in proc uring payment of his legal c osts bec ause he knew that he was not c overed by the Indemnity Resolution (bec ause of his malic e in making the defamatory statements). It was therefore inc umbent upon the Club to additionally show that the Plaintiff did not _honestly believe_ that he was entitled to rely on the Indemnity Resolution when he had “proc ured” payment of his legal fees. The Club’s c losing submissions were strangely silent on this point. 

198    Another important plank of the Club’s c ase on this issue of the Plaintiff’s alleged proc urement of payment of his legal c osts c onc erns the sum of $1,021,793.48 whic h the Club had paid on 14 February 2012 to the Suit 33 Plaintiffs for their c osts in Suit 33 and the Suit 33 Appeals. The fac ts leading to this payment of $1,021,793.48 were not really disputed at trial. They have been 


summarised at [52] above. 

199    This payment was made after the Club had rec eived the requisition for the EOGM on 18 January 2012 but before the EOGM on 4 Marc h 2012. Mr Tan submitted that the Plaintiff had proc ured the payment with haste, in a bid to c irc umvent the impending EOGM Resolutions. In this regard, the Club c ontended that the Plaintiff had instruc ted Jennifer Wee to make the payment of $1,021,793.48 and relied in partic ular on a sentenc e in the Plaintiff’s email to Jennifer Wee on 13 February 2012 where the Plaintiff said, “we should take the lawyer’s advic e and settle the amounts payable now to avoid ac c ruing interest”. 

200    I do not agree with the Club’s c ontention that this sentenc e should be c onstrued as an instruc tion from the Plaintiff to Jennifer Wee to make payment. To do so would be to c ompletely ignore a later sentenc e in the same email where the Plaintiff added: 

 “[P]lease c onsult with the Treasurer on this matter and if payment is to be made, on booking into whic h ac c ount payment sinc e the payment was due on 31 January 2012, ie in the last financ ial year” 

201    In c ross-examination, Jennifer Wee agreed that the Plaintiff was not giving instruc tions for payments to be made in this email. Rather, he was asking her to c onsult with Tan Wee Tin as to whether the Club wished to pay. When seen in this light, I do not see how the Club c an c ontend that the Plaintiff had proc ured or c aused payment of the $1,021,793.48. 

202    It is therefore not surprising that the Club’s foc us in c losing submissions was Tan Wee Tin’s motivations in having the $1,021,793.48 paid. During c ross-examination, Tan Wee Tin gave three reasons why he had approved the payment in the fac e of the impending EOGM: 

 (a) the Indemnity Resolution c onferred authority to make the payment and there was nothing at the relevant time against it; 

 (b) interest was running on the Suit 33 Plaintiffs’ demand for c osts and he had relied on Bajwa & Co’s explic it advic e in making the payment (see [52(b)] above); and 

 (c ) the EOGM was an issue of Club politic s and it was not c lear whether the proposed EOGM Resolutions would be passed. 

203    Mr Tan submitted that eac h of Tan Wee Tin’s reasons were untenable. In my judgment, even if this were the c ase and Tan Wee Tin had breac hed his fiduc iary duties in approving payment of the $1,021,793.48 (whic h I note was not pleaded), this would not have advanc ed the Club’s pleaded c ase whic h was that _the Plaintiff_ had breac hed his fiduc iary duties to the Club by proc uring payments of his legal c osts. I do not see how Tan Wee Tin’s alleged breac h of fiduc iary duties to the Club would mean that the Plaintiff had also breac hed his fiduc iary duties, unless the Club c ould prove that Tan Wee Tin was direc ted by the Plaintiff to make the payment. The Club had c learly not done so as a matter of evidenc e. I therefore find the Club’s c ollateral attac k on Tan Wee Tin’s reasons for approving payment of the $1,021,793.48 to be irrelevant to the issues at hand. 

204    In the c irc umstanc es, I find that the Club has not proven its c ase that the Plaintiff had breac hed his fiduc iary duties to the Club by proc uring payment of his legal c osts. 

_Conclusion_ 


205    For the reasons stated above, the Club has not established that the Indemnity Resolution is voidable on the basis of the various breac hes of fiduc iary duties whic h it had alleged. 

**_Mistake_** 

206    It remains for me to c onsider the Club’s c ontention that it is entitled to restitution of sums paid towards the Plaintiff’s legal c osts under the law of unjust enric hment, bec ause it had paid these sums under a mistake as to the Plaintiff’s entitlement to rely on the Indemnity Resolution. 

_The law on unjust enrichment_ 

207    Before turning to the parties’ arguments in greater detail, I shall first c onsider the princ iples applying to a c laim in unjust enric hment. 

208    In _Wee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another_ <span class="citation">[2013] 3 SLR 801</span> (“ _Anna Wee_ ”), the Court of Appeal rec ognised a c ause of ac tion in restitution based on the doc trine of unjust enric hment. The Court of Appeal held (at [98]) that three elements had to be proven for suc h a c ause of ac tion to be made out: 

 (a) a benefit or enric hment ac c ruing to the defendant; 

 (b) the benefit or enric hment must be at the c laimant’s expense; and 

 (c ) the defendant’s enric hment must be “unjust”. 

Onc e these three elements are made out, the defendant is _prima facie_ liable to make restitution unless he c an establish one of the rec ognised defenc es to suc h a c laim. 

209    As for the requirement that the defendant’s enric hment must be “unjust”, it should be noted the c ourt does not order restitution based on broad notions of what is fair or just. Instead, the availability of a restitutionary c ause of ac tion will depend on whether a rec ognised “unjust fac tor” at c ommon law exists on the fac ts: _Anna Wee_ at [130] and [134]. It is also apposite to note in this c ontext that the law of unjust enric hment is not premised upon a defendant’s wrongdoing, but rather, the injustic e of depriving a c laimant of a benefit that he has c onferred upon the defendant: _Anna Wee_ at [108]. 

210    To this end, it is not diffic ult to see why mistake is a rec ognised unjust fac tor: _Anna Wee_ at [132]–[133]; _Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2011] 3 SLR 540</span> at [134]–[138]. As explained in K Mason _et al_ , _Mason & Carter’s Restitution Law in Australia_ (LexisNexis Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 2008) at para 403: 

 ...The rec eipt of the money benefits the payee. A mistaken payment is unoffic ious, almost by definition. The destruction of the basis upon which payment was made, through negating the payee’s intention to pay in light of the true facts , leaves the payee as the unintended rec ipient of a windfall whose amount c orresponds direc tly to the c ountervailing detriment of the mistaken payer. The payee’s receipt due to the payer’s mistake makes the payee’s enrichment unjust ... [emphasis added] 

211    The law permits rec overy for both mistakes of fac t and mistakes of law. In this regard, the princ iples governing the rec overy of mistaken payments are c onveniently summarised in Charles Mitc hell _et al_ (eds), _Goff & Jones, The Law on Unjust Enrichment_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2011) at 


para 9-31 as follows: 

 (a) the c laimant must prove as a threshold issue that he made a mistake, ie , that he believed the true fac ts or the true state of the law to be otherwise that they in fac t were; 

 (b) the c laimant’s mistake must have c aused him to make the payment to the defendant, or in other words, the mistake must be a c ausative one; 

 (c ) even if a c ausative mistake c an be shown, the c laimant may be denied relief if he responded unreasonably to his doubts or unreasonably ran the risk of error; and 

 (d) a c laimant who had doubts may be denied relief if he has c ompromised or settled with the defendant or if he is estopped from pleading the mistake. 

212    In relation to the meaning of “mistake”, the High Court of Australia had also suggested in _David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia_ (1992) 175 CLR 133 at 369 that a mistake is not c onfined to a positive belief in the existenc e of a state of affairs. Rather, it c an inc lude “sheer ignoranc e of something relevant to the transac tion at hand”. 

_Application to the present case_ 

213    It will be apparent from the above disc ussion that the issue of mistake in the present c ase turns on the 2008 MC’s intention in passing the Indemnity Resolution and thereafter, paying the Plaintiff’s legal c osts pursuant to the Indemnity Resolution. It also turns on the 2011 MC’s intention in re-affirming the Indemnity Resolution on three separate oc c asions. In partic ular, the issue is whether the intention of the 2008 MC, and that of the 2011 MC, to make payment had been vitiated on the fac ts of the c ase. 

214    As framed, Mr Tan’s submissions on the issue of mistake entailed the following set of propositions: 

 (a) the Indemnity Resolution was only intended to c over c laims against MC members arising from ac ts done or omitted to be done in the proper disc harge of their duties; 

 (b) in Suit 33, the Court of Appeal found that the Plaintiff ac ted with malic e when he made the defamatory statements; 

 (c ) it nec essarily followed from the Court of Appeal’s finding of malic e that the Plaintiff had ac ted outside the sc ope of his duties when he made the defamatory statements; 

 (d) the Plaintiff was therefore not c overed by the Indemnity Resolution; and 

 (e) the Club had made the payments under a mistake. 

215    On the evidenc e, I am unable to agree with Mr Tan’s submissions. 

216    As a preliminary point, I should note that seven of the 12 members of the 2008 MC and seven of the 11 members of the 2011 MC were not c alled as witnesses in these proc eedings. In c rossexamination, Chua Hoe Sing also testified that the Club had not interviewed these MC members as to their intentions in passing and/or reaffirming the Indemnity Resolution. In my view, this substantially weakens the Club’s c ase on the issue of mistake bec ause, as mentioned at [210] above, rec overy of mistaken payments depends on proof that the _subjective intention_ of the payer has been vitiated. 


217    As regards the 2008 MC’s intention in passing the Indemnity Resolution, both parties made submissions to the effec t that the Indemnity Resolution should be interpreted as if it were a c ontrac t. Given my earlier c onc lusion (at [75] above) that the Indemnity Resolution is not a c ontrac t, I will briefly c omment on this submission. In my view, whilst there are parallels between the interpretation of a c ontrac t and the interpretation of a resolution, in the sense that both turn on the issue of the parties’ intention to be determined in the light of the relevant fac tual matrix, it is important to be mindful of the following observations in A D Lang, _Horsley’s Meetings_ : _Procedure, Law and Practice_ (LexisNexis Butterworths Australia, 6th Ed, 2010) (at para 11.3): 

 ...Resolutions are for the most part (as their wording often evidenc es) formulated on the spur of the moment; it is essential therefore to look at the circumstances in which the resolution or proposition was made if it is to be given its fair and natural meaning. It would, ac c ordingly, be misleading to rely only on the bare words of a resolution disengaged from the events that led to, and result from, its being passed and to look for unreason rather than for reason... [emphasis added in bold italic s] 

See also _Myer Queenstown Garden Plaza Pty Ltd and Myer Shopping Centres Pty Ltd v Corporation of the City of Port Adelaide and the Attorney General_ (1975) 11 SASR 504 at 520; _Kenros Nominees Pty Ltd and others v Tipperary Group Pty Ltd and others_ [2009] VSC 524 at [63]. 

218    Bearing this in mind, I am not satisfied that the Club has proven that it had paid the Plaintiff’s legal c osts under a c ausative mistake. 

219    First, the Indemnity Resolution was passed against a bac kdrop whic h suggests that the 2008 MC had intended to c over the Plaintiff’s legal c osts and damages in Suit 33. It was not disputed that although the Indemnity Resolution applied to all MC members, it was prec ipitated by Suit 33 and D&N’s requirement that the Club indemnify the Plaintiff for his legal c osts before D&N would ac t for the Plaintiff. 

220    Sec ond, the evidenc e suggests that the 2008 MC did not intend that the Plaintiff’s entitlement to an indemnity from the Club was in any way c ontingent upon the outc ome of Suit 33. Instead, during the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting, the 2008 MC had grappled with the polic y of the Club _defending_ its MC members. This is reflec ted in the following statements made by Eric Ng during the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting: 

 I’m not using “c overed”, I said “ will be defended by the Club ”, okay. Even if there was no insuranc e polic y, the Club will still have to defend , so we are talking about, yah, we are talking about the Club defending the MC for -when they are being sued in the c ourse of exec uting their duties and responsibilities. 

 [emphasis added in bold italic s] 

221    Likewise, Eric Ng deposed in his AEIC that the MC’s intention in passing the Indemnity Resolution was to c over the Plaintiff, even if a c ourt subsequently found that his statements c onstituted libel or slander. The Club did not dispute this part of Eric Ng’s evidenc e in c losing submissions. However, Mr Tan maintained that the Indemnity Resolution did not c over malic e in the sense found by the Court of Appeal in Suit 33 bec ause _this_ would not have been a proper disc harge of duties. 

222    In c ross-examination, Mr Tan also put to Eric Ng and Loreen Teo that the Indemnity Resolution 


## Q: 

## A: 

was only intended to c over MC members ac ting in the proper disc harge of their duties. They both agreed with this proposition. Mr Tan used their c onc essions as a springboard for his c ase that the MC members did not intend for the Indemnity Resolution to c over malic e. 

223    I do not agree with Mr Tan’s submission bec ause it glosses over other important aspec ts of the evidenc e. The first, as I had just mentioned, is that the evidenc e before me suggests that the 2008 MC did not intend that the Plaintiff’s entitlement to an indemnity from the Club was in any way c ontingent upon the outc ome of Suit 33. 

224    Sec ond, whilst the Indemnity Resolution was passed to c over ac ts c arried out by MC members in the “disc harge of their duties”, the evidenc e before me suggests that the 2008 MC had intended the phrase to bear a broad meaning, rather than the narrow meaning as argued by Mr Tan. The distinc tion drawn by the 2008 MC was between ac ts done in a personal c apac ity and ac ts done in the c apac ity of an MC member. As Eric Ng said during the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting: 

 So now is the – the reason why this is being brought up is to ensure that the MC knows exac tly the position we are in, that even though we are sued individually, as an individual, but because you are sued by virtue of your position here, the Club should cover the cost of defending the MC member , regardless of who he is. 

 So I will rec ommend that the Club should, I think in princ iple and prac tic e, always defend an MC member if that member is being sued for exec uting his duty and responsibility as MC member. If you are sued for your own personal reason, because you called someone a wrong name, that’s too bad. Even though you are MC member, but you are not sued because you were exercising your duty as the MC member. 

 [emphasis added in italic s] 

Therefore, the 2008 MC’s dec ision to defend the Plaintiff in Suit 33 and indemnify him for his legal c osts and liabilities was bec ause he was sued for statements he had made in his c apac ity as President of the Club. There was no suggestion that the 2008 MC had also intended to qualify their dec ision to indemnify the Plaintiff by referenc e to the outc ome of Suit 33 and the findings made therein. 

225    Further, both Eric Ng and Loreen Teo testified that the 2008 MC believed that the Plaintiff was ac ting in c ourse of his duties when he made the defamatory statements. In this regard, Eric Ng’s evidenc e in re-examination is signific ant: 

 Can you tell us, Mr Ng, why after the Court of Appeal has given their judgment, did you reaffirm the resolution? 

 ...The intent of the indemnity resolution is to indemnify the members...And, as far as we were c onc erned, the statements were made in the c ontext of a meeting where he was the c hairman, and his job was to summarise the disc ussion, and, in the proc ess of the summary, he used the words that were deemed to be defamatory. 

 That’s within the c ontext of the meeting. It has been the c lub’s prac tic e to put up all minutes on the notic e board, to let the members know, that’s an ac t of transparenc y in the c lub’s management, and that’s where it bec ame defamatory. So, as far as the MC members were c onc erned, at the time when the statement was made, he was doing his job as president of the c lub. I mean, notwithstanding the c ourt’s dec ision, but our view was he was doing his job as the 


 president of the c lub when --... 

This was Eric Ng’s, and also Loreen Teo’s, explanation as to why the 2011 MC had re-affirmed the Indemnity Resolution after the Court of Appeal’s judgment in Suit 33 and why the Club had c ontinued to pay the Plaintiff’s legal c osts. In this regard, the 2011 MC’s dec ision to re-affirm the Indemnity Resolution and c ontinue paying the Plaintiff’s legal c osts after the CA Judgment was delivered also goes against the notion that the Club had made previous payments under a _causative_ mistake. 

226    In c losing submissions, Mr Tan submitted that the Court of Appeal’s finding of malic e should be determinative of whether the Plaintiff had properly disc harged his duties, and therefore, whether the Plaintiff was entitled to rely on the Indemnity Resolution. Mr Tan said that the MC members should not be entitled to substitute their own subjec tive and erroneous views for the Court of Appeal’s c lear finding of fac t. Mr Tan further submitted that little weight should be given to the 2011 MC’s reaffirmations of the Indemnity Resolution bec ause they were made in bad faith and motivated by selfinterest. 

227    With respec t, I do not agree with Mr Tan’s submissions. The Club’s dec ision to defend the Plaintiff and c over his legal c osts pursuant to the Indemnity Resolution was a private arrangement between the Club and the Plaintiff. Before the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment in Suit 33, the MC was entitled to dec ide for itself whether the Plaintiff was ac ting in the disc harge of his duties as an MC member when he made the defamatory statements. Likewise, after the CA Judgment was delivered, the MC was entitled to take a view on the Plaintiff’s ac tions whic h was different from that of the Court of Appeal in Suit 33. 

228    Furthermore, even if the 2011 MC had re-affirmed the Indemnity Resolution and c ontinued to pay the Plaintiff’s legal fees in bad faith, it did little to assist the Club’s c ase of mistake. If anything, it undermined it. 

229    In this regard, I wish to observe that in c losing submissions, the Club shifted away from its pleaded c ase of mistake and instead alleged various breac hes of fiduc iary duties by the Plaintiff and his “c ronies”, in the 2008 MC and the 2011 MC, as a basis for invalidating the Indemnity Resolution and the payments made pursuant to it. In fac t, the Club went as far as to assert (at para 160 of its c losing submissions) that “the purpose of the Indemnity Resolution was to c over the Plaintiff’s liabilities in Suit 33. The primary purpose of the Indemnity Resolution was therefore to protec t the Plaintiff’s interests and not for the purposes of protec ting the interests of the Club”. In my view, the Club’s new c ase on breac h of fiduc iary duties is at odds with its pleaded c ase of mistake bec ause the new c ase suggests that the 2008 MC and the 2011 MC intended to protec t the Plaintiff in any event. Ultimately, the Club elec ted to run both arguments as alternatives and in doing so, ran the risk of eac h weakening the other. 

230    I also note Mr Seah’s point that the 2008 MC had adopted the Indemnity Resolution with firsthand knowledge of the fac ts and c irc umstanc es in whic h the Plaintiff had made the defamatory statements. The Club did not lead evidenc e to c ontradic t this and buttress its c ase on the issue of mistake. Instead, the Club premised its c ase on mistake almost entirely on the Court of Appeal’s finding of malic e in Suit 33. Had the Court of Appeal not found that the defenc e of qualified privilege was defeated by the Plaintiff’s malic e, the Club’s c ase on mistake would have no legs to stand on. In my view, it would be both artific ial and c ontrary to princ iple to find that the Club had paid the Plaintiff’s legal c osts under a mistake merely bec ause the Court of Appeal had drawn its own inferenc es from the same set of fac ts known to the 2008 MC, and had attac hed the legal label of malic e to the Plaintiff’s c onduc t. 


231    In the c irc umstanc es, the Club’s c laim for restitution on the basis of mistake fails. 

**Conclusion** 

232    For all the reasons stated above, both the Plaintiff’s c laim and the Club’s c ounterc laim in Suit 634 are dismissed. 

233    After delivering my oral judgment on 12 Dec ember 2014, I heard c ounsel’s submissions on c osts. I have c onsidered these submissions. In my view, it would be fair for eac h party to bear its own c osts given my findings of fac t, as well as the outc ome in these proc eedings. 

234    There is a final question as to c osts thrown away. In the middle of c ross-examination, the Plaintiff’s witness, Loreen Teo, c laimed that the Insured v Insured Exc lusion was disc ussed during an earlier part of the 14 January 2009 Meeting whic h had not been transc ribed. Although Mr Seah was in the midst of having the rec ording of this earlier part of the 14 January 2009 MC Meeting transc ribed, he did not inform the Court or his opponent of this. This c aught both the Club, as well as the Court, by surprise when Loreen Teo raised the point in c ross-examination. Proc eedings had to be adjourned for both sets of c ounsel to review the rec ordings and the new transc ripts. This was a matter whic h should have been resolved earlier and not late in the day, in the middle of trial. The adjournment and the additional work nec essitated were disruptive to the proc eedings. I will therefore order that the Plaintiff pay the wasted c osts to the Club, fixed at $20,000 inc lusive of disbursements.
