Tay Yong Kwang J: 

1       In this Originating Summons, the plaintiff seeks an order that the defendant remove the c aveat lodged on 13 November 2006 against the plaintiff’s property c alled Spanners Building loc ated at 6 Changi North Street 1, Singapore (“the property”). Initially, there was also a prayer for an inquiry as to damages sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant’s c aveat remaining on the register. However, as the plaintiff had not rec eived any offer or inquiry in respec t of any sale (with or without a lease bac k) of the property, that prayer was abandoned at the hearing of the Originating Summons. 

**The facts** 

2       The property is held by the plaintiff under a lease from Jurong Town Corporation (“JTC”). The lease is for 30 years (and renewable for another 30 years) with effec t from 1 January 1997. The property was c onstruc ted by the plaintiff spec ific ally for its business of manufac turing elec tric al transmission and distribution equipment. Its land area was some 3205 sq m while its gross floor area was about 4566 sq m. 

3       In early 2006, the plaintiff c ontemplated the possibility of raising financ e for its business by a sale and lease bac k of the property. The lease bac k was required by the plaintiff as it wished to remain on the property and c ontinue its business for a period of time after any sale thereof. The plaintiff initially wanted a lease bac k for 3 years as it had plans to reloc ate its manufac turing operations to Malaysia. For this purpose, the plaintiff appointed a property broker to look for prospec tive buyers interested in suc h a deal. 

4       The defendant was one suc h interested buyer. However, the defendant wanted to lease bac k the property for a 7-year term. The plaintiff denied the defendant’s c ontention that the plaintiff then c ounter-proposed a lease bac k of 3 years with an option for another 3 years. Instead, it asserted that it c ounter-proposed a period of 5 years, unaware at that time of JTC’s polic y of granting subletting approval for not more than 3 years at one time. During negotiations, the defendant proposed a lease bac k term of 5 years and 2 months so as to inc lude the last 2 months of the year 

2006\. This proposal was ac c epted by the plaintiff. 


5       On 24 July 2006, the plaintiff sent a letter to the defendant setting out the terms of the sale and lease bac k of the property. This letter was ac c epted by the defendant on 4 August 2006 (“the Letter of Agreement”). The salient terms were: 

 1 Purc hase Pric e: 

 S$4,423,050 (exc luding GST). 

 2 Option Fee: 

 1% of the Purc hase Pric e. 

 3 Option Period 

 4 weeks to exerc ise option-to-purc hase (“Option”). Exerc ise of Option shall be ac c ompanied by a payment of 4% of the Purc hase Pric e, whic h shall be stakeheld pending c ompletion. ... 

 4 Completion of Sale & Purc hase: 

 1 st November 2006 

 5 Leasebac k by Vendor 

 On c ompletion of the sale and purc hase of the Property, the Vendor shall lease bac k the Property from the Purc haser for a lease term of 5 years and 2 months c ommenc ing from the date of c ompletion of the sale and purc hase of the property as set out in paragraph 4 above at a monthly rental as tabulated below. 

 Period/Year Monthly Rent 

 ... ... 

 6 Sec urity Deposit for Leasebac k 

 The Vendor shall provide the Purc haser a sum equivalent to 5 months’ rental in the form of a banker’s guarantee ac c eptable to the Purc haser ... 

 ... 

 11 Conditions of Sale 

 The sale and purc hase of the Property shall inter alia be subjec t to: 

 (a) ... 

 (b) approvals from JTC and other relevant authorities being granted on the sale and purc hase and lease bac k of the Property. In the event JTC and/or any relevant authority impose any c ondition, the Vendor is obliged to c omply at its c osts and expense to the satisfac tion of JTC and/or any relevant authority. 

 ... 


 The above sets out the princ ipal terms of the sale and purc hase and lease bac k of the Property. If the parties are in agreement with the terms as set out above, please signify your ac c eptanc e by signing in the spac e below. 

 Upon ac c eptanc e of this letter of agreement, the Vendor shall proc eed to issue the Option to the Purc haser within three weeks from the date hereof. The Vendor hereby ac knowledges rec eipt of the 1% Option Fee ( ). The Purc haser shall issue the tenanc y terms to the Vendor within three weeks from the date hereof. 

After this Letter of Agreement was entered into, the plaintiff dec ided to postpone its plans to reloc ate its operations to Malaysia and ran its business thenc eforth on the basis that it would remain on the property for 5 years and 2 months after the c ompletion of the sale and purc hase. 

6       On 16 August 2006, the plaintiff’s solic itors sent to the defendant’s solic itors a draft Option and a draft Lease. Clause 7.1 of the draft Option reads: 

7\. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 

 7.1 Jurong Town Corporation Approvals: The sale and purc hase for the Property is subjec t to Jurong Town Corporation (“JTC”) granting its written approval (“JTC Approvals”), on or before the Completion Date, for: 

 (a) the sale and purc hase of the Property; 

 (b) a lease of the Property for a term of five (5) years and two (2) months by the Purc haser to the Vendor upon c ompletion; 

 (c ) the Vendor’s sub-lease of part of the Property to Hernis Sc an Systems Asia Pte Ltd for two (2) terms of twenty-four (24) months eac h c ommenc ing from 1st January 2005 and 1 st January 2007; and 

 (d) the Purc haser’s proposed usage of the Property for light industry use. 

7       Negotiations on the draft Option and the draft Lease then took plac e between the parties’ solic itors by c orrespondenc e. On 30 August 2006, the defendant’s solic itors reverted with proposed amendments to the draft Option. While c lause 7.1(c ) was deleted, the defendant’s solic itors left intac t the rest of c lause 7.1. 

8       However, on 19 September 2006, the defendant’s solic itors emailed the plaintiff’s solic itors in the following terms: 

 Our c omments to the latest amended option are as follows: 

 ... 

 (d) Cl 7.1(b): plse add to the c lause to c larify that parties are aware that JTC c urrently grants subletting c onsent on 3-yearly basis and parties are to apply for further subletting c onsent subsequently to see through the lease term of 5 years 2 mths. 

The email also stated that c lause 7.1(c ) was not ac c eptable to the defendant as it was doubtful that JTC would grant c onsent for the plaintiff to further sublet. It also proposed the deletion of 


c lause 7.1(d) as being unnec essary in the c irc umstanc es. 

9       On 13 Oc tober 2006, the defendant’s solic itors sent to the plaintiff’s solic itors a c opy of the draft Option with various amendments made, inc luding the deletion of c lauses 7.1(b) and (c ), with an annotation that the defendant’s position in respec t of these two c lauses remained unc hanged and “thus these are not ac c eptable for the reasons mentioned at the meeting”. 

10     On 13 November 2006, the defendant lodged a c aveat against the property stating that it was “c laiming an estate or interest in the land as purc haser”. On 6 Dec ember 2006, JTC c onfirmed by email that it would only approve a maximum period of 3 years for subletting. The plaintiff negotiated further with the defendant on the _impasse_ relating to the draft Option but no resolution was reac hed. 

11     On 8 February 2007, the plaintiff’s solic itors forwarded to the defendant’s solic itors an amended c opy of the draft Option in whic h the said c lause 7.1(b) was reinstated. On 8 Marc h 2007, the defendant’s solic itors replied, stating: 

 If the Vendor is able to proc ure JTC approval on a leasebac k of 5 years and 2 months, we will have no objec tion for the Vendor to subjec t the sale to the same, otherwise, a provision should be added to express that the Vendor is fully aware of JTC’s prevailing polic ies on subletting and approval will only be granted on a three-yearly basis. 

12     Where the draft Lease prepared by the plaintiff’s solic itors was c onc erned, the defendant’s solic itors made various amendments, inc luding the insertion of a c lause 18 (b) in the following terms: 

 If for whatever reasons, [JTC] grants approval to the lease of the Property on a shorter tenure (hereinafter referred to as “the Approved Lease Tenure”) than the Term, the parties agree that it shall not in anyway affec t or prejudic e the lease of the Property or any of the terms and c onditions governing the lease of the Property for the Term as set out in this Agreement and the Tenant hereby agrees with the Landlord to proc eed with making a subsequent applic ation at least six (6) months prior to the expiry of the Approved Lease Term for further [JTC] Approval and where nec essary make suc h further applic ation(s) of the same at the appropriate time so as to fulfil the lease duration in ac c ordanc e with the Term suc h that there will be no break in the lease of the Property by the Tenant at any time during the Term. 

However, the plaintiff c ould not agree with the insertion of this c lause as the Letter of Agreement provided for a lease bac k of 5 years and 2 months. The defendant, in turn, was not agreeable to its deletion and another stalemate ensued. 

13     On 11 April 2007, the plaintiff dec ided that negotiations had gone on long enough and informed the defendant that if the parties c ould not agree on the terms and c onditions for the option to purc hase and the lease agreement, the plaintiff was amenable to c all off the deal. It added that if the defendant wished to proc eed with the sale and purc hase, the plaintiff would issue the option to purc hase in ac c ordanc e with the Letter of Agreement and the terms and c onditions agreed thus far. 

14     Despite having been granted an extension of time to respond, the defendant’s solic itors did not reply by the due date. On 24 April 2007, the plaintiff’s solic itors issued to the defendant an option to purc hase whic h was in ac c ordanc e with the terms and c onditions of the Letter of Agreement. That same day, the defendant’s newly appointed solic itors (the present solic itors on rec ord) replied to the plaintiff’s solic itors’ earlier letter of 11 April 2007 stating that they had only been instruc ted rec ently and requesting an extension of time to respond. This reply was seen by the plaintiff’s solic itors only after the option to purc hase was issued. 


15     Later that day, the defendant’s solic itors (i.e. the present solic itors from here on) replied to say that it was a breac h on the plaintiff’s part to issue an option to purc hase whic h did not properly reflec t the agreement of the parties. The plaintiff’s solic itors naturally asserted that the option to purc hase was in c omplianc e with the parties’ agreement. The defendant’s solic itors retorted that at no time was the defendant unable to c omply with the lease bac k term of 5 years and 2 months, reiterating the proposal that JTC’s approval would be sought in two stages to make up the agreed term. This was rejec ted again by the plaintiff whic h was then ac c used by the defendant of imposing unilaterally a c ondition prec edent (that JTC approval be obtained for a 5 year 2 month lease) where none had been agreed upon. The defendant’s solic itors asked whether it was the plaintiff’s position that it would seek to abort the deal if JTC granted approval for 3 years initially. This pointed question was not answered. The defendant’s solic itors also wrote to reiterate its c ommitment to the 5 year 2 month lease bac k and to state that prior to c ompletion of the sale and purc hase of the property, it c ould not apply to JTC for approval for the lease bac k anyway. 

16     The option to purc hase had to be exerc ised within 4 weeks from 24 April 2007 (i.e. by 22 May 2007). Sinc e it was not exerc ised by the deadline, the plaintiff’s solic itors wrote to the defendant’s solic itors on 23 May 2007 requesting that the defendant’s c aveat on the property be withdrawn by 29 May 2007 as the defendant had no c aveatable interest. The defendant has not done so, thus nec essitating the issue of this Originating Summons. 

17     At the first hearing of this Originating Summons, I direc ted the parties to seek c larific ation from JTC on its polic y on approving subletting in situations suc h as the present c ase. On 21 November 2007, the plaintiff’s solic itors wrote to JTC to enquire the following: 

 (1) Whether an applic ation for your approval for the lease bac k of the property c an be made by the parties prior to c ompletion; 

 (2) Whether you will grant approval for the lease bac k of the property for the term of 5 years and 2 months on c ompletion; and 

 (3) If approval for the lease bac k of the property will be granted for a term of only 3 years, when c an the parties seek approval for the balanc e of 2 years 2 months. 

18     On 13 Dec ember 2007, JTC replied: 

 ... 

 2 The permitted predominant usage for the property, like the majority of properties leased by us, is industrial. Therefore, all owners/lessees of industrial properties have to engage in industrial ac tivities. Other than the approved REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) c ompanies, there shall not be any form of sales and leasebac k arrangement between individual c ompanies. 

 3 Generally, under our subletting polic ies, subjec t to our prior written c onsent, our lessees are permitted to sublet their properties. Our subletting polic ies and proc edures may be viewed at our website at ‘www.jtc .gov.sg’ under the following links – ‘Polic ies – Lease management – Subletting – Subletting handbook’. 

It is not in dispute that the defendant, a limited exempt private c ompany, is not a REIT. 

**The plaintiff’s arguments** 


19     The plaintiff relied on s 127 of the Land Titles Ac t (“LTA”) (Cap 157) whic h provides: 

 At any time after the lodgement of a c aveat, the c aveatee may summon the c aveator to attend before the c ourt to show c ause why the c aveat should not be withdrawn or otherwise removed, and the c ourt may make suc h order, either ex parte or otherwise, as seems just. 

20     The plaintiff submitted that c lause 5 of the Letter of Agreement plainly provided for a lease bac k of 5 years and 2 months on c ompletion with the monthly rental for eac h of the years agreed upon. Even the defendant ac knowledged that the lease period was c ritic al as it would affec t its yield from the property after the sale. The lease bac k term was therefore a princ ipal term of the Letter of Agreement. 

21     Both parties were apparently unaware of JTC’s polic y on subletting when they signed the Letter of Agreement. What they would have agreed upon if they had known of suc h polic y at the time of signing the Letter of Agreement was irrelevant for present purposes. 

22     The defendant was not able to provide a lease bac k for the stipulated period on c ompletion. This was obvious from its attempts at deleting c lause 7.1(b) in the draft Option. The defendant was not entitled to rewrite the terms by demanding that the plaintiff ac c ept a lease bac k of 3 years first and await future approval for the remaining 2 years and 2 months. JTC has not given any assuranc e that approval for the remaining term was a c ertainty and neither has the defendant attempted to proc ure suc h assuranc e. JTC’s handbook setting out its subletting polic y stipulated that lessees (suc h as the defendant if the sale of the property is c ompleted) would not be able to sublet should they be served with any letter of demand or be sued by JTC. There was therefore always a risk that the approval for the remaining term may be jeopardized by the defendant. 

23     Clause 7.1(b) of the option to purc hase issued by the plaintiff was in c omplianc e with the Letter of Agreement, c ontrary to the defendant’s assertion that it imposed a c ondition prec edent where none had been agreed upon. As the defendant had failed to exerc ise the option to purc hase by 22 May 2007, it no longer had any c aveatable interest in the property (see _Eng Bee Properties Pte Ltd v Lee Foong Fatt_ <span class="citation">[1993] 3 SLR 837</span>) and should therefore remove the c aveat. 

24     In any event, JTC would not be giving approval for the lease bac k for the agreed term and the defendant would therefore be unable to fulfil one of the c onditions for the sale of the property. Spec ific performanc e was not available until the c onditions for the sale were satisfied. The defendant would not be entitled to c laim spec ific performanc e of the agreement to sell the property and c onsequently c ould not c laim to be the benefic ial owner thereof (see _Chi Liung Holdings Sdn Bhd v AG_ <span class="citation">[1994] 2 SLR 355</span>). 

25     Further, JTC’s reply in response to the query sent by the plaintiff’s solic itors showed that its approval would not be given as the defendant was not a REIT. There was no evidenc e that the defendant would bec ome a REIT before c ompletion. As the c ondition prec edent in c lause 11 of the Letter of Agreement c ould not have been fulfilled by the defendant, the plaintiff was released from the performanc e of its obligations thereunder. 

26     The plaintiff submitted that the defendant had not raised any serious question to be tried. Even if it had, it had not shown that, on the balanc e of c onvenienc e, it would be better to maintain the status quo until trial as it had not even brought any proc eedings to c laim spec ific performanc e of the Letter of Agreement. More than 16 months had passed sinc e the agreed original c ompletion date and some 19 months had passed sinc e the signing of Letter of Agreement. 


**The defendant’s arguments** 

27     Given the plaintiff’s insistenc e that JTC’s approval for the c omplete lease bac k period be obtained, it would appear that the period of the lease bac k was c ritic al to the plaintiff. However, it was the defendant to whom the lease bac k period was c ritic al as it would affec t the yield on its investment in the property. It was the defendant whic h wanted a lease bac k term of 7 years but the plaintiff was prepared to take only 3 years at the start of negotiations, with an option to renew the lease subsequently. 

28     As a matter of prac tic e, JTC grants approval for sub-leases for a maximum of 3 years at one time. Many c ompanies (partic ularly multi-national ones whic h are muc h larger than the plaintiff ) entered into sub-leases of more than 10 years, with approval from JTC sought in tranc hes of 3 years eac h time. So long as the plaintiff as sub-lessee did not c ommit any breac h of JTC’s terms, there would be no reason for JTC not to approve further applic ations for subletting. Suc h applic ations are done on-line. 

29     The plaintiff must have sought approval for subletting to Hernis Sc an Systems Asia Pte Ltd (“Hernis”)(see [6] above) and would therefore be familiar with JTC’s proc ess and prac tic e. It had given no c ogent reason why it was unable to ac c ept an approval for 3 years to be followed by subsequent approval for the remaining duration of the lease bac k period. 

30     The Letter of Agreement did not provide that approval for the c omplete term was a c ondition prec edent. The Letter of Agreement only stated that the property was to be sublet by the defendant after the sale. Clause 11(b) stated that the sale and purc hase was subjec t to JTC’s approval for the sale and lease bac k and therefore both parties were equally bound by JTC’s approval. If the first approval was for 3 years, then that was what both parties would have and it was not open to either of them to insist on a longer period. The grant of approval for 3 years at any one time did not mean that the intended lease bac k was prohibited or invalidated. The Letter of Agreement did not provide that JTC must approve the full term of the lease bac k at one go and neither has JTC stated that it would not grant approval for c onsec utive 3-year terms for subletting. 

31     The approval c ould not be obtained by c ompletion date in any event. This was bec ause JTC required the defendant to be a new “owner” before it c ould make the applic ation and that c ould only be after c ompletion had taken plac e. Therefore it was disingenuous of the plaintiff to insist on an alleged c ondition prec edent that it knew c ould not be fulfilled on two c ounts – JTC’s polic y of granting approval for 3 years at a time and the fac t that the defendant c ould only make the applic ation for approval upon c ompletion 

32     The plaintiff did not allege antic ipatory breac h even after c onfirming with JTC in Dec ember 2006 regarding its polic y on subletting. Instead, it went about in purported fulfilment of the Letter of Agreement while aware of the fac t that the alleged c ondition prec edent c ould never be c omplied with. The defendant alleged that all that the plaintiff wanted was to abort the sale and purc hase and forfeit the 1% of the purc hase pric e paid by the defendant. The defendant proffered two reasons why the plaintiff would want to do this. First, the property market was experienc ing an upturn and the plaintiff c ould potentially make muc h more profit by selling the property to another buyer. Sec ond, the plaintiff c ould have realized that it had failed to take into ac c ount its sub-lease to Hernis whic h was not mentioned in the Letter of Agreement but whic h surfac ed in the c ondition prec edent that the plaintiff sought to impose in its first draft Option on 16 August 2006. The plaintiff had insisted on retaining Clause 7.1(c )(see [6] above) until February 2007 when it was finally deleted. After c ompletion of the sale and purc hase, the plaintiff would bec ome the sub-lessee and JTC would not allow another level of sub-lease between the plaintiff and Hernis. The plaintiff would therefore breac h 


JTC’s c onditions and put its own lease bac k at risk, with the likely result of bec oming liable to both the defendant and Hernis. 

33     The defendant has always been c ommitted to a lease bac k of the agreed period to the plaintiff and has never reneged on this position. It was therefore the plaintiff and not the defendant whic h was in breac h of the Letter of Agreement. The 24 April 2007 Option to Purc hase was not in c omplianc e with the Letter of Agreement and it was inc umbent on the plaintiff to issue an option whic h c omplied. In the meantime, the defendant, having paid the option fee of 1% of the purc hase pric e, was legally entitled to have the c aveat remain on the register. 

34     Insofar as JTC’s response on its polic y in suc h a situation was c onc erned, the defendant argued that it was merely a polic y and not something c ast in stone. The plaintiff c ould not assume that the defendant would be unable to fulfil the requirement that only REITs would be allowed to do a sale and lease bac k (see [18] above) as the option was granted to the defendant “or nominees”. The person involved in the defendant has interests in other c ompanies whic h are interested in the REIT business and whic h have been involved in other properties belonging to JTC. 

35     The defendant has not made a c laim for spec ific performanc e bec ause the same arguments made here would be c anvassed in suc h a c laim. 

**The decision of the court** 

36     I ac c ept that both parties were unaware of JTC’s subletting polic y at the time the Letter of Agreement was signed. In my opinion, c lauses 5 and 11 of the Letter of Agreement, given their plain meaning, support the plaintiff’s position that a lease bac k for the agreed period of 5 years and 2 months must be granted by the defendant to the plaintiff upon c ompletion. Although the defendant was c ommitted to giving a lease bac k for the agreed duration, it was not entitled to insist on granting a partial lease for the time being subjec t to a sec ond applic ation to JTC for approval to be made in due c ourse. It was understandable why c ertainty of duration was c ruc ial to the plaintiff’s future operations, in the same way that it was c ritic al to the defendant’s dec ision to invest in the property. Although I have no doubt that the defendant would make the sec ond applic ation to JTC when the first 3-year term was about to expire, there was always the risk that something c ould go awry in the years ahead and JTC might dec line to grant further approval after the first 3 years. JTC might even c hange its polic y on subletting in the c ourse of that time. As ac knowledged by c ounsel for the defendant, its present polic y is not writ in stone. The plaintiff would not have the c omfort of knowing for sure at the start of the lease bac k that it has the legal right to c onduc t its business on the property for the remaining 2 years and 2 months. 

37     In my view, the Option to Purc hase issued on 24 April 2007 ac c orded with the terms of the Letter of Agreement even if it (the Option to Purc hase) was unac c eptable to the defendant. The defendant c ould have better protec ted its position by inserting a rider to the terms of the Letter of Agreement. As matters stood, if it agreed to do something whic h turned out to be impossible to perform through no fault of the plaintiff, then it has only itself to blame. It was not entitled to attempt to reword the Letter of Agreement in its favour, in the same way as the plaintiff was prevented by the defendant from trying to augment its position by inserting the c lause c onc erning the sublease to Hernis. 

38     By not exerc ising the validly issued Option to Purc hase within the agreed period of 4 weeks, the defendant has forfeited its right to buy the property and c ould no longer c laim to have an interest in the property as purc haser. 


39     In any event, even if the defendant had exerc ised the Option to Purc hase, it was patent that it would not be able to c omply with c lause 11 read with c lause 5 of the Letter of Agreement. As mentioned above, the JTC approval c ontemplated was for the c omplete term of 5 years and 2 months even if JTC dec ided to impose c ertain c onditions as part of its approval. It was not meant to be an approval for part of the agreed term. What the parties agreed on was the c ertainty of a lease bac k, not the c ertainty of another applic ation to be made to JTC for approval in due c ourse. 

40     JTC’s reply to the plaintiff’s solic itors’ query posed a further impediment to the defendant’s c omplianc e with c lause 11 read with c lause 5 of the Letter of Agreement. The defendant is not a REIT. It has alluded to the possibility that it might be c onverted into a REIT in time for the c ompletion of the sale and purc hase but suc h a possibility was too remote without some c onc rete evidenc e that steps were already underway to ac c omplish this. The defendant has also not adduc ed any evidenc e that it would be able to nominate a purc haser c apable of satisfying the requirement of being a REIT. 

41     In _Eng Mee Yong v Letchumanan_ [1979] 2 MLJ 212, the Judic ial Committee of the Privy Counc il held: 

 In their Lordships’ view a distinc tion must be drawn between c ases where the applic ant is the registered proprietor of the land (i.e. the c aveatee) and c ases where the applic ant is some other person who c laims a right to an interest in it. In the former c ase the c aveatee c an rely upon his registered title as prima facie evidenc e of his unfettered right to deal with the land as he pleases; it is for the c aveator to satisfy the c ourt that there are suffic ient grounds in fac t and in law for c ontinuing in forc e a c aveat whic h prevents him from doing so. 

 ... 

 This is the nature of the onus that lies upon a c aveator in an applic ation by a c aveatee under s 327 [of the Malaysian National Land Code] for the removal of a c aveat: he must first satisfy the c ourt that on the evidenc e presented to it his c laim to an interest in the property does raise a serious question to be tried; and, having done so, he must go on to show that on the balanc e of c onvenienc e it would be better to maintain the status quo until the trial of the ac tion, by preventing the c aveatee from disposing of his land to some third party. 

 ... 

 So too in an applic ation by the c aveator under s 327 for the removal of a c aveat, onc e the c aveatee has met the first requirement of satisfying the c ourt that the c laim on whic h his c aveat is based does raise a serious question to be tried, the balanc e of c onvenienc e would in the normal way and in the absenc e of any spec ial c irc umstanc es be in favour of leaving the c aveat in existenc e until proc eedings, brought and prosec uted timeously by the c aveator, for spec ific performanc e of the c ontrac t of sale whic h he alleges had been tried. 

42     In my opinion, the defendant has failed to show any fac tual or legal grounds for maintaining its c aveat on the property. It has lost its right as purc haser and c ould have no right in the c irc umstanc es to seek spec ific performanc e of an agreement whic h it has not c omplied with while the plaintiff has done so. 

43     Ac c ordingly, I ordered that the c aveat be removed by 31 Marc h 2008 unless otherwise ordered. I also awarded c osts of $10,000 for the Originating Summons to the plaintiff. The defendant has appealed against my dec ision.
