**Introduction** 

1       This was an appeal by the plaintiff (“the Debtor”) against the Senior Assistant Registrar’s dec ision dismissing his applic ation to set aside the statutory demand (“the SD”) issued against him by the defendant (“the Bank”). 

2       The debt c laimed in the SD arose out of three guarantees (“the Guarantees”) signed by the Debtor in respec t of banking fac ilities obtained by three c ompanies (“the Borrowers”) from the Bank. The Debtor was the sole direc tor and shareholder of eac h of the Borrowers. 

3       Before me, the Debtor sought to set aside the SD on three distinc t grounds: 

 (a) First, under r 98(2)( d ) of the Bankruptc y Rules (Cap 20, R1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) for nonc omplianc e with r 94(1) in that: 

 (i) the amount of the debt stated in the SD was as of a date earlier than the date of the SD, and/or 

 (ii) the note in Part B of the SD referred to “bankruptc y petition” instead of “bankruptc y applic ation”. 

 (b) Sec ond, under r 98(2)( c ) of the Rules for nonc omplianc e with r 94(5) in that: 

 (i) the SD did not spec ify the nature and value of the Debtor’s property held by the Bank; and/or 

 (ii) the SD reflec ted property that was not property of the Debtor. 

 (c ) Third, under r 98(2)( b ) of the Rules on the ground that the debt was disputed on substantial grounds. 


4       I disagreed with the Debtor’s submissions and dismissed the appeal. The Debtor has appealed against my dec ision. 

**Whether there was non-compliance with r 94(1) of the Rules, and if so, whether the SD must be set aside under r 98(2(d)** 

5       The SD was dated 25 February 2014 but the amount of the debt c laimed in the SD was stated to be as of 20 February 2014. In addition, the note to the Debtor in Part B of the SD stated as follows: 

 If you do not c omply with this statutory demand or set it aside, the c reditor may file a bankruptc y petition against you. 

 If you wish to avoid a bankruptc y petition being presented against you, you must pay the sum demanded ... [emphasis added] 

6       Rule 94(1) of the Rules provides that a statutory demand “shall be in Form 1”. Form 1 is the presc ribed form for a statutory demand and requires the c reditor to state the “[e]xac t sum due as of date of demand”. The note in Part A of Form 1 explains that the partic ulars of the debt must inc lude the “ac tual amount of debt as of the date of the demand”. The note to the Debtor in Part B of Form 1 uses the expression “bankruptc y applic ation” instead of “bankruptc y petition”. For these two reasons, the Debtor submitted that the SD failed to c omply with r 94(1) sinc e it did not c onform to the spec ific ations of Form 1. 

7       The Bank ac c epted that the note in Part B of the SD should have referred to a “bankruptc y applic ation” but submitted that the Rules did not require the SD to state the amount of the debt due on the date of the SD. The Bank submitted that under the Rules, a statutory demand c an state an amount that is different from the amount ac tually owing by the debtor as at the date of the statutory demand; all that is required is that the amount demanded must have ac c rued by the date of the statutory demand. In support, the Bank referred to r 94(2) whic h provides that the “statutory demand shall state the ac tual amount of the debt that has ac c rued as of the date of the demand”. Ac c ording to the Bank, the SD had c omplied with r 94(2) of the Rules sinc e on 25 February 2014, the amount of the debt stated on the SD (whic h was expressed to be the amount owing as of 20 February 2014) had already ac c rued. 

8       I disagreed with the Bank’s submissions. The Bank had to c omply with r 94(1); failure to do so was a ground for setting aside the SD under r 98(2)( _d_ ). Rule 94(1) requires the SD to be in Form 1. Form 1 unequivoc ally requires the SD to state the _amount due as of the date of the demand_. The “date of the demand” referred to in Form 1 has to mean the date of the SD whic h in this c ase was 25 February 2014. In my view, the requirement under r 94(2) was the same – the SD had to state the amount that had ac c rued due as of the date of the SD. It did not make sense to interpret r 94(2) to allow a statutory demand to state an amount due on a date earlier than the date of the demand when this would be c ontrary to what was required in Form 1. This was all the more so when nonc omplianc e with r 94(1) was expressly stated to be a ground for setting aside the statutory demand under r 98(2) whereas nonc omplianc e with r 94(2) was not. 

9       The next question was whether the two defec ts in the SD were fatal. The Debtor argued that stric t c omplianc e with r 94(1) of the Rules was nec essary and submitted that as r 98(2)( _d_ ) of the Rules uses the word “shall”, it was mandatory to set aside the SD if r 94(1) was not c omplied with. Rule 98(2)( _d_ ) provides that the “c ourt shall set aside the statutory demand if ... rule 94(1) has not been c omplied with”. 


10     The Debtor also submitted that stric t c omplianc e with r 94(1) was nec essary bec ause of the “drac onian” and “quasipenal” c onsequenc es of bankruptc y. The Debtor referred to _Re Peh Kong Wan, ex p United Malayan Banking Corp Bhd_ [1992] 2 MLJ 292, whic h was c ited in _Re: Wong Kin Heng, ex parte Imperial Steel Drum Manufacturers Sdn Bhd_ <span class="citation">[1998] SGHC 237</span> at [33]. 

11     I disagreed with the Debtor’s submissions. The Debtor’s submissions meant that any nonc onformity with Form 1, no matter how trivial or inc onsequential, would invalidate a statutory demand. In my view, this c ould not have been the intent behind rr 94(1) and 98(2)( _d_ ) of the Rules. The interpretation of the Ac t and Rules must take “into ac c ount the radic al c hanges the legislation has undergone and the prevailing c onsequenc es of bankruptc y, whic h are far less dire than they used to be” (see _Re Rasmachayana Sulistyo (alias Chang Whe Ming), ex parte The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd and other appeals_ <span class="citation">[2005] 1 SLR(R) 483</span> (“ _Rasmachayana_ ”) at [29]). The legislative intent is to ac c ord “prec edenc e to substanc e over form and/or tec hnic alities” and “any _prima facie_ inferenc e raised by [words suc h as ‘shall’ or ‘must’] may be dislodged after taking into c onsideration the sc ope and objec tives of the legislation and the c onsequenc es arising from alternative c onstruc tions” (see _Rasmachayana_ at [24]). 

12     I agreed with the Bank’s submission that s 158(1) of the Bankruptc y Ac t (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”) applies to situations of nonc omplianc e with r 94(1) of the Rules. It reads as follows: 

 No proc eedings in bankruptc y shall be invalidated by any formal defec t or by any irregularity, unless the c ourt before whic h an objec tion is made to the proc eedings is of the opinion that substantial injustic e has been c aused by the defec t or irregularity and that the injustic e c annot be remedied by any order of that c ourt. 

As noted in _Rasmachayana_ at [27], s 158(1) of the Ac t exemplifies the “underlying philosophy of pragmatism and substantial justic e [whic h] permeates through the entirety of the [Ac t] and [Rules]”. However, lest it be thought otherwise, I would also ec ho the learned judge’s reminder in _Rasmachayana_ at [29] that a more flexible approac h under the new Ac t is not to be “c onstrued as an imprimatur for slipshod prac tic es but rather as a statutory direc tive for judic ial pragmatism”. 

13     The Bank also referred to _Re A Debtor (No 1 of 1987)_ [1989] 1 WLR 271. That c ase involved an applic ation to set aside a statutory demand on the grounds that it was not in the form presc ribed, had overstated the amount of the debt, and the partic ulars of the c alc ulation of the amount c laimed set out in the supporting affidavit were perplexing and inc onsistent with the supporting exhibits. The Court of Appeal refused to set aside the statutory demand bec ause there was no evidenc e of prejudic e to the debtor and no evidenc e to suggest that he would have taken steps to satisfy a nondefec tive demand (at 279D–E). Although the Insolvenc y Rules 1986 (SI 1986 No 1925) (UK) whic h the c ourt was c onsidering are not on all fours with our Rules, in my view, the c ourt’s pragmatic approac h makes good sense. 

14     In the present c ase, there was no evidenc e of any injustic e (let alone substantial injustic e) suffered by the Debtor as a result of the two defec ts in the SD. It c annot seriously be suggested that the use of the term “bankruptc y petition” instead of “bankruptc y applic ation” had c aused any injustic e to the Debtor. As for the amount of the debt stated in the SD, it was c lear to the Debtor what he had to pay to disc harge the SD. Had the Debtor paid the amount due as of 20 February 2015 (whic h was stated in the SD), the SD would have been spent. I therefore c onc luded that the nonc omplianc e with r 94(1) of the Rules in this c ase was not fatal and I dec lined to set aside the SD under r 98(2)( _d_ ). 

**Whether there was non-compliance with r 94(5) of the Rules** 


**_The Debtor’s property under a hire-purchase agreement_** 

15     The Debtor had a c ar that was financ ed under a hirepurc hase agreement with the Bank (“the HP Agreement”). Ac c ording to him, as at the date of the SD, the value of the c ar exc eeded the remaining amount owed to the Bank under the HP Agreement. The Debtor submitted that the c ar or, alternatively, his interest under the HP Agreement, was property whic h fell within the sc ope of r 94(5) of the Rules. 

16     Rule 94(5) provides that: 

 If the c reditor holds any property of the debtor or any sec urity for the debt, there shall be spec ified in the demand – 

 (I) ( a ) the full amount of the debt; and 

 (II) ( b ) the nature and value of the sec urity or the assets. 

Although r 94(5)( _b_ ) uses the word “assets”, it is c lear that the word refers to “property of the debtor”. 

17     The SD did not make any referenc e to the c ar or any interest that the Debtor had under the HP Agreement. The Debtor submitted that, pursuant to r 98(2)( _c_ ) of the Rules, the SD had to be set aside sinc e r 94(5) was not c omplied with. Rule 98(2)(c ) states as follows: 

 The c ourt shall set aside the statutory demand if ... it appears that the c reditor holds assets of the debtor or sec urity in respec t of the debt c laimed by the demand, and either rule 94(5) has not been c omplied with, or the c ourt is satisfied that the value of the assets or sec urity is equivalent to or exc eeds the full amount of the debt ... 

Clearly, the expression “assets of the debtor” in r 98(2)( _c_ ) means the same thing as “property of the debtor” (whic h is the expression used in r 94(5)). Similarly, the expression “value of the assets” has to mean “value of the property of the debtor”. 

18     The question, then, was whether the Debtor had any property under the HP Agreement that was held by the Bank within the meaning of r 94(5). 

19     The Bank first referred me to _Goh Chin Soon v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited_ <span class="citation">[2001] SGHC 17</span> (“ _Goh Chin Soon_ ”). In that c ase, the debtor c ontrolled two c ompanies, Grandlink Group Pte Ltd (“Grandlink”) and Galleries Development Pte Ltd (“Galleries”). Both c ompanies took loans from the bank (“OCBC”) and the debtor ac ted as guarantor for both loans. A statutory demand was issued against the debtor in respec t of the _Galleries debt_. It was argued that the statutory demand did not c omply with r 94(5) of the Rules bec ause it did not spec ify four properties belonging to the debtor whic h had been mortgaged to OCBC in respec t of the _Grandlink loans_. On the fac ts, the Grandlink debt far exc eeded the value of the four properties. The c ourt held that OCBC was not required under r 94(5) to spec ify the four properties in the statutory demand for the Galleries debt. 

20     The Bank submitted that _Goh Chin Soon_ was authority for the proposition that properties held as sec urity for another debt whic h was not the subjec t matter of a statutory demand need not be spec ified in that statutory demand. Ac c ording to the Bank, it followed that the HP Agreement was irrelevant in the present c ase sinc e the HP Agreement was not the subjec t matter of the SD. I disagreed with the Bank’s submission. The learned judge in _Goh Chin Soon_ had dealt with this spec ific 


issue at [10] and noted that r 94(5) appeared to be “wide enough to inc lude all property of the c reditor held by the Bank, inc luding any property held as sec urity in respec t of another debt... bec ause the term ‘any property of the debtor’ is not qualified.” In my view, the _ratio_ of the c ase is that property of the debtor need not be spec ified in a statutory demand _if it is not available to satisfy the debt claimed in the statutory demand_. As the learned judge said (at [11]): 

 ... the intent of rule 94(5) is to make a c reditor dec lare that he holds any asset of the debtor or any sec urity in respec t of the debt c laimed so that the c ourt may asc ertain whether the c reditor has suffic ient sec urity or assets of the debtor that will satisfy the debt in full. However, in the present c ase, the assets held by [OCBC] are not available to satisfy the debt the subjec t of the [statutory demand]. No purpose is served in requiring [OCBC] to spec ify the 4 properties as they were held as sec urity in respec t of a different debt and there is no surplus ac c ruing to [the debtor]. [emphasis added] 

The referenc e to the sec urity being held in respec t of a different debt should be read in c ontext. It was bec ause the sec urity was in respec t of a different debt that the question arose whether there was a surplus available to satisfy the debt. 

21     The Bank next submitted that as of the date of the SD, the c ar was not the Debtor’s property sinc e the owner of the c ar was the Bank. Under the HP Agreement, the Debtor was only a hirer and had not ac quired ownership of the c ar sinc e full payment of the hirepurc hase pric e had not yet been made. 

22     The Debtor did not dispute that legal title to the c ar resided with the Bank. However, he pointed out that under c lause 24 of the HP Agreement (“c lause 24”), the Bank has a right to set off any sums due to the Debtor or to appropriate moneys payable to the Debtor against any other liabilities of the Debtor. He submitted that he therefore had an interest under the HP Agreement whic h fell within the wide definition of “property” in s 2 of the Ac t, whic h reads: 

 ... money, goods, things in ac tion, land and every desc ription of property wherever situated and also obligations and every desc ription of interest, whether present or future or vested or c ontingent, arising out of or inc idental to, property ... 

23     In my view, this submission was misc onc eived. There was no evidenc e that the Bank was holding any sums due or payable to the Debtor so c lause 24 was simply inapplic able. 

24     The Debtor next submitted that although he was not the owner of the c ar, he had an option to purc hase the c ar under the terms of the HP Agreement, and that this option c onstituted property as defined in s 2 of the Ac t. In support, he c ited the dec ision of the Malaysian High Court in _M Hashimi bin Ibrahim v Asia Commercial Finance (M) Bhd_ [2001] 4 MLJ 67 (“ _M Hashimi_ ”). There, the c ourt referred to para 124 of _Halsbury’s Laws of England_ Vol 22 (Butterworths, 4th Ed) and held that the hirer’s option to purc hase in a hirepurc hase agreement was “property” within the meaning of the Bankruptc y Ac t 1967 (Ac t 360) (M’sia) (“Malaysian BA 1967”). The definition of “property” in s 2 of the Malaysian BA 1967 is identic al to that in our Ac t. 

25     I agreed with the dec ision in _M Hashimi_ and held that the Debtor’s option to purc hase under the HP Agreement was “property” within the meaning of s 2 of the Ac t. However, I still c onc luded that r 94(5) did not require the Bank to spec ify the Debtor’s option to purc hase in the SD for two reasons. 

26     First, under r 94(5) of the Rules, property of the debtor must be _held by the creditor_. In the present c ase, the Bank did not “hold” the option to purc hase; the option was held by the Debtor. 


27     Sec ond, I agreed with the Bank that r 94(5) does not apply to _all_ property of the debtor that is held by the c reditor. In my view, property of the debtor held by the c reditor falls within the sc ope of r 94(5) only if it is property that the c reditor is _entitled to apply towards payment of the debt claimed in a statutory demand_. The reason for this lies in r 94(6). 

28     Rule 94(5) requires a c reditor to spec ify in a statutory demand, the full amount of the debt and the nature and value of any sec urity for the debt or any property of the debtor held by him (see [16]). Rule 94(6) of the Rules then states as follows: 

 The debt of whic h payment is c laimed shall be the full amount of the debt less the amount spec ified as the value of the sec urity or assets. 

The word “assets” in r 94(6) is c learly a referenc e to what is desc ribed in r 94(5) as “property of the debtor”. 

29     Rule 94(6) is c lear – the value of the sec urity or property is to be deduc ted from the full amount of the debt and only the balanc e c an be c laimed in the statutory demand. It stands to reason that the expression “property of the debtor” in r 94(5) means property of the debtor that the c reditor is entitled to apply towards payment of the debt, sinc e he is required by r 94(6) to deduc t the value of the property from the total amount of the debt and is only entitled to c laim the balanc e. Requiring a c reditor to spec ify property that he is not entitled to apply towards payment of the debt would serve no purpose. Worse, it would be illogic al and unfair to require him to deduc t the value of the debtor’s property from the amount he c an c laim in a statutory demand if he is not entitled to apply that property towards payment of the debt. 

30     The interpretation that I have adopted is also c onsistent with the dec ision in _Goh Chin Soon_. If a c reditor is not entitled to apply the property of the debtor towards payment of the debt c laimed in a statutory demand, that property would not be available to satisfy the debt c laimed in the statutory demand and therefore would not need to be spec ified in the statutory demand. 

31     I would mention one other point. Rule 94(5) refers to “any property of the debtor _or_ any sec urity for the debt” [emphasis added]. The use of the disjunc tive “or” suggests that the expressions “property of the debtor” and “sec urity for the debt” refer to two different c ategories of assets. I am not sure if this is c orrec t. Sec tion 63 of the Ac t stipulates that a c reditor who is _applying for a bankruptcy order_ is required to either give up his sec urity or deduc t the estimated value of his sec urity from the amount c laimed by him. Sec tion 63 refers only to sec urity; there is no referenc e to any other property. If the only deduc tion to be made when making a bankruptc y applic ation is the value of sec urity, it seems to me that there is no reason why a c reditor should be required to deduc t the value of any other property ( _ie_ , property whic h is not sec urity for the debt c laimed) of the debtor from the amount c laimed in a statutory demand. However, this point was not raised in the present c ase, and as I have not had the benefit of c ounsel’s submissions on it, I shall say no more. 

32     In c onc lusion, the Debtor’s option to purc hase under the HP Agreement was “property” as defined in the Ac t. However, r 94(5) does not require the SD to spec ify the nature and value of this property for two reasons: (a) the Bank did not hold this property; and (b) it was not property that the Bank was entitled to apply towards payment of the debt c laimed in the SD. 

**_The SD referred to property belonging to third parties_** 

33     The SD set out the partic ulars of the debt as was required by the Rules. These inc luded the 


amounts owed by eac h of the Borrowers to the Bank. The amount owed by one of the Borrowers inc luded an amount outstanding under a “Commerc ial Property Loan Ac c ount”. The Debtor noted that r 94(5) of the Rules referred to “property of the debtor”. The Debtor then submitted that sinc e he was not the owner of the c ommerc ial property for whic h the loan had been taken, the SD should not have fac tored in that property. Alternatively, the Debtor argued that if the property were c onsidered sec urity for the debt, then the SD was inc orrec t as it did not spec ify the nature and value of the sec urity as required under r 94(5) of the Rules. 

34     In my view, the Debtor’s submissions were simply misc onc eived. The referenc e to the Commerc ial Property Loan Ac c ount merely desc ribed the loan under whic h there was an outstanding amount owed to the Bank by one of the Borrowers. This outstanding amount was a debt that the Debtor was liable for _as guarantor_. Rule 94(5) had not relevanc e whatsoever. 

**Whether the debt was disputed on substantial grounds** 

35     The Debtor disputed the debt on five grounds and submitted that the SD should be set aside under r 98(2)( _b_ ) of the Rules. Rule 98(2)( _b_ ) states that the c ourt “shall set aside the statutory demand if ... the debt is disputed on grounds whic h appear to the c ourt to be substantial”. 

36     First, the Debtor pointed out that he had signed other guarantees whic h c ould also apply to the same debts and that the total amount under all the guarantees exc eeded the loans to the Borrowers. Therefore, the Debtor submitted, the Guarantees were not binding on him. I agreed with the Bank’s submissions that this did not afford the Debtor any defenc e. It was c lear from the SD that the c laim against the Debtor was based on the Guarantees and did not exc eed the limit provided for under eac h Guarantee. The fac t that he had signed other guarantees was neither here nor there. 

37     Sec ond, the Debtor submitted that he was released from liability under the Guarantees bec ause he had entered into a settlement agreement with the Bank under whic h the Borrowers and the Debtor were permitted to make monthly repayments (“the Settlement Agreement”). Clause 4 in eac h of the Guarantees provided that the Debtor would not be released from his obligation of repayment bec ause of, among other things, any time given or extended by the Bank. I rejec ted the Debtor’s submission that c lause 4 was illegal and against public polic y. As the Bank submitted, suc h a c lause had been upheld by this c ourt (see _Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd v The Timekeeper Singapore Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">[1997] 1 SLR(R) 392</span>). 

38     The Debtor also submitted that the Settlement Agreement did not provide that the Guarantees would c ontinue to be enforc eable in the event of a breac h of the agreement so the Bank c ould not now enforc e the Guarantees against him. I did not agree. The Settlement Agreement provided that in the event of default by the Debtor, the Bank shall proc eed to enforc e its rights against the Debtor inc luding but not limited to instituting bankruptc y ac tion against the Debtor. In May 2014, the Debtor defaulted on the monthly repayments that he had agreed to make under the Settlement Agreement. I agreed with the Bank’s submission that the Bank was entitled to maintain the c laim under the Guarantees against the Debtor onc e he defaulted under the Settlement Agreement. 

39     Third, the Debtor submitted that the Guarantees were not binding as his signatures to the Guarantees had not been witnessed by the Bank’s representatives personally. I agreed with the Bank’s submissions that s 6( _b_ ) of the Civil Law Ac t (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) only requires the guarantee to be in writing and signed by the guarantor. There was no requirement, whether under the Civil Law Ac t or the Guarantees, that the Debtor’s exec ution of the Guarantees had to be witnessed by a representative of the Bank. 


40     Fourth, the Debtor submitted that the Guarantees were not binding as they were not explained to the Debtor and there was no c lause to the effec t that the Debtor had obtained independent legal advic e or that he understood the Guarantees. I agreed with the Bank’s submissions that these did not amount to substantial grounds of dispute. The Debtor was a savvy businessman and there was no suggestion that he did not understand the c ontent of the Guarantees. 

41     Fifth, the Debtor pointed out that he had not initialled on every page of the Guarantees but had only initialled the last page of eac h. He submitted that, therefore, only the terms in the last page of eac h Guarantee were binding on him. The last page of eac h Guarantee c ontained only the governing law and submission to jurisdic tion c lauses. In my view, the Debtor’s submissions on this ground were made in desperation and were wholly devoid of merit. 

42     In summary, the Debtor had not shown any substantial grounds for disputing the debt. By c ontrast, the Bank had shown that the debt was c learly owed. The Bank pointed out that it first demanded payment in Oc tober 2013 and filed a bankruptc y applic ation against the Debtor on 10 July 

2014\. The Debtor did not dispute his liability then. Instead, on 14 February 2014, the Debtor, through his then solic itors, informed the Bank’s solic itors that he intended to fully repay the debt and proposed monthly repayments of $33,000. The Settlement Agreement was entered into on 30 April 

2014\. The Debtor made two payments of $33,000 eac h before defaulting. It was only when he filed the present applic ation in Oc tober 2014 that the Debtor first disputed the debt. I had no doubt that the Debtor was liable for the debt c laimed in the SD. 

**Conclusion** 

43     I dismissed the Debtor’s appeal and ordered him to pay the Bank c osts of the appeal whic h I fixed at $8,000 plus reasonable disbursements. The c osts were fixed on an indemnity basis whic h the Bank was entitled to under the Guarantees.
