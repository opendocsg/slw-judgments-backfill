1       The ac c used, R Sekhar s/o R G Van (“Van”), was ac quitted in the magistrate’s c ourt of 11 c harges of obtaining c redit, by taking up ac c ommodation at the Peninsula Hotel (“the hotel”) and inc urring monthly debts of over $500, without disc losing to the hotel that he was an undisc harged bankrupt, under s 141(1)(a) read with s 146 of the Bankruptc y Ac t (“the Ac t”). On appeal by the prosec ution against his ac quittal, I amended the 11 c harges to a single c harge under the same provision and c onvic ted him of that c harge. I now give my reasons. 

**Background facts** 

2       Van who was an undisc harged bankrupt at all material times, had registered to stay at the hotel as a guest on 4 July 1997. Even though his registration c ard (Exhibit P13) stated that his departure date would be 7 July 1997, he eventually stayed at the hotel for more than one year. 

3       The 11 c harges with whic h Van was c harged were based on monthly summaries of invoic es for the period from 4 July 1997 to 9 November 1998 (Exhibits P14 – P30). Eac h monthly summary of invoic es, save the first, reflec ted the balanc e brought forward from the previous month. Suc h a balanc e was, however, deduc ted from the total hotel c harges as stated in the summary of invoic es for eac h month for the purposes of determining whether Van had inc urred debts of over $500 in that partic ular month. The sums of payment made by Van in eac h month were also deduc ted. As suc h, after the c alc ulations were made, for some months (July ’97, Nov ’97, Feb ’98 and Apr ’98) Van had a c redit balanc e and for some other months (Oc t ’97 and Dec ’97), he inc urred debts of less than $500. The 11 c harges brought against him were for _each_ of the remaining months during his stay at the hotel, for whic h he inc urred debts to the extent of $500 or more. 

**The prosecution’s case** 

4       The prosec ution’s c ase was built around the evidenc e of the main prosec ution witness, one Lee Chia Loo, also known as “Mic hael Lee” (“Mic hael”). Mic hael was the Front Offic e Manager of PeninsulaExc elsior Hotel at the material time. He testified that he was formerly the Front Offic e Manager of Exc elsior Hotel sinc e 1984 and when Peninsula Hotel and Exc elsior Hotel merged, he was promoted to bec ome the Front Offic e Manager of the Peninsula-Exc elsior Hotel, starting from 1 August 


1997\. His duties inc luded the organisation and running of daily operations suc h as the registration of guests. 

5       Mic hael c onfirmed that Van was the same person stated to be “Simon Van” on the registration c ard. He had the opportunity to meet Van onc e in Oc tober 1998, when he had to deal with him over some irregularities in the guest invoic es rendered for the period from April 1998 to September 1998. 

6       The words “pax ac c ount” were endorsed on the registration c ard. Mic hael explained that this meant that the guest would be settling by c ash. The hotel allowed a c redit limit of up to $500. If this amount was exc eeded, the guest would be c ontac ted and asked to settle the payments. Van was, however, allowed to extend his stay at the hotel as a result of his long-term relationship with it, notwithstanding that his arrears had started snowballing. 

7       Ac c ording to Mic hael, Van was eventually loc ked out from his hotel room on 9 November 1998, upon instruc tions from the hotel’s general manager. By that time, the aggregate amount owed to the hotel by Van, as reflec ted in the last summary of invoic es tendered (Nov ’98) was $23,874.94. An ac tion was c ommenc ed by the hotel to rec over this sum from Van. In February 1999, judgment in default of appearanc e was obtained by the hotel. Bankruptc y proc eedings were also c ommenc ed and c onsequently a sec ond bankruptc y order was made against Van on 5 August 1999. Mic hael testified that neither he nor the hotel was aware of Van’s previous status as an undisc harged bankrupt. It was not the polic y of the hotel to c hec k the solvenc y status of its guests. 

**The defence case** 

8       Van testified that he was a regular guest of the hotel from as early as the 1980s. He knew several of the people who were part of the management of the hotel, inc luding the financ ial c ontroller, Mr KK Tay and the assistant general manager, Mr James Loo. He c laimed to have a working relationship with the hotel as he had supplied music ians to the hotel at one stage and had also rec ommended c lients to stay at the hotel. Ac c ording to Van, Mic hael was also known to him, sinc e they had had tea together on many oc c asions. 

9       Van denied that he had ever seen the monthly summaries of invoic es whic h had been tendered as evidenc e. He was not able to rec all having made all the payments reflec ted in those invoic es. He c laimed that he made payments in lump sums, suc h as $1000, $2000 etc. and that they were paid in c ash to the duty managers, c ashiers and even to Mic hael himself. 

10     Ac c ording to Van, he had asked for a proper set of rec ords when approac hed by the hotel to settle his bills. He c laimed that he had notic ed that some amounts whic h he had paid to Mic hael were not reflec ted in the weekly statements issued to him. It was said that the financ ial c ontroller, Mr KK Tay, had also approac hed him about the irregularities in his statements of ac c ounts. Van alleged that Mic hael had not submitted two months’ reports to the ac c ounts departments, nor had he paid over some sums of money whic h were handed to him by Van for the hotel c harges. 

11     Van c laimed that on 7 November 1998, Mic hael had c alled him to his offic e and told him that if anyone asked to whom the money was paid over, Van should say that he gave the money to another duty manager named Hazlinda. Van alleged that he had stormed out of Mic hael’s offic e, after telling him that he c ould not lie and ac c use an innoc ent girl. Van also c laimed that there was a meeting on 8 November 1998 to investigate why the figures were not right and that he had stormed out of the meeting as he was unhappy with the way it was c onduc ted. He agreed with the prosec uting offic er 


that c riminal breac h of trust was a very serious offenc e but c laimed that he did not report the matter to the polic e bec ause of his long-term relationship with the hotel. He further stated that he would put it on rec ord that, onc e the trial was over, he would be making a polic e report against Mic hael. 

12     Van testified that when he was loc ked out of his room by the hotel, all his belongings worth “thousands of dollars”, statements of ac c ounts and invoic es whic h the hotel had issued to him were left inside the room. He disputed the amount as reflec ted in the summaries of invoic es ($23,874.94) and c laimed that he owed only about $7,000 to the hotel. His stay at the hotel had been financ ed by an Indonesian ac quaintanc e of his by the name of Ghani Santoso and also by a c ompany c alled ID Imaging Pte Ltd, where he was working as a development c onsultant. 

13     It was Van’s testimony that the hotel had known of his bankruptc y status but had yet allowed him to stay. It was his evidenc e during c ross-examination that he was a member of a c lub, known as the Booze Members’ Club at the hotel and, when he was adjudic ated bankrupt, he had been removed as a member of that c lub. There was also an artic le in a newspaper regarding a previous c onvic tion of his, whic h mentioned c learly that he was a bankrupt at that time. It was said by Van that Mic hael had even shown him a c opy of this artic le before. 

**The decision below** 

14     The trial judge, relying on the c ase of _Highway Video Pte Ltd v PP_ [2002] 1 SLR 129, c ame to the view that Mic hael’s evidenc e was hearsay and unreliable. As he c ame over to the hotel to work only on 1 August 1997, he c ould not have been privy to the workings of the hotel at the time Van registered to stay at the hotel. The trial judge also took issue with the fac t that the prosec ution had not c alled any of the staff who had attended to Van as witnesses. Neither was any evidenc e adduc ed as to who was the maker of the registration c ard. In the c irc umstanc es, the trial judge was of the view that it c ould not be said c onc lusively that the hotel did not enquire about the solvenc y status of the guests in so far as Van, who c hec ked in on 4 July 1997, was c onc erned. This would, in turn, mean that it c ould not be inferred c onc lusively that, at the time of c hec king-in, Van had not disc losed his bankruptc y status to the hotel. 

15     The trial judge also found the summaries of invoic es to be hearsay and unreliable. Ac c ording to him, it was obvious that Mic hael did not prepare those exhibits. Under c ross-examination, he was unable to testify in detail how the figures in the summaries of invoic es were derived and explained that all financ ial statements were prepared by the ac c ounts department and within the purview of the financ ial c ontroller, Mr KK Tay. Furthermore, the summaries of invoic es were not c ontemporaneous doc uments rendered to Van during his stay at the hotel, but merely extrac ts from them. The original invoic es were not tendered to the c ourt. Mic hael revealed during his testimony that the summaries of invoic es were prepared for the purpose of bringing c ivil proc eedings against Van. It was, furthermore, ac c epted that there were c omputer glitc hes, whic h resulted in irregularities in the guest invoic es rendered for the period from April 1998 to September 1998. The prosec ution did not lead any evidenc e to show who the maker of the summaries of invoic es was and why the hearsay exc eptions in sec tions 32 and 34 of the Evidenc e Ac t should be invoked. 

16     Sinc e the material aspec ts of the evidenc e of the main prosec ution witness were hearsay and flawed, the trial judge had to rely on and take c ognisanc e of Van’s position that he had made disc losure through his prior dealings with the hotel and that the hotel was aware of his bankruptc y status, within the disc losure guidelines formulated in the c ase of _PP v Ong Ker Seng_ [2001] 4 SLR 180, whic h do not nec essarily require a bankrupt to disc lose his bankruptc y at the prec ise moment when 


c redit is obtained. 

17     In not c alling additional witnesses to supplement Mic hael’s evidenc e, the prosec ution took the risk that the c harges against Van would not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The c irc umstantial evidenc e adduc ed by the prosec ution did not disc ount the possibility that the hotel and its management were aware of Van’s bankruptc y status. It was held that the nature of the evidenc e was suc h that it did not lead to the irresistible inferenc e that Van did not disc lose his bankruptc y status or that the hotel was not aware of suc h a status. 

18     In the premises, even though the trial judge found that Van was an evasive witness and had c onduc ted a tenuous defenc e, inc luding making many unmeritorious allegations against Mic hael to attac k his c redibility, he granted Van a disc harge amounting to an ac quittal on the 11 c harges as he was of the view that the prosec ution had not proven its c ase beyond a reasonable doubt. 

**The appeal** The law 

19     It is useful at the outset of the appeal to lay down the provision under whic h Van had been c harged. Sec tion 141(1)(a) of the Bankruptc y Ac t provides as follows :

A bankrupt shall be guilty of an offenc e, if being an undisc harged bankrupt – 

 (a) either alone or jointly with any other person, he obtains c redit to the extent of $500 or more from any person without informing that person that he is an undisc harged bankrupt. (Emphasis added) 

20     In c onsidering this appeal, I was c onvinc ed that the onus lay on the undisc harged bankrupt to show that he had disc losed his bankruptc y status to the proposed lender before obtaining c redit of $500 or more, rather than on the prosec ution to prove that he had not made suc h a disc losure. 

21     It is established law in Singapore that a statute c an, on its true and proper c onstruc tion, plac e a burden of proof on the ac c used to prove the positive of a negative averment. In the leading Court of Appeal dec ision of _PP v Kum Chee Cheong_ [1994] 1 SLR 231, the c ourt, following the approac h in the c ase of _R v Hunt (Richard)_ [1987] AC 352, held that : 

 Where an enac tment prohibits the doing of an ac t save in spec ified c irc umstanc es or by persons of spec ified c lass or with spec ified qualific ations or with lic enc e or permission of spec ified authorities, it is a matter of construction whether the burden of proving the c irc umstanc es, qualific ation, lic enc e or the like shifts to the defendant, and if on the true c onstruc tion of the enac tment, the burden shifts to the defendant it is for him to show that he is entitled to do the prohibited ac t and that burden is not an evidential burden but a legal burden. It follows therefore that in suc h a c ase there is no nec essity for the prosec ution to establish prima fac ie evidenc e of the spec ified c irc umstanc es, qualific ation or lic enc e or the like as provided in the enac tment entitling the defendant to do the prohibited ac t. (Emphasis added) 

22     The c ourt further quoted the following passage of Lord Griffith in _R v Hunt (Richard)_ with approval : 

 ...if the linguistic c onstruc tion of the statute does not c learly indic ate upon whom the burden 


 should lie the c ourt should look to other c onsiderations to determine the intention of Parliament suc h as the misc hief at whic h the Ac t was aimed and prac tic al c onsiderations affec ting the burden of proof and, in partic ular, the ease or diffic ulty that the respec tive parties would enc ounter in disc harging the burden. 

23     Reverting bac k to s 141(1)(a) of the Ac t, in my judgment, there was no doubt that on a true c onstruc tion, the sec tion in effec t prohibits an undisc harged bankrupt from obtaining c redit to the extent of $500 or more, unless he first informs the proposed lender of his bankruptc y status. To my mind, the objec t of the sec tion is indisputably to protec t the person from whom the bankrupt seeks to obtain c redit. The sec tion strives to prevent innoc ent people and business organisations from being misled by a bankrupt’s appearanc e of solvenc y and a promise to pay. Having regard to the intention and purpose of the sec tion, I was of the view that it plac es an obligation squarely on the undisc harged bankrupt to disc lose his status to the proposed lender before obtaining c redit to the extent of $500 or more. 

24     The imprac tic ality of the prosec ution proving the fac t of non-disc losure on the part of the undisc harged bankrupt bec omes evident when one c onsiders the c ase of _PP v Ong Ker Seng_ [2001] 4 SLR 180. In that c ase, with regard to the issue of the proper time and c ontext for a notific ation of the bankruptc y status to be valid, the trial judge was of the opinion that the notific ation must be given in the c ontext of the undisc harged bankrupt obtaining c redit from the proposed lender. I disagreed with her and held (at p 185) : 

 By virtue of s 141(1)(a) of the Ac t, the bankrupt has been spec ific ally tasked with the duty to inform the proposed lender before obtaining c redit. In R v Zeitlin (1932)23 Cr App R 163, it was said that disc losure by the undisc harged bankrupt need not be at the very moment when c redit is obtained, provided it was made at a reasonable time before the transac tion took plac e. As the c ourt in R v Duke of Leinster [1924] 1 KB 311 said at p 316, ‘disc losure must be made in fac t to the person giving the c redit’. Henc e, where notific ation of the bankrupt’s status has previously been c onveyed by the bankrupt (or his agent) to the proposed lender, even in c irc umstanc es extending outside the c ontext of the lending transac tion, then disc losure has been made as a matter of fac t, and no offenc e is c ommitted. Where a bankrupt reasonably believes that the fac t that he is an undisc harged bankrupt c ontinues to feature in the proposed lender’s mind when extending the c redit, then there is no need to inform the lender again. 

25     From the passage above, it c an be seen that the duty of disc losure as required by s 141(1) (a) of the Ac t is satisfied in instanc es where disc losure was made within a reasonable time before the extension of c redit. The disc losure need not be made at the prec ise moment when c redit is obtained or even in the c ontext of the lending transac tion. In the c irc umstanc es, the point of disc losure would be one whic h is fully within the knowledge of the undisc harged bankrupt. This is even more so when the proposed lender is an organisation, as in the present c ase. Only the bankrupt himself would be in a position to know to whom he had disc losed his bankruptc y status and the time and c ontext of the notific ation and therefore c ould prove with ease the fac t of disc losure. On the other hand, the prosec ution may well have to produc e every single employee of the organisation as witnesses in order to prove that the bankrupt had _never_ made the disc losure about his bankruptc y status. 

26     Therefore, in my judgment, there is no doubt that the form, substanc e and effec t of s 141(1)(a) of the Ac t are suc h that the burden is shifted to an undisc harged bankrupt to show that he had informed the proposed lender of his status before obtaining c redit to the extent of $500 or more. By virtue of the sec tion, the bankrupt is spec ific ally tasked with the duty of disc losing his status and, in my opinion, he ought to be vigilant in this regard. As I had pointed out in the c ase of _PP v Ong Ker_ 


_Seng,_ it is in the bankrupt’s own interest that he personally and direc tly inform the proposed lender of his status at the point when he obtains c redit and optimally, suc h matters should be properly doc umented. 

Whether Van had disc losed his bankruptc y status to the hotel 

27     After c onsidering the evidenc e of Van, it was c lear to me that he had not established that he had informed the hotel about his status as an undisc harged bankrupt. 

28     Van c laimed that he had a long-standing relationship and was familiar with the hotel management, as he had stayed at the hotel on numerous oc c asions. This did not, however, mean that he had disc losed his bankruptc y status to the hotel management. I noted that the hotel had a polic y of allowing guests a c redit limit of up to $500 only. If this amount was exc eeded, the guest would be c ontac ted and asked to settle the payments. Had the hotel known that he was an undisc harged bankrupt, I found it most unlikely and c ontrary to c ommon sense that it would have allowed Van’s arrears in total hotel c harges to ac c umulate c ontinuously over a period of one year and four months, notwithstanding his long-standing relationship with it. 

29     Van also c laimed that he was removed from the Booze Members’ Club as a result of his adjudic ation as a bankrupt in the early 1990s. This was, nevertheless, a bare assertion. Furthermore, as pointed out by the prosec ution, the ac tual relationship between the c lub and the hotel was unknown. There was no indic ation that the c lub was, in fac t, a part of the hotel. Van had merely said that “the hotel had a small group of people c oming to drink at the garden lounge”. In the c irc umstanc es, the c ourt c ould not determine that there was an assoc iation between the c lub and the hotel, and _a fortiori,_ that the hotel had ac tual knowledge of his bankruptc y status through the c lub. 

30     Van further c laimed that there was a newspaper artic le on him, whic h mentioned c learly that he was a bankrupt. However, he was registered at the hotel as “Simon Van” and it was not known whether the newspaper artic le had referred to him by this name or whether the hotel knew that “Simon Van” and “R Sekhar s/o RG Van” were one and the same. In the premises, the c ourt would not draw any inferenc e that the hotel knew of Van’s bankruptc y status. In any event, s 141(1)(a) of the Ac t requires the undisc harged bankrupt to _inform_ the proposed lender of his status and he c annot esc ape from this obligation simply by _presuming_ that the latter must have known of his status through some other means, suc h as a newspaper artic le. 

31     In the c irc umstanc es, not only did I find that Van had not informed the hotel about his bankruptc y status, I found his c onduc t, on the whole, reprehensible, bordering on c heating. Based on his long-term relationship with the hotel, he was able to obtain an extension of his stay and had eventually stayed at the hotel for a period of over one year and four months, despite c ontinuous ac c umulation of arrears in hotel c harges. He was ultimately loc ked out of his hotel room on 9 November 1998. At the trial, he c laimed that the hotel, in so doing, had seized his property left in the hotel room, whic h was worth “thousands of dollars”. Nevertheless, at that time when he was loc ked out of his hotel room, he did not report the matter to the polic e or make any effort to rec over his property or negotiate with the hotel to pay the arrears in instalments or for a longer grac e period to settle his payments. It would seem that he had simply left the hotel. As suc h, I disbelieved his c laim that he had left behind property, whic h was worth “thousands of dollars” and found that his ac tions indic ated that he had no intention whatsoever of making any payments to settle the debt owing to the hotel for ac c ommodation and other servic es. 

32     Moreover, when the hotel obtained a judgment in default of appearanc e against him for the sum 


of $23,874.94, he did not attempt to set aside the judgment and instead, waited until the trial to vehemently insist that the amount whic h he owed the hotel was only about $7,000. If this was indeed true, one would have expec ted him to apply to set aside the judgment and put it on rec ord with the hotel that he would be settling the debt owed. However, he was c ontent to leave the matter as it was. When pressed by the prosec uting offic er as to why he had not set aside the judgment, he gave the unbelievable answer that the Offic ial Assignee had advised him “never mind” and that it was easier to negotiate and settle the matter instead. In the c ourse of the trial, he had further attempted to c ast aspersions on the offic e of the Offic ial Assignee, c laiming that over the years sinc e his adjudic ation as a bankrupt, he had seen many different offic ers regarding his matters and that his file was “spun around”. 

Whether Van obtained c redit to the extent of $500 or more on 11 oc c asions 

33     It will be rec alled that Van fac ed a total of 11 c harges, whic h were based _entirely_ on the monthly summaries of invoic es tendered by the prosec ution through Mic hael. The c harges brought against Van were for those months for whic h he had inc urred debts of $500 or more, _according to_ the summaries of invoic es. The ac c urac y and authentic ity of the summaries of invoic es were of _crucial importance_ , sinc e whether or not there was an offenc e c ommitted depended on whether the summaries of invoic es reflec ted a debit balanc e of $500 or more for any partic ular month. 

34     Van had c hallenged the summaries of invoic es on the grounds of hearsay and unreliability. There was no doubt that the summaries of invoic es were tendered to prove the fac ts stated therein without more. Ac c ordingly, sec tion 35 of the Evidenc e Ac t bec ame applic able to determine whether the summaries of invoic es should, nevertheless, be admissible despite being hearsay evidenc e. The sec tion provides for the admissibility of c omputer output as evidenc e of the fac ts stated therein if it is relevant or otherwise admissible ac c ording to the other provisions of the Evidenc e Ac t or any other written law _and_ if it satisfies one of three c onditions listed under subsec tion (1); that the c omputer output is : 

 (a) expressly agreed between the parties to the proc eedings at any time that neither its authentic ity nor the ac c urac y of its c ontents are disputed; 

 (b) produc ed in an approved proc ess; or 

 (c ) shown by the party tendering suc h output that – 

 (i) there is no reasonable ground for believing that the output is inac c urate bec ause of improper use of the c omputer and that no reason exists to doubt or suspec t the truth or reliability of the output; and 

 (ii) there is reasonable ground to believe that at all material times the c omputer was operating properly, or if not, that in any respec t in whic h it was not operating properly or out of operation, the ac c urac y of the output was not affec ted by suc h c irc umstanc es. 

35     Mic hael, through whom the summaries of invoic es were tendered, was unable to explain how the amounts in the summaries of invoic es were derived. He c laimed that Van was a long-term guest and enjoyed c orporate rates. He also c laimed that Van was given better rates and that “they did not go up but went down”. However, he was unable to answer defenc e c ounsel when asked for an explanation for the fluc tuations in room rates for September 1997, February and April 1998. He even admitted that “it may be a possible typographic al error”. It was patently c lear that he was not the one who prepared the summaries of invoic es. He alluded that all financ ial statements were prepared 


by the ac c ounts department and were within the purview of the financ ial c ontroller, Mr KK Tay. During c ross-examination, it transpired that the summaries of invoic es were c reated by extrac ting figures from guest invoic es, the originals of whic h were not tendered in c ourt, for the purposes of c ommenc ing c ivil litigation against Van. To c ompound the unreliability of the summaries of invoic es, by Mic hael’s own admission, he had met with Van in Oc tober 1998 over some _irregularities_ in the guest invoic es for the period from April 1998 to September 1998, c aused by c omputer glitc hes. No evidenc e was led to show that the ac c urac y of the summaries of invoic es had not been affec ted by the c omputer glitc hes. In the c irc umstanc es, there was c ompelling reason to doubt or suspec t the truth or reliability of the summaries of invoic es. Sinc e s 35 of the Evidenc e Ac t was not satisfied, the summaries of invoic es were therefore inadmissible. Without the summaries of invoic es, there was nothing to show that Van had obtained c redit of $500 or more on _11 occasions_ , forming the basis of the _11 charges_ against him. 

36     Notwithstanding this, the rec ord of evidenc e revealed that Van had admitted to owing the hotel about $7,000. In fac t, he had stated c ategoric ally _no less than three times_ during his testimony in c ourt that the amount owing to the hotel was around $7,000 only and not $23,874.94 alleged to be owed. In _Er Joo Nguang v PP_ [2000] 2 SLR 645, I stated that the High Court, sitting in its appellate c apac ity, is empowered through a c ombination of c ase law and statute, to amend a c harge and that suc h a power to amend the c harge will be exerc ised in appropriate c ases where the rec ord of fac ts and the rec ord of evidenc e support the amended c harge, and where suc h amendment does not affec t the substanc e of the evidenc e given in the lower c ourt. In exerc ising suc h a power, the c ourt must ensure that no prejudic e is c aused to the ac c used. 

37     In my judgment, this was indeed a proper c ase for amending the original 11 c harges to a single c harge under the same provision. From the rec ord of fac ts and the rec ord of evidenc e, Van had evidently owed the hotel debts in the sum of around $7,000 during his entire stay at the hotel. The rec ords henc e supported the single c harge whic h I amended to read as follows : 

 You, R Shekhar s/o RG Van.....are c harged that you, having been first adjudged a bankrupt on 16 th February 1990 did, between the period of 4 th July 1997 and 9th November 1998 , obtain c redit from Peninsula Hotel, to wit, by taking up ac c ommodation of the said hotel for the aforesaid period and c onsequently inc urring a sum of about S$7,000 without disc losing to the latter that you were an undisc harged bankrupt and you have thereby c ommitted an offenc e under Sec tion 141(1)(a) of the Bankruptc y Ac t (Chapter 20) and punishable under Sec tion 146 of the same Ac t. 

38     Suc h an amendment did not affec t the substanc e of the c harge against Van, whic h was that he had obtained c redit from the hotel to the extent of $500 or more without informing the hotel about his bankruptc y status. There was no dispute at the trial that a sum in exc ess of $500 was owed to the hotel. Van’s defenc e was that he had made known his bankruptc y status to the hotel. Suc h a defenc e, if indeed believed, would have been a c omplete answer to the amended c harge inasmuc h as it would have been to the 11 original c harges. In the premises, I was satisfied that no prejudic e had been c aused to Van by suc h an amendment. 

39     For all the reasons whic h I have given above, I found Van guilty of the amended c harge and ac c ordingly I c onvic ted him of it. 

**Sentence** 

40     In mitigation, c ounsel for Van submitted that he has to look after his 81-year old mother, who 


was rec ently disc harged from hospital after suffering from heart problems. In addition, he has to support his niec e who will be taking her ‘A’-level examinations. Counsel also submitted that Van has been gainfully employed for two years now and has been paying taxes on his earnings and working hard towards obtaining a disc harge from his bankruptc y. 

41     In _PP v Ong Ker Seng,_ I stated that I agreed with the view expressed in _R v Schefelaar_ [1939] SSLR 221 that in offenc es of obtaining c redit without disc losure, the ac c used is more appropriately punished with imprisonment than with a fine. In suc h c ases, a sentenc e in the form of a fine is generally ineffec tive as the bankrupt is unlikely to have suffic ient funds to pay the fine, whic h would result in someone else (usually family members) having to pay the fine on behalf of the bankrupt. As suc h, I was minded to impose a c ustodial sentenc e in this instanc e. 

42     Hardship on the family as a result of imprisonment is generally not a good mitigating fac tor : _Lai Oei Mui Jenny @ Tan Siew Hong v PP_ [1993] 3 SLR 305. As for the fac t that Van had been gainfully employed for the past two years and working hard towards obtaining a disc harge from his bankruptc y, I was of the view that this was what he ought to have been doing in any event. In my opinion, not only does a bankrupt have a personal interest to obtain a disc harge from his bankruptc y, he also has a soc ial responsibility to do so. As suc h, I did not view this as muc h of a mitigating fac tor. 

43     In passing the sentenc e, I noted that Van’s ac tions smac ked thoroughly of dishonesty. He took advantage of his long-term relationship with the hotel to extend his stay for months on end, and c onsequently inc urred greater c redit than he would have been allowed to. In addition, when he was loc ked out of his hotel room, there was no attempt by him whatsoever to negotiate with the hotel to pay for the arrears in instalments or for a longer period to make the payments. To my mind, it did not seem as if he had any intention at all to settle the arrears whic h he owed, when he left the hotel. I also took into ac c ount the c onduc t of Van’s defenc e. During the c ourse of the trial, he made many allegations against Mic hael to attac k his c redibility, whic h the trial judge found to be wholly unmeritorious. Moreover, he even took the opportunity to c ast aspersions on the offic e of the Offic ial Assignee. Taking all the relevant fac tors into c onsideration, I sentenc ed him to one year’s imprisonment. 

_Appeal allowed._
