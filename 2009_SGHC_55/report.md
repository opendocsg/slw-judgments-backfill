6       Marc h 2009 Judgment reserved 

Tan Lee Meng J: 

1       The plaintiff, The Monarc h Beverage Company (Europe) Limited, an Irish c ompany (hereinafter referred to, together with all its affiliated c ompanies, as “Monarc h”), is the registered proprietor of two trade marks in Class 32 in respec t of “non-alc oholic beverages and juic es”, namely “Kic kapoo Joy Juic e” (TM No T86/05341I) and “Kic kapoo” (TM No T86/05246G) (both marks will be referred to as the “Kic kapoo marks”). 

2       The first defendant, Kic kapoo (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (“KM”), a Malaysian c ompany, was granted an exc lusive lic enc e to produc e and sell “Kic kapoo Joy Juic e” in c ans and PET bottles in Malaysia and Singapore (“the lic enc e agreement”) by Monarc h’s predec essor in title, The Monarc h Company Inc 

(“TMCI”), an Americ an c ompany, in 1996. The 2nd defendant, Kic kapoo Beverage Pte Ltd (“KB”), is KM’s Singapore subsidiary. 

3       Monarc h, whic h c laimed to have terminated the lic enc e agreement, sued KM and KB for infringement of the Kic kapoo marks and passing off. KM, whic h asserted that it is still Monarc h’s lic ensee, c ounterc laimed against Monarc h for breac hing the lic enc e agreement. KM also made a c ounterc laim against Monarc h and four other defendants with respec t to the tort of c onspirac y in relation to the breac hing of its lic enc e agreement with Monarc h and its sole distributorship agreement with, Heng Sheng Company (“HSC”), a Singapore c ompany whose business was subsequently taken over by Heng Sheng Corporation Pte Ltd (“HSCPL”). The parties who allegedly c onspired with Monarc h are: 

 (a) the 2nd defendant in the c ounterc laim, Ying F & B Pte Ltd, whose name was imprinted on China-made Kic kapoo beverage imported into Singapore in alleged breac h of KM’s sole distribution agreement with HSC; 

 (b) the 3rd and 4th defendants in the c ounterc laim, Mr Chia Yong Khoon and his wife, Mdm Yeo Puoy Cheng, who were the partners of HSC; and 

 (c ) the 5th defendant in the c ounterc laim, HSCPL, whic h was formed on 15 November 2004 to ac quire the business of HSC. 


**Background** 

4       The Kic kapoo marks were first registered in the name of Monarc h’s predec essor in title, TMCI. 

5       On 12 February 1996, TMCI assigned its business and its rights to the Kic kapoo marks, to Monarc h. 

6       KM c laimed that it appointed HSC as the Singapore distributor of its Kic kapoo drinks in 1996. However, HSCPL asserted that HSC was appointed KM’s sole distributor in 1998. In that year, HSC appointed PH Sales & Marketing Pte Ltd (“PH”) as its c o-distributor of KM’s Kic kapoo drinks in Singapore. 

7       The Kic kapoo beverage produc ed by KM made inroads in the Singapore and Malaysian beverage market. Indeed, sales of the said beverage in these two c ountries ac c ounted for 90% of Kic kapoo worldwide beverage sales. Kic kapoo beverage sales were also c ruc ial to KM’s business as they ac c ounted for 95% of its total business. 

8       The original lic ensor, TMCI, intended its relationship with KM to be a long-term one. However, relations between KM and Monarc h, to whom the Kic kapoo marks had been assigned, turned sour. 

9       By the end of 2001, Monarc h was quite determined to terminate the lic enc e agreement with KM. On 9 Dec ember 2001, Monarc h served on KM a notic e of termination of the lic enc e agreement without giving any reason for its ac tion. 

10     One day later, on 10 Dec ember 2001, Mr Raymond Chow (“Mr Chow”) of Yeo Hiap Seng (“YHS”), a Singapore c ompany that bottles and pac ks a variety of beverages, requested Monarc h to forward him a letter of appointment so that the terms and c onditions of the proposed agreement c ould be outlined while the legal c ontrac t was being sorted out by Monarc h and YHS. 

11     That Monarc h had already made up its mind to abandon KM was evident. On 11 Dec ember 2001, its representative, Ms Nella Aguf, replied to YHS’ Mr Chow as follows: 

 [I] think we are going to go ahead and cancel the [licensing agreement with KM] anyway and see what happens. 

[emphasis added] 

12     As it turned out, the proposed business relationship between Monarc h and YHS did not materialise. Shortly thereafter, Mr Chow left YHS to join Monarc h as the vic e-president of its loc al subsidiary. 

13     Between Dec ember 2001 and June 2005, Monarc h served six termination notic es on KM, whic h rejec ted the said notic es and affirmed the lic enc e agreement. 

14     On 20 September 2002, Monarc h gave HSC, KM’s sole distributor of Kic kapoo beverage in Singapore, a lic enc e to manufac ture and sell Kic kapoo beverage in Shanghai (“the Shanghai lic enc e”). As all the Kic kapoo drinks made under the Shanghai lic enc e were imported into Singapore and no serious attempt was made to penetrate the Shanghai beverage market, KM asserted that the Shanghai lic enc e was part of a plan to sabotage it. 

15     Just three days after HSC was granted the Shanghai lic enc e, Monarc h informed KM on 


23 September 2002 that as from 1 Oc tober 2002, Kic kapoo beverage bases, from whic h Kic kapoo drinks are produc ed, would be sold to KM at USD 602 per gallon instead of the c urrent pric e of around USD 60 per gallon. This phenomenal pric e inc rease of 1,000%, whic h was unheard of in the beverage market, made it ec onomic ally unviable for KM to produc e any Kic kapoo beverage. Monarc h c onc eded that to date, no other lic ensee has been c harged this exorbitant pric e of USD 602 per gallon. 

16     KM, whic h alleged that this unwarranted pric e inc rease was to c ripple it financ ially and was a serious breac h of the lic enc e agreement, responded by ordering from Monarc h about a year’s supply of beverage bases, whic h amounted to 1,000 gallons at the old pric e. However, Monarc h supplied KM with only 200 gallons. Monarc h did not deliver any more Kic kapoo beverage bases to KM thereafter despite being reminded by the latter to deliver the balanc e of 800 gallons. 

17     Under the lic enc e agreement, KM was required to purc hase beverage bases from “approved” sourc es. In the fac e of the depletion of its beverage bases from “approved” sourc es, KM sought the assistanc e of Mr Joseph Norman Stutz (“Mr Stutz”), who was part of the TMCI team in the 1990s and had played an ac tive role in the c onc luding of the lic enc e agreement between TMCI and KM. Mr Stutz arranged for KM to purc hase beverage bases for its Kic kapoo produc ts from BevTec h International, whic h is not an authorised sourc e for Kic kapoo beverage bases under the lic enc e agreement. Subsequently, he arranged for another unauthorised sourc e under the lic enc e agreement, Tropic al International (Bahamas) Limited (“Tropic al”), whic h owns Kic kapoo trade marks in Bahamas and Barbados, to ship beverage bases to KM. Ac c ording to Mr Stutz, Tropic al’s beverage bases were produc ed in ac c ordanc e with the formula for the Kic kapoo beverage bases previously supplied by Monarc h to KM. 

18     While KM used Tropic al’s beverage bases to produc e its “Kic kapoo” beverage for the Singapore market, HSC, whic h stopped buying KM’s “Kic kapoo” produc ts, arranged for the Kic kapoo beverage produc ed in China under its Shanghai lic enc e to be shipped to and sold in Singapore. 

19     On 23 May 2003, KM asked HSC why the latter had stopped purc hasing its Kic kapoo beverage sinc e April 2002. In the same letter, KM asked HSC to c omment on why a large number of retailers in Singapore were selling China-made Kic kapoo drinks. HSC did not reply to this letter. 

20     On 28 January 2004, KM wrote to HSC to demand that it stop its ac tivities of supplying, selling or distributing Kic kapoo drinks without its authority. Another letter was sent to HSC on 2 Marc h 2004. HSC maintained a stony silenc e. 

21     Monarc h suspec ted that KM must have been purc hasing beverage bases from unauthorised sourc es bec ause it had not been supplying KM with beverage bases and the expiry date for the beverage bases previously supplied by it to KM had already passed. On 24 November 2004, offic ers from the Malaysian Ministry of Health visited KM’s bottling plant in Seremban, Malaysia, and found beverage bases from Tropic al on the premises. As has been mentioned, the Tropic al beverage bases are not an approved sourc e for Kic kapoo beverage bases under the lic enc e agreement. On 15 June 2005, Monarc h relied on the use of the unauthorised beverage bases to terminate the lic enc e agreement with KM. 

22     Shortly after terminating KM’s lic enc e on 15 June 2005, Monarc h swiftly appointed HSCPL as bottlers and distributors of Kic kapoo drinks for the Singapore market on 1 July 2005. Interestingly enough, HSCPL c eased to manufac ture Kic kapoo drinks in China under the Shanghai lic enc e in 2005. 

**Monarch’s Claim on Infringement and Passing Off** 


23     Monarc h’s c laim regarding infringement of its trade marks and passing off will first be c onsidered. 

**_Infringement of trade marks_** 

24     Sec tion 27(1) of the Trade Marks Ac t (Cap 332, 1998 Rev Ed), whic h c onc erns infringement of a trade mark, provides as follows: 

 A person infringes a registered trade mark if, without the consent of the proprietor of the trade mark , he uses in the c ourse of trade a sign whic h is identic al with the trade mark in relation to goods or servic es whic h are identic al with those for whic h it is registered. 

 [emphasis added] 

25     On 14 February 2005, Monarc h’s representative purc hased from Sheng Siong Supermarket Pte Ltd a PET bottle and a c an, both of whic h bore the Kic kapoo marks and had the names of KB and KM imprinted on them. It was stated on the PET bottle and c an that the beverage was produc ed under the authority of “The Monarc h Company, Atlanta GA 30326 USA”. 

26     KM admitted that it had used the Kic kapoo marks on the beverage made from bases supplied by BevTec h and Tropic al. There is no doubt that these beverage bases were obtained from unauthorised sourc es and Monarc h obviously did not c onsent to the use of the Kic kapoo marks on the beverage produc ed from beverage bases supplied by BevTec h and Tropic al. 

27     When c ross-examined, KM’s Chief Exec utive Offic er (“CEO”), Mr Lam Hoy Por (“Mr Lam”), c onc eded that KM did not seek Monarc h’s c onsent for the use of the bases supplied by Bevtec h. He also admitted that KM is still using beverage bases from Tropic al for its “Kic kapoo” drinks without Monarc h’s c onsent. 

28     An important part of the c ross-examination of Mr Lam that is worth noting is the following: 

Q Now, despite rec eiving this warning from the plaintiffs that suc h use c ould be registered trade mark infringement, you still c ontinued to use the bases from Tropic al to manufac ture drinks sold in Singapore? 

A Yes. 

Q So even after rec eiving the letter of 15th June 2005, you c ontinued to sell drinks made from Tropic al bases? 

A Yes. 

29     KM did not plead any of the well known defenc es to an allegation of trade mark infringement. Furthermore, although it had initially sought in its c ounterc laim to revoke the registration of the Kic kapoo marks, KM elec ted on 22 January 2008 not to proc eed with the applic ation to revoke the said registration. Instead, KM asserted that in order to maintain its c ommerc ial position as the lic ensee under the agreement, it had no reasonable alternative but to use alternative beverage bases from BevTec h and Tropic al to produc e and sell its Kic kapoo beverage in Singapore. KM argued that this was the means by whic h it mitigated the loss c aused by Monarc h’s failure to supply it with beverage bases. 


30     There are serious problems with KM’s argument regarding mitigation of damage. KM affirmed the lic enc e agreement in the fac e of Monarc h’s surfeit of termination letters. In this c ontext, it is worth noting that in _MP-Bilt Pte Ltd v Oey Widarto_ <span class="citation">[1999] 3 SLR 592</span>, Selvam J stated at [18] as follows: 

 The duty to mitigate does not arise if the innoc ent party dec ides to affirm the c ontrac t. The duty to ac t reasonably arises only when the innoc ent party dec ides to treat the breac h as repudiation and also annuls the c ontrac t. 

31     The reality is that KM need not have ac quired beverage bases from alternative sourc es if Monarc h had supplied beverage bases to KM but this does not entitle KM to infringe Monarc h’s Kic kapoo marks. It follows that both KM and KB breac hed the Kic kapoo marks and c annot exc use the infringement of the Kic kapoo marks on the basis of mitigation of loss. 

**_Passing off_** 

32     As for Monarc h’s assertion that KM and KB are also guilty of passing off their own goods as those of Monarc h’s, referenc e may first be made to _Perry v Truefit_ (1842) 6 Beav 66, where Lord Langdale said as follows [at p 73]: 

 A man is not to sell his own goods under the pretenc e that they are the goods of another man; he c annot be permitted to prac tise suc h a dec eption, not to use the means whic h c ontribute to that end. He c annot therefore be allowed to use names, marks, letters or other indic ia, by whic h he may induc e purc hasers to believe, that the goods whic h he is selling are the manufac ture of another person. 

33     What must be proven in a passing off ac tion has been reiterated on numerous oc c asions by the c ourts: see, for instanc e, _Caterpillar Inc v Ong Eng Peng (formerly trading as Catplus International)_ <span class="citation">[2006] 2 SLR 669</span>. To suc c eed in an ac tion for passing off, it must be established that: 

 (i) there is goodwill in the marks belonging to the plaintiff; 

 (ii) there was a misrepresentation by the defendants in the c ourse of trade to either prospec tive or ultimate c ustomers; and 

 (iii) damage resulted from the misrepresentation or that there is a likelihood of damage as a result of the misrepresentation. 

34     The above three requirements were desc ribed by Lai Kew Chai J in _Pan-West (Pte) Ltd v Grand Bigwin Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2003] 4 SLR 755</span> at [48] as the “oft-c ited trinity of requirements for a passing off ac tion”. 

35     KM ac knowledged that there is goodwill and reputation in Singapore in the Kic kapoo marks. When c ross-examined, its CEO, Mr Lam, said: 

Q Now Mr Lam, do you ac c ept that there is goodwill and reputation in the Kic kapoo marks in Singapore. Goodwill and reputation that people know about the Kic kapoo marks in Singapore? 

A Yes. 

Q Do you ac c ept that this goodwill and reputation in the Kic kapoo marks in Singapore has been developed over a long period of time sinc e 1966? 


A Yes. 

36     It is pertinent to note that neither KM nor KB pleaded any positive defenc e to the tort of passing off. There c an be no doubt that by using the Kic kapoo marks on its beverage made from unauthorised bases, KM represented that its goods were lic ensed by the owners of the said marks. Monarc h asserted that this does not c onvey the true pic ture and dec eives the public. 

37     As for whether Monarc h suffered any damage as a result of the misrepresentation, it is worth noting that in _H P Bulmer Ltd and Showerings Ltd v J Bollinger SA_ [1978] RPC 79 at 95, Buc kley LJ said as follows: 

 It is well settled that the plaintiff in a passing off ac tion does not have to prove that he has ac tually suffered damage by loss of business or in any other way. A probability of damage is enough, but the ac tual or probable damage must be damage to him in his trade or business , that is to say, damage to his goodwill in respect of that trade or business. 

 [emphasis added] 

38     As the Kic kapoo beverage sold by KM was made from unauthorised beverage bases, the threshold of “probability of damage” to Monarc h was c rossed. Monarc h rightly pointed out that as the beverage bases were not from its authorised sourc es, it did not have any c ontrol over their quality. 

39     I thus hold that KM and KB are also guilty of passing off. 

**_Assessment of damages_** 

40     Damages for the infringement of the Kic kapoo marks and for passing off will be assessed by the Registrar. 

41     In the meantime, KM and KB are restrained from infringing the Kic kapoo marks, selling or offering to sell in Singapore any beverage bearing the trade marks “Kic kapoo Joy Juic e” or “Kic kapoo” and from using the Kic kapoo marks in their business in Singapore. 

**KM’S Counterclaim for Breach of Contract** 

42     Before KM’s c ounterc laim for breac h of c ontrac t is disc ussed, the effec t of Monarc h’s many termination notic es must be c onsidered bec ause of their possible effec t on the said c ounterc laim. 

**_Monarch’s termination letters_** 

43     Monarc h’s right to terminate the lic enc e agreement is governed by c lause 18 of the lic enc e agreement. Clause 18(3) provides that the lic ensor may terminate the lic enc e agreement – 

 On thirty (30) days’ written notic e by the Company for a breach of this Agreement by Licensee , exc ept that the notic e will be null and void if the Lic ensee c ures the breac h within fifteen (15) days from the date written notic e is given. The written notic e of termination shall substantially desc ribe the defaults of the Lic ensee of whic h the Company has knowledge, but the Company shall not be limited to suc h reasons in any judic ial proc eeding in whic h the validity of the termination is at issue. However, if the Lic ensee has rec eived two (2) or more notic es of breac h for the same or different defaults within the prec eding 360 days pursuant to this paragraph, the Company may, at its option, terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days’ notic e without the 


 opportunity of the Lic ensee to avoid termination by c uring the breac h. 

 [emphasis added] 

44     Apart from c lause 18(3), note must be taken of c lause 18(4), whic h allows the _immediate_ termination of the lic enc e agreement by written notic e “in the event of Lic ensee’s intentional substitution in whole or in part of the base of any of the Lic ensed Trademark Beverages in any way or manner by Lic ensee”. 

45     Although Monarc h served a surfeit of termination notic es on KM, it opted to rely on the following three alleged breac hes by KM to terminate the lic ensing agreement: 

 (i) KM’s alleged failure to furnish monthly reports to Monarc h; 

 (ii) KM’s alleged failure to c onstruc t a bottling plant on time; and 

 (iii) KM’s use of unauthorized beverage bases to produc e its beverage. 

**_The monthly reports_** 

46     On 23 November 2002, Monarc h sought to terminate the lic enc e agreement when it wrote to KM as follows: 

 We note from our rec ords that your c ompany has failed to provide us with monthly reports on Lic ensed Trademark Beverage sales by pac kage size for eac h prec eding month for the months prior to year 2001 as required under the said Clause 16. 

 As it c urrently stands from our rec ords, it appears that you have breac hed Clause 16 of the Agreement. In view of the said breac h, we hereby give you 30 days’ NOTICE of termination of the Agreement pursuant to Clause 18A(3) to take effec t from your rec eipt of this letter. 

47     On 3 Dec ember 2002, KM’s solic itors replied to deny that KM had breac hed its obligation regarding the furnishing of monthly reports. 

48     On 16 January 2003, Monarc h requested c onfidential information from KM with respec t to the latter’s c ustomers and terms of sales. A sales report form for 2001 was also enc losed for KM to c omplete. As c lause 16 of the lic enc e agreement merely required KM to send a monthly report detailing its inventory of the beverage bases and rec ord of sales by pac kage size for the prec eding month, KM replied that it would c omply with c lause 16 if Monarc h forwarded the proper forms. 

49     On 21 February 2003, KM submitted the sales reports for 2001 under protest but refused to furnish some c onfidential information requested by Monarc h as this was not required under the agreement. 

50     In relation to the submission of monthly reports, Mr Stutz stated in his AEIC at [54] as follows: 

 Under Clause 16 of the lic ense agreement, KM agree to send to TMCI at the end of eac h month, on forms to be supplied by TMCI, a report showing KM’s inventory of bases and sales by pac kage size for the prec eding month. However, Monarch’s letter to KM dated 16 January 2002 required customer details and other confidential trade information. TMCI had never required suc h c onfidential information from KM. 


 [emphasis added] 

51     As Monarc h did not establish that it was entitled to the c onfidential information sought from KM in the monthly sales reports, I find that Monarc h had no right to terminate the lic enc e agreement on the basis that monthly sales reports had not been furnished by KM. 

_Construction of the manufacturing plant_ 

52     On 26 Dec ember 2002, Monarc h sought to terminate the lic enc e agreement on the ground that KM had failed to c onstruc t a manufac turing plant for the produc tion of Kic kapoo beverage in Malaysia by 1 Oc tober 1996, as was required by the lic enc e agreement between KM and TMCI. 

53     KM c ontended that it had been given more time by TMCI to c onstruc t the manufac turing plant. It explained that by 1994, it had taken the requisite steps to plan for the c onstruc tion of the said plant in Seremban, Malaysia, but it fac ed diffic ulties in ac quiring an effluent treatment plant that c omplied with loc al stringent health and environment regulations for the disposal of waste water. On 20 Oc tober 1997, KM wrote to TMCI about the delay and on 4 January 1998, Mr Stutz, signing as Vic e-President of TMCI, replied to KM as follows: 

 [I]t was nec essary for me to disc uss, what I suspect could be a long delay in getting your plant operational , with Mr Frank Armstrong. 

 We had some experienc e with effluent treatment with our franc hisee in Thailand a few years ago.... 

 Both Mr Armstrong and myself fully understand the problem.... 

 [TMCI] ... agrees that as long as you c ontinue the promotion and marketing of Kic kapoo and assure that adequate supplies of Kic kapoo are available to meet the demands of the market, your Lic enc e agreements for Singapore and Malaysia of January 9 1996 will remain in full forc e and effec t. 

 [emphasis added] 

54     Relying on Mr Stutz’s letter of 4 January 1998, KM’s solic itors replied on 31 Dec ember 2002 that there was no basis for Monarc h’s attempted termination of the lic enc e agreement. 

55     Mr Stutz c orroborated KM’s c ase when he explained in his AEIC at [31] as follows: 

 At all material times KM kept TMCI informed of the progress on the c onstruc tion of the plant and that KM fac ed diffic ulties in c omplying with loc al government requirements imposed on the effluent treatment plant and the tec hnic al problems in designing and building the fac ility and that there would be a protrac ted delay. After disc ussing the problem ... I was authorized to write a letter on behalf of Monarc h International to KM on 4 January 1998 that both Armstrong and myself fully understood the problem and that as long as KM c ontinue the promotion and marketing of Kic kapoo and assure that adequate supplies of Kic kapoo are available to meet the demands of the market, KM’s lic enc e agreements for Malaysia and Singapore will remain in full forc e and effec t. 

56     In the light of the position taken by the previous lic ensor, TMCI, the very least that Monarc h should have done if it wanted to alter the position regarding the time-table for the c onstruc tion of 


the plant was to give reasonable notic e to KM of its new position regarding the c onstruc tion of the manufac turing plant. Monarc h’s CEO, Mr Arnaud, c onc eded that there was no evidenc e that Monarc h bothered to find out from KM when the plant would be ready when it terminated the lic enc e agreement on 26 Dec ember 2002. In fac t, the plant started operating in April 2003, some four months after Monarc h’s purported termination of the lic enc e agreement in Dec ember 2002. I thus hold that Monarc h’s attempt to terminate the lic enc e agreement on the ground that the bottling plant had not been c ompleted on time was unjustified and ineffec tive. 

_Use of unauthorized beverage bases_ 

57     As for the question of use of unauthorized beverage bases, what needs to be noted is that c lause 6 of the lic enc e agreement requires KM to use Kic kapoo beverage bases from _approved_ sourc es for the produc tion of Kic kapoo beverage and under c lause 18(4), the lic enc e agreement may be terminated _immediately_ on written notic e when unauthorised beverage bases are substituted for the authorised bases. 

58     As has been mentioned, during a raid on KM’s Malaysian bottling plant in Seremban in November 2004 by the authorities, beverage bases supplied by Tropic al, whic h was an unauthorised sourc e for beverage bases, were found on the premises. Not surprisingly, on 15 June 2005, Monarc h’s solic itors served a notic e of termination of the lic enc e agreement on the ground that KM had used unauthorised beverage bases for produc ing its “Kic kapoo” beverage. 

59     KM’s assertion that it is entitled to use the unauthorised beverage bases to mitigate the damage c aused by Monarc h’s breac h, has already been c onsidered and rejec ted in the earlier disc ussion on KM’s infringement of trade marks. It follows that Monarc h was entitled to terminate the lic enc e agreement on 15 June 2005. This finding makes it unnec essary for me to c onsider KM’s c ounterc laim in relation to spec ific performanc e of the lic enc e agreement. 

60     I now turn to Monarc h’s assertion that c lause 18A(3) of the lic enc e agreement allows it to rely on the use by KM of unauthorised beverage bases to justify its termination letter on 3 February 2003. The relevant part of c lause 18(A)(3) is as follows: 

 The written notic e of termination shall substantially desc ribe the defaults of the Lic ensee of whic h the Company has knowledge but the Company shall not be limited to suc h reasons in any judic ial proc eedings in whic h the validity of the termination is at issue. 

 [emphasis added] 

61     Monarc h asserted that as KM had purc hased beverage bases from an unauthorised sourc e before one of its many termination notic es was issued on 3 February 2003, it is entitled to rely on the said breac h to justify its termination notic e on that date even though it was unaware of the purc hase of unauthorised beverage bases at the material time. 

62     It is pertinent to note that c lause 18(4) of the lic enc e agreement allowed Monarc h to terminate the lic enc e in the “event of Lic ensee’s intentional _substitution_ in whole or in part of the base of any of the Lic ensed Trademark Beverages in any way or manner by Lic ensee”. There is no evidenc e that there had been any substitution of the beverage bases before 3 February 2003. Although KM admitted that it ordered unauthorised beverage bases before February 2003, it had hoped that Monarc h would relent and supply it with the 800 gallons of beverage bases that it had ordered in September 2002, just before the hefty pric e inc rease of 1,000% took effec t. KM’s assertion that it first began to use unauthorised bases in the produc tion of Kic kapoo beverage in Marc h 2003 was not c ontradic ted. As 


KM began to use unauthorised beverage bases after Monarc h’s termination notic e of 3 February 2003, this breac h c annot be relied upon to justify the said termination notic e. It follows that the lic enc e agreement was terminated by Monarc h only on 15 June 2005. 

**_KM’s counterclaim for breach of contract_** 

63     In view of my finding that Monarc h validly terminated the lic enc e agreement on 15 June 2005, only events prior to that date are relevant to KM’s c ounterc laim for breac h of c ontrac t by Monarc h. 

_Issuance of unjustified termination notices_ 

64     KM c omplained that Monarc h breac hed the lic enc e agreement by issuing unjustified termination notic es. However, the unjustified notic es had no effec t sinc e KM rejec ted them and affirmed the lic enc e agreement. In _Fercometal SARL v Mediterranean Shipping Co SA_ [1989] 1 AC 788, Lord Ac kner approved of Asquith LJ’s statement in _Howard v Pickford Tool Co Ltd_ [1951] 1 KB 417, 421 that “an unac c epted repudiation has no legal effec t (‘a thing writ in water and of no value to anybody’)”. Admittedly, the fac t that a party has affirmed the c ontrac t does not deprive it of damages but in the present c ase, KM suffered no loss from the ineffec tive termination notic es. As suc h, it is unnec essary to c onsider these ineffec tive notic es of termination any further. 

_Failure to supply KM with the 1,000 gallons of beverage bases ordered_ 

65     As has been mentioned, just before the pric e for the beverage bases was inc reased on 1 Oc tober 2002, KM ordered 1,000 gallons of beverage bases and that Monarc h only supplied KM with 200 gallons. Despite reminders, Monarc h did not send the balanc e of 800 gallons to KM. 

66     Monarc h c ontended that the lic enc e agreement did not require it to meet every request by KM for beverage bases. However, so long as the lic enc e agreement is in forc e and KM remains the exc lusive lic ensee, Monarc h is obliged to meet reasonable requests from KM for beverage bases. It is thus nec essary to c onsider whether Monarc h had any legitimate exc use for not shipping the 800 gallons of beverage bases to KM. 

67     On 30 September 2002, Monarc h informed KM as follows: 

[W]e c an only provide 200 units of Kic kapoo ... for the following reasons: 

1       Sinc e we were not warned in advanc e you would be c onsiderably inc reasing orders for Kic kapoo, nor did we rec eive your 2002 projec tions, our produc tion c annot ac c ommodate this order in its entirety. 

2       In addition, we have dec ided to reformulate Kic kapoo to harmonize tastes and formulas used in different markets. This c hange will take plac e very shortly. Therefore, it is unreasonable to supply you with a year’s worth of c onc entrate at this time given the shelf life of the produc t. 

68     In its defenc e to KM’s c ounterc laim, Monarc h pleaded another reason for not despatc hing the balanc e of 800 gallons to KM, namely that prolonged storage of suc h a large quantity would affec t the quality of the bases and the beverage made from them. 

69     Monarc h’s reasons for refusing to supply more than 200 gallons of beverage bases to KM c annot be taken seriously. Mr Stutz testified that there is no c lause in the lic enc e agreement requiring KM to furnish its annual projec tion of orders for Kic kapoo bases and that KM had not been required to furnish 


any projec tion of orders in the past. He also c onfirmed that KM had previously been supplied with bases, ranging from 200 to 1,000 gallons by TMCI and that KM had always managed to use up the beverage bases well within their shelf life. It follows that Monarc h should have supplied the outstanding beverage bases to KM, or at least a portion of the order, when it was reminded by KM to do so on 2 May 2003. KM had made it c lear to Monarc h that its beverage base stoc k was running low and it would be apprec iated if at least 200 gallons c ould be shipped as soon as possible. Monarc h did not respond to this reminder and its CEO, Mr Arnaud, had the temerity to offer the following answers during c ross-examination: 

Q Was [Monarc h] going to supply the 800 gallons at any point of time after September 2002? 

A At the right pric e, definitely.... 

Q So therefore, even if there were reminders sent everyday from Oc tober to Dec ember 2002 ... it will not make any differenc e to the position bec ause [Monarc h] wanted to sell at the new pric e? 

A Yes.... 

Q _A new price that [Monarch] wasn’t applying to anybody else in the world even today?_ 

A Yah, I mean, that’s c orrec t. 

[emphasis added] 

70     I thus find that in failing to supply KM with the remaining 800 gallons of beverage bases ordered before the pric e inc rease, Monarc h was in breac h and must c ompensate KM for the loss suffered as a result of the failure to supply the outstanding 800 gallons of beverage bases to KM. 

_The price increase of 1,000%_ 

71     KM also asserted that Monarc h breac hed the lic enc e agreement by its phenomenal pric e inc rease of around 1,000% in September 2002. The effec t of this pric e inc rease need not be c onsidered at the present moment bec ause KM did not protest or write a single letter to Monarc h to c omplain about the alleged breac h. Neither did KM order any beverage bases after the pric e inc rease on 1 Oc tober 2002. Instead of insisting on its c ontrac tual right to be supplied beverage bases, KM took the unwise step of ac quiring beverage bases from unauthorised sourc es. In view of these c irc umstanc es, the effec t of the phenomenal pric e inc rease will be c onsidered in the later part of this judgment in relation to KM’s allegation that the pric e inc rease was part of a c onspirac y to harm its interests. 

**Conspiracy** 

72     KM’s allegation with respec t to the tort of c onspirac y by unlawful means will next be c onsidered. While referring to a c onspirac y by unlawful means in _Wu Yang Construction Group Ltd v Zhejiang Jinyi Group Co Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2006] 4 SLR 451</span>, Andrew Phang JA said at [76]: 

 There is, first, the situation, where unlawful means have been used (also known as “wrongful means c onspirac y”) The relevant law in this c ontext appears to be straightforward. In partic ular, there is no need for the plaintiff c onc erned to prove that there has been a predominant intention on the part of the defendants to injure it. It would appear that the very utilisation of unlawful means is, by its very nature, suffic ient to render the defendants liable, regardless of their 


 predominant intention. This would appear to be both logic al as well as just and fair, espec ially if we bear in mind the fac t that the c entral c ore, as it were, of the tort of c onspirac y hinges on the proof that the c onspirac y is somehow unlawful and that the plaintiff is entitled to suc c eed provided that it c an prove that it has suffered damage. 

73     KM alleged that Monarc h and the 2nd to 5th defendants in the c ounterc laim c ommitted the tort of c onspirac y by unlawful means in that they: 

 (a) wrongfully c aused Monarc h to breac h and wrongfully terminate the lic enc e agreement between KM and Monarc h; and 

 (b) wrongfully and intentionally proc ured or induc ed KM’s former sole distributor in Singapore for Kic kapoo beverages, HSC, to breac h and wrongfully terminate the distribution agreement between KM and HSC. 

KM’s c ase is that but for the c onspirac y, it would not have been deprived of beverage bases by Monarc h. 

**_Whether there was a sole distributorship agreement_** 

74     While it was c lear that Monarc h had a lic enc e agreement with KM, HSCPL pleaded that it had no sole distribution agreement with KM. If HSCPL is right, KM’s allegation that there was a c onspirac y to breac h the sole distribution agreement will not get off the ground. After wasting muc h time on this issue, HSCPL finally admitted during the trial that it had a sole distribution agreement with KM as from 

1998\. This c onc ession should have been made long from the very start bec ause HSC had c omplained to Monarc h that KM had breac hed the sole distributorship agreement by allowing other c ompanies to sell its Kic kapoo beverage in Singapore. This was revealed by Monarc h in its Reply and Defenc e to KM’s Defenc e and Counterc laim (Amendment No 3) when it pleaded [at 10(vi)] as follows: 

 [KM] breac hed an existing sole distributorship agreement with Heng Sheng Company ... by c ausing and or permitting other distributors ... to also supply KICKAPOO produc ts in Singapore. 

75     The 2nd to 5th defendants next argued that even if there had been a sole distributorship agreement, it had been terminated bec ause HSC, and subsequently HSCPL, had stopped purc hasing Kic kapoo drinks from KM for some time. While the termination of an agreement may, in appropriate c ases, be inferred from the c irc umstanc es, HSCPL, whic h was busy misleading the c ourt as to whether or not it was KM’s sole distributor, did not introduc e any evidenc e to show when the sole distributorship agreement finally ended. As suc h, the c ourt has no basis to make a finding that the sole distributorship agreement had been terminated before the appearanc e of the alleged c onspirac y. What is c lear is that in May 2003, KM still regarded HSC as its sole distributor as it reproac hed HSC for not having purc hased any Kic kapoo beverage from it sinc e the end of 2002. HSC c ould have replied to KM to deny that it was obliged to order any Kic kapoo beverage from KM but it did not do so. Instead, HSC’s suc c essor, HSCPL, c lutc hed at straws by making an unsubstantiated assertion that KM was unwilling to sell any beverage to HSC at the material time. 

**_The evidence relating to the alleged conspiracy_** 

76     It is not easy to prove the existenc e of a c onspirac y. In _Asian Corporate Services (SEA) Pte Ltd v Eastwest Management Ltd (Singapore Branch)_ <span class="citation">[2006] 1 SLR 901</span>, Chao Hic k Tin JA, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, pointed out (at [19]) that it is not often that the vic tim of a c onspirac y has direc t evidenc e to prove the allegation and that proof of c onspirac y is normally 


inferred from other objec tive fac ts. He approved of the following passage from _R v Siracusa_ (1190) 90 Cr App R 340 at 349: 

 [T]he origins of all c onspirac ies are c onc ealed and it is usually quite impossible to establish when or where the initial agreement was made, or when or where other c onspirators were rec ruited. The very existenc e of the agreement c an only be inferred from overt fac ts. Partic ipation in a c onspirac y is infinitely variable. 

77     All the defendants in the c ounterc laim were aware of the existenc e of the lic enc e agreement 

and the sole distributorship agreement and the c ontention of the 2nd to 5th defendants that they did not know that there were problems between Monarc h and KM was, in the light of the evidenc e, a blatant lie. What needs to be noted at this junc ture is that Mr Chia Hoc k Seng (“Mr Chia”), the _sole_ 

witness for the 2nd to 5th defendants in the c ounterc laim, c onc eded that Monarc h and HSCPL would be c ommitting a wrong if they c aused the other party to breac h the said agreements with KM. The relevant part of the c ross-examination is as follows: 

Q So [Monarc h and HSCPL] know that you --you eac h have got exc lusive agreements with KM, c orrec t? 

A Yes. 

Q Good. Now if you two did anything to c ause the other one to breac h these two agreements, you will be guilty of wrongdoing. Would you agree? 

A Yes. 

78     It must be borne in mind that Monarc h was quite determined to terminate the lic enc e agreement by the end of 2001. By Dec ember 2001, Monarc h already had disc ussions with YHS to replac e KM as their lic ensee and on 9 Dec ember 2001, Monarc h served on KM a notic e of termination of the lic enc e agreement without bothering to furnish any reason for the termination. On the very next day, YHS asked for a letter of appointment as the new lic ensee. On 11 Dec ember 2001, Monarc h’s representative, Ms Nella Aguf, informed YHS that Monarc h would c anc el the lic ensing agreement with KM “anyway and see what happens”. 

_Monarch admits it made preparations with HSC_ 

79     Monarc h admitted in its further and better partic ulars that as it wanted to terminate the lic enc e agreement with KM, it began to make preparations “before Marc h 2003” to ensure that “the c ontinued presenc e of beverages bearing the [Kic kapoo marks] in the Singapore market would be maintained”. Monarc h disc losed that those involved in the said preparations, or in KM’s view, the c onspirac y, to maintain the presenc e of Kic kapoo drinks in Singapore inc luded HSC and PH. Mr Chia, who represented HSC as well as PH in these disc ussions, wore many hats. Apart from being the managing direc tor of PH and the former general manager of HSC, whose partners are the 3rd and 4th defendants in the c ounterc laim, Mr Chia is a direc tor of HSCPL, whic h was formed to take over HSC’s business, and a 

direc tor of the 2nd defendant, Ying F & B Pte Ltd. It is also pertinent to note that Monarc h’s Mr Chow, the vic e-president of the Singapore subsidiary, had his offic e in the premises of PH, of whic h Mr Chia was the managing direc tor and that KM alleged that Mr Chow and Mr Chia are key players in the c onspirac y. 

80     What was the plan, or in KM’s view, the c onspirac y, formulated by Monarc h, HSC and PH to maintain the presenc e of Kic kapoo drinks in Singapore after KM was sidelined? 


_The unwarranted price increase_ 

81     KM asserted that unsure as to whether its termination notic es were valid, Monarc h hatc hed a plan to inc rease the pric e of beverage bases by a phenomenal 1,000% as from 1 Oc tober 2002 in order to make it ec onomic ally unviable for KM to c ontinue to produc e any Kic kapoo beverage at c ompetitive pric es. 

82     Monarc h‘s c hief exec utive offic er (“CEO”), Mr Didier Arnaud (“Mr Arnaud”), c laimed that the Kic kapoo beverage bases had been sold to KM at an unusually low pric e in the past. However, he was c ontradic ted by Mr Stutz, who pointed out that when TMCI sold KM beverage bases at the old pric e, it already made a gross profit of 400%. He explained in his AEIC at [61] and [62] as follows: 

 61 Given the almost 400% gross margin of profit to TMCI, any adjustments in the prevailing pric e would be nominal at best.... 

 62 The upward revision of the c ost of the flavour c omponent alone would almost equal the wholesale selling pric e of the beverage. To the best of my rec ollec tion, there were no signific ant c hanges in the market pric es for the bases in 2002. 

83     Monarc h’s Mr Arnaud was less than c andid when he testified that the market pric e for the beverage base was around USD 400 600 per gallon and that its Shanghai lic ensee, HSC, and subsequently HSCPL, was c harged USD 470 per gallon. When c ross-examined, he said as follows: 

 Q Why did you not, in answer ... say that the pric e of US$470 was also applied to Heng Sheng c ompany in – in Shanghai? 

 A Okay ... I mean, I should have .... Bec ause that’s the pric e we are c harging. 

84     However, it was not disputed that the nett pric e for the Kic kapoo beverage bases sold to HSC and HSCPL was only USD 200 per gallon bec ause HSC and HSCPL had a rebate of USD 270 for eac h gallon purc hased. No suc h rebate had been offered to KM. 

85     Monarc h also c laimed that the pric e inc rease of 1,000% was nec essary for it “to fund advertising and promotion expenses whic h would add to the health and wealth of our brands”. However there was no basis for Monarc h to require KM to fund advertising and promotion expenses. TMCI’s former offic er, Mr Stutz, explained in his AEIC at [56] as follows: 

 In ac c ordanc e with the lic ense agreements, at no time was there an advertising c omponent built into the pric e for Kic kapoo bases. In fac t, TMCI and Monarc h made no c ontribution for advertising or marketing and it was left to KM to fund the c reation of the advertising and marketing materials and the c osts of all point of sale and media advertising and marketing. 

86     I thus find that Monarc h’s unprec edented pric e inc rease of nearly 1,000% on 23 September 2002, a hefty pric e whic h has, to date, not been applied to any other lic ensee in the world, was a most unusual step and must be taken into ac c ount when c onsidering whether there was a c onspirac y by unlawful means. 

_The link between the hefty price increase and the Shanghai licence_ 

87     KM asserted that while Monarc h made it ec onomic ally unviable for it to produc e any Kic kapoo 


beverage by inc reasing the pric e for its beverage bases by more than 1,000%, the alleged c onspirators ac ted in c onc ert to ensure that the Singapore market was stoc ked with Kic kapoo drinks manufac tured in China under the Shanghai lic enc e granted to HSC on 20 September 2002, just 3 days before Monarc h inc reased the pric e of beverage bases offered to KM. 

88     The evidenc e supports KM’s assertion that the Shanghai lic enc e was a sham that was intended to c ater for the Singapore market while KM was deprived of beverage bases. In this c ontext, the following fac ts are relevant: 

 (i) All the drinks produc ed under the Shanghai lic enc e were sent to Singapore; 

 (ii) No Kic kapoo drinks produc ed under the Shanghai lic enc e were sold in Shanghai or other parts of China and no serious steps were taken to establish Kic kapoo as a serious player in the Shanghai market; and 

 (iii) The parties took extensive steps to c amouflage the trail of the drinks made under the Shanghai lic enc e to Singapore. 

89     A question arises as to why Monarc h had to rely on drinks produc ed under the Shanghai lic enc e to servic e the Singapore market when it c ould have taken the simple step of appointing a Singapore bottler and distributor after having taken the step to terminate the lic enc e agreement with KM. After all, the Singapore market is c ruc ial to Monarc h bec ause the sales in Singapore and Malaysia ac c ount for 90% of the world-wide sales for this beverage and as early as Dec ember 2001, Monarc h had been keen on appointing YHS, a Singapore bottler of beverages, to replac e KM as the supplier of Kic kapoo beverages for the Singapore market. KM asserted that Monarc h did not appoint a Singapore bottler bec ause it was not c ertain that its termination notic es were legally valid. That is why the Shanghai lic enc e given to HSCPL c ame in handy. In fac t, it was only in July 2005 that Monarc h finally appointed HSCPL as its Singapore bottler. This was immediately after Monarc h found an iron-c lad ground for serving yet another termination notic e on KM on 15 June 2005, namely that KM had used unauthorised beverage bases, a fac t c onfirmed in a raid on KM’s fac tory in Seremban, Malaysia. Not c oinc identally, HSCPL’s China operations under the Shanghai lic enc e c eased after it had been appointed Monarc h’s Singapore bottler. 

_All beverages produced under the Shanghai licence arrived in Singapore_ 

90     Effec tively, the beverage produc ed under the Shanghai lic enc e were all exported to Singapore. The first shipment from China to Singapore alone involved 518,400 c ans of Kic kapoo drinks. Mr Chia c laimed that there c ould be no c onspirac y bec ause Monarc h, and more partic ularly, its key man in Singapore, Mr Chow, did not know that his c ompany, HSC, imported China-made Kic kapoo drinks to Singapore even though, as has been mentioned, Mr Chow’s offic e was loc ated within the premises of PH, of whic h Mr Chia was the managing direc tor. Why he made this assertion c annot be fathomed as he tied himself in knots during c ross-examination on the issue of Mr Chow’s lac k of knowledge. The relevant part of the proc eedings is as follows: 

 Q ... The plaintiffs’ own pleaded c ase says, they, you and PH got together to make this thing happen, Shanghai to Singapore, ...and you are now saying Raymond Chow doesn’t know anything about it? 

 A Raymond Chow told Heng Sheng in [April 2003] that “Now, you can import” ... 

 Q Prior to February 2003, you got the lic enc e from [Monarc h] for Shanghai ... All nic ely stated 


 here, “Prior to 3rd February 2003, the parties PH, Heng Sheng and [Monarc h]” And you want to say that Raymond Chow of [Monarc h] sitting in your offic e, didn’t tell you about this? When they themselves said that these were the steps they took, the preparation.... 

 A I told you no. This is their ... not mine. 

 Q Their version. Now you are saying Raymond Chow and Monarc h are lying? 

 A No. I – I never say that. That is their version. 

 Q Then what are you saying? 

 A --this is my version, you know. 

 Q So if there are two versions and one version is true and one version is not, one of you is lying...? 

 A I won’t know. 

 [emphasis added] 

91     For the rec ord, Mr Chia finally ac c epted that his imports of Kic kapoo drinks from China after May 2003 were made with the full knowledge and approval of Monarc h. The relevant part of the proc eedings is as follows: 

 Q [F]rom 2003 ...., you and Monarc h were already working together about this Kic kapoo drinks made in China and sold in Singapore. Correc t? You had a working relationship with them. 

 A Yes. 

 Q Yes. Very good. And Monarc h agreed for Heng Sheng to obviously c arry on selling Kic kapoo drinks made in China, right? Yes, they --they agreed. 

 A Yes.... 

 [emphasis added] 

_No sales in Shanghai_ 

92     If the Shanghai lic enc e was a genuine lic enc e that was intended to c ater for the Shanghai market, there would have been sales of Kic kapoo produc ts in Shanghai after September 2002, when produc tion in China started. 

93     When answering an interrogatory, Mr Chia dec lared that he did not know whether any Kic kapoo beverage produc ed under the Shanghai lic enc e had been sold in Shanghai. However, when c rossexamined, he finally c onc eded that China-made Kic kapoo beverage had _not_ been sold in Shanghai. The relevant part of the proc eedings is as follows: 

 Q Did you sell a single c an of Kic kapoo drink in Shanghai in 2002? 

 A 2002, we produc ed. 


 Q Did you sell a single c an of Kic kapoo drink, a single c an of Kic kapoo bottle of any Kic kapoo in any pac kaging in Shanghai in the year 2002? 

 A We manufac tured. 

 Q Did you sell in Shanghai or China any Kic kapoo drinks in the year 2002, that’s the third time I am asking you. It’s a very simple question. 

 A I think in my interrogatory I answered you. 

 Q Answer the question that’s put to you now. 

 A Do we sell? We never sell. [HSC] never sell. 

 [emphasis added] 

94     When pressed further during c ross-examination, Mr Chia admitted that no evidenc e of sales in Shanghai of the Kic kapoo drinks made under his Shanghai lic enc e had been furnished to the c ourt. His c onc ession is reproduc ed below: 

 Q [W]ere the drinks made in China all exported [to] Singapore? .... 

 A Not all. 

 Q Do you have any evidenc e that they were sold in Shanghai? 

 A No .... 

 Q So based on that evidence available in this court, all the drinks made in China were sent to Singapore, isn’t it? 

 A Based on the evidence, yes. Court evidence. 

 [emphasis added] 

95     Monarc h’s CEO, Mr Arnaud, admitted that Monarc h c ould not furnish to the c ourt any evidenc e of sales in China of drinks produc ed under the Shanghai lic enc e. Although Monarc h had sought to persuade the c ourt that it was entitled to terminate its lic enc e agreement with KM on the ground that the latter had failed to furnish it with information on sales and c ustomers, it was c learly not as insistent about rec eiving timeous reports on sales and c ustomers from its Shanghai lic ensee. 

96     If, as alleged by the 2nd to 5th defendants, the Shanghai lic enc e was a genuine lic enc e intended for the Shanghai market, serious steps would have been taken by HSC to position itself as a serious player in the Shanghai beverage market. When c ross-examined as to why HSC settled for a bottler in Tianjin, near Beijing and not a Shanghai bottler when its lic enc e was for the Shanghai market, Mr Chia’s answers were illuminating. The relevant part of the proc eedings is as follows: 

 Q [A]s soon as the agreement is signed, you went to Tianjin, whic h is way up north near Beijing.... Why go to Tianjin when your business is in Shanghai? 

 A He c an work with us. 


 Q Why get [a lic enc e] for Shanghai when you have to go all the way north to Tianjin? 

 A Shanghai, I don’t know anybody that can work with us to distribute the drink. 

 [emphasis added] 

97     Mr Chia’s admission that he knew no one in Shanghai who c ould distribute Kic kapoo drinks in that c ity prompted the following interesting exc hange between KM’s c ounsel, Mr Chandran, and Mr Chia: 

 Q [Y]ou don’t know anybody in Shanghai to deal with soft drinks manufac turing, distribution, marketing or sales. Yet [Monarc h] gave you this exc lusive [lic enc e for Shanghai]? 

 A Bec ause they want the China market. 

 Q Doesn’t make sense? 

 A They are ... hard up ... 

 [emphasis added] 

98     Mr Chia initially asserted that HSC was serious about the Shanghai market as it gave free c onc entrates to the China bottlers to enc ourage them to flood the Shanghai market with drinks. When asked in an interrogatory to reveal the total quantity of the drinks made and used for promotional purposes, the answer given was as follows: 

 Save that about 400 gallons of c onc entrates were provided to produc e drinks for promotional purposes, HSC ... have no knowledge of the total quantity produc ed.... 

99     When c ross-examined, Mr Chia admitted that the answer was untrue. The relevant part of the proc eedings is as follows: 

 Q Here you said the 400 gallons were used for promotional purposes. They never were used for promotional purposes. They were sent to Singapore, weren’t they? 

 A I’ve said to them to stop and send [bac k to Singapore]. 

 Q Yes.... 400 gallons were never used for promotional purposes. The first two shipments c ame straight to Singapore. 

 A Yes. 

100    When asked why he had c laimed that 400 gallons of beverage bases had been used for promotional purposes when he knew that this was not true, Mr Chia said that he had answered the interrogatory on HSC’s behalf and although PH knew through him that the 400 gallons had not been used for promotional purposes, HSC did not. The relevant part of the proc eedings is as follows: 

 Q [The beverage bases were] not used for promotion in China, c orrec t? 

 A Heng Sheng [did] not know that. 

 Q You are Heng Sheng and you are also PH, isn’t it? ... 


 A ... Heng Sheng do not know all this thing, PH is PH. You c annot say I am Heng Sheng and PH. 

 Ct You answered this, right? .... 

 A It’s under Heng Sheng. Heng Sheng [doesn’t] know. 

_Camouflaging the trail from China to Singapore_ 

101    The length to whic h the defendants in the c ounterc laim went to c over up their trac ks in relation to the importing of China-made Kic kapoo drinks into Singapore is really astounding. What unfolded in the trial in relation to the defenc e to KM’s assertion of c onspirac y was a web of half-truths and outright lies. 

102    For a start, when the 2nd to 5th defendants were asked for further and better partic ulars of the identity and address of the manufac turer and exporter of Kic kapoo beverage from China that was then being shipped to Singapore, they stated as follows: 

 It is believed that the manufac turer of the beverages is Zhenjiang Kic kapoo F & B Co Ltd. The 2nd to 5th defendants in the c ounterc laim ... do not know the identity of the exporter of the said beverages. 

 [emphasis added] 

103    Evidently, Mr Chia knew the identity of the exporter and that the manufac turer was not, “ _as believed_ ”, Zhenjiang Kic kapoo F & B Co Ltd. When c ross-examined, he said as follows: 

 Q [O]n behalf of Heng Sheng, you instruc ted Tian to manufac ture these drinks in China, didn’t you? 

 A Yes. 

 Q And on behalf of Heng Sheng, you instruc ted Zhenjiang InterChina to get the drinks from Tian to export ... didn’t you? 

 A Yes. 

104    It is also noteworthy that although HSC was the Shanghai lic ensee, its name did not appear on the Kic kapoo beverage produc ts imported into Singapore. Instead, the name of Ying F & B Ltd, another Singapore c ompany, of whic h Mr Chia is also a direc tor, was printed on the bottles and c ans of Kic kapoo drinks produc ed in China for the Singapore market. Mr Chia c onc eded that HSC’s name should be on the beverage produc ts imported from China and he c ould not explain why Ying F & B’s name was there instead. The relevant part of the c ross-examination of Mr Chia is as follows: 

 Q If it’s manufac tured for the Singapore market, whose name should appear on the c an ...? 

 A [HSC]. 

 Q ... [O]r the bottle? ... 


## A [HSC]. 

 Q Then whose name appears on this? 

 A Ying. 

 Q Why? 

 A That one I don’t --I can’t --I can’t answer you .... 

 Q Yes. Why don’t you put [HSC’s] name on the ... packaging? 

 A That one I can’t answer you. 

 [emphasis added] 

105    It was regrettable that Monarc h offered only one witness, namely, its CEO, Mr Arnaud, who was quite unfamiliar with many of the issues raised by KM with respec t to the c onspirac y. Admittedly, he talked about Monarc h’s interest in entering the China market. However, while any c ompany c an be interested in entering the China market, Mr Arnaud shed no light on his c ompany’s grant of the Shanghai lic enc e to HSC. Monarc h should have c alled its loc al subsidiary’s vic e-president, Mr Chow, a former employee of YHS, as a witness, and espec ially so sinc e KM had alleged that he was a key player in the c onspirac y. KM pointed out that it was Mr Chow who signed the Shanghai lic enc e agreement with HSC. Evidently, there is muc h more than meets the eye in Monarc h’s dec ision not to have Mr Chow c ross-examined in the present proc eedings. 

106    To sum up, KM managed to establish that the Shanghai lic enc e was not really intended for the Shanghai market and that it was a poorly c amouflaged sc heme to allow HSC to manufac ture drinks in China for the Singapore market while there was still a valid and subsisting lic enc e agreement between Monarc h and KM, and while HSC was still KM’s sole distributor in Singapore. For Monarc h, the advantage was that instead of reaping around USD 60 per gallon from KM for the beverage bases, it earned USD 200 from HSC for eac h gallon. As for HSC and subsequently, HSCPL, they made more profits by importing the Kic kapoo beverage from China manufac tured under the Shanghai lic enc e as c ompared to buying suc h beverage from KM. 

_Conclusion on conspiracy_ 

107    I hold that all the defendants in the c ounterc laim were involved in a c onspirac y by unlawful means against KM and that this c onspirac y prec eded KM’s infringement of the Kic kapoo marks. Evidently, this c onspirac y injured KM. Damages will be assessed by the Registrar. 

**Costs** 

108    Monarc h is entitled to c osts with respec t to its c laim on the infringement of the Kic kapoo marks and passing off. 

109    KM is entitled to c osts with respec t to its c ounterc laim.
