**Introduction** 

1       This suit arises from a long-standing dispute among a few siblings over the estates of their late parents and late brother. It was c ommenc ed by two of the seven benefic iaries of the late father’s will, who brought various c laims against the exec utor of the will (who is himself a benefic iary) as well as against the law firm engaged to assist in the administration of the estate. 

2       The trial was heard over six days in July 2016, with written submissions filed in September 

2016\. I now deliver my judgment. 

**Background facts** 

**_The parties_** 

3       The 1st Plaintiff, the 2nd Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant and the 3rd Defendant are four of six siblings in the Foo family. Together with their late mother, Yap Wee Kien (“the Late Mother”), their late brother, Foo Jee Fong (“the Late Brother”) and their sister, Foo Chin Chin, they are benefic iaries of the estate of their late father, Foo Tai Joong (“the Late Father”) in equal shares. The estate of the Late Father c onsists solely of a piec e of landed property known as 39 Lorong Marzuki (“the Property”).

estate, under c irc umstanc es whic h I shall set out at [20] below. 

5       The Foo family is no stranger to the c ourts. The present Suit No 764 of 2013 (“the present suit”) is part of a long-running and ac rimonious dispute between the siblings over the estates of the Late Father, the Late Mother, and the Late Brother. I will shortly set out some of these proc eedings relevant for the purposes of the present suit. 

6       The Late Father passed away on 5 May 1979. In his will dated 8 May 1975, he appointed the Late Mother and the 1st Defendant as c o-exec utors and trustees of his estate. The will provided for a trust for sale over the Property. The following shows the distribution of the Late Father’s estate ac c ording to the will, in order of seniority: 

7       Probate was obtained by the Late Mother on 30 November 1979 as sole exec utor of the will. At 

this point of time, the 1st Defendant was still a minor. [note: 1] After the Late Mother passed away on 25 July 2005, the administration of the Late Father’s estate was granted to the 1st Defendant solely 

on 11 January 2010. [note: 2] On 21 Marc h 2011, pursuant to an applic ation brought by the 1st Defendant in Summons No 5672 of 2010 (brought under Originating Summons No 909 of 2010, whic h I will disc uss later), Judith Prakash J (as she then was) dec lared the 1st Defendant to be the sole surviving exec utor and trustee of the Late Father’s estate, and that he was entitled to apply to have the Property c onveyed to him. The Property was thereafter transmitted and duly registered in the 1st Defendant’s sole name. 

8       In the Late Mother’s will dated 18 May 2002, she appointed the 1st Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant as the c o-exec utors and trustees of her estate, whic h c onsists solely of her 1/7th share in the Late Father’s estate. This share is to be divided among three of the siblings, in order of seniority, as follows: 


 Foo Jee Boo 1st Plaintiff Co-exec utor and trustee 

## 1/ 

9       A grant of probate for the Late Mother’s estate was obtained on 1 Oc tober 2012 and issued to 

the 1st Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant on 14 Dec ember 2012. [note: 3] It should be noted that the 2nd Plaintiff is neither an exec utor nor a benefic iary of the Late Mother’s estate. 

10     The Late Brother passed away intestate on 19 July 2007. His estate also c onsists solely of his 1/7th share of the Late Father’s estate. By FC/P 678 of 2015, a letter of administration was granted to the Late Brother’s widow, Chen Yu, in February 2016, whic h appointed her as the sole administrator of the Late Brother’s estate. Over the c ourse of the present proc eedings, the parties have c ome to ac c ept that the c laims in relation to the Late Brother’s estate are not part of the present suit. This was bec ause neither of the Plaintiffs is an administrator of the Late Brother’s estate, and therefore would not have had the standing to bring any c laim in relation to his estate. A c laim relating to the Late Brother’s estate was eventually brought by Chen Yu (as I will elaborate at [59] below). For the purposes of this judgment, I foc us only on the disputes in relation to the Late Father’s and Late Mother’s estates. 

11     The relationship between the five surviving Foo siblings quic kly deteriorated largely bec ause of disagreements on how to deal with the Property after the Late Mother’s death. In brief, the 1st Plaintiff, the 2nd Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant wanted the Property to be sold, but the 1st Defendant did not. These disagreements led to a slew of legal tussles between them. It is nec essary to briefly set out some of the legal proc eedings and relevant events at this junc ture, as these will provide an essential bac kdrop to the disputes in the present suit. 

**_Originating Summons No 909 of 2010_** 

12     On 2 September 2010, the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant filed Originating Summons No 909 of 2010 (“OS 909”) in the High Court, naming the 1st Defendant and Foo Chin Chin as defendants. OS 909, amongst other things, was an applic ation to c ompel a sale of the Property and thereafter the distribution of the proc eeds of the sale ac c ording to the Late Father’s will. It also sought to c ompel the 1st Defendant to furnish an ac c ount of the proc eeds of the rent that he had allegedly rec eived from the Property. 

13     The 2nd Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant were initially represented by Mr David de Souza (“Mr de Souza”) from M/s De Souza Lim & Goh LLP. Mr de Souza issued the originating summons on behalf of all the plaintiffs in OS 909, _ie_ , the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant. It subsequently c ame to light that the 1st Plaintiff was separately represented by Mr V Ramakrishnan (“Mr Rama”) from V Ramakrishnan & Co. The 1st Plaintiff had apparently sought leave to intervene in OS 909 to apprise the c ourt of issues relating to the Late Mother’s estate. The 1st Defendant and Foo Chin Chin, the defendants in OS 909, were represented by M/s Tan See Swan & Co (“TSS”). 

14     At the first hearing of OS 909 on 21 Marc h 2011, Prakash J felt that it was not appropriate for the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant to be represented by two different sets of solic itors. It was thereafter agreed that Mr de Souza was to submit on behalf of all of them. Mr Rama then left the c hambers. 

15     OS 909 was ultimately dismissed by Prakash J on 18 May 2011 with c osts to be paid by the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant to the 1st Defendant and Foo Chin Chin, as taxed or agreed. 


**_CA 70 of 2011_** 

16     On 9 June 2011, the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant appealed the dec ision of Prakash J, whic h led to CA 70 of 2011 (“CA 70”). By this point, the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant had c hanged their solic itors to Ms Molly Lim SC, Ms Hwa Hoong Luan (“Ms Hwa”) and Mr Ang Hou Fu from M/s Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC (“WTL”), while the 1st Defendant and Foo Chin Chin c ontinued to be represented by TSS. 

17     Further, the 1st Plaintiff engaged M/s Wong Thomas & Leong to file Summons No 5533 of 2011 (“SUM 5533”), again seeking leave for the 1st Plaintiff, in his c apac ity as c o-exec utor of the Late Mother’s estate, to partic ipate in CA 70 to apprise the c ourt of the position taken by eac h of the benefic iaries in relation to the Late Mother’s estate. 

18     CA 70 and SUM 5533 were heard together on 29 February 2012. SUM 5533 was dismissed with no order as to c osts. The judgment for CA 70 was reserved. On 7 August 2012, the Court of Appeal 

delivered judgment for CA 70 and made the following orders (c ollec tively “the CA Orders”): [note: 4] 

1\. The Appeal be allowed; 

2\. the [1st Defendant] shall take steps to sell [the Property] and distribute the sale proc eeds to the benefic iaries ac c ording to their respec tive entitlements under [the Late Father’s will]; 

3\. the sale of the Property shall be effec ted no later than six months from the date of the judgment hereof, ie, 7th August 2012; 

4\. the solic itors for the [Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant] [ie, WTL], and the [1st Defendant] [ie, TSS] shall jointly appoint a valuer/agent and a solic itor to effec t the sale; 

5\. the [1st Defendant] shall, within three months of the date of the judgment hereof, ie, 7th August 2012, furnish an ac c ount of the trust to all the benefic iaries; and 

6\. the parties are requested to file their submission on c osts within 2 weeks hereof. 

19     On 31 August 2012, after hearing the parties’ submissions on c osts, the Court of Appeal further ordered that: 

7\. The c osts of the [Plaintiffs and 3rd Defendant] in [CA 70 and OS 909] shall be paid out of the proc eeds of the sale of the Property; and 

8\. The [1st Defendant] shall bear his own c osts. 

**_Appointment of the 2nd Defendant and attempts to sell the Property_** 

20     Pursuant to the CA Orders, WTL and TSS jointly appointed the 2nd Defendant as the law firm having c onduc t of the matter. I will elaborate on this appointment further at [177]–[181] below. Ms Eunic e Chee (“Ms Chee”) of the 2nd Defendant was the solic itor in c harge of the matter, and the one whom the parties and their solic itors c orresponded with. WTL and TSS also appointed DTZ Debenham Tie Leung (SEA) Pte Ltd (“DTZ”) as the valuer/agent for the sale of the Property. 

21     An auc tion for the Property was originally sc heduled for 31 Oc tober 2012. However, the auc tion 


for the Property c ould not be c ompleted on time. It appears that one reason was that the 1st 

Defendant had rec eived some unsolic ited offers for the Property. [note: 5] In any event, the 1st Defendant requested for the sale of the Property to be postponed, on the basis that he needed time 

to c ome up with a reasonable proposal. [note: 6] In late Dec ember 2012, DTZ proposed for a public tender to be c alled instead. WTL agreed to the proposal. However, the 1st Defendant did not agree. By an email dated 4 January 2013, the 1st Defendant stated that the reserve pric e for the Property was to be $6.5 million, and that he would work it out with the 3rd Defendant and Foo Chin Chin before instruc ting DTZ on the proposed sale of the Property. On 10 January 2013, he wrote to DTZ stating 

that the reserve pric e was $6.5 million, and that he had not agreed for DTZ to do the valuation. [note: 7] 

22     Meanwhile, on 4 January 2013, WTL wrote to the 1st Defendant, stating that the Court of Appeal in CA 70 had direc ted in no unc ertain terms that the Property was to be sold. It will be rec alled that under the CA Orders, the sale of the Property was to be c ompleted within six months, _ie_ , by 7 February 2013. WTL then wrote to DTZ and informed it that the sale of the Property by public tender was to c ontinue. By another letter dated 10 January 2013, WTL warned the 1st Defendant to refrain from writing to DTZ to delay or prevent the sale of the Property, as that would be c ontrary to the CA Orders. WTL further stated that ac tion would be taken to enforc e the CA Orders against the 

1st Defendant if he persisted in taking any ac tion to delay or prevent the sale of the Property. [note: 8] 

23     The public tender went on, and one of the tenderers ultimately offered $5.8 million for the Property. However, the 1st Defendant refused to sign the Letter of Authorisation and Confirmation to allow the 2nd Defendant to ac c ept the tender bid on his behalf. Instead, he suggested that parties should seek an extension of time for a further six months to sell the Property, so that they c ould try 

to sec ure a sale pric e of above $6 million. [note: 9] 

**_Summons No 634 of 2013: Enforcement proceedings_** 

24     Convinc ed that the 1st Defendant was delaying the sale of the Property when the date of c ompletion was sc heduled on 19 April 2013, the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant, through WTL, took out Summons No 634 of 2013 (“SUM 634”) on 4 February 2013 to enforc e the judgment in CA 70, inc luding a prayer asking the c ourt to sanc tion the sale of the Property for $5.8 million. On 7 February 2013, the 1st Defendant attended at the offic e of the 2nd Defendant and duly signed the Letter of 

Authorisation and Confirmation. [note: 10] At the hearing of SUM 634 on 23 February 2013, the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant were granted leave to withdraw SUM 634, and the c ost of the applic ation was fixed at $2,000, to be paid out from the proc eeds of the sale of the Property. Ms Chee was informed of this c ost order by WTL as well as the 1st Defendant. 

25     The tender was ultimately ac c epted on 8 February 2013 [note: 11] and the Property was sold for 

$5.8 million. The sale was c ompleted on sc hedule on 19 April 2013. [note: 12] The proc eeds of the sale were then deposited into the 2nd Defendant’s c onveyanc ing ac c ount. 

**_Payments of the sales proceeds by the 2nd Defendant to the 1st Defendant_** 

26     On 10 May 2013, the 2nd Defendant sent an email to the 1st Defendant with a Statements of Ac c ounts relating to the sale of the Property, the deduc tions to be made, and the amounts to be distributed in relation to the Late Father’s and Late Mother’s estates. She asked the 1st Defendant to 


c hec k whether the c alc ulations were c orrec t, and explained that she would need WTL’s and Foo Chin 

Chin’s approval before releasing the funds. [note: 13] 

27     On 17 May 2013, the 1st Defendant replied to say that the Statement of Ac c ounts was substantively c orrec t, and that “no other lawyer or benefic iary should interfere and obstruc t the 

[distribution] proc ess”. [note: 14] 

28     On 20 May 2013, Ms Chee wrote to the 1st Defendant, forwarding him the Statements of Ac c ounts for the Late Father’s and Late Mother’s estates, as well as a Letter of Authority whic h was to be signed by “every one named in there in the presenc e of a solic itor”, _ie_ , all the surviving benefic iaries. The letter also explained that a sum of $200,000 was being set aside in the 2nd Defendant’s c onveyanc ing ac c ount to meet the legal c osts in c onnec tion with “the suits between [the 1st Defendant] and [his] siblings”, as well as the “additional work done [by the 2nd Defendant] in 

attending to the distribution of [the Late Father’s and Late Mother’s] [e]states”. [note: 15] 

29     On 21 May 2013, the 1st and 3rd Defendants separately attended at the 2nd Defendant’s offic e to c ollec t the Statements of Ac c ounts relating to the Late Father’s and Late Mother’s estates. The 1st Defendant alone signed a Letter of Authority, in his c apac ity as sole exec utor of the Late Father’s 

estate, c onfirming the payments to be made to eac h benefic iary. [note: 16] 

30     On 29 May 2013, Ms Chee gave the 1st Defendant a c ashier’s order issued in his favour for the sum of $1,064,536.02, being his purported shares of the Late Mother’s and Late Father’s estates, as well as reimbursements for his c laims against the two estates. At the same time, Ms Chee gave the 1st Defendant another c ashier’s order for the sum of $782,542.86, being the purported inheritanc e 

due to the estate of the Late Brother. Ms Chee expressly advised the 1st Defendant to open a new bank ac c ount under the name “Estate of [the Late Father], Dec eased” and to deposit the Late Brother’s purported inheritanc e into the ac c ount. She stated that the money “must remain there until a legitimate c laimant of [the Late Brother’s estate] c omes to make his/her/their c laims”, and that the 

1       st Defendant was “responsible for ensuring the money is paid to the legitimate c laimant” of the Late 

Brother’s estate. [note: 17] Whether the 2nd Defendant should have paid out these amounts to the 1st Defendant was heavily disputed by the parties in the present suit and I shall return to these disputes in due c ourse. 

31     Ms Chee also reiterated to the 1st Defendant in a c over letter to the c ashier’s orders that a sum of $200,000 remained in the 2nd Defendant’s c onveyanc ing ac c ount for “legal expenses whic h have not been settled in c onnec tion with: (a) the suits between [the 1st Defendant and his siblings] ... and (b) [the 2nd Defendant’s] fees for the additional work done in attending to the distribution of 

the [the Late Father’s and Late Mother’s] [e]states”. [note: 18] 

32     On 31 May 2013, Ms Chee sent an email to the Plaintiffs, the 3rd Defendant and Foo Chin Chin, informing them that their respec tive c heques for their shares of the Late Father’s estate were 

available for c ollec tion at the 2nd Defendant’s offic e. [note: 19] 

33     Shortly after this email was sent, Ms Hwa of WTL c alled Ms Chee and followed up with an email, essentially stating that sinc e WTL’s c lients were also party to the 2nd Defendant’s appointment, the latter needed to hand over a c opy of the Statement of Ac c ounts of the Late Father’s estate for c onfirmation. Ms Hwa also asked Ms Chee to hold the distribution of the sale proc eeds in the 

meantime, until after WTL had replied with their c omments on the Statement of Ac c ounts. [note: 20] On 3 June 2013, at a meeting at the offic e of WTL, Ms Molly Lim asked Ms Chee to arrange to stop 


payment to the 1st Defendant, but Ms Chee informed Ms Molly Lim that she c ould not do so as the c ashier’s orders had already been given to the 1st Defendant a few days before, on 29 May 2016. Ms Chee also rec eived a letter from WTL on the same day, alleging that the Plaintiffs disputed various 

c laims for the expenses inc urred on behalf of the Late Father’s and Late Mother’s estates. [note: 21] Thereafter, there were numerous email exc hanges between Ms Hwa, Ms Chee and some of the siblings. This inc luded emails from the 3rd Defendant and Foo Chin Chin on 25 June 2013 stating that 

they agreed with the c alc ulations of the 1st Defendant, [note: 22] and an email from Ms Chee to WTL on 2 July 2013 stating, _inter alia_ , that the 2nd Defendant was not bound to follow WTL’s instruc tions and that the 2nd Defendant would hold the balanc e pending the instruc tions of the exec utor or the c ourt. After further exc hanges the present suit was c ommenc ed on 26 August 2013, whic h I shall c ome to shortly. 

**_BC 127 and 160 of 2013: Taxation proceedings_** 

34     On 13 August 2013 and 24 September 2013, the Plaintiffs (without the 3rd Defendant) filed BC 127 and BC 160 for taxation of the proc eedings in CA 70 and OS 909 respec tively. On 29 August 2014, these were taxed by Assistant Registrar James Elisha Lee (“AR Lee”). Pursuant to the Plaintiffs’ applic ation for a review of AR Lee’s taxation order, Prakash J adjusted the sum upwards slightly to an aggregate of approximately $150,000. 

**_DC 2814 of 2012: the 1st Plaintiff’s claim for medical expenses against the Late Mother’s estate_** 

35     While the above-related events c onc erning the estate of the Late Father were unfolding, problems with the estate of the Late Mother also started to surfac e. These largely c onc erned medic al expenses inc urred before her death in 2005. On 14 July 2011, the 1st Plaintiff c ommenc ed DC Suit No 2814 of 2012 (“DC 2814”) against the estate of the Late Mother, c laiming the sum of $99,706.49 as the medic al expenses inc urred for the Late Mother’s treatment at Gleneagles hospital (“the Gleneagles Bills”). This ac tion was ultimately settled. A Deed of Settlement was entered into on 12 November 2012 between the 1st Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant and the 3rd Defendant. The Deed of Settlement 

states: [note: 23] 

1\. Judgment will be entered in [the 1st Plaintiff’s] favour for the sum of $99,706.49 c laimed in [DC 2814] within seven (7) days from the date hereof, with eac h party to bear his own c osts. Provided that: 

 .... 

 (b) [The 1st Defendant] shall pay the $2,600 costs ordered in [DC 2814/2012] out of the [Late Mother’s] estate ... 

 ... 

 5. The judgment for $99,706.49 entered under paragraph (1)...above will be paid to [the 1st Plaintiff] out of the [Late Mother’s] estate...and [the 1st Plaintiff] shall out of the [Late Mother’s estate] pay [the 1st Defendant] a sum equivalent to 25% of the [Late Mother’s] Gleneagles Bills i.e., the sum of $24,925. Both payments will be effec ted on the c ompletion of the sale of the Property 

6\. The payments mentioned in paragraph (5) above c onstitute _full and final settlement of all_ 


 claims between and amongst [the 1st Defendant, the 3rd Defendant, the 1st Plaintiff and the Late Mother’s estate] relating to the [Late Mother’s] estate and assets thereof. Upon the payments mentioned in paragraph (5) above, neither [the 1st Defendant, the 3rd Defendant, the 1st Plaintiff and the Late Mother’s estate] shall make any claim whatsoever against the [Late Mother’s] estate or against each other in relation to the [Late Mother’s] estate and assets thereof , apart from their respec tive entitlement to the [Late Mother’s] estate’s share of the sales proc eeds of the Property under the Late Mother’s will dated 18 May 2002. 

7\. This Deed does not affec t any of the parties’ rights ac c rued under and c laim for c osts relating to...[CA 70] and suc h c osts will be dealt with between the respec tive parties’ lawyers ac ting in the said ac tions/proc eedings. 

 ... 

9\. This Deed c onstitutes the whole agreement between the parties hereto relating to its subjec t matter and no variations hereof shall be effec tive _unless agreed to by the parties in writing_. 

 ... 

 [emphasis added] 

36     The 1st Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant and the 3rd Defendant further rec orded a c onsent judgment on 14 Dec ember 2012. The c onsent judgment only stated that the Late Mother’s estate was to pay the 1st Plaintiff the sum of $99,706.49, and that eac h party was to bear his or its own c ost of the 

ac tion. [note: 24] 

37     The Deed of Settlement and c onsent judgment provide the bac kdrop to the disputes in relation to the Late Mother’s estate in c onnec tion with the present suit. This will be explained further later in the judgment. 

**_The present suit_** 

38     The protrac ted disagreements between the siblings were not resolved. On 26 August 2013, the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs, through their then solic itors, M/s Malkin & Maxwell LLP, c ommenc ed the present suit against the 1st and 2nd Defendants, bringing the c laims whic h I shall set out at [60]–[65] below. On 4 August 2014, the Plaintiffs c hanged their solic itors to M/s Belinda Ang Tang & Partners (“BATP”). 

39     As originally pleaded, the present suit was brought against the Defendants only in respec t of the Late Father’s estate. There was no c laim made in respec t of the Late Mother’s or the Late Brother’s estates. 

40     Numerous interloc utory applic ations were filed in the present suit, the most essential of whic h are summarised below. 

_Amendments of Statement of Claim_ 

41     On 23 Oc tober 2013, before the pleadings were deemed c losed, the Plaintiffs amended their Statement of Claim pursuant to O 20 r 3 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). This led to the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) (“SOC-1”). The amendments were minor, seeking, for example, an additional relief for interest to be paid on the sums found due. There were still no c laims brought against the Late Mother’s and Late Brother’s estates. 


42     On 18 September 2014, the Plaintiffs filed Summons No 4655 of 2014 (“SUM 4655”) for leave to amend SOC-1, as indic ated in an attac hed draft. These proposed amendments were fairly signific ant. In brief, the amendments expanded or added details in respec t of the Plaintiffs’ c laim against the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Father’s estate. The amendments also sought to add new c laims against the 1st and 2nd Defendants in respec t of the Late Mother’s estate and the Late Brother’s estate. At the hearing before AR Lee, the Defendants did not objec t to a number of proposed amendments. As for the c ontested amendments, AR Lee allowed some, but disallowed a signific ant number as well. Both the Plaintiffs and the 2nd Defendant were dissatisfied with AR Lee’s dec ision. The Plaintiffs filed Registrar’s Appeal No 396 of 2014 seeking to reverse the AR’s dec ision disallowing c ertain paragraphs of the draft. The 2nd Defendant filed Registrar’s Appeal No 397 of 2014 seeking to exc lude c ertain paragraphs in the draft that had been allowed. The appeals then c ame before me. 

43     After hearing the parties on 9 February 2015, I allowed the 2nd Defendant’s appeal in full, and only partially allowed the Plaintiffs’ appeal. These are summarised at [22] of my dec ision in _Foo Jee Boo and another v Foo Jhee Tuang and another (Foo Jee Seng, intervener)_ <span class="citation">[2015] SGHC 176</span> (“the Amendment Judgment”). In essenc e, I allowed various paragraphs relating to the 2nd Defendant’s handling of the Late Father’s estate. I also allowed fac ts relating to the parties’ c laims in relation to the Late Mother’s estate. 

44     However, there was c onsiderable c onfusion over the status in whic h the parties were suing or being sued in the present suit. In the c ourse of SUM 4655, the parties eventually c onfirmed that they were suing and being sued in their _personal capacities_ : see the Amendment Judgment at [26] and [33]–[36]. That being the c ase, I disallowed the amendments pleading breac h of duty against the 2nd 

Defendant in relation to the Late Mother’s estate. In the c ase of the c laims against the1st Defendant in respec t of the Late Mother’s estate, there were _no objections_ raised by the 1st Defendant to the amendments, and these were allowed on that basis. 

45     The Plaintiffs were dissatisfied with my dec ision in the Amendment Judgment. On 16 February 2015, they wrote in to c ourt to request for further arguments on the Registrar’s Appeals. On 17 February 2015, they filed Summonses No 786 and 787 of 2015, seeking leave to appeal my dec ision in the Registrar’s Appeals. On 9 July 2015, I dismissed the applic ations for leave to appeal and did not c hange my order in the Registrar’s Appeals after hearing their further arguments. I will elaborate on some parts of the Amendment Judgment in due c ourse, when I analyse and set out my dec ision on the Plaintiffs’ c ase against the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Mother’s estate in the present suit. 

46     On 21 July 2015, the Plaintiffs duly amended SOC-1 as direc ted, whic h led to the present Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) (“SOC-2”). 

_Summonses for leave to intervene_ 

47     On 25 November 2014, the 3rd Defendant filed Summons No 5860 of 2014, an applic ation to make himself a party to the present suit and to be allowed to partic ipate in it, on the basis that he was a benefic iary of both the Late Father’s and Late Mother’s estates. On 4 February 2015, AR Zhuang Wenxiong granted the applic ation. The 3rd Defendant was subsequently added as a defendant to the present suit. 

48     I should add that on 23 September 2015, Foo Chin Chin also applied for leave to intervene in the present suit. However, she subsequently withdrew her applic ation at a hearing before me on 7 Marc h 2016, indic ating that she no longer wished to c ontest the proc eedings.

_Payment into court and payments out of the minimum undisputed sum_ 

49     On 24 Marc h 2014, I ordered the 2nd Defendant to pay the sum of $3,897,359.97, being the balanc e of the sale proc eeds of the Property still held in its c onveyanc ing ac c ount, into c ourt pending the determination of the present suit. This was duly done on 29 Dec ember 2014. 

50     On 1 September 2015, the Plaintiffs brought Summons No 4346 of 2015 (“SUM 4346”) seeking to have the minimum undisputed portions of their shares in the Late Father’s estate, quantified at $758,495.68 eac h (“the Minimum Sum”), to be paid out of the sum paid into c ourt on 29 Dec ember 

2014\. The detailed c omputation of this figure is set out at [63] below. I granted this applic ation on 7 Marc h 2016. 

51     On 15 Marc h 2016, the 3rd Defendant filed Summons No 1291 of 2016 (“SUM 1291”) also seeking a payment out of his Minimum Sum. On 22 Marc h 2016, Foo Chin Chin, not being a party to the present suit, filed OS 291 of 2016 (“OS 291”) for payment out of her Minimum Sum pursuant to O 90 r 8 of the Rules of Court. I granted orders-in-terms of both applic ations on 20 April 2016. 

_Summary of positions_ 

52     In summary, as a result of the abovementioned events and legal proc eedings, the positions of the benefic iaries of the Late Father’s estate just before the trial of the present suit were as follows: 


 Foo Jee Boo 1st Plaintiff 1/7 Minimum Sum of $758,495.68 paid out pursuant to Order of Court dated 7 Marc h 2016 in SUM 4346 (see [50] above)

 Foo Jee Seng 3rd Defendant 1/4 Not paid. Sum remains in c ourt. 

 Foo Jhee Tuang 1st Defendant Co-exec utor and trustee 

 1/4 $229,354.47 paid by the 2nd Defendant to the 1st Defendant (see [30] above). 

 Foo Jee Boo 1st Plaintiff Co-exec utor and trustee 

 1/2 Not paid. Sum remains in c ourt. 

53     The positions of the benefic iaries of the Late Mother’s estate just before the trial of the present suit were as follows: 

54     After the payments out mentioned above, the sum left in c ourt is **$863,377.25** (being the total sum paid into c ourt, $3,897,359.97 _less_ the four payments out of $758,495.68 eac h). 

_The Plaintiffs’ discharge of solicitors_ 

55     It should be noted that just 11 days before the trial for the present suit, the Plaintiffs disc harged their solic itors, BATP, and opted to ac t in person. 

**_Proceedings subsequent to the present suit_** 

56     After the present suit was under way, two other legal proc eedings were c ommenc ed in relation to the Late Mother’s and Late Brother’s estates. 

_Suit No 284 of 2016: proceedings in relation to the Late Mother’s estate_ 

57     On 23 Marc h 2016, Suit No 284 of 2016 (“S 284”) was filed by the 1st Plaintiff, in his _representative capacity_ as c o-exec utor and trustee of the Late Mother’s estate (c ontrast [44] above). S 284 is most likely a c onsequenc e of the Amendment Judgment, in whic h I had held that the Plaintiffs had no standing to bring c laims against the 2nd Defendant in relation to the Late Mother’s estates when suing in their _personal capacities_ (see [71] of the Amendment Judgment). S 284 was brought primarily against the 2nd Defendant. The 1st Defendant was joined as defendant bec ause he refused to join the 1st Plaintiff in suing the 2nd Defendant. The c laims and reliefs of S 284 arise out of substantially the same fac ts as those raised in relation to the Late Mother’s estate in the present suit. In S 284, the 1st Plaintiff wants the 2nd Defendant to ac c ount for all monies rec eived by the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Mother’s estate, inc luding overpayment quantified at $89,678.86, and for the 2nd Defendant to indemnify and pay the 1st Plaintiff for any shortfall the latter suffers if he fails to rec eive his entitlement of the Late Mother’s estate. 

58     In June 2016, the Plaintiffs, through BATP, orally applied to c onsolidate S 284 and the present 

suit, but this was dismissed by AR Lee. [note: 25] S 284 is c urrently still at the interloc utory stages, 


and has not yet c ome to trial. 

_Suit No 811 of 2016: proceedings in relation to the Late Brother’s estate_ 

59     On 27 July 2016, Suit No 811 of 2016 was c ommenc ed by Chen Yu, the Late Brother’s widow, against the 1st Defendant. Chen Yu alleged that the Late Brother was entitled to at least $782,542.86 as 1/7th benefic iary of the Late Father’s estate. She c laimed for the share of $782,542.86 whic h she alleged the 1st Defendant had neglec ted, ignored and/or failed to return to the Late Brother’s estate. The Late Brother’s estate is, as I mentioned earlier, not an issue in the present suit. 

**The pleadings** 

**_The Plaintiffs’ claims_** 

60     Having outlined the history of litigation between the parties, I now set out the Plaintiffs’ c ase in the present suit, as pleaded in SOC-2. 

_Claims in relation to the Late Father’s Estate_ 

61     The Plaintiffs c laim that the 1st Defendant had breac hed the CA Orders, as well as his duties as 

trustee of the Late Father’s estate, [note: 26] spec ific ally by: 

 (a) failing to render an ac c ount of the trust to the Plaintiffs and the other benefic iaries of the estate, and in partic ular failing to render an ac c ount of the rent proc eeds c ollec ted from the renting out of the Property within the three-month time limit set by the Court of Appeal in CA 70; 

 (b) failing to properly c alc ulate the benefic iaries’ respec tive entitlements under the Late Father’s estate due to the erroneous inc lusion or omission of c laims against the Late Father’s estate; 

 (c ) failing to properly distribute or to properly instruc t the 2nd Defendant to distribute the Late Father’s estate; and 

 (d) wrongfully instruc ting the 2nd Defendant to release to himself sums of money above and beyond what he is entitled to. 

62     The Plaintiffs c laim that the 2nd Defendant had represented that it was jointly appointed by the Plaintiffs and the 1st Defendant and would take instruc tions from both the 1st Defendant and WTL (as solic itors for the Plaintiffs). However, the 2nd Defendant allegedly breac hed its fiduc iary duties owed to the Plaintiffs, and ac ted c ontrary to the terms of its engagement and its representations, [note: 27] spec ific ally by: 

 (a) wrongly ac ting on the sole and unilateral instruc tions of the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Father’s estate (in partic ular in paying out the 1st Defendant’s share), without prior c onsultation or notific ation to the Plaintiffs or verifying the liability of the Late Father’s estate; 

 (b) wrongly setting aside only $200,000 as legal c osts for CA 70 and OS 909; and 

 (c ) wrongly providing for additional expenses c laimed by the 1st and 3rd Defendants, thus enabling the 1st Defendant to inflate his share in the Late Father’s estate, to the detriment of

Late Mother’s estate is as follows: [note: 30] 

**_The 1st Defendant’s Defence_** 

_The Late Father’s estate_ 

66     In relation to the Late Father’s estate, the main lines of the 1st Defendant’s Defenc e are as follows:

 DTZ Valuation $2, 

 Agenc y c ommission $46, 

 2nd Defendant’s c osts $6,641.

 3rd Defendant’s share $796,542.86 (Minimum Sum plus $14,000 as legitimate expenses inc urred) 

 (a) There was no refusal on the part of the 1st Defendant to ac c ount for the rent money, as he had not been in rec eipt of any rental inc ome, other than what the 1st Plaintiff had already known, and whic h was disc losed in OS 909 (see [87] below). [note: 31] In fac t, it was the 1st Plaintiff that had rented out various rooms in the Property to the tenants and rec eived rents; [note: 32] 

 (b) The amounts of $52,638.70 and $14,000 were legitimately inc urred, and thus debts verily owed by the Late Father’s estate to the 1st and 3rd Defendants respec tively; [note: 33] and 

 (c ) The 1st Defendant never agreed to pay $350,000 as legal c osts for OS 909 and CA 70. The sum of $200,000 was more than suffic ient to defray any legal c osts inc urred in CA 70 and OS 

909\. [note: 34] 

67     Ac c ording to the 1st Defendant, eac h benefic iary’s entitlement to the Late Father’s estate was

 1st Plaintiff’s share (50%) $362,236. 

68     In relation to the Late Mother’s estate, the main lines of the 1st Defendant’s Defenc e are as follows: 

 (a) He disputes the quantum of $99,706.49 for the Gleneagles Bills. [note: 36] He also denies that the sum was owed to the 1st Plaintiff, as he states that there was a verbal agreement between the 1st Defendant and the 1st Plaintiff that the latter had waived this c laim. [note: 37] 

 (b) He alleges that he had also inc urred expenses for the Late Mother’s medic al fees. [note: 38] 

69     Ac c ording to the 1st Defendant, eac h benefic iary’s entitlement to the Late Mother’s estate 

should be c alc ulated as follows: [note: 39] 

**_The 2nd Defendant’s Defence and Notice of Indemnity and/or Contribution against the 1st Defendant_** 

70     In brief, the 2nd Defendant’s main lines of defenc e are as follows: [note: 40] 

 (a) The 2nd Defendant was appointed to ac t for the 1st Defendant only , as the sole surviving exec utor and trustee of the Late Father’s estate. The 2nd Defendant was obliged only to ac t on the instruc tions of the 1st Defendant; 

 (b) The Plaintiffs were not the 2nd Defendant’s c lients. At the material time, the Plaintiffs’ solic itors were WTL, who advised, assisted and represented them. No duties were therefore owed by the 2nd Defendant to the Plaintiffs; 


 (c ) The 2nd Defendant was only appointed to ac t in the sale of the Property, and not the distribution of the proc eeds of the sale; and 

 (d) The c omputation of eac h benefic iary’s 1/7th share of the Late Father’s estate at $782,547.87 was c orrec t. 

71     The 2nd Defendant issued a Notic e of Indemnity and/or Contribution against the 1st Defendant on 30 July 2014, and filed its Statement of Claim against the 1st Defendant on 2 June 2016. It sought a c ontribution or indemnity from the 1st Defendant against any sums that the 2nd Defendant is held liable to pay the Plaintiffs, on the ground that the 1st Defendant ought to have known that the 2nd Defendant’s appointment was to ac t for the 1st Defendant. Therefore, if the Plaintiffs suffered any loss as a result of the distribution, this was c aused by the 1st Defendant, sinc e the 2nd Defendant only ac ted on the instruc tions, c onfirmation and authorisation of the 1st Defendant. 

**The Late Father’s estate: claims against the 1st Defendant** 

**_The law on the powers and duties of an executor_** 

72     Before turning to the spec ific c laims brought by the Plaintiffs against the 1st Defendant, it will be helpful to set out briefly the powers and duties of an exec utor, suc h as the 1st Defendant. 

73     KS Rajah JC (as he then was) provided a suc c inc t summary of the duties of exec utors in _Lee Yoke San and another v Tsong Sai Sai Cecilia and another_ <span class="citation">[1992] 3 SLR(R) 516</span> (“ _Lee Yoke San_ ”) at [35]: 

 An exec utor “ calls in” the estate that c ollec ts and c onverts the assets into c ash, and pays all the funeral and testamentary expenses, estate duty, debts and legacies. When he has done this, he has disc harged his duties as an exec utor. Then he steps into the shoes of a trustee. He owes a fiduciary duty to the benefic iaries, whether he is an exec utor or trustee. 

 [emphasis added] 

74     I shall now elaborate on the duties owed by an exec utor as summarised in the prec eding paragraph. 

_Calling in assets_ 

75     First and foremost, an exec utor is obliged to “c all in” the dec eased's real and personal estate. In other words, he has to determine the extent of the assets and liabilities of the dec eased, and then ac t diligently and reasonably in realising the assets. In this respec t, if the dec eased died testate, his will would be a guide, although not nec essarily a c omprehensive one, as to the assets that he owned: G Raman, _Probate and Administration in Singapore and Malaysia_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2012) at pp 157 and 159 (“ _Probate and Administration_ ”). Where the estate is small, like the present c ase in whic h the estate c onsists of a single asset, the c arrying out of this duty does not normally pose an issue. 

_Paying funeral and testamentary expenses_ 

76     Sec tion 57(3) of the Probate and Administration Ac t (Cap 251, 1985 Rev Ed) allows for the estate to be applic able towards the disc harge of the funeral, testamentary and administration expenses of the dec eased. 


77     Testamentary and administration expenses are “expenses inc ident to the proper performanc e of the duty of the exec utor”: _Sharp v Lush_ [1879] 10 Ch D 468 (“ _Sharp v Lush_ ”) at 470. They inc lude, but are not limited to: 

 (a) The c osts of obtaining probate or letters of administration; 

 (b) Legal c osts oc c asioned in c ommenc ing a suit to obtain assistanc e of the c ourt to dec ide on questions relating to the asc ertainment of debts and liabilities due from the dec eased’s estate, the payment of suc h debts and liabilities, and the legal and proper distribution of estate among persons entitled. The suit c an be instituted either by the exec utor himself or by the benefic iaries in a proper c ase. The c osts that are allowed inc ludes the c osts by the person who instituted the suit, as well as the c osts of other parties to the suit: Sharp v Lush at 470-471; and 

 (c ) The c osts of taking the advic e of a solic itor and c ounsel outside the administration suit as to the distribution of the estate: Sharp v Lush at 471. 

_Paying debts_ 

78     In addition, it is the duty of the exec utor to pay off the debts of the dec eased. This duty is owed to the c reditors as well as the benefic iaries. _In Re Tankard, Tankard v Midland Bank Executor and Trustee Company, Limited_ [1942] 1 Ch 69 at 72 summarised this duty in the following terms: 

 ...it is the duty of exec utors, as a matter of the due administration of the estate, to pay the debts of their testator with due diligence having regard to the assets in their hands whic h are properly applic able for that purpose, and in determining whether due diligenc e has been shown regard must be had to all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase...The duty is owed not only to c reditors, but also to beneficiaries , for the ultimate objec t of the administration of an estate is to plac e the benefic iaries in possession of their interest and that objec t c annot be fully ac hieved unless all debts are satisfied. 

 [emphasis added] 

79     Prior to the c onveyanc e or distribution of the dec eased’s assets, it would be prudent for the exec utor to protec t himself by giving notic e in the _Gazette_ of his intention to make a c onveyanc e or distribution of the assets, and requiring any person interested to send to the exec utor partic ulars of his c laim in respec t of the assets within a stipulated period that is not less than two months: see s 29 of the Trustees Ac t (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed). If the nec essary advertisements are plac ed, the exec utor will be at liberty after the expiration of the time spec ified in the advertisements to distribute the assets, having regard only to the c laims of whic h he has notic e. 

_Rendering accounts of the estate_ 

80     It is also the duty of the exec utor to keep proper ac c ounts of the administration of the estate that they are dealing with. If c alled upon by the benefic iaries to render ac c ounts, they are obliged to furnish suc h ac c ounts and allow the benefic iaries to inspec t the ac c ounts. The ac c ounts would be required to show the monies and assets rec eived by the exec utor and how he had dealt with these monies and assets: see _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore: Probate, Administration and Succession_ at para 190.102, c iting _Thompson v Dunn_ (1870) LR 5 Ch App 573 at 576; see also _Foo Jee Seng and others v Foo Jhee Tuang and another_ <span class="citation">[2012] 4 SLR 339</span> (“ _Foo Jee Seng (CA)_ ”) (the Judgment in CA 70) at [86]–[87]. It is also a requirement before the exec utor winds up the administration that he submits ac c ounts for the benefic iaries’ perusal and approval prior to distribution: _Probate and_ 


_Administration_ at p 167. 

81     The request for an ac c ount and any suit c ommenc ed for an ac c ount are not based on any allegations of impropriety on the part of the exec utor, but simply arise from the _fiduciary relationship_ between a fiduc iary (the exec utor) and the objec t of the fiduc iary duty (the benefic iaries): _A-G v Cocke_ [1988] Ch 414 (“ _A-G v Cocke_ ”) at 420. Naturally, if there is an allegation of a breac h of fiduc iary duty, the benefic iaries would all the more be entitled to an ac c ount: _Foo Jee Seng (CA)_ at [87]. The only exc eption oc c urs where it would be oppressive to require the exec utor to so ac c ount, or for some other good reason, the c ourt in its disc retion thinks it wrong to make an order: _A-G v Cocke_ at 420. 

_General duty to act in best interest of the beneficiaries_ 

82     Bec ause an exec utor is in a fiduc iary relationship with the benefic iaries (see _Lee Yoke San_ at [35] and _A-G v Cocke_ at 420), it is the exec utor’s foremost duty to ac t in the best interests of the benefic iaries when c arrying out his duties or exerc ising his powers, in the sense that he must do his best to promote the benefic iary’s affairs: _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore: Equity and Trusts_ at para 110.213. 

83     Where an exec utor is to ac t for the benefit of a c lass of persons, suc h as multiple benefic iaries of a will, he must advanc e their c ommon interests, holding the sc ales evenly among the benefic iaries, and ac t with detac hment and impartiality: _Probate and Administration_ at p 165. I should add that this is espec ially important when the exec utor is _himself_ a benefic iary, suc h as the 1st Defendant is in the present c ase. In suc h a c ase, it is all the more c ruc ial that he c annot prefer his own interest over that of other benefic iaries. 

**_The Plaintiffs’ claims against the 1st Defendant_** 

84     Having set out the duties owed by an exec utor, I now turn to the Plaintiffs’ c laims against the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Father’s estate. The main issue is whether the 1st Defendant’s ac ts and omissions breac hed the CA Orders and his duties as the exec utor of the Late Father’s estate. The relevant ac ts and omissions broadly fall into three c ategories: (i) his failure to provide further ac c ounts of rent rec eived from the Property; (ii) his setting aside of only $200,000 and not $350,000 for legal c osts of CA 70 and OS 909; and (iii) his reimbursements of various expense c laims by himself and the 3rd Defendant, while not taking into ac c ount the c laims by the Plaintiffs. I shall deal with eac h of them in turn. 

_Account of rent_ 

85     To rec apitulate, one of the CA Orders is that “the [1st Defendant] shall, within three months of the date of the judgment hereof, _ie_ , 7th August 2012, furnish an ac c ount of the trust to all the benefic iaries” (see [18] above). I pause to observe that even in the absenc e of the CA Orders, it is inc umbent upon the 1st Defendant, as exec utor of the Late Father’s estate, to render an ac c ount of the estate when required to do so, by virtue of his fiduc iary relationship with the benefic iaries (see [80] – [81] above). 

The parties’ submissions 

86     The Plaintiffs submit that the 1st Defendant failed and/or refused to provide an ac c ount of the trust, and in partic ular, the rent proc eeds he rec eived from the Property to date, despite the express 

CA Orders whic h were not varied. [note: 41] It is c lear that the Property, at the very least, had been

rented out from time to time. Private investigators from Covert Investigations Pte Ltd were hired, and the investigation report revealed that the Property was oc c upied by no less than 16 persons, all of 

whom were foreigners and most of whom were Myanmar nationals. [note: 42] The Report c overed the period 23 August 2011 to 14 September 2011.The ac c ount of rent that the 1st Defendant provided in his Affidavit of Evidenc e-inChief (“AEIC”) in OS 909 was plainly inadequate, as the CA was aware of the ac c ount of rent in his AEIC but nonetheless made the order for him to provide an ac c ount of the 

trust in CA 70. [note: 43] 

87     The 1st Defendant did not dispute that the CA had ordered that he was to provide an ac c ount of the trust, inc luding the rent proc eeds. However, his position was that there were no additional rent proc eeds to disc lose, as all the rent c ollec ted and the expenses inc urred between September 2009 to September 2010 had been disc losed at para 53 of the AEIC dated 22 Oc tober 2010, whic h was filed in 

OS 909. [note: 44] These are reproduc ed below: 

88     Further, the 1st Defendant submits that at the hearing of SUM 634, the Plaintiffs’ enforc ement applic ation, the 1st Defendant had explained his predic ament to the Court of Appeal. Sinc e leave was granted to withdraw the summons with no further order to ac c ount, he did not therefore have a 

c ontinuing duty to ac c ount for his trust. [note: 45] 

89     In any event, the 1st Defendant stated that it was not possible for him to c ontinue renting the Property out to foreign workers, as a letter from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) dated 16 April 2010 (“the URA letter”) had explic itly stated that URA had not approved the use of the Property as a workers’ dormitory, and that the unauthorised use must c ease within one month from the date of 

the letter in order to avoid enforc ement ac tion being taken. [note: 46] 

90     At trial, the 1st Defendant c larified that after 16 May 2010 (the one-month deadline set by 


URA), “the house was empty” all the way _until “somewhere after CA 70”_. [note: 47] Thereafter, the 1st Defendant said that he rented out one of the rooms in the house to some Myanmar nationals for about seven to eight months. These tenants had stayed in the Property to take c are of and maintain 

the premises. [note: 48] The sums c ollec ted from these oc c upants were minimal, and only defrayed the 

c osts of utilities and gardening. [note: 49] 

91     The 1st Defendant also alleges that it was the 1st Plaintiff who had rented out various rooms in 

the Property to various tenants until 2010. [note: 50] For this allegation, he relies on a letter dated 1 

Marc h 2010, [note: 51] in whic h 1st Plaintiff informed the oc c upants that they c ould c ontinue staying in the Property, but were to pay rental to the Late Father’s estate from 1 Marc h 2010. This showed that the 1st Plaintiff was c learly aware of the identity of the tenants and was even able to list their identific ation numbers. The 1st Plaintiff, however, asserted that he had been working overseas at 

least sinc e 2008 and c ould not have been renting out the Property then. [note: 52] 

92     I pause here to note that after the death of the Late Father in 1979, the Late Mother was the sole exec utor of the Late Father’s Estate. It would be rec alled that the 1st Defendant did not ac tually bec ome appointed as the exec utor until 11 January 2010 (see [7] above). It appears that the Late Mother resided in the Property together with the Late Brother up to the time of their passing. It is unc lear when the Late Brother’s wife left the property. It is also unc lear when the 2nd Plaintiff, 1st Defendant and 3rd Defendant c eased to reside at the Property. Indeed, even in the c ase of the 1st Plaintiff, the evidenc e as to his residenc e in the Property was c onfused. On the whole, it seems that he was working in Malaysia from 2006 to 2007. It appears that he returned to Singapore in 2007. [note: 53] Thereafter, on 8 August 2008, he left to work in Qatar (whic h is now his plac e of residenc e). 

[note: 54] However, his evidenc e was rather inc onsistent. At one point, the 1st Plaintiff asserted that 

he never went overseas while his mother was alive ( _ie_ , before 25 July 2005). [note: 55] A short while later, the 1st Plaintiff said that “[he had] been overseas _since the year 2002_ ” [emphasis added]. [note: 56] The general point is that it is unc lear as to whic h sibling was in effec tive day-to-day c ontrol 

of the Property. The evidenc e as to when the Property or individual rooms in the Property were rented out, and to whom, was also thin and c onfused. That said there is some evidenc e that the 1st Defendant visited the property from time to time and was handed sums of c ash for utility bills in 2012. [note: 57] 

Dec ision 

93     In my view, the 1st Defendant c learly owes a duty to provide an ac c ount of the trust, inc luding rent proc eeds, pursuant to the CA Orders and also under c ommon law (see [80]–[81] above). I agree with the Plaintiffs that the Court of Appeal had c learly been aware of the ac c ount set out in the 1st Defendant’s AEIC in OS 909, but had nonetheless ordered an ac c ount of the trust. This must mean that the Court of Appeal still c onsidered it nec essary to impose a positive duty on the 1st Defendant to ac c ount for rental inc ome. 

94     The 1st Defendant argues that bec ause leave was granted in SUM 634 to withdraw the enforc ement applic ation, with no further order as to his duty to ac c ount, this must have meant that he was no longer under a c ontinuing obligation to ac c ount for the rent. I am unable to agree. Instead, the withdrawal of SUM 634 merely signified that the the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant no longer wished to _enforce_ the CA Orders at that time, but did not go towards _negating_ his c ontinuing duty to provide an ac c ount in ac c ordanc e with the CA Orders. The Court of Appeal, in granting leave to withdraw SUM 634, was not making any judgment on the merits of the CA Orders, nor was it varying 


them. 

95     One of the 1st Defendant’s arguments is that he was not in rec eipt of any rental inc ome, other than those disc losed in his AEIC in OS 909. This is c learly not the c ase in light of the Covert Investigation Report (see [86] above), whic h related to investigations c arried out between 23 August and 14 September 2011 ( _ie_ , _before_ the CA Orders were made). The Covert Investigation Reports showed that there were still oc c upants in the Property. These rental rec eipts were not rec orded in the 1st Defendant’s AEIC in OS 909, whic h only c overed the period from September 2009 to September 2010. The Covert Investigation Report was not seriously c hallenged by the 1st Defendant at trial. I am more inc lined to give greater weight to the Covert Investigation Report than the 1st Defendant’s c ontrary stanc e at trial, where he made the bare assertion (with vague details) that the 

Property was empty and not rented out until sometime _after_ CA 70. [note: 58] 

96     The URA letter is also not of muc h assistanc e to the 1st Defendant. While the URA letter prohibited the use of the Property as a _workers’ dormitory_ , it did not prevent any rental of the Property at all. It therefore does not prec lude the rental of the Property to any persons other than foreign workers. It c annot be used to prove that the 1st Defendant never rented out the Property after the rec eipt of the URA letter. 

97     A related argument, raised at trial, is that the 1st Defendant did not rec eive any rental inc ome bec ause any money paid was used to defray utility and gardening bills of the Property. In my view, this is simply irrelevant. The CA Orders only provide that the 1st Defendant has to provide an ac c ount of the trust. They do not state that the 1st Defendant must only so ac c ount if he has made an _overall profit_ , _ie_ , if the rent he rec eived exc eeded the expenses inc urred in the upkeep of the Property. All that the 1st Defendant is obliged to do is to provide an ac c ount of the rent he rec eived and expenses inc urred during the relevant periods, even if, like in July, August and September 2010, he inc urred a net loss. This, in my opinion, should not be an unduly onerous task. 

98     However, I should add that based on the material before the c ourt, it is unlikely that the ac c ount will disc lose “very substantial” inc ome rec eived by the 1st Defendant, if at all. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in CA 70 had observed (at [8]) that the net rental inc ome from the Property was not high, ranging from $1,130 in September 2009 to $200 in September 2010. Nonetheless, even if any rent after September 2010 was small, this does not detrac t from the 1st Defendant’s c ontinuing duty to provide suc h ac c ount. 

99     I now deal briefly with the 1st Defendant’s assertion that it was _the 1st Plaintiff_ who had been renting out the Property. The only evidenc e that the 1st Defendant relied on was the letter from the 

1st Plaintiff to several foreign nationals dated 1 Marc h 2010. [note: 59] It appears from the letter that the 1st Plaintiff was dissatisfied with the 1st Defendant’s administration of the Late Father’s estate, and had instruc ted the tenants to pay rent to the Late Father’s estate, presumably instead of to the 1st Defendant. The 1st Plaintiff did not, at any point in the letter, state that he was the one who had rented out the Property to the tenants. In fac t, under c ross-examination, the 1st Plaintiff c larified that these tenants were staying in the Property “rent-free” in exc hange for their taking c are of the 

Property while the 1st Plaintiff was overseas. [note: 60] They also paid the utilities bills and other outgoings. Although the rest of the siblings (exc ept the Late Brother) had moved out of the Property, the 1st Plaintiff denies that he was in c ontrol of it and states that the Property was a “family house” 

and that the siblings c ould go bac k to it at any time. [note: 61] In light of the whole of the evidenc e, I am not satisfied that the 1st Plaintiff had rec eived any rent from the Property. 

_Costs of CA 70 and OS 909_ 


100    I now move on to another of the CA Orders for the c osts of the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant in CA 70 and OS 909 that was to be paid out of the proc eeds of the sale of the Property. The Court of Appeal did not, however, determine the quantum of the c osts to be paid. The quantum bec ame a substantial bone of c ontention in the present suit. 

The Plaintiffs’ submissions 

101    Ac c ording to the Plaintiffs, there was an agreement between the parties for c osts of CA 70 and 

OS 909 to be fixed at $350,000. [note: 62] This amount was supposed to be set aside from the sale proc eeds of the Property, but was not. In support of their position, the Plaintiffs refer to the following series of c orrespondenc e. 

102    On 12 November 2012, WTL wrote to the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant, asking them to “please c onfirm whether you have spoken with [the 1st Defendant] as to whether he is agreeable to have your c osts of the Appeal [ _ie_ , CA 70] and the c ourt below [ _ie_ , OS 909] fixed at $350,000.00 (inc lusive of disbursements).” WTL further stated that “[i]f there is no agreement by [the 1st Defendant] as to the c osts, we will have to tax the c osts. Please let us have [the 1st Defendant]’s agreement by c lose of business, Monday, 19 November 2012, failing whic h we will proc eed to tax the 

c osts”. [note: 63] 

103    Later that day, the 3rd Defendant forwarded the email attac hing the WTL letter to the 1st Defendant, asking him to “please read the attac hed file” and said that the 1st Defendant c ould c all 

him later”. [note: 64] 

104    On 13 November 2012, the 1st Defendant replied to the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant, stating that “I have no problems to the c ost if all our legal c ost all c an c laim to estate, with rec eipt, we don’t want to have further damage and c ost inc ur[r]ed. Cost for tax is not nec essary, we siblings have to sit down and disc uss with answ[e]r and in Win Win situation” (“the 13 November 2012 

email”). [note: 65] 

105    On 19 November 2012, the 3rd Defendant wrote to WTL, c opying the Plaintiffs, stating, “I had spoken to [the 1st Defendant] and he was agreeable to have our c ost of the Appeal [ _ie_ , CA 70] and the c ourt below [ _ie_ , OS 909] fixed at $350,000.00 (inc lusive of disbursements)... Thus, do not 

proc eed to tax the c osts” (“the 19 November 2012 email”). [note: 66] 

106    On 23 November 2012, Ms Hwa wrote to the 3rd Defendant, c opying the Plaintiffs, stating “We note your instruc tions that [the 1st Defendant] has agreed on the Appellant’s c osts for [CA 70] and [OS 909] at $350,000 in lieu of taxation. As suc h, we forward the agreement on c osts for [the 1st Defendant] to sign and return to us the duly signed original agreement for our rec ord”. Ms Hwa duly 

attac hed the agreement on c osts to be signed by the 1st Defendant. [note: 67] 

107    The Plaintiffs argue that the above c orrespondenc e was evidenc e that the 1st Defendant had 

agreed to pay the sum of $350,000, and that he subsequently reneged on the agreement. [note: 68] 

The 1st and 3rd Defendant’s submissions 

108    On the other hand, the 1st and 3rd Defendant’s c ase is that the 1st Defendant never agreed to fixed c osts of $350,000. The 1st Defendant points out that the 13 November 2012 email was c learly premised, _inter alia_ , on c osts being verified with rec eipts, whic h were not provided by the 


Plaintiffs. Further, the 19 November 2012 email, whic h alleged that the 1st Defendant had agreed to the c osts, was sent by _the 3rd Defendant_ to WTL and the Plaintiffs, without c opying the 1st Defendant. It c annot be used as evidenc e to show that _the 1st Defendant_ had agreed to the fixed 

c osts. [note: 69] 

109    The 1st and 3rd Defendants both point out that the ac tual amount of c osts inc urred in OS 909 and CA 70 was only about $296,000, whic h fell short of $350,000. Thus, the 1st and 3rd Defendants 

allege that the Plaintiffs are attempting to profit from the litigation. [note: 70] 

110    The 3rd Defendant’s main gripe is that the 1st Plaintiff’s c osts for hiring Mr Rama in OS 909 (see [13] above) were inc urred in relation to the Late Mother’s estate, and should not be c laimed from the Late Father’s estate. This is espec ially bec ause Mr Rama left the c hambers at the hearing of OS 909 in the High Court, upon Prakash J’s indic ation that it was inappropriate for two sets of solic itors to be ac ting for the Plaintiffs. In the 3rd Defendant’s view, Mr Rama therefore “did not do 

any legal work pertaining to [the Late Father’s] estate”. [note: 71] Further, the 3rd Defendant is of the view that the 1st Plaintiff should not be allowed to rec over the c osts paid to M/s Wong, Thomas and Leong for SUM 5533 (see [17] above), whic h was dismissed with no order as to c osts, as it again 

related to the Late Mother’s estate. [note: 72] 

Dec ision 

111    The first question that arises for determination is whether there was an agreement for legal c osts to be fixed at $350,000. In my view, it is evident that there was no suc h agreement. It was _the 3rd Defendant_ who had informed WTL that the 1st Defendant had agreed to the fixed c osts, on his own interpretation of the 1st Defendant’s words in the 13 November 2012 email. The 1st Defendant himself never replied in these terms, and the 1st Plaintiff c onc eded that this was the c ase at trial. [note: 73] The 1st Defendant also never signed the agreement to c osts whic h was forwarded by WTL. 

That must have been prec isely the reason WTL proc eeded to tax the c osts of CA 70 and OS 909, whic h is what it had indic ated it would do if there was no agreement to c osts (see [102] above). 

112    I pause to observe that the Plaintiffs’ position on the alleged $350,000 in c osts shifted in the c ourse of these proc eedings. In SOC-2, the 1st Plaintiff’s AEIC and the Plaintiffs’ opening statement, 

the $350,000 was referred to as “legal c osts” or “the c osts of... OS 909 and CA 70”, [note: 74] whic h were _actually_ inc urred. However, during c ross-examination by the 1st Defendant’s c ounsel, the 1st 

Plaintiff c onc eded that he did not in fac t inc ur $350,000 in c osts, but only about $296,000. [note: 75] The ac tual sum inc urred is also evidenc ed by an email from Ms Hwa to the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant on 28 September 2012, whic h summarised the c osts of CA 70 and OS 909 as merely 

$296,135.28. [note: 76] 

113    Instead, the 1st Plaintiff said that the figure of $350,000 was merely for c osts that were “inc urred _and anticipated_ ” [emphasis added] and whic h “enc ompass[ed] everything”. It was to be set aside on a c ontingenc y basis, over and above the ac tual c osts inc urred, in c ase any further 

applic ations to Court in c onnec tion with the matter was required. [note: 77] Given that this was the c ase, the 1st Plaintiff’s attempt to explain that $350,000 was to be set aside for c osts already inc urred as well as antic ipated c osts c omes very late in the day, and does not square with evidenc e of ac tual legal c osts inc urred. In my view, this was nothing more than an afterthought and a poor attempt to justify the $350,000 he insisted was agreed upon. 

114    As it turned out, the sum of $200,000 set aside for the legal c osts of CA 70 and OS 909 was 


more than suffic ient. Upon bills of c osts c oming for taxation in BC 127 and 160 before AR Lee on 15 August 2014 and a subsequent review by Prakash J on 31 Oc tober 2014, the c osts were determined 

to only be about $150,000. [note: 78] I note that the taxation had gone through two layers of sc rutiny. The present proc eedings c annot be used as a bac kdoor to c hallenge the taxed c osts. On the same note, while I understand that the 3rd Defendant disputes the appropriateness of inc luding the legal fees paid to Mr Rama, I do not find it nec essary to delve into the prec ise figures. These disputes had already been raised by the 3rd Defendant at the taxation hearing and review, and must 

have been taken into ac c ount by AR Lee and Prakash J. [note: 79] 

115    In any event, I note that there is c lear doc umentary evidenc e that the 3rd Defendant and Foo Chin Chin had expressly agreed that if there was a shortfall in funds and the $200,000 set aside was not enough to meet the taxed legal c osts of CA 70 and OS 909, they were willing to “top up” the 

differenc e from their shares. [note: 80] This is, in my view, eminently reasonable. 

_The claims_ 

116    Finally, I turn to the various heads of c laims that are disputed by the parties. 

Should the 1st Defendant have forwarded the ac c ounts prior to distribution? 

117    Before delving into the spec ific s of eac h of the disputed c laims, I first deal briefly with the Plaintiffs’ submission that the 1st Defendant should have kept them informed about the various expense c laims made by the other benefic iaries, for example, by forwarding them the ac c ounts prior to distribution so that they c an be aware of the c laims against the Late Father’s estate and take a 

position on any disputed payments. [note: 81] I was not, however, pointed to any c ase authority on point. 

118    In my judgment, this issue c an be analysed under the existing framework of the exec utor’s duties as set out earlier. Under this framework, the 1st Defendant was indeed under a duty to forward the ac c ounts to the Plaintiffs (as well as other benefic iaries), detailing the c laims made and the amounts to be paid out, before instruc ting the 2nd Defendant to distribute the sales proc eeds. This is part of his duty to provide ac c ounts of the assets when the benefic iaries so require (see [80] above). 

119    The imposition of this duty simultaneously helps to fulfil another of the 1st Defendant’s duties as exec utor, whic h is to ac t in the best interest of the benefic iaries. By forwarding the ac c ounts to the Plaintiffs and other benefic iaries, he ensures that they are kept fully informed of all material fac ts that may affec t their rights and entitlements under the will, and have the opportunity to inspec t the ac c ounts and voic e any c onc erns about them. This is espec ially so bec ause the 1st Defendant must have been aware from the email c orrespondenc e that the Plaintiffs had objec tions to some of the c laims, suc h as the expenses involved in the removal of the family altar. 

120    The forwarding of the ac c ounts to the benefic iaries is made all the more important in this c ase, bec ause the 3rd Defendant was in fac t given a c opy of the Statements of Ac c ounts of both the Late Father and Late Mother’s estates on 21 May 2013 (see [29] above). The 1st Defendant therefore should also have forwarded the Statements of Ac c ounts to the other benefic iaries, to disc harge his duty of ac ting fairly and impartially among the members of a c lass of benefic iaries and to hold the sc ales evenly between them (see [82] and [83] above). 

121    In the ideal sc enario, the benefic iaries will agree to and approve the ac c ounts before distribution (see [80] above). However, I am c ognisant that in this partic ular c ase, the prec ise reason 


that the 1st Defendant did not want the ac c ounts to be forwarded to the benefic iaries was bec ause he did not want to inc ur further legal c osts in the event of additional disputes between the benefic iaries. While the danger of gridloc k among the benefic iaries is a legitimate c onc ern, the 1st Defendant must still ac t impartially and not prefer his own c laims or the c laims of some benefic iaries over that of the others. Instead, the 1st Defendant should have forwarded the ac c ounts to the benefic iaries and parties should have tried to c ome to an agreement on the c laims. If this was not possible, the 1st Defendant should have sought the assistanc e of the c ourt. The 1st Defendant should not have attempted to c irc umvent the problem _by simply keeping the beneficiaries in the dark_. I, therefore, find that the 1st Defendant had breac hed his duty in failing to forward the ac c ounts to the benefic iaries of the Late Father’s estate. Nonetheless, given that the present suit has been brought by the Plaintiffs, the c ourt is now essentially c alled on to adjudic ate on the disputed c laims. 

Claims taken into ac c ount 

122    I now move on to the c laims that the 1st Defendant had taken into ac c ount prior to distribution. The Plaintiffs’ position is that the 1st Defendant breac hed his fiduc iary duties by 

ac c epting these c laims, whic h were unreasonably c laimed and unreasonable in amount. [note: 82] I will examine eac h c laim in turn. 

Repairs to the Property: $37,436.50 

123    The first disputed c laim is in relation to c osts allegedly inc urred by the 1st Defendant for repairs c arried out on the Property, amounting to $37,436.50. 

_The parties’ submissions_ 

124    The Plaintiffs’ main grievanc e is the verac ity of the $35,000 allegedly inc urred for “supply material and labour c ost” to repair the Property. They c ontend that these were unsubstantiated by 

any invoic es, rec eipts or other evidenc e of payment. [note: 83] Ac c ording to the Plaintiffs, the $35,000 “c ash sales” doc ument that the 1st Defendant referred to at trial was c ompletely unsatisfac tory, as it was devoid of details suc h as the name of the c ontrac tor, his c ontac t details, and the date that the 

works were c ommenc ed or c ompleted. [note: 84] 

125    Further, the Plaintiffs point out that the large sum that the 1st Defendant allegedly spent on repairs to the Property was c ontrary to the position he took at para 84 of his AEIC in SUM 5533, filed on 7 February 2012, in whic h he stated that “there was no real need to spend a large sum of money to repair [the Property]. This is bec ause [the Property] [was] a struc turally sound and solid building, save for some parts of the building whic h require some repairs”. 

126    The 1st Defendant, on the other hand, states that his expenditure is reasonable and fully supported by invoic es, whereas the Plaintiffs had not proffered any alternative valuations for the 

repairs, whic h made their assertions on the c osts of the repairs spec ulative. [note: 85] 

127    The 1st Defendant also points to a letter from the Building and Construc tion Authority (“BCA”) 

dated 16 November 2010 (“the BCA letter”), [note: 86] whic h indic ated that the struc tural integrity of 

the Property was of c onc ern. [note: 87] In partic ular, the BCA letter highlighted the “extensively damaged termite infested roof” of the premises, advising the immediate engagement of a Professional Engineer to inspec t the roof and building struc ture, and to advise on nec essary protec tive measures. Thus, the 1st Defendant argues, the expenses are c ompletely nec essary and legitimate. At trial, Ms Chee also indic ated that she had c onsidered the c laim, reviewed photographs produc ed by the 1st 


Defendant and noted that the timber rafters of the roof had been replac ed. She observed that the c ost of treated timber was “very high” and thus thought that the $35,000 inc urred was reasonable. [note: 88] 

_Decision_ 

128    Upon c areful c onsideration, I do not, on balanc e, see any reason to rejec t the 1st Defendant’s c laims for repairs. This is espec ially so when seen in light of the following c irc umstanc es. The BCA letter on 10 November 2010 c learly referred to an “extensively damaged termite infested roof” at the Property. This must have meant that there was a genuine need to c arry out extensive repair works on the roof. About one and a half years later, on 1 February 2012, a c ivil engineer inspec ted the Property and prepared a report dated 2 February 2012. He c onc luded that the building was in “good struc tural c ondition[]”. In partic ular, he observed that the “roofing is in good working c ondition[] exc ept for some minor rafter defec ts” whic h was due to some of the timber rafters being “[worn] out” (rather than bec ause of any termite infestation). A photo of the roof attac hed to the report was 

ac c ompanied by the c aption “[t]imber roof [is] safe and sound”. [note: 89] The c ontrasting positions taken in the BCA letter and the c ivil engineer’s report a year and a half later, on the very same Property, must have meant that rec tific ation works had been c arried out in the interim period. These repair works are evidenc ed by various rec eipts for the repair work done to the roof prec isely during 

that interim period, between Oc tober 2011 and January 2012. [note: 90] The repair works may well have meant that the 1st Defendant inc urred signific ant c osts, espec ially when, as the 1st Defendant stated at trial, the c ontrac tor had to “remove all the termite infec ted roof struc ture...and replac e all 

the roof c eiling”. [note: 91] Thus, although the doc umentary evidenc e is far from perfec t, it is nonetheless my view that the $35,000 c ash sales invoic e dated 30 Oc tober 2011 is, on a balanc e of probabilities, a legitimate expense inc urred by the 1st Defendant. 

129    I should add that I find the BCA letter to be a more objec tive assessment of the state of the Property, as c ompared to the 1st Defendant’s c ontrary statement in his AEIC in SUM 5533 that the Property was struc turally sound. 

Transportation c osts for removal of rubbish: $5,000 

130    With that, I move on to the next disputed c laim, whic h is the 1st Defendant’s c laim for $5,000 as transportation c osts for the removal of unwanted items and rubbish from the Property. These expenses were allegedly for the ten trips made on 13 Marc h 2013 and 17 April 2013. 

_The parties’ submissions_ 

131    The Plaintiffs agree in princ iple that the 1st Defendant should be reimbursed for reasonable expenses inc urred as the transportation c osts for removal of rubbish, but that there was no proof 

that these c osts were reasonably inc urred. [note: 92] The Plaintiffs argue that the rubbish outside the gate was limited, and would not require four additional trips to c lear in April 2013. There was also no reason the 1st Defendant c ould not have ensured that the c ontrac tors finished removing the rubbish 

in Marc h 2013. [note: 93] 

132    The 1st Defendant’s position was that the Property had been oc c upied by the Foo family for about 50 years, during whic h they had ac c umulated numerous personal effec ts, resulting in the Property being in an unkempt state. The 1st Defendant was thus duty bound as exec utor to instruc t professional movers to dispose of unused artic les and rubbish in view of impending sale of the 


Property. [note: 94] The Plaintiffs had failed to show why the expenses were unreasonably inc urred or 

provide any alternative quotations. [note: 95] 

_Decision_ 

133    At the outset, I note that the 1st Plaintiff did not dispute that he was “agreeable [to] reasonable expenses so inc urred to be borne by the estate” and that, “[b]eing the exec utor of [the Late Father’s] estate, [the 1st Defendant] c an do what [he] deem[s] fit[] to vac ate the Property with appropriate c ost[s] being born by the estate” and that he “never had any objec tions in this 

regard”. [note: 96] 

134    The 1st Plaintiff also stated that he believed that “there [were] many stuff (like unused c hairs, 

tables, utensil, c upboard etc ) [that]...need to be removed” from the Property. [note: 97] Under c rossexamination by the 1st Defendant’s c ounsel, the 2nd Plaintiff also c onfirmed that there were many 

items in the Property that would need to be removed. [note: 98] Curiously, the Plaintiffs nonetheless disagreed that the transport c osts inc urred by the 1st Defendant was reasonable. 

135    In my view, it is disingenuous for the Plaintiffs to c laim that they agree for reasonable c osts to be inc urred, admit that numerous artefac ts were ac c umulated over the years, and yet insist that the transportation c osts were exc essive and on suc h a flimsy basis. This is espec ially so as it is undisputed that the expenses inc urred in Marc h and April 2013 are supported by handwritten rec eipts, [note: 99] and the Plaintiffs had no alternative quotations upon whic h reasonableness (or the lac k of it) 

c an be assessed. [note: 100] I, therefore, find the 1st Defendant’s c laim for $5,000 as transportation c osts for the removal of unwanted items and rubbish from the Property to be a reasonable c laim. 

Removal of altar and religious c eremonies: $14,000 

136    I turn to the next c laim by the 3rd Defendant for $14,000 in respec t of prayers and religious rites c onduc ted for the dec eased family members, and the removal of a single family altar from the Property. 

_The parties’ submissions_ 

137    The Plaintiffs c ontend that the altar c ould have been removed for $2,000 by a “temple c aretaker”, and that they had already made known to the 1st and 2nd Defendants that they were 

unwilling to pay more than $2,000 for the removal of the altar. [note: 101] Further, the Plaintiffs state that sinc e it is a family altar, not all of the $14,000 should be deduc ted from the Late Father’s estate alone. Instead, the sum should be divided and a part of it c laimed from another estate, suc h as the Late Brother’s or Late Mother’s estate, espec ially bec ause there were separate invoic es issued for 

eac h of the family members, whic h spec ified the items purc hased and servic es performed. [note: 102] 

138    The 1st and 3rd Defendants, however, state that the family tradition of anc estral worship involves saying prayers for those who have passed on, and moving the family altar to a proper plac e 

of rest. [note: 103] The altar is a “prec ious item” whic h “c annot simply be c rowbarred off the wall and thrown into the bac k of a lorry to be transported elsewhere”. Instead, “[m]oving it was an intric ate task that only Taoist priests c ould reasonably undertake, and needless to say this entailed inc urring 

signific ant c ost” whic h was nonetheless reasonably inc urred. [note: 104] Further, the 1st Defendant argues that under s 67(1) of the Probate and Administration Ac t, funeral expenses must be “suitable 


to the station in life of the dec eased”. The family altar was a spiritual embodiment of the family’s anc estral beliefs and prac tic es, thus the c eremony and rites were fitting with tradition and not a 

fanc iful whim. [note: 105] 

_Decision_ 

139    I agree with the 1st Defendant that the c osts of removing the family altar and the religious c eremonies for the dec eased family members is a legitimate expense that is expressly allowed under s 67(1) of the Probate and Administration Ac t. These are “reasonable expenses of subsequent religious c eremonies suitable to the station in life of the dec eased”. In addition, these are also nec essary expenses to allow for the vac ant transfer of the Property, thus they are properly inc urred for the benefit of the Late Father’s estate. The expenses are also fully supported by offic ial rec eipts from the 

Taoist Ritual and Prayer Ceremony Servic es. [note: 106] 

140    The Plaintiffs’ c laim that the removal of the family altar c ould have been done for $2,000 is a mere assertion and their evidenc e in support of this is woefully thin, if at all existent. Further, the assertion that the expenses should have been split between all the estates, inc luding the Late Brother’s estate, was never pleaded. There is no dispute that there was only one family altar for all the generations of dec eased family members, and it would not be sensible to split the c osts ac ross all of these estates. 

SubConc lusion on c laims taken into ac c ount 

141    For the abovementioned reasons, I find that none of the c laims that had been taken into ac c ount by the 1st Defendant were unreasonable in nature and quantum. I therefore find that the 1st Defendant had not breac hed any of his duties in taking these c laims into ac c ount. 

Claims not taken into ac c ount 

142    I now c ome to the c laims of the Plaintiffs that they say the 1st Defendant should have taken into ac c ount, but did not. The Plaintiffs’ c laims relate to: 

 (a) $16,330.31 for utilities, property tax, telec ommunic ations bills, termite, bee and snake removal, and renovation works on the Property (“the misc ellaneous expenses”); and 

 (b) $2,000 as the fixed c osts for SUM 634, the enforc ement applic ation subsequently withdrawn by the the Plaintiffs and 3rd Defendant: see [24] above (“the enforc ement c osts”). 

The parties’ submissions 

143    The Plaintiffs allege that the 1st Defendant breac hed his fiduc iary duties by failing to ac t fairly between the benefic iaries. This is bec ause he allegedly preferred his own c laims against the Late Father’s estate, as well as the c laims of the other benefic iaries, but failed to take the Plaintiffs’ c laims 

into ac c ount. [note: 107] 

144    The 1st Defendant’s position was that the Plaintiffs had ample time to put in their c laims. From the time the Property was c ontrac ted for sale on 7 February 2013, to the notific ation by Ms Chee that the c heques were ready for c ollec tion on 31 May 2016, the Plaintiffs had more than three 

months to submit their c laims. [note: 108] Further, the Plaintiffs were, at the material time, represented by WTL, whic h was in a position to put forth all c laims on behalf of the Plaintiffs. 


However, no c laims were made, other than the c laim for legal c osts of $350,000. The 1st Defendant was thus unaware of the c laims and was c onsequently not in a position to c onsider the merits of 

these c laims, or to ac c ept or rejec t them. [note: 109] 

145    In relation to their c laim for misc ellaneous expenses, the Plaintiffs argue that the c laim is proved by c heques made payable to “Air IQ Engineering and Marketing” and should have been inc luded in the 1st Defendant’s ac c ounts. 

146    However, the 1st Defendant states that the c laims were not made timeously, prior to distribution. He says that the belated c laim simply evidenc es a “tit-for-tat” strategy by the Plaintiffs, who only dec ided to bring the c laim after they notic ed that the 1st Defendant had also made c laims 

against the Late Father’s estate. [note: 110] Further, the 1st Defendant argues that the c laims were brought in bad faith. There were no supporting doc uments for the c laim for property tax. The utilities and telec ommunic ation bills were attributable to the oc c upants of the Property at that time, and not to the Late Father’s estate. The c heques issued to “Air IQ Engineering and Marketing” for the alleged renovation works did not explain what these servic es were for and how they related to the Late Father’s estate. In any event, the c heques allegedly in support of the Plaintiffs’ c laim only add up to about $7,000. As for the other inc idental expenses, suc h as for nails, paintwork and materials, the 1st Plaintiff had enjoyed rent-free oc c upation of the Property to the exc lusion of the other benefic iaries for many years. Any expenses inc urred in the upkeep of the Property would have been the result of 

his own use and should be borne by the 1st Plaintiff and not by the Late Father’s estate. [note: 111] 

147    The 3rd Defendant asserts that this c laim was an afterthought, as it was submitted very late in the day. The three c heques exhibited only added up to $7,000, and the rest of the invoic es add up to approximately $6,086.83. The total was $13,086.43 whic h was still some distanc e from the c laim of more than $16,000. 

148    As for the enforc ement c osts, the Plaintiffs allege that the sum of $2,000 should have been set aside from the Late Father’s estate. The 1st Defendant’s position was that the $200,000 legal c osts 

set aside would be suffic ient to c over the enforc ement c osts of $2,000. [note: 112] 

Dec ision 

_The 1st Defendant did not breach his fiduciary duties_ 

149    I first deal with the broad issue of whether the Defendant had breac hed his fiduc iary duties by unfairly preferring the c laims of the other benefic iaries (inc luding himself ) and failing to take into ac c ount the Plaintiffs’ c laims. It will be rec alled that one of the duties of the 1st Defendant, as exec utor for a c lass of benefic iaries, is to ac t with impartiality and to hold the sc ales evenly among the benefic iaries: see [83] above. 

150    After c arefully reviewing the fac ts and c irc umstanc es of the c ase, as well as the c ontemporaneous doc uments, I am of the view that he did not breac h his duties in this respec t. This is for three main reasons. 

151    First, from as early as February 2013, the Plaintiffs were intimately involved in heated disc ussions about c ertain c laims that were to be made against the various estates. For example, the Plaintiffs sent various emails to the other benefic iaries between 2 February 2013 and 14 Marc h 2013, expressing their views on the c osts of moving the family altar and the expenses for removing rubbish 

from the Property. [note: 113] In fac t, on 19 Marc h 2013, the 1st Plaintiff wrote an email whic h 


c ontained detailed breakdowns of legal c osts inc urred, as well as debts due from the other 

benefic iaries to him. [note: 114] On 27 May 2013, the 2nd Plaintiff had personally attended at Ms Chee’s offic e, asking Ms Chee when she would rec eive her share of the sales proc eeds. The 2nd Plaintiff also said that she had c laims she wished to make against the Late Brother’s estate and 

passed Ms Chee some doc uments. [note: 115] In my judgment, these are all evidenc e that the Plaintiffs were ac utely aware that c laims were being made against the various estates by the other benefic iaries, and they also seemed to be in the midst of preparing their own c laims. 

152    Sec ond, I agree with the 1st Defendant that the Plaintiffs had, in any event, ample time to submit their c laims. From the time that they were aware that c laims were being made (February 2013) to the time that the 1st Defendant c ollec ted his share of the sale proc eeds (29 May 2013), there was an intervening period of more than three months in whic h c laims c ould have been made. Indeed, the misc ellaneous expenses were inc urred in or before 2008, and the Plaintiffs would have been aware of them in 2013, c ould have brought them up, but did not do so. Indeed, the Plaintiffs and Ms Hwa ac c epted that there was nothing to stop them putting in c laims and that they knew c laims were in 

fac t being made. [note: 116] 

153    Third, it is reasonable for the 1st Defendant to believe that all of the Plaintiffs’ c laims had already been submitted prior to the payments out. This is espec ially so given the following series of c orrespondenc e: 

 (a) On 19 Marc h 2013, Ms Hwa sent an email to Ms Chee (“the 19 Marc h 2013 WTL email”), stating “[w]e will c ollate the payments to be deduc ted from the sale proc eeds before distribution and forward these to you in due c ourse, together with the c ontrac ts”. This was in response to Ms Chee’s earlier email asking about the terms of engagement and agreed fees payable to DTZ. The “payments” presumably referred to the fees due to DTZ. Ms Hwa also stated, “our c lients want c ertain set-offs from eac h other’s share and onc e they have c onfirmed this, we will revert”. [note: 117] 

 (b) On 5 April 2013, WTL wrote a letter to the 2nd Defendant, stating: [note: 118] 

 On c ompletion of the sale of the Property, the following payments are to be made from the sale proc eeds: 

 a. DTZ’s c osts of valuation and their c ommission for the sale of the sums of $2,000 plus GST and $43,500.00 plus GST respec tively; 

 b. your legal c osts in ac ting for the vendor in the sale of the Property; 

 c. $350,000.00 made payable to use to meet the agreed c osts and expenses in respec t of OS 90[9] and CA 70; 

 d. a further sum of either $50,000.00 or $100,000.00 to meet the c osts of enforc ement proc eedings, whic h sum will be notified to you on 9 April 2013; 

 e. the balance sale proceeds after the payments set out in paragraphs 2a to 2d above , will be divided into 7 equal shares and paid to the following beneficiaries: 

 i. 1/7th share to [the 2nd Plaintiff]; 


 ii. 1/7th share to Foo Chin Chin; 

 iii. 1/7th share to [the 3rd Defendant]; 

 iv. 1/7th share to [the 1st Plaintiff]; 

 v. 1/7th share to the Estate of [the Late Mother]; and 

 vi. 2/7th share to [the 1st Defendant] of whic h 1/7th share is due to [the 1st Defendant] as benefic iary and 1/7th share to be held by [the 1st Defendant][ as trustee holding on trust for [the Late Brother’s] widow or estate. 

 [emphasis added in italic s and bold italic s] 

154    In my view, it is reasonable for the 1st Defendant to infer that the payments stated at paragraphs 2a to 2d were _exhaustive_ of the Plaintiffs’ c laims against the Late Father’s estate. This is espec ially so given that no other c laims were made between the 5 April 2013 letter and 29 May 2013, when the 1st Defendant c ollec ted his share of the sale proc eeds. That being the c ase, the 1st Defendant had duly taken into ac c ount all the c laims that he had been aware of at that time (see s 29 of the Trustees Ac t and [79] above). For this reason it is not nec essary to c onsider whether the 

1st Defendant is able to rely on sec tion 60 of the Trustees Ac t. [note: 119] 

155    In light of the foregoing, the Plaintiffs c annot now shift the blame to the 1st Defendant by alleging that he had breac hed his fiduc iary duties by deliberately ac ting unfairly towards them. Indeed, the Plaintiffs were, at all material times, represented by their solic itors, WTL, who were aware 

of the date of c ompletion of the sale of the Property. [note: 120] The 3rd Defendant and Foo Chin Chin 

- who were not even legally represented at that time – had managed to put in their c laims against the Late Father’s and Late Mother’s estates on their own ac c ord before the distribution was made to 

the 1st Defendant. [note: 121] The Plaintiffs’ c laims were not inc luded bec ause of their own fault, and not as a c onsequenc e of any unfair preferenc e or breac h of fiduc iary duty on the 1st Defendant’s part. This is espec ially so when I have already found earlier that the c laims that the 1st Defendant did take into ac c ount were reasonable both in nature and quantum: see [141] above. 

_The Plaintiffs’ claims should not in any case be allowed_ 

156    Even if I had found that the 1st Defendant had breac hed his fiduc iary duties, and should have taken the Plaintiffs’ c laims into ac c ount, I would still have been of the view that the Plaintiffs’ c laims should not be allowed. Even at trial, the expenses c laimed against the Late Father’s Estate were vague and poorly supported. The three c heques made to “Air IQ Engineering & Marketing” relied on by the Plaintiffs only totalled $7,000 and did not spec ify what the payments were for. Indeed, it was not even c lear whether the c heques were c leared by the bank, as there was no invoic e from the rec ipient. As for the renovation expenses for whic h rec eipts were produc ed, these were inc urred in early 2008 when the 1st Plaintiff was still residing in the Property ( _ie_ , before he left Singapore to work overseas), and also before the Property was c ontrac ted for sale. Given that this is the c ase, the renovation expenses would be for his own benefit as an oc c upier of the Property, rather than for the benefit of the Late Father’s estate. The expenses for property tax, utilities bills, telec ommunic ations bills, termite, bee, and snake removals were not at all supported by rec eipts. As I see it, the c laim for misc ellaneous expenses is merely an afterthought by the Plaintiffs and not legitimate expenses that were attributable to the Late Father’s estate. 


157    As for the enforc ement c osts, this was neither pleaded nor inc luded in the Plaintiffs’ AEICs. I agree that the 1st Defendant was aware that the enforc ement c osts were fixed by the Court of Appeal at $2,000, as he was present at the hearing of SUM 634 itself, and had thereafter informed 

the 2nd Defendant prec isely of this fac t. [note: 122] However, the $200,000 set aside for legal c osts is more than suffic ient to meet the c osts of SUM 634, sinc e the taxed c osts was only about $150,000. In fac t, Ms Chee’s c orrespondenc e to the 1st Defendant on 20 May 2013 and 29 May 2013 expressly stated that the $200,000 set aside was for legal c osts in c onnec tion with “the suits between [the 1st Defendant] and [his] siblings” (see [28] and [31] above), whic h would inc lude the enforc ement c osts. 

**_Conclusion on the Plaintiffs’ claims against the 1st Defendant_** 

158    I pause to summarise my findings on the c laims by the Plaintiffs against the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Father’s estate. I find that the 1st Defendant had breac hed his fiduc iary duties in failing to provide an ac c ount of rent rec eived from the Property, and in failing to forward the Statements of Ac c ounts to the Plaintiffs before distribution. However, the 1st Defendant did not breac h his fiduc iary duties in ac c epting the c laims that he did take into ac c ount, as they were reasonable both in nature and quantum. He also did not breac h his fiduc iary duties in not taking into ac c ount the Plaintiffs’ c laims, as that was a result of the Plaintiffs’ own fault in not submitting the c laims on time. For these reasons, the 1st Defendant did not unfairly prefer the c laims of the other benefic iaries over those of the Plaintiffs. In any event, even if the Plaintiffs had submitted the c laims in time, I note that the c laims would in all likelihood have been rejec ted for reasons as set out in [156] and [157]. For these reasons, the 1st Defendant’s failure to forward the Statements of Ac c ounts to the Plaintiffs did not c ause them to suffer any loss. 

**The Late Father’s estate: claims against the 2nd Defendant** 

159    Having dealt with the Plaintiffs’ c laims in relation to the Late Father’s estate against the 1st Defendant, I now turn to c onsider their c laims against the 2nd Defendant. 

**_The Plaintiffs’ submissions_** 

160    Ac c ording to the Plaintiffs, bec ause the 2nd Defendant was jointly appointed, it was under an 

express retainer to _both_ the Plaintiffs and the 1st Defendant. [note: 123] The very purpose of a joint appointment by the Court of Appeal was for the 2nd Defendant to ac t as a neutral solic itor to safeguard the parties’ interests in the sale proc eeds of the Property, and to prevent the sale 

proc eeds due to the Plaintiffs from falling into the hands of the 1st Defendant. [note: 124] 

161    The Plaintiffs also c ontend that the 2nd Defendant’s sc ope of work under the express retainer was not limited to the sale of the Property, but also inc luded the _distribution of the sale proceeds_. This is bec ause part of a solic itor’s engagement to ac t in the sale of a property must naturally be to 

handle the proc eeds of the sale as well. [note: 125] In fac t, the 2nd Defendant expressly represented that it would distribute the sale proc eeds. In an email dated 8 Marc h 2013 from Ms Chee to the 1st Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant, c opied to the 2nd Plaintiff, the 3rd Defendant and Foo Chin Chin, it was stated that “[the 2nd Defendant]’s appointment was only to ac t in the sale of [the Property] _and_ 

_to distribute the proceeds as directed by the 2 legal firms, (i) [WTL] and (ii) [TSS]..._ ” [note: 126] [emphasis added]. 

162    Even if there was no express retainer, the Plaintiffs say that there was an implied retainer 

bec ause of the 2nd Defendant’s c onduc t and c orrespondenc e: [note: 127] 


 (a) Referring to the 19 Marc h 2013 WTL email (see [153(a)] above), [note: 128] the Plaintiffs argue that Ms Chee must have known that WTL was c ollating payments to be made from the sale proc eeds. She must also have known that the Plaintiffs wanted the 2nd Defendant to take these payments into c onsideration before distributing the monies in the Late Father’s estate. [note: 129] 

 (b) Further, on 5 April 2013, Ms Chee wrote to Ms Hwa c opying Ms Molly Lim, stating that “for the deduc tion of various items c laimed against the estates, [the Late Father and the Late Mother], I shall forward them to you once I have organized them ” [emphasis added]. [note: 130] The Plaintiffs said that they were therefore under the impression that the 2nd Defendant required their approval or c onfirmation before any distribution of the sale proc eeds. [note: 131] 

163    This was also evidenc ed by Ms Chee’s emails to the 1st Defendant: 

 (a) In Ms Chee’s emails to the 1st Defendant on 6 April 2013 and 10 May 2013, she reiterated that she needed WTL approval for the ac c ounts of the estate before distribution. In her 6 April 2013 email, she attac hed various expenses inc urred by the 1st Defendant and Foo Chin Chin, whic h she said she would tender to WTL “for their approval”. [note: 132] In her 10 May 2013 email, she stated that she needed to “get [WTL] to c onfirm before [she] c an arrange for the PayOut.” She reminded the 1st Defendant that “[the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant] are all represented by [WTL]. [Foo] Chin Chin is unrepresented and I have to seek her approval too.” [note: 133] 

 (b) On 20 May 2013, Ms Chee wrote to the 1st Defendant forwarding a Letter of Authority to be signed by “every one named in there” ( ie , the Plaintiffs, the 1st Defendant, the 3rd Defendant and Foo Chin Chin). She added that “the amounts therein must be ac c eptable to all otherwise we will not be able to draw out the funds ” [emphasis added], and c onc luded “please let us know whether your siblings are all ready to sign the Letter of Authority so that ac tion c an be taken to initiate the payment out”. [note: 134] 

164    The nec essity to send the Statement of Ac c ounts to the Plaintiffs was made all the more important given that the 2nd Defendant was aware of the ac rimonious relationship and distrust 

between the Plaintiffs and the 1st Defendant. [note: 135] 

165    Even in the absenc e of an express or implied retainer, the Plaintiffs argue that the 2nd Defendant nonetheless owed fiduc iary duties to them by holding itself out to be ac ting on behalf of 

them and in their interests. [note: 136] Alternatively, the 2nd Defendant is liable for dishonest assistanc e, in helping the 1st Defendant to c ommit a breac h of trust in improperly distributing the 

sales proc eeds. [note: 137] 

166    Finally, the Plaintiffs c ontend that the 2nd Defendant owed them a duty of c are under tort law as benefic iaries of the Late Father’s estate, based on the c ase of _AEL and others v Cheo Yeoh &_ 

_Associates LLC and another_ <span class="citation">[2014] 3 SLR 1231</span> (“ _AEL_ ”). [note: 138] 

**_The 2nd Defendant’s submissions_** 

167    The 2nd Defendant’s position is that its only c lient was the 1st Defendant, and it was only obliged to ac t on his instruc tions. Further, it was appointed only for the sale of the Property and _not_ for the distribution of the sale proc eeds. It states that this is evident from the c orrespondenc e 


surrounding the appointment of the 2nd Defendant, [note: 139] as well as from the CA Orders. The CA Orders did not state that a law firm was to be jointly appointed to _distribute_ the sales proc eeds, but t ha t _the 1st Defendant_ was responsible for distributing the sale proc eeds to the benefic iaries ac c ording to their respec tive entitlements. Finally, in the final bill that the 2nd Defendant rendered to the 1st Defendant, the former had stated its professional c harges in ac ting for the latter “in the _sale_ 

of the Property” [emphasis added]. [note: 140] 

168    Ac c ording to the 2nd Defendant, the Plaintiffs’ c laim for breac h of fiduc iary duties must fail. Fundamentally, the Plaintiffs had failed to spec ific ally plead prec isely how it had breac hed its fiduc iary duties listed at para 27 of SOC-2. For example, they did not spec ify how it had failed to ac t in good 

faith, or ac ted in a c onflic t of interest, or for a third party interest. [note: 141] Moreover, the relationship between the Plaintiffs and the 2nd Defendant is not within one of the ac c epted c ategories of fiduc iary relationships. This is also not a c ase where a fiduc iary relationship c an be implied from the fac ts and c irc umstanc es of the c ase. In partic ular: 

 (a) The 2nd Defendant never undertook to ac t for the Plaintiffs in the distribution of the Late Father’s estate. In fac t, the Plaintiffs and WTL in c orrespondenc e regarded the 2nd Defendant as solely ac ting for the 1st Defendant. [note: 142] 

 (b) The interests of the Plaintiffs and 1st Defendant c onflic t, as they were warring parties from the c ommenc ement of OS 909. The Court should thus be slow to infer that a fiduc iary relationship had been assumed by the 2nd Defendant to the Plaintiffs, when the 1st Defendant was also a c lient of the 2nd Defendant. [note: 143] 

 (c ) The Plaintiffs were not in a position that was vulnerable to abuse by the 2nd Defendant, as they were represented by their own solic itors. The onus and power to distribute the proc eeds to the benefic iaries fell solely on the 1st Defendant, and the 2nd Defendant only rendered simple assistanc e (suc h as mathematic al c alc ulation), and had itself no power to distribute. [note: 144] 

 (d) There was no relationship of trust or c onfidenc e between the 2nd Defendant and the Plaintiffs. In fac t, the c orrespondenc e between the Plaintiffs and Ms Chee was ac rimonious, with the Plaintiffs showing deep disdain for her and an unwillingness to work with her. Indeed, at one point, the Plaintiffs even sought to disc harge her. [note: 145] 

169    The 2nd Defendant further c laims that even if fiduc iary duties were owed by the 2nd Defendant to the Plaintiffs, the fiduc iary relationship would have been terminated when the 1st Plaintiff emailed WTL on 11 Marc h 2013 stating that he did not have a working relationship with the 2nd Defendant and/or when the Plaintiffs proposed to disc harge the 2nd Defendant in plac e of Mr Eric Ng of M/s Malkin & Maxwell LLP on 10 April 2013. Thus, by the time the 2nd Defendant released the 1st Defendant’s share of the Late Father’s estate to him on 29 May 2013, there would not have been any 

subsisting fiduc iary relationship between the Plaintiffs and the 2nd Defendant. [note: 146] 

170    In addition, the 2nd Defendant also did not owe the Plaintiffs a duty of c are at c ommon law ( _ie_ , in tort). It c annot be inferred, from the 2nd Defendant’s appointment to assist the 1st Defendant, pursuant to CA Orders, that the 2nd Defendant had voluntarily assumed responsibility to the Plaintiffs. 

171    In any event, the 2nd Defendant alleges that the Plaintiffs did not suffer any loss. The sum of $782,547.87 for the 1/7th share was c orrec tly c alc ulated. Even if it was not, the Plaintiffs would not 

have suffered any loss bec ause the estate ac c ounts are still not finalised, and c an be adjusted. [note: 


147] 

**_Issues_** 

172    Having c onsidered the submissions, the following issues arise for determination: 

 (a) What was the sc ope of the 2nd Defendant’s work? This involves an examination of the language of the CA Orders as well as the c orrespondenc e between the parties’ solic itors in relation to the appointment of the 2nd Defendant. 

 (b) What duties did the 2nd Defendant owe to the Plaintiffs? This involves the examination of whether the 2nd Defendant owed duties to the Plaintiffs under an express or implied retainer, in tort, or in equity. 

173    I will examine eac h of these issues in turn. 

**_What was the scope of the 2nd Defendant’s work?_** 

174    For c onvenienc e, the relevant CA Orders are set out again below: 

2\. _the [1st Defendant]_ shall take steps to _sell [the Property]_ **_and distribute the sale proceeds_** _to the beneficiaries_ ac c ording to their respec tive entitlements under [the Late Father’s Will]; 

3\. the sale of the Property shall be effec ted no later than six months from the date of the judgment hereof, ie, 7th August 2012; 

4\. the solic itors for the [the Plaintiffs and 3rd Defendant] [ _ie_ , WTL], and [the 1st Defendant] [ _ie_ , TSS] shall jointly appoint a valuer/agent and a solic itor _to_ **_effect the sale_** ... 

 [emphasis added in italic s and bold italic s] 

175    On a plain reading of the CA Orders, the duty is on the 1st Defendant to “take steps to sell” the Property and to _distribute the sale proceeds_. This is eminently reasonable bec ause the 1st Defendant was neither removed as an exec utor of the Late Father’s estate, nor were any of his powers as exec utor removed (exc ept that the Court of Appeal set a six-month time limit on the sale of the Property). The CA Order for the jointly appointed solic itor to “effec t” the sale is, in my view, simply be a direc tion for this solic itor to provide legal servic es to fac ilitate the c onveyanc ing of the Property. It does not impose an independent duty on the 2nd Defendant to sell the Property _per se_ , muc h less distribute the sale proc eeds. 

176    I do not agree with the Plaintiffs’ submission that the 2nd Defendant must have been appointed for the distribution of sale proc eeds as well, bec ause the purpose of the CA Order for joint appointment was for that solic itor to polic e the sale proc eeds to prevent them from falling into the hands of the 1st Defendant. I similarly disagree with Ms Hwa’s statement at trial that “obviously [the] Court of Appeal didn’t trust [the 1st Defendant], [therefore nec essitating] a joint appointment” and her c harac terisation of the joint appointment as “a c hec k of balanc e... [to] help [Ms Hwa] c hec k on [the 1st Defendant]”. Indeed, given that the Court of Appeal has never made any finding on the unsuitability of the 1st Defendant to ac t as the exec utor of the Late Father’s estate, there is no reason this would have been the purpose of the CA Order. Instead, as WTL itself stated in a letter dated 12 November 2012 to the Plaintiffs, the purpose of the CA Order whic h asked the _solicitors_ for both sides, WTL and TSS, to appoint the solic itors “for the sale” of the Property is to “ensure that 


there is _no delay to the sale_ whic h may result if appointment is _by the parties_ , who are unable to 

agree” [emphasis added]. [note: 148] Ms Hwa ultimately admitted that this was the purpose of the CA 

Order during c ross-examination. [note: 149] 

177    The fac t that the 2nd Defendant was only engaged for the sale of the Property is also c lear from the c orrespondenc e surrounding the engagement of the 2nd Defendant. In WTL’s first letter of 

engagement to the 2nd Defendant on 2 Oc tober 2012, it stated: [note: 150] 

6\. The parties’ solic itors have agreed to appoint you _to act for the trustee_ in _the sale of the Property_ ... 

7\. Upon the sale of the Property, the sale proc eeds after the payment of the [plaintiffs in OS 909]’s c osts of the Appeal and in the c ourt below [ie, OS 909] _will be distributed_ to “the benefic iaries ac c ording to their respec tive entitlements under the will of [the Late Father]...” 

9\. Please c onfirm your willingness to ac t _in the sale_. 

 [emphasis added] 

178    The letter only stated that the 2nd Defendant was to ac t in the “sale” of the Property. It further stated that the sale proc eeds “will be distributed” to the benefic iaries, but did not impose a duty on _the 2nd Defendant_ to distribute the sale proc eeds. 

179    On 4 Oc tober 2012, Ms Chee replied to WTL in the following terms: [note: 151] 

 Thank you for your letter of 2nd Oc tober 2012. 

 We would be pleased to ac c ept the appointment to act for the trustee, Foo Jhee Tuang , in the sale of the above property. 

 The sc ope of work

1\. liaising with the DTZ in the preparing the sale c ontrac t 

2\. getting your approval before finalizing the terms 

3\. c ompleting the sale transac tion 

4\. _distributing the sale proceeds pursuant to the order_ 

 Our fee would be $5,000.00 plus GST plus disbursements. Please let us know whether this is ac c eptable. 

 [emphasis added] 

180    In this letter, Ms Chee, on behalf of the 2nd Defendant, ac c epted the appointment to ac t in the “sale” of the Property. While the sc ope of work detailed referred to “distributing the sale proc eeds” from the sale of the Property, this was only “pursuant to the [CA] [O]rder”. The CA Order plac ed the obligation on the _1st Defendant_ to distribute the sale proc eeds. Thus, the 2nd Defendant must have meant that its task was only to distribute the sale proc eeds _as directed by the 1st_ 


_Defendant_. Indeed, I find that this is the natural and reasonable interpretation of words used in the c orrespondenc e set out above. The 2nd Defendant did not rec ognise that it had any independent duty to distribute the sale proc eeds. This was c onsistent with Ms Chee’s evidenc e on the stand, in whic h she explained that the sale proc eeds belonged to the registered owner of the Property, _ie_ the 1st Defendant. However, as the sale proc eeds were deposited into the 2nd Defendant’s c onveyanc ing ac c ount, it had to be distributed, but only on the instruc tions of the owner of the proc eeds, _ie_ , the 

1st Defendant. [note: 152] 

181    On the same day, WTL replied to the 2nd Defendant, stating: [note: 153] 

 We refer to your fax dated 4 Oc tober 2012 and are instruc ted that our c lients on their part are agreeable to engage you as the solic itors to handle the sale of the Property based on your fees quote. 

 [emphasis added] 

182    On 9 Oc tober 2012, TSS also replied to the 2nd Defendant: [note: 154] 

 We refer to your letter dated 4 Oc tober 2012. 

 We are pleased to inform you that your fees quoted for handling the sale of the [Property] is ac c eptable to our c lient. 

 [emphasis added] 

183    From the above c orrespondenc e, it is c lear to me that, over and above the express wording of the CA Orders, the joint intention of WTL, TSS and the 2nd Defendant was also for the 2nd Defendant to ac t in the sale of the Property only. 

**_What duties did the 2nd Defendant owe to the Plaintiffs?_** 

_Duty under an express or implied retainer_ 

184    In my view, it is c lear that there was no express retainer subsisting between the Plaintiffs and the 2nd Defendant in the present c irc umstanc es. The c orrespondenc e surrounding the engagement of the 2nd Defendant in the previous sec tion shows that its appointment was to “ac t for the trustee” _ie_ , the 1st Defendant only. I find that this would be the understanding of any reasonable person plac ed in the Plaintiffs’ position. Indeed, I go further and state that this must also have been the Plaintiffs’ understanding. The 1st Plaintiff had himself, in an email dated 10 April 2013 to the 1st Defendant, stated that he was “not c omfortable with [Ms Chee] _because she is acting for [the 1st Defendant] as_ 

_Executor_ ” [emphasis added]. [note: 155] Indeed, the 2nd Defendant’s invoic e for legal fees was also 

issued to the 1st Defendant as the exec utor of the Late Father’s estate. [note: 156] 

185    I do not ac c ept the Plaintiffs’ argument that bec ause the CA Order required WTL and TSS to jointly appoint a solic itor, the 2nd Defendant was therefore under a duty to take instruc tions from _both_ the Plaintiffs and the 1st Defendant. This alleged duty simply did not follow from the joint appointment. First, the Plaintiffs were represented by their own solic itors, WTL, at the material time. Sec ond, suc h an argument would not be in ac c ordanc e with the purpose of the CA Order for joint appointment (see [176] above). The purpose of the CA Order is to ensure an expedient _appointment_ of a solic itor to fac ilitate the c onveyanc e of the Property, and to prevent the possibility of gridloc k 


and delay if that solic itor was to be c hosen by the warring parties. It did not follow that the solic itor, _after_ appointment, would still have to ac tively take instruc tions from both parties. 

186    The next issue is whether there was nonetheless an implied retainer between the Plaintiffs and the 2nd Defendant. The c irc umstanc es under whic h a retainer may be implied is set out in _Law Society of Singapore v Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani_ <span class="citation">[2006] 4 SLR(R) 308</span> (“ _Ahmad Khalis_ ”) at [66]: 

 A retainer may be implied where, on an objec tive c onsideration of all the c irc umstanc es, an intention to enter into such a contractual relationship ought fairly and properly to be imputed to all the parties. The implic ation would have to be so clear that the solicitor ought to have appreciated it. Circ umstanc es to be taken into ac c ount might inc lude, where appropriate, who is paying the [solicitor’s] fees, who is providing instructions and whether a contractual relationship has existed between the parties in the past. 

 [emphasis added] 

187    The c ourt in _Anwar Patrick Adrian v Ng Chong & Hue LLC_ <span class="citation">[2014] 3 SLR 761</span> (“ _Anwar_ ”) stated that the c rux of the matter is whether a c ontrac tual relationship “ought fairly and properly” be imputed to all parties (at [53]). The giving of advic e to a third party is a strong inferenc e that the solic itor and the third party had regarded themselves as being in some kind of c ontrac tual relationship. However, the absenc e of any advic e given, while in many c ases helpful in enabling the c ourt to infer that no implied retainer had arisen, is not dec isive on whether there is an implied retainer if other objec tive evidenc e point towards the existenc e of an implied retainer (at [51]-[52]). 

188    In this c ase, there are no fac tors that point towards the need for a retainer to be implied. Applying the fac tors outlined in _Ahmad Khalis_ , it is c lear that a retainer should not be implied in these c irc umstanc es. The 2nd Defendant’s bill was addressed to the 1st Defendant, as exec utor of the Late Father’s estate. It was the 1st Defendant who gave the 2nd Defendant instruc tions. There was no previous c ontrac tual relationship between the Plaintiffs and the 2nd Defendant. No advic e was given by the 2nd Defendant to the Plaintiffs; in fac t, the Plaintiffs were separately advised by lawyers from WTL, whic h inc luded a senior c ounsel. Any emails from the 2nd Defendant to WTL was merely to keep 

them updated of matters pertaining to the sale of the Property. [note: 157] Further, the Plaintiffs had themselves repeatedly told Ms Chee not to reply to their emails, stating that they were not 

c omfortable with her and did not want to c ommunic ate with her. [note: 158] It would not be fair and proper to imply a retainer in suc h c irc umstanc es. Indeed, the implic ation of a retainer was not “so c lear that the solic itor [the 2nd Defendant] ought to have apprec iated it”. On the c ontrary, the 2nd Defendant must sensibly have c ome to the opposite c onc lusion that there was no subsisting solic itorc lient relationship between itself and the Plaintiffs. Indeed, it is c lear from the emails (where the Plaintiffs state that they were not c omfortable with Ms Chee) that they did not want any c ommunic ations from her. 

189    As for Ms Chee’s emails to the 1st Defendant whic h stated that she would send various expenses inc urred by the 1st Defendant and Foo Chin Chin to WTL “for their approval”, and her statement that the letter of authorisation required the signatures of all the benefic iaries, Ms Chee had explained in her AEIC and on the stand that this was bec ause she had mistakenly thought she needed the c onsent of all benefic iaries but realised she only needed the c onsent of the exec utor of the Late 

Father’s estate, _ie_ , the 1st Defendant. [note: 159] Further, under c ross-examination by the 1st Plaintiff, Ms Chee made c lear that the referenc e to the Plaintiffs’ approval was not bec ause she owed any obligations under a retainer to the Plaintiffs, but bec ause she knew that there was a history of unhappiness and distrust between the parties and hoped that all would agree to prevent future 


disputes. I ac c ept these explanations. 

_Duty of care in tort_ 

190    Having dismissed the Plaintiffs’ c laim that the 2nd Defendant owed them a duty of c are under an express or implied retainer, I move on to the c laim that the 2nd Defendant owed them a duty of c are in tort. The immediate diffic ulty for the Plaintiffs is that this c ause of ac tion was not even pleaded. While the Plaintiffs c hose to disc harge c ounsel just before the trial, they did have legal representation at the time the pleadings were drafted (and indeed amended). No evidenc e was led on this c laim at the trial. The c laim only surfac ed in the c losing submissions. Given that no replies were allowed to be filed, the 2nd Defendant never had a c hanc e to address the c laim. For these reasons, the c laim in tort for breac h of a duty of c are fails. I add in passing that, on the fac ts before me, even if the c laim had been properly pleaded, the c laim in tort is highly questionable, to say the least. 

_Fiduciary duties_ 

191    Sinc e there is no subsisting solic itor-c lient relationship between the Plaintiffs and the 2nd Defendant, the question whether the 2nd Defendant owes fiduc iary duties to the Plaintiffs is one whic h demands c areful examination. 

192    The only question is whether the present c ase is one in whic h the c irc umstanc es justify an imposition of fiduc iary duties. A fiduc iary is someone who has undertaken to ac t for or on behalf of another in a partic ular matter in c irc umstanc es whic h give rise to _a relationship of trust and confidence_ : _Bristol & West Building Society v Mothew_ [1998] Ch 1 at 18, rec ently c ited in _FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC_ [2014] UKSC 45 at [5]. In this c ase, it c annot be said that there was a relationship of trust and c onfidenc e between the 2nd Defendant and the Plaintiffs, for largely the same reasons as I have detailed at [188]. 

193    Furthermore, there is no voluntary assumption of responsibility by the 2nd Defendant. No advic e was rendered by Ms Chee to the Plaintiffs. Indeed, it bears repeating that the Plaintiffs made it c lear to Ms Chee in the email c orrespondenc e that her input and reply was not required. They made no attempts to hide their disdain and distrust of her. The 1st Plaintiff, for example, wrote to Ms Hwa stating that he “do[es] not c ommunic ate with [Ms Chee] nor give her any instruc tion[s]...Anyway I do 

not have [a] working relationship with her and I will not regard her”. [note: 160] It would fly in the fac e of logic for the Plaintiffs to now suggest that Ms Chee had assumed responsibility towards them or had entered into a relationship of trust and c onfidenc e in respec t of the distribution, when they themselves had _prevented_ her from taking any responsibility. Further, based on the c orrespondenc e surrounding the appointment of the 2nd Defendant (see [177] to [183] above), the only person that the 2nd Defendant agreed to ac c ept responsibility for was the 1st Defendant. 

194    The Plaintiffs were independently advised by WTL, whom they treated as their solic itors. WTL 

also always referred to the Plaintiffs as “[their] c lients”. [note: 161] The 2nd Defendant was simply ac ting on the instruc tions of the 1st Defendant, who was the exec utor of the Late Father’s estate. It was the 1st Defendant who had the power to order the distribution of the sale proc eeds. The Plaintiffs were not vulnerable and dependent on the 2nd Defendant suc h as to give rise to a relationship of trust and c onfidenc e. 

_Dishonest assistance_ 

195    The Plaintiffs’ c laim in dishonest assistanc e was not pleaded and appears to be an afterthought. In any event, a c laim in dishonest assistanc e is a type of ac c essorial liability: the 


defendant must have lent assistanc e to the c ommission of some breac h of duty by a person in a fiduc iary relationship with the plaintiff. As I have already found that the 1st Defendant did not breac h his fiduc iary duties (exc ept in relation to the provision of ac c ounts), the 2nd Defendant naturally c annot be held liable for dishonest assistanc e. In any event, there is also no dishonesty on the 2nd Defendant’s part. 

**_Conclusion on the Plaintiffs’ claims against the 2nd Defendant_** 

196    The Plaintiffs’ c laims against the 2nd Defendant are dismissed in their entirety. The 2nd Defendant does not owe the Plaintiffs a duty of c are in c ontrac t or equity. The c laims in tort and dishonest assistanc e were not pleaded nor c anvassed during trial, and these belated c laims are also rejec ted. 

**_The 2nd Defendant’s claim for contribution or indemnity against the 1st Defendant_** 

197    Given my findings that the 2nd Defendant did not owe any duties towards the Plaintiffs, there is no need to deal with the 2nd Defendant’s c laim for c ontribution or indemnity against the 1st Defendant. 

**The Late Mother’s estate** 

198    Having dealt with the Plaintiffs’ c laim in relation to the Late Father’s estate, I now move on to deal with their c laims in relation to the Late Mother’s estate. 

**_Do the Plaintiffs have standing to bring claims in relation to the Late Mother’s estate?_** 

199    The c omplaint essentially relates to an allegation that the Late Mother’s 1/7th share in the Late Father’s estate should have been retained or paid over to the 1st Plaintiff and 1st Defendant as the c o-exec utors and trustees of her estate. The 1st Defendant should not have been given his share (as a benefic iary) of the Late Mother’s estate. Further, the share that he rec eived was inc orrec t as c ertain expenses against the Late Mother’s estate had not been properly ac c ounted for. The problem, however, for the Plaintiffs is that these issues or c laims in respec t of the Late Mother’s estate are not or are no longer before this c ourt. I explain by first revisiting the preliminary issue of whether the Plaintiffs even have the _locus standi_ to bring c laims in relation to the Late Mother’s estate in the first plac e. 

200    In my Amendment Judgment (whic h I referred to briefly at the start of this judgment), I had stated that the Plaintiffs’ unequivoc al position in the c ourse of the present suit was that the parties were all suing and being sued in their _personal capacities_ only (at [35] of the Amendment Judgment). I had held (at [71]) that the Plaintiffs, suing in their personal c apac ities, had no standing to bring c ertain c laims relating to the Late Mother’s estate _against the 2nd Defendant_. I therefore did not allow the inc lusion of c ertain paragraphs in the Statement of Claim outlining the said c laims against the 2nd Defendant. I pause to note that the Plaintiffs had legal representation at this junc ture. 

201    I had also observed (at [73] of the Amendment Judgment) that my dec ision on standing as outlined in the previous paragraph had an impac t on the Plaintiffs’ standing to bring c laims in relation to the Late Mother’s estate _against the 1st Defendant_ as well. However, I noted that bec ause the 1st Defendant had never objec ted to the paragraphs pertaining to these c laims, the issue was not before me and it was for the parties to take the nec essary c ourses of ac tion they deemed fit following my dec ision. 


202    Following my Amendment Judgment, the 1st Plaintiff c ommenc ed S 284 in his _representative capacity_ as exec utor of the Late Mother’s estate (see [57] above), bringing c laims against _the 2nd Defendant_ in relation to the Late Mother’s estate. 

203    The 1st Defendant, in his opening statement, submitted that S 284 was the proper forum for matters c onc erning the Late Mother’s estate to be properly ventilated. This was allegedly bec ause 

the reliefs sought in S 284 were c learly the same as in the present suit. [note: 162] On the first day of the trial, c ounsel for the 1st Defendant c ross-examined the 1st Plaintiff on the c ommenc ement of S 284, and the 1st Plaintiff admitted on more than one oc c asion that he “should not c laim twic e” 

against the 1st Defendant and that “having [a] double-c laim is wrong”. [note: 163] In the Plaintiffs’ c losing submissions, they appear to have given up the c laims in the present suit in relation to the Late Mother’s estate, stating at para 160 that “[a]s the Late Mother’s estate was ordered to be dealt with at the trial of [S 284], we will leave this to the trial judge at the trial of [S 284] to make the appropriate orders against the 1st and 2nd Defendants”. 

204    I first observe that S 284 was brought primarily against _the 2nd Defendant_ , with reliefs sought against the 2nd Defendant. As c urrently pleaded, no substantive c laims were brought against the 1st Defendant. Whether this remains the c ase is to be seen, sinc e there is tec hnic ally nothing to prevent the Statement of Claim from being amended to set out substantive c laims against the 1st Defendant as well. I make c lear that I am not making any c omment on the c onduc t of S 284 whic h is not before me. While it may be said that the 1st Plaintiff, as a litigant-in-person, might not have fully 

c omprehended the tec hnic al arguments on legal c apac ities, [note: 164] I am of the view that he c learly ac c epted that all issues against the 1st and 2nd Defendants in relation to the Late Mother’s estate are to be dealt with in S 284. 

205    In any event, although the 1st Defendant did not expressly address the point of c apac ity in his submissions, I am of the view that the Plaintiffs simply do not have the standing to bring an ac tion against the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Mother’s estate in the present suit. In this respec t, I refer to my analysis and reasoning at [58]–[67] of the Amendment Judgment, in whic h I analysed the c ase of _Wong Moy v Soo Ah Choy_ <span class="citation">[1996] 3 SLR(R) 27</span> (“ _Wong Moy_ ”). Based on the authority of _Wong Moy_ , the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs did not have the standing to bring the c laims against the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Mother’s estate, given that they were suing in their _personal capacities_ , as benefic iary and c reditor of the Late Mother’s estate respec tively. This is bec ause the Plaintiffs have not been able to prove that it is “impossible or at least seriously inc onvenient for the representatives to take proc eedings” ( _Wong Moy_ at [28]). Indeed, the 1st Plaintiff, as c o-exec utor of the Late Mother’s estate, c ould have brought the c laims in a representative c apac ity _against the 1st Defendant_. He has done prec isely that when he c ommenc ed S 284 in relation to c laims _against the 2nd Defendant_. The Plaintiffs only have themselves to blame for this omission and the c urrent state of affairs. I had in my Amendment Judgment (at [73]) already made c lear that my dec ision on standing in relation to the Plaintiffs’ c laims against the 2nd Defendant would affec t their standing against _the 1st Defendant_ as well. I had given them a c hanc e to take up any proc eedings they deemed nec essary (see [211] above). It would have been prudent for the 1st Plaintiff to do so, but he has not up to this point. 

**_Some observations on the Plaintiffs’ claims against the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Mother’s estate_** 

206    Notwithstanding the fac t that the Plaintiffs agreed and ac c epted that the c laims in respec t of the Late Mother’s estate were to be dealt with in S 284, they gave c onsiderable evidenc e in respec t of their c omplaints in relation to the Late Mother’s estate. That said, the 1st and 3rd Defendant also 


touc hed on matters relating to the Late Mother’s Estate. The evidenc e mainly c onc erned: (i) the 1st Plaintiff’s c laim for the Gleneagles Bills, the Deed of Settlement and the c onsent judgment in DC 2814; (ii) the 2nd Plaintiff’s c laim for the Late Mother’s medic al expenses; (iii) the 1st and 3rd Defendant’s c laim for the Late Mother’s medic al expenses; (iv) the 1st Defendant’s c laim for the Late Mother’s funeral expenses; (v) the failure to take ac c ount of “ _pek kim_ ” c ollec ted during the Late Mother’s wake. 

207    Given that the parties have agreed that c laims in respec t of the Late Mother’s estate will be dec ided in S 284, I make no further c omment on the evidenc e. 

**Costs** 

208    Having dealt with all the c laims by the Plaintiffs, I now turn to the final issue of the c osts of this trial. 

**_The parties’ submissions_** 

209    The 1st Defendant asks for c osts on an indemnity basis against the Plaintiffs. This was for a few reasons. First, despite the Amendment Judgment, in whic h I disallowed c laims c onc erning the Late Mother’s and Late Brother’s estates, the Plaintiffs did not disc ontinue the c laims relating to Late Mother’s estate until the first day of trial when the 1st Plaintiff c onc eded that it would be improper to 

make double c laims. [note: 165] After the c ommenc ement of the present suit, the Plaintiffs separately c ommenc ed S 284, whic h related to the Late Mother’s estate. This made the various heads of c laim under the present suit unnec essary and duplic ative. Further, the Plaintiffs insisted on taking unreasonable positions, for example by insisting that there was an agreement of $350,000 on legal c osts. This is a larger sum than what the Plaintiffs had ac tually inc urred, and more than the quantum determined in taxation proc eedings. 

210    The 2nd Defendant also c laims for c osts on an indemnity basis from the Plaintiffs. Ac c ording to the 2nd Defendant, the c ontemporaneous doc uments and the evidenc e evinc es a lac k of basis to the Plaintiffs’ c ase against the 2nd Defendant. The Plaintiffs also never had any intention to settle, and sought to disingenuously paint themselves as involuntary plaintiffs, alleging that the 2nd Defendant was inviting them to sue, when there was no suc h evidenc e. Further, the Plaintiffs disc harged their former solic itors BATP at the very last moment, at the doorstep of trial. This prejudic ed the Defendants, c ausing numerous delays and resulting in the 2nd Defendant inc urring extra c osts in preparing doc uments suc h as the agreed bundles, whic h would ordinarily have been the responsibility of the Plaintiffs. Finally, the 2nd Defendant points to the Plaintiffs’ behaviour at the trial, stating that they formulated c onvoluted questions, whic h resulted in protrac ted c ross-examination. 

211    In their further submissions on indemnity c osts filed on 30 September 2016, the Plaintiffs argue that indemnity c osts should not be awarded, as their c onduc t was not unreasonable. As against the 1st Defendant, the Plaintiffs’ position is that there is merit to their c laims, as the 1st Defendant has 

c learly shown a flagrant disregard for the CA Orders and for his duties to the benefic iaries. [note: 166] Further, the Plaintiffs had tried to make proposals to the 1st Defendant for mediation and settlement, but these were all rejec ted. Further, as S 284 was brought only in relation the Late Mother’s estate, there is no duplic ation. Instead, it was the 1st Defendant who ought to pay the Plaintiffs’ c osts on an indemnity basis if he fails in the present suit, and should not be entitled to any c osts if he suc c eeds. [note: 167] 

212    As against the 2nd Defendant, the Plaintiffs c laim that they had written to the 2nd Defendant 


on 19 June 2013 to try and settle the c laim, but this was rejec ted. At the beginning of the ac tion, the 2nd Defendant’s c ounsel had made an offer to settle but this was subjec t to the Plaintiffs’ agreement to pay the 2nd Defendant indemnity c osts, whic h the Plaintiffs had found unac c eptable. Further, the Plaintiffs assert that they are genuinely aggrieved by the 2nd Defendant’s ac tions and have no ulterior motive or personal grievanc e. They only wish to seek redress from the c ourts for the loss that the Plaintiffs have suffered as a result of the 2nd Defendant’s ac ts and omissions. Further, the reason they were unable to c ontinue with legal representation for the trial was bec ause they 

have limited funds. They deny that they have been abusing the proc ess of the c ourt. [note: 168] 

**_The law on indemnity costs_** 

213    When c osts are awarded on an indemnity basis, all c osts are allowed exc ept in so far as they are of an unreasonable amount or have been unreasonably inc urred, and any doubts in these respec ts will be resolved in favour of the rec eiving party: O 59 r 27(3) of the Rules of Court. By c ontrast, where an order is made for c osts on a standard basis, the rec eiving party is allowed a reasonable amount in respec t of all c osts reasonably inc urred, and any doubts are resolved in favour of the paying party: O 59 r 27(2). Costs on an indemnity basis are awarded as an exc eption rather than the norm: see _CCM Industrial Pte Ltd v Uniquetech Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 20</span> at [32]. 

214    The determination of whether indemnity c osts are appropriate begins with a c onsideration of the fac tors under O 59 r 5 of the Rules of Court, whic h states 

 Special matters to be taken into account in exercising discretion (O. 59, r. 5) 

5\. The Court in exerc ising its disc retion as to c osts shall, to suc h extent, if any, as may be appropriate in the c irc umstanc es, take into ac c ount – 

 (a) any payment of money into Court and the amount of suc h payment; 

 (b) the c onduc t of all the parties, inc luding c onduc t before and during the proc eedings; 

 (c ) the parties’ c onduc t in relation to any attempt at resolving the c ause or matter by mediation or any other means of dispute resolution; and 

 (d) in partic ular, the extent to whic h the parties have followed any relevant pre-ac tion protoc ol or prac tic e direc tion for the time being issued by the Registrar. 

215    Two of the fac tors are partic ularly relevant to this c ase. The first is the c onduc t of the parties, inc luding c onduc t _before_ and _during_ the proc eedings (O 59 r 5(b)). The sec ond is the parties’ c onduc t in relation to any attempt at resolving the c ause of matter by mediation or any other means of dispute resolution (O 59 r 5(c )). I shall return to these fac tors later in my judgment. 

216    The rec ent dec ision of _Airtrust Hong Kong Ltd v PH Hydraulics & Engineering Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2016] SGHC 167</span> (“ _Airtrust_ ”), c ited by all the parties, c omprehensively examined the c ase law on indemnity c osts. In that c ase, Chan J opined that it may be useful for a c ourt to ask itself the question of whether the party’s c onduc t was “so unreasonable as to justify an award of indemnity c osts”. Suc h c onduc t must “reflec t a high degree of unreasonableness, and c annot merely be wrong or misguided in hindsight”. However, the unreasonable c onduc t “need not rise to the level of dishonesty or moral iniquity”: _Airtrust_ at [50]. 

217    To assess the unreasonableness of the party’s c onduc t, the c ourt may c onsider whether the 


party’s c onduc t c aused prejudic e to the other party as well as the c ontext and nature of the dispute. One example c ited in _Airtrust_ was the c ase of _Goh Eileen née Chia and another v Goh Mei Ling Yvonne and another_ <span class="citation">[2014] 3 SLR 1356</span> (“ _Goh Eileen_ ”). In _Goh Eileen_ , the plaintiff’s applic ation to remove the defendants as joint tenants to a flat was dismissed. The defendants sought, _inter alia_ , to rec over c osts on an indemnity basis. Quentin Loh J found that the c ase was not suffic iently exc eptional to warrant an order of indemnity c osts. Loh J c onsidered (at [50]) that at the heart of the c ase was a family dispute where siblings were fighting over their parents’ flat and “[l]ike most family disputes, emotions ran deep and tempers flared; various allegations, valid or otherwise, were made both in and out of c ourt”. 

218    Chan J further suggested (at [23] and [49] of _Airtrust_ ) that it may be appropriate for a c ourt to make an order of indemnity c osts where the ac tion or a party’s c onduc t falls into any of the following non-exhaustive c ategories: 

 (a) Where the ac tion is brought in bad faith, as a means of oppression or for other improper purposes; 

 (b) Where the ac tion is spec ulative, hypothetic al or c learly without basis; 

 (c ) Where a party’s c onduc t in the c ourse of proc eedings is dishonest, abusive or improper; and 

 (d) Where the ac tion amounts to wasteful or duplic ative litigation or is otherwise an abuse of proc ess. 

219    For the purposes of my dec ision, I adopt the propositions set out above, whic h I find to be a helpful summary of the law on indemnity c osts. 

**_Decision_** 

_On what basis should costs be assessed?_ 

220    After a c areful review of the c irc umstanc es surrounding the present suit, I award c osts on an indemnity basis to be paid by the Plaintiffs to the 2nd Defendant _only_. 

221    In respec t of the 1st Defendant, I am of the view that the c ontext and nature of the present suit is similar to _Goh Eileen_ (see [217] above). This is, after all, a family dispute between siblings, for whic h there was, and still is, deep-seated grievanc es and hurt. Emotions flared during the c ourse of the trial and various allegations were made, some of whic h were unc alled for. However, this fac t alone did not mean that indemnity c osts would invariably be allowed. 

222    In partic ular, I note that the 1st Defendant had raised the argument that despite the Amendment Judgment, in whic h I had apparently disallowed c laims c onc erning the Late Mother’s and Late Brother’s estates, the Plaintiffs did not disc ontinue the c laims relating to Late Mother’s estate until the first day of trial. That is not entirely ac c urate. As I had earlier explained, I had only held in the Amendment Judgment that the Plaintiffs were not allowed to add c ertain paragraphs to the Statement of Claim with respec t to c laims _against the 2nd Defendant_ in relation to the Late Mother’s estate. While I observed that this dec ision may have an impac t on whether the Plaintiffs were allowed to pursue the c laims in relation to the Late Mother’s estate _against the 1st Defendant_ , I did not express any firm views on this for the simple reason that the 1st Defendant never raised any objec tions to these and the issue was not properly before me. It is also not the c ase that the 


Plaintiffs had pursued _duplicitous_ c laims in the present suit, bec ause S 284 (as presently formulated) did not even enc ompass c laims against the 1st Defendant. 

223    For these reasons, I am of the view that there was nothing exc eptional in the matters alleged by the 1st Defendant to warrant a departure from the usual basis of c osts on the standard basis. While the 1st Defendant has been ordered to provide an ac c ount of the rental inc ome (whic h may well prove not to be substantial), I note that in all other aspec ts he has suc c eeded and is entitled to full c osts. 

224    The situation is different with respec t to the 2nd Defendant, where the Plaintiffs’ c onduc t is far more unreasonable. The c laims that were brought by the Plaintiffs were untenable in law, without fac tual basis, and sometimes direc tly c ontradic ted by c ontemporaneous doc uments. I also observe that it was the Plaintiffs’ own c onduc t that had distanc ed Ms Chee, and it was disingenuous for them to allege that the 2nd Defendant had breac hed various duties towards them. Further, the Plaintiffs had not even pleaded substantive c auses of ac tion in the tort of negligenc e and in dishonest assistanc e against the 2nd Defendant. This was wholly unac c eptable given that they were represented by c ounsel (BATP) at the pleadings stage. 

225    Further, the Plaintiffs’ c onduc t prior to the proc eedings is objec tionable. First, the Plaintiffs c hose to disc harge their solic itors at the eleventh hour, less than two weeks before the trial began. This c aused real prejudic e to the 2nd Defendant (a fac tor in [217] above), who was burdened with having to prepare doc uments, suc h as the four agreed bundles, whic h would ordinarily be the onus of the Plaintiffs. During the trial, the Plaintiffs were not able to give good reasons for the disc harge of their solic itor at suc h a late stage, save for a vague and unsubstantiated belief that they would not be able to fully artic ulate their side of the story if they c ontinued to be represented by solic itors. [note: 169] It was only in their further submissions that they made a belated referenc e to the fac t that 

they “do not have unlimited resourc es of funds”. [note: 170] 

226    Sec ond, it is evident to me that the Plaintiffs never had any intention to settle the suit. Up to their opening statements, the Plaintiffs stated that they were “willing to c ompromise”, and that their 

“attempts at mediation and offers to settle were rejec ted”, [note: 171] but their ac rimony and obvious hostility towards the 2nd Defendant both before and during the proc eedings militates against any genuine intention to settle. There was only one offer to settle dated 19 June 2013 to the 2nd Defendant. The other “proposal” pointed out by the Plaintiffs simply informed the 2nd Defendant that the Plaintiffs were about to c ommenc e legal ac tion against the 1st Defendant and asked if the 2nd 

Defendant was willing to be bound by the judgment in that ac tion. [note: 172] In fac t, it appears that the Plaintiffs’ position was that they were essentially involuntary plaintiffs bec ause the 2nd Defendant had “invit[ed] [them] to sue”. This allegation is unsupported by evidenc e and c ompletely at odds with sense or reason. 

227    I should add that the Plaintiffs c ould not rely on their status as litigants-in-person to avoid adverse c ost orders when their c onduc t has passed the threshold of unreasonableness. I have already granted the Plaintiffs signific ant latitude in the presentation of their c ase, even though they were sometimes evasive in their answers, disruptive during c ross-examination, and insisted on spending c opious time on irrelevant questions. In this respec t, I draw guidanc e from the observations of Edmund Leow JC in the rec ent c ase of _Ong Chai Hong (executrix of the estate of Chiang Chia Liang, deceased) v Chiang Shirley and others_ <span class="citation">[2016] 3 SLR 1006</span> at [40]–[41]: 

 It is every layperson’s right to represent himself or herself without the aid of c ounsel. Justic e requires that c ourts do not apply professional standards to litigants in person, who may be 


 involved in a c ourt proc eeding for the only time in their lives. However, litigants in person are still subject to the same rules and procedure of court. Whilst the courts are cognisant of the fact that litigants in person are not legally trained, and are thus more indulgent of their mistakes, this does not mean that they can act without regard to these rules and procedures... I find that the first defendant had behaved unreasonably, even when allowanc e is made for her inexperienc e and lac k of objec tivity; her ac tions c aused the other parties in the litigation to inc ur unnec essary c osts to respond to her allegations and in managing her disruptions. In my view, the first defendant had taken unfair advantage of the leeway given to her as a litigant in person and pursued her c laims in a manner that was prejudic ial to the other parties in the c ase. 

 I pause to c larify that I did not draw an adverse inferenc e against the first defendant for not engaging c ounsel for the trial when she c ould afford to do so: her right to appear in person is quite absolute. However, her status as a litigant in person alone does not and cannot mean that she can conduct her case in an unreasonable manner that causes the other parties to incur unnecessary costs, and remain immune from adverse cost orders ... 

 [emphasis added] 

_By whom should the costs be paid?_ 

228    Despite fairly extensive submissions on the _basis_ of the assessment of c osts, there were no submissions made by any of the parties on _who_ should bear the c osts inc urred –whether it should be borne by the parties personally, or by the Late Father’s estate. Nonetheless, it is my view that there is suffic ient evidenc e before this c ourt to make an assessment on this issue. 

229    In my view, the c osts of the Plaintiffs and the 1st Defendant inc urred for the present suit are to be paid by the Late Father’s estate, _ie_ , out of the sale proc eeds of the Property. This is bec ause these proc eedings are brought to determine the sc ope of the 1st Defendant’s duty as exec utor. Suc h legal proc eedings c an be brought by the benefic iaries in a proper c ase, with legal expenses of _both_ the person who instituted the proc eedings, as well as other parties in the suit, borne by the estate as legitimate testamentary expenses (see [77(b)] above). However, I note that a sum of only $863,377.25 remains in c ourt after the payments out of the Minimum Sums: see [54] above. At the point of the payments out, provision had been made for the legal expenses that the Plaintiffs allege have been inc urred in OS 909 and CA 70 ($350,000): see [50]-[52] and [63] above. However, the c ourt’s attention was not drawn in any of the summonses to the fac t that further provision may need to be made for meeting the c osts of _the present suit_. In the c irc umstanc es, it is unc lear whether the amount that remains in c ourt would be suffic ient to meet the c ost order c urrently made. If it is not, the outstanding amount that c annot be met by the remaining sum in c ourt is to be divided among the benefic iaries equally, and eac h benefic iary is to pay that amount bac k to c ourt in order to satisfy the c ost order. 

230    However, the Plaintiffs are to bear the c osts inc urred by the 2nd Defendant in this suit _personally_. It is c lear that there was no merit to their c ase against the 2nd Defendant and it would not be just or reasonable to make the Late Father’s estate bear the c osts of suc h untenable c laims, when the Plaintiffs were responsible for this state of affairs. Looking at the evidenc e as a whole, it is c lear that the Plaintiffs’ displeasure with the 2nd Defendant was largely due to their perc eption that Ms Chee was not listening to their instruc tions and that she was “favouring” the 1st Defendant. I find that they have no basis for this perc eption. Ms Chee was ac ting as best she c ould in diffic ult c irc umstanc es, taking ac c ount of the sc ope of her appointment and the CA Orders. Indeed, the Plaintiffs were the ones who had attempted to c ut off c ommunic ations with her: see [188] above. Ms Chee, through no fault of her own, bec ame embroiled in what was already a highly emotional and 


bitter dispute between the siblings over the Late Father’s estate that has now stretc hed to involve three estates. 

231    As for the 3rd Defendant, I am of the view that he should bear his own c osts. The 3rd Defendant was added to the present suit mainly to apprise the c ourt of his position in relation to some of the disputed c laims, and his evidenc e was fairly c ontained. 

**Conclusion** 

232    In summary, I find that: 

 (a) The 1st Defendant has breac hed his fiduc iary duties only in relation to his failure to provide an ac c ount of rent of the Property and to forward the Statements of Ac c ounts to the Plaintiffs before distribution of the sale proc eeds. However, the 1st Defendant did not breac h his fiduc iary duties in ac c epting the c laims that he did take into ac c ount. He also did not breac h his fiduc iary duties in not taking into ac c ount the Plaintiffs’ c laims, whic h would not in any c ase have been allowed. The failure to forward the Statements of Ac c ounts to the Plaintiffs therefore did not c ause any loss to the Plaintiffs. 

 (b) The Plaintiffs’ c laims against the 2nd Defendant are dismissed in their entirety. 

233    The 1st Defendant is to provide an ac c ount of rent rec eived from the Property within two months of the date of this judgment. If the ac c ount of rent reveals profits made from the rental, these profits must be returned to the estate and be equally divided among the benefic iaries. I remind the 1st Defendant that he needs to perform this duty _assiduously and honestly_. 

234    The 1st Defendant’s c osts are to be assessed on a standard basis. The Plaintiffs’ and 1st Defendant’s c osts are to be paid out of the Late Father’s estate. If the amount left in c ourt is insuffic ient to meet this c ost order, the outstanding c osts are to be divided equally among the benefic iaries, with eac h benefic iary to pay bac k that amount into c ourt as nec essary to satisfy the c ost order. 

235    In addition, the Plaintiffs are to pay the 2nd Defendant’s c osts on an indemnity basis. These c osts are to be paid by the Plaintiffs _personally_. 

236    All the above c osts are to be agreed or taxed. 

237    The 3rd Defendant is to bear his own c osts. 

238    I c onc lude by making some observations about the present suit. It is c lear that there is muc h bitterness among the Foo siblings and deep-rooted grievanc es against one another whic h has spilt into the c ourts over the years. This is undersc ored by the sheer number of suits and interloc utory proc eedings in relation to the late parents’ estates. Indeed, there are now also proc eedings c onc erning the Late Brother’s Estate. These legal proc eedings have resulted in the estate monies being substantially depleted in pursuing and defending the c laims, without any real prospec t of settlement. In fac t, in the present suit, the disputed sums are negligible c ompared to the Minimum Sums already paid out to the benefic iaries. It bears emphasis that the c ourt should not be used as a forum for the airing of grievanc es ac c umulated over a lifetime against other family members. As a c ourt of law, the grievanc es must be set out in the c ontext of legally enforc eable rights and obligations and with due regard to established rules on proc edure and evidenc e. It is my hope that this judgment provides some c losure to the parties and enables them to leave behind their animosity 


and to move on to the next c hapter of their lives.
