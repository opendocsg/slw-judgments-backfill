Land – Caveats – effec t of c aveat-Adverse possession – Whether adverse possession ac quired by 1st Marc h 1994 – Failure to lodge c aveat against disputed plot of land before lapsing of c aution 

- Whether suc h interest c an be defeated by bona fide purc haser's interest under Land Titles Ac t (Cap 157, 1994 Ed) 

: These are four related originating summonses heard together and they concern a plot of land, one 

part of which has been assimilated by 1 Bedok Rise and the other by 3 Bedok Rise. The plaintiff in OS 

1628 and 1629 of 2000 is a company (`the company`) which owns 7A Bedok Rise which adjoins both 

1       and 3 Bedok Rise. The company claims against the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise possession of the 

respective portion of the plot in issue together with an injunction to restrain them from remaining on 

the said plot, mesne profits and/or damages from the date of trespass until the delivery up of 

possession, interest and costs on an indemnity basis. 

Originating Summons 1925 of 2000 and OS 600154 of 2001 are the actions by the owners of 3 and 1 

Bedok Rise respectively against the company for a declaration that they are the owners of the 

relevant portion of the plot of land in question by virtue of adverse possession. They also seek an 

order that the Singapore Land Registry be directed to rectify the entries in the registry to exclude the 

plot in question from the title of 7A Bedok Rise. 

The portion of the plot occupied by 3 Bedok Rise is about 48.10sq m with an estimated market value 

of $210,000 while the portion occupied by 1 Bedok Rise is about 80.16sq m with an estimated market 

value of $345,000. 

**_The company`s case_** 

The company is the registered owner of the piece of land described as Lot 8187W Mukim 27 Bedok 

(`the property`) of which 7A Bedok Rise is a part. The property`s parent lot used to be known as Lot 

235-25 Mukim 27 Bedok/Lot 98170L Mukim 27 Bedok. 

The company purchased the property from another company known as Double L & T Pte Ltd which 

had in turn acquired it from one Thulasi Velayutham. Pursuant to an Indenture of Conveyance dated 

17 December 1993, Thulasi conveyed the land known as Lot 235-25 Mukim 27 Bedok to Double L & T 

Pte Ltd. Thereafter, Double L & T Pte Ltd applied for the parent lot (comprising the property) to be 

registered under the Land Titles Act. 

On 20 June 1994, Double L & T Pte Ltd obtained a qualified certificate of title of the parent lot which 

was subdivided into Lot 8187W (the property), Lot 8188V and Lot 8189P. 

On 15 June 1996, the property was transferred from Double L & T Pte Ltd and registered in the name 


of the company. The company, which is a housing developer, then built houses on the property. The 

company intends to sell the house now known as 7A Bedok Rise together with its compound. The plot 

in dispute falls within the compound of 7A Bedok Rise but the respective portions thereof have been 

fenced up and assimilated by 1 and 3 Bedok Rise. 

On 9 April 1996, the company`s solicitors wrote to the owner of 1 Bedok Rise in the following terms: 

 Dear Sirs, 

 re: Lots 235-25 and 4236 Mukim 27 Bedok Close Singapore 

 We ac t for M/s Liwen Holdings Pte Ltd who are the purc hasers of No. 16 Bedok Close, Singapore i.e. Lots No. 235-25 and 4236, Mukim 27, Singapore.

 In any event, please let us have your written response within the next seven (7) days. 

A similar letter was written to the owners of 3 Bedok Rise on the same day. 

On 21 June 1996, the company`s solicitors followed up with another letter to the respective owners 

which reads: 

 Dear Sir, 

 re: Lots 8187 (previously 235-25) Mukim 27 Bedok Close Singapore 

 We ac t for M/s Liwen Holdings Pte Ltd who are now the owners of the above property. 

 Despite our letter of 9th April 1996, you have not set bac k your fenc ing to its proper boundary.

On 15 July 1996, the company`s solicitors wrote again to the owner of 1 Bedok Rise the following 

letter: 


 Dear Sir, 

 re: Lot 8187 (previously 235-25) Mukim 27 Bedok Close Singapore 

 We ac t for M/s Liwen Holdings Pte Ltd who are the owners of the above property. 

 We are instruc ted that you have enc roac hed onto the portion of our c lients land, more partic ularly marked "D" in the enc losed plan.

 In any event, please let us have your written response within the next seven (7) days. 

A similar letter did not appear to have been sent to 3 Bedok Rise. 

Some four years later, on 9 October 2000, the company`s solicitors wrote:

A letter in similar terms was sent to 3 Bedok Rise. However, there was no response from either 1 or 3 

Bedok Rise. 

The company claims that its title has become absolute on 17 December 1998, five years after the 

Indenture of Conveyance by Thulasi to Double L & T Pte Ltd. No one has filed a caveat against the 

property alleging an interest in it. 

**_The defendants` case_** 

The case of the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise is contained in their affidavits filed in OS 1925/ 

and OS 600154/2001. 

1       Bedok Rise was transferred to the present owner on 25 April 1988. The previous owner bought this 

property in 1975. 

1       Bedok Rise was part of a housing project developed by Lucky Realty Co Ltd. An application was 

made sometime in 1973 by the developer to subdivide the parent lot (Lot 235-24 Mukim 27 Bedok) 

into individual lots which included 1 Bedok Rise. 

When the present owner purchased 1 Bedok Rise, it was separated along its entire boundary with 3 

Bedok Rise by a brick wall with metal grilles at the top. In 1978, this brick wall was built in place of 

the chain fencing put up by the developer and it has been in continuous existence since then. The 

first owner of 1 Bedok Rise was in continuous possession of the relevant portion of the plot of land in 

dispute since the date of purchase of 1 Bedok Rise from the developer and there was undisturbed 

possession for more than 12 years before this property was transferred to the present owner in 1988. 

The company reiterates its position set out in its originating summons in respect of 1 Bedok Rise. 

None of the directors of the company has any knowledge of the owner`s allegations spelt out above 

and the company does not admit them as the truth. The company points out that the assertion that 

the chain fencing put up by the developer had annexed the disputed plot is a bare one. In fact, the 

site plan of the developer attached to its application for subdivision in 1973 clearly indicated that the 

plot in issue was excluded from 1 Bedok Rise. The company also points out that the present owner 

has no personal knowledge about the developer`s chain fencing nor any documents as to the date of 


construction of the brick wall. In the ordinary course of events, there ought to have been various 

queries regarding the unauthorised use of the plot in issue in the purchases of 1 Bedok Rise in 1971, 

1975 and 1988 but no documentary evidence of such has been adduced. There was also no response 

when the company and its predecessor demanded the cessation of encroachment. 

The present owners of 3 Bedok Rise are a married couple who bought it in 1986. The husband was 

told by the previous owner that he bought this property from Lucky Realty Co Ltd in 1971 and was 

given possession in August 1973. The previous owner also told him a chain fencing had been 

constructed between 1 and 3 Bedok Rise at the time he took possession of his property and that it 

enclosed the disputed plot as well. 

He was further told that sometime in 1978, the chain fencing was replaced by a brick wall with metal 

grilles on top. Beyond the boundary walls of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise (ie the company`s property) was a 

strip of land reserved as a backlane or access which was covered with wild vegetation and which had 

never been used. In fact, the access to this strip was sealed up with a wooden fence. 

The previous owner of 3 Bedok Rise is now residing in Canada. An affidavit was filed by him confirming 

what has been stated by the present owner. The previous owner also confirms that he was in 

continuous possession of the relevant part of the disputed plot since the time he took possession of 3 

Bedok Rise from the developer in 1973. He had also maintained, repaired and carried out improvements 

to the disputed plot. 

The company filed an affidavit raising the same points as it did in the case of 1 Bedok Rise. 

**_The issues_** 

On 1 March 1994, acquisition of title by adverse possession was effectively abolished. The present 

owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise who took possession in 1988 and 1986 respectively would therefore not 

have satisfied the requirement of 12 years of continuous adverse possession in their own right. The 

issues for determination are therefore the following: 

(1) whether by 1 March 1994, the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise have acquired the disputed plot 

through adverse possession; 

(2) if they have so acquired, whether such interest can be defeated by the company`s interest as 

bona fide purchaser under the Land Titles Act and whether the company`s title to the disputed plot 

has become an unqualified title on 17 December 1998. 

**_The decision of the court_** 

The first issue is one of fact. In the light of the documentary evidence which shows that the disputed 

plot was not included as part of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise, the assertions of the present owners and those 

of the previous owner of 3 Bedok Rise must be tested by cross-examination in court. I therefore 

ordered a trial of this factual issue and directed that all affidavits on record stand as the affidavits of 

evidence-in-chief of the respective witnesses. I also directed the parties to proceed for a pre-trial 

conference before the Registrar on the question of the need for further witnesses and to take dates 

for the trial of the issue. This part of my decision is not under appeal by the company. 

The second issue is a question of law. The company`s case is that its title has become an absolute 


one with effect from 17 December 1998, five years after the conveyance from Thulasi to Double L & T 

Pte Ltd, as no caveat was lodged before 17 December 1998 to assert any claim against the property. 

On 20 June 1994, when the property was brought within the regime of the Land Titles Act, the 

conveyance which was cancelled upon the issuance of the qualified certificate of title to Double L & T 

Pte Ltd was Thulasi`s 17 December 1993 conveyance. The company`s certificate of title dated 15 

June 1996 was also a qualified title. 

Sections 19 and 20 of the Land Titles Act set out the process of bringing land within the said Act. 

The relevant parts of these sections provide: 

 19 (1) Land not subject to the provisions of this Act may be brought under the provisions of this Act. (2) Subject to this section, a primary application may be made by (a) a person entitled whether at law or in equity to an estate in fee simple or in perpetuity in the land to which the application relates; or (b) a person entitled either at law or in equity to a leasehold estate having an unexpired term of not less than 10 years on the date of the lodgment of the application in the land to which the application relates. ... 20 When land has been brought under the provisions of this Act pursuant to a primary application, the Registrar shall (a) upon the creation of a folio unqualified as to title, cancel all assurances lodged to support the primary application in so far as they relate to the registered land, and retain in his possession or under his control such assurances as have been wholly cancelled; and (b) upon the creation of a folio qualified as to title, cancel the last conveyance passing title to the person who is recorded in the folio as the registered proprietor of the land comprised in the folio. 

Section 3(1) provides: 


 Exc ept as hereinafter provided, all Ac ts, regulations, rules, and other laws, and all prac tic es, relating to estates and interests in land and operative at 1st Marc h 1994, so far as they are inc onsistent with the provisions of this Ac t in their applic ation to registered land, are repealed. 

Section 25 (on which the company relies for its assertion that its qualified title has become absolute 

on 17 December 1998) reads: 

 (1) Upon the c reation of a qualified folio, the Registrar shall enter thereon a c aution warning persons dealing with the registered proprietor therein named that the land c omprised therein is held subjec t to any interest whic h affec ted it at the date of the c reation of that folio, and so long as the c aution remains on that folio that land shall be so held. 

 (2) In favour of any purc haser of an entire estate or interest in any land c omprised in a qualified folio who is registered as the proprietor in the qualified folio, a c aution entered on the qualified folio whether before or after 1st Marc h 1994 lapses, in respec t of that estate or interest, on the expiration of 5 years from the date of the last c onveyanc e whic h was c anc elled by the Registrar upon the c reation of the qualified folio. 

 (3) A mortgagee or c hargee shall not be regarded as a purc haser for the purposes of subsec tion (2). 

 (4) When a c aution lapses pursuant to subsec tion (2), the lapsed c aution shall c onstitute a defunc t entry and the Registrar shall, after the lodgment of an applic ation in the approved form made by the proprietor of the land c ause an entry to be made in respec t of the lapsing of the c aution. 

 (5) Upon the lapsing of a c aution pursuant to subsec tion (2), the folio shall c ease to be qualified and the land c omprised therein shall thenc eforth be held subjec t only to suc h interests as are registered or notified on the folio and to suc h interests as are otherwise exc epted by sec tion 46. 

 (6) Any person deprived of land by the operation of this sec tion shall not by reason of that deprivation have any c laim against the assuranc e fund. 

 (7) For the purposes of subsec tion (2), 

 "c onveyanc e" has the same meaning as in sec tion 21 (6). 

Section 45 of the Land Titles Act states that instruments are ineffectual to pass any estate or 

interest in land under the Land Titles Act until they are registered. The estate of the proprietor of 

registered land is paramount as provided in: 


 46(1) Notwithstanding the existence in any other person of any estate or interest, whether derived by grant from the State or otherwise, which but for this Act might be held to be paramount or to have priority, and notwithstanding any failure to observe the procedural requirements of this Act, any person who becomes the proprietor of registered land, whether or not he dealt with a proprietor, and notwithstanding any lack of good faith on the part of the person through whom he claims, shall hold that land free from all encumbrances, liens, estates and interests whatsoever except such as may be registered or notified in the land-register, ... 

This subsection is subject to seven exceptions. The registered title of a proprietor may also be 

defeated on the ground of fraud or forgery. Section 46(3) further provides: 

 Nothing in this sec tion shall c onfer on a proprietor c laiming otherwise than as a purc haser any better title than was held by his immediate predec essor. 

Knowledge of the existence of any unregistered interest shall not of itself be imputed as fraud (ss 

47(1) and 49(2) of the Land Titles Act). No fraud has been alleged against the company in these 

proceedings. Finally, s 157(1) provides: 

 Notwithstanding anything in this Ac t, no purc haser who has bec ome a proprietor shall be subjec t to ac tion for the rec overy of land or of money on the plea that his vendor, or any predec essor in title, may have ac ted in bad faith. 

In **Sum Keong Realty v Syed Jafaralsadeg Alhadad** <span class="citation">[1996] 3 SLR 55</span> at 61, Chao Hick Tin J held 

that in the light of s 25(2) of the Land Titles Act, it was clear that a caution stated on a qualified 

title lapsed on the expiry of five years from the date of the last conveyance which was cancelled by 

the Registrar upon the creation of the qualified folio and the fact that no entry had yet been made in 

respect of the lapsing of the caution was immaterial. This was because under s 25(4), the caution 

constituted a defunct entry and the making of an entry regarding its lapsing was a purely 

administrative act in which the Registrar had no discretion. It is therefore of no consequence that no 

such entry has been made in the present case before me. 

**Balwant Singh v Double L & T** <span class="citation">[1996] 2 SLR 726</span> was a case involving the same property as the one 

in the present case. In that case, Balwant Singh had been in adverse possession of a triangular plot 

of some 70.4sq m which formed part of Lot 235-25 Mukim 27 belonging to one VK Samy. This plot of 

land was in the adverse possession of Thulasi since 1941. On 17 December 1993, Thulasi obtained 

consent judgment against VK Samy and was declared owner in fee simple by virtue of adverse 

possession. On the same day, Thulasi conveyed Lot 235-25 including the said triangular plot to Double 

L & T Pte Ltd. This conveyance was duly registered in the Registry of Deeds. On 1 March 1994, the 

new Land Titles Act came into force. On 20 June 1994, the property was brought within the new Land 

Titles Act with Double L & T Pte Ltd as the registered proprietor under a qualified certificate of title. 

On 17 February 1995, Balwant Singh lodged a caveat against the property claiming an interest in the 

triangular plot as an adverse possessor. 


Goh Joon Seng J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, set out the issues before the court 

and the law on adverse possession of both common law land and registered land as follows (at pp 

729-731): 

 The issues on appeal were essentially the same as those raised in the c ourt below, namely: 

 (a) did s 50 of the new LTA abolish Balwants c laim by way of adverse possession of the disputed plot whic h bec ame registered land on 20 June 1994; 

 (b) did s 177(3) of the 1993 LTA apply to preserve Balwants c laim. 

 Before we proc eed, it would be c onvenient to trac e briefly the development of the law relating to ac quisition of title to land by adverse possession with regard to registered and unregistered land. Prior to 1 Marc h 1994, for land whic h was held under the c ommon law system, title ac quired by adverse possession need not be registered sinc e all that was required to ac quire the same was the nec essary intention and physic al possession to extinguish the doc umentary owners title. The Limitation Ac t also provided that if the doc umentary owner did not assert title to the land within 12 years, his c laim would be barred and his title extinguished and the person in adverse possession would then ac quire a possessory title. See ss 9(1) and 18 of the Limitation Ac t. 

 On the other hand, c laims to adverse possession of registered land were governed by s 42 of the repealed LTA whic h read: 

 (1) Any person in adverse possession of registered land who, if that land had not been brought under the provisions of this Ac t would have bec ome entitled thereto by virtue of that adverse possession, may apply to the Registrar for a c ertific ate of title to that land, provided that not less than 12 years have elapsed sinc e the land was brought under the provisions of this Ac t, or sinc e the entry in the land-register of the most rec ent memorial of registration or notific ation of an instrument (other than an instrument of statutory obligation) affec ting that land. 

 (2) Exc ept as in this Division provided, no title to land adverse to or in derogation of the title of a proprietor shall be ac quired by any length of possession by virtue of the Limitation Ac t or otherwise, nor shall the title of any proprietor be extinguished by the operation of that Ac t. 

 (3) Nothing in this Ac t affec ts the operation of the Limitation Ac t with respec t to the right of a person in adverse possession of land c omprised in a qualified c ertific ate of title where the possession c ommenc ed before the land was brought under the provisions of this Ac t and that right has been protec ted by c aveat. 

 Sec tion 42(2) is the prec ursor of s 50 of the new LTA. In Wong Kok Chin v Mah Ten Kui Joseph <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR 161</span> , Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) in delivering the judgment of this c ourt dealt c omprehensively with the provisions 


of the repealed LTA. There the adverse possessor`s oc c upation of the enc roac hed land began in 1969. On 23 August 1974, the land, of whic h the enc roac hed land was a part, was brought under the provisions of the repealed LTA then applic able and a qualified c ertific ate of title issued. On 23 June 1988, the registered proprietor of the land lodged a notic e of reassertion of ownership. On 27 June 1988, the adverse possessor lodged a c aveat c laiming an interest as an adverse possessor of the enc roac hed land. It was held that the adverse possessor`s c laim fell within s 42(3) in that he had five years` adverse possession before the land bec ame registered land. This was an inc hoate interest whic h c rystallised into an indefeasible title by Dec ember 1981 and the registered proprietor`s title was thereby extinguished long before he lodged his reassertion of ownership. At p 172 Chan Sek Keong J stated: 

`... Having regard to the polic y of the LTA in c ontinuing to apply the Limitation Ac t to registered land, subjec t only to the provisions of Div 2 of the Ac t, the short answer must be that unless Div 2 expressly provides to the c ontrary, the appellant`s title was extinguished long before he lodged his reassertion of ownership. In our view, the lodgment of the reassertion of ownership c ould not have the effec t of reviving a title whic h had been extinguished by limitation as there is no provision in Div 2 whic h so provides. A reassertion of ownership is not intended by the LTA to revive an extinc t title but to stop the ac c ruing right of an adverse possessor before limitation sets in.` 

As Baalman in **_The Singapore Torrens Systems_** [1961] at p 96 desc ribed, these permitted exc eptions under the repealed LTA effec tively steered a middle c ourse between exposing the land-register entirely to c laims based on adverse possession, and exc luding entirely the princ iple of limitation of ac tion. 

However, as of 1 Marc h 1994, the repealed LTA was repealed by the 1993 LTA. Sec tion 50 of the 1993 LTA is now s 50 of the new LTA. It reads: 

`Exc ept as provided in sec tion 172(7) and (8) no title to land adverse to or in derogation of the title of a proprietor of registered land shall be ac quired by any length of possession by virtue of the Limitation Ac t or otherwise, nor shall the title of any proprietor of registered land be extinguished by the operation of that Ac t.` 

Sec tion 50 of the new LTA is thus similarly worded as s 42(2) of the repealed LTA exc ept for the transitional provisions. Effec tively under s 50 of the new LTA, exc ept in limited instanc es falling within the transitional provisions, no title to registered land c ould be ac quired by adverse possession. These transitional provisions are found in s 172(7) and (8) of the new LTA. Sec tion 172(7) states: 

`Where at any time before 1st Marc h 1994, a person 

(a) was in adverse possession of any registered land; and 

(b) has lodged an applic ation for a possessory title to the land under the 

provisions of the repealed Ac t and the applic ation has not been withdrawn but is 

on suc h date pending in the Land Titles Registry, 

the applic ation shall be dealt with in ac c ordanc e with the provisions of the 


 repealed Ac t in forc e immediately before suc h date. 

 Sec tion 172(8) states: 

 Where at any time before 1st Marc h 1994 a person 

 (a) was in adverse possession of any registered land; and 

 (b) was entitled to lodge an applic ation for a possessory title to the land under the provisions of the repealed Ac t whic h were in forc e immediately before suc h date, 

 he may, within 6 months of suc h date make an applic ation to c ourt for an order to vest the title in him or lodge an applic ation for a possessory title to the land and the applic ation shall be dealt with in ac c ordanc e with the provisions of the repealed Ac t in forc e immediately before suc h date. 

 Sec tion 50 of the new LTA therefore provides for the preservation of an adverse possessors c laim to title in two situations. Firstly, under s 172(7), where the land was registered under the repealed LTA and an applic ation for possessory title had been lodged prior to 1 Marc h 1994. Sec ondly, under s 172(8) where there was a subsisting entitlement to lodge suc h an applic ation in respec t of suc h registered land as of 1 Marc h 1994 and the adverse possessor, within six months, makes an applic ation to the c ourt for an order to vest the title in him or lodges an applic ation for possessory title. 

After referring briefly to an Australian case, the Court of Appeal went on to say (at pp 732-733): 

 It is therefore c lear that, under the new LTA, adverse possession for registered land was to be abolished onc e and for all, save for the transitional provisions as provided in s 172(7) and (8). But adverse possession of unregistered land is still governed by the Limitation Ac t as amended by s 177(1) of the 1993 LTA. Sec tion 177 of the 1993 LTA provides as follows: 

 (1) Sec tion 9 of the Limitation Ac t is amended by inserting, immediately after subsec tion (2), the following subsec tion: 

 (3) This sec tion [referring to s 9 of the Limitation Ac t] shall not apply to an ac tion to rec over land from a person by reason only of his unauthorised oc c upation of the land. [This subsec tion is now s 9(3) of the Limitation Ac t.] 

### (2) ... 

 (3) Nothing in this sec tion [referring to s 177 of the 1993 LTA] shall 

 (a) enable any ac tion to be brought whic h was barred by the Limitation Ac t immediately before the c ommenc ement of the Land Titles Ac t 1993 (referred to in this subsec tion as the appointed day); 


(b) affec t any ac tion c ommenc ed before the appointed day; or 

(c ) revive any title to land whic h was extinguished by the operation of the 

Limitation Ac t in forc e immediately before the appointed day.` 

For c onvenient referenc e we set out below the provisions of s 9(1) and (2) of the Limitation Ac t: 

`(1) No ac tion shall be brought by any person to rec over any land after the 

expiration of 12 years from the date on whic h the right of ac tion ac c rued to 

him, or, if it first ac c rued to some person through whom he c laims, to that 

person. 

(2) Nothing in this sec tion or in sec tion 11(2) shall be deemed to affec t the 

provisions of the Government Proc eedings Ac t, or to apply to any person 

registered under or by virtue of the provisions of the Land Titles Ac t as the 

proprietor of the land sought to be rec overed, or to any person c laiming 

through a person so registered, exc ept to the extent that suc h Ac t so provides 

or permits.` 

Thus s 177 of the 1993 LTA by sub-s 1 amended s 9 of the Limitation Ac t thereby abolishing c laim by way of adverse possession. At the same time by sub-s 3 it preserved rights that had ac c rued as of 1 Marc h 1994. 

Sec tion 177(3) of the 1993 LTA was omitted from the new LTA. But though omitted, it remains in forc e by virtue of s 5 of the Revised Edition of the Laws Ac t (Cap 275) whic h reads: 

`(1) The Commissioners shall omit from the revised edition of Ac ts suc h Ac ts as 

may be spec ified by the President by notific ation in the Gazette. 

(2) Notwithstanding anything to the c ontrary in this Ac t, suc h Ac ts and any 

Parts, sec tions or other divisions of suc h Ac ts shall remain in forc e until they 

have been expressly repealed or have expired or bec ome spent or had effec t.` 

To sum up the position as of 1 Marc h 1994, there were thus three c ategories of adverse possession c laims. Firstly, for land held under the c ommon law system if the adverse possessor did not have 12 years of adverse possession as of 1 Marc h 1994, he would now not be able to make a c laim see s 9(3) of the Limitation Ac t. Conversely, if he had the requisite 12 years, he c ould rely on s 177(3) of the 1993 LTA to preserve his possessory title. Sec ondly, for registered land held under the provisions of the repealed LTA, the adverse possessor c ould rely on s 172(7) and (8) of the new LTA. Thirdly, for registered land held under the provisions of the new LTA, no adverse possession c laims are now allowed unless s 172(7)or (8) of the new LTA applies. 

The question we had to c onsider was whether the new LTA was intended to apply to c laims by way of adverse possession even in respec t of registered land in c irc umstanc es where the adverse possessor had already ac quired title before 


 the land bec ame registered land under the provisions of the new LTA, where a qualified c ertific ate of title was issued and where the adverse possessor had lodged a c aveat in respec t of his c laim. 

The Court of Appeal then considered the views of the Select Committee on the Land Titles Bill as well 

as the Parliamentary debates on that Bill (at pp 733-734): 

 In the Report on the Land Titles Bill, the Selec t Committee had this to say: 

### `... 

 The amendment will not be retrospec tive. They will not affec t squatters or mortgagees in possession who have already perfec ted their title by effluxion of time prior to the amendments. 

 An adverse possessor who has perfec ted his c laim to a possessory title to unregistered land will not be required to apply to c ourt for a vesting order within a spec ified time-frame. However, should the land be brought under the Land Titles Ac t through the issue of a qualified c ertific ate of title, the adverse possessors c laim will remain protec ted so long as 

 (a) a c aution as to title remains on the c ertific ate of title; or 

 (b) the adverse possessor lodges a c aveat before suc h c aution has lapsed or been c anc elled. 

 This view was reiterated by the Minister for Law, Professor S Jayakumar, when he moved that the Land Titles Bill be read for the third time: 

### `... 

 I also wish to stress that the amendment is not retrospec tive. It will not affec t those in possession who have already ac quired their title by adverse possession prior to the amendment c oming into forc e. Nor will suc h persons in possession be required to apply within a time-frame to the c ourt for an order as to their title to the land. 

 I should point out that should any land bec ome registered land through the issue of a qualified c ertific ate of title, an adverse possessors c laim to the land will remain protec ted only as long as, first, a c aution as to title remains on the c ertific ate of title; and sec ond, the adverse possessor lodges a c aveat before suc h c aution has lapsed or been c anc elled. 

 Sec ondly, c l 172(9) [now s 172(8) of the new LTA] enables persons who have prior to the c oming into operation of the Bill, established their title by way of adverse possession of registered land to apply to c ourt for an order or to the Registrar of Titles for a possessory title. Clause 172(9) has been amended to give suc h persons six months instead of three months to do so as it was represented to the Selec t Committee that six months would give more 


 flexibility. 

At the end of the analysis, the Court of Appeal concluded (at p 735): 

 Thus we agreed with the learned judge when he said that as of 1 Marc h 1994 there were only two c ategories of adverse possession c laims in respec t of registered land under the new LTA whic h were found in s 172(7) and (8) of the same Ac t. However, it is quite c lear that these two c ategories apply to land whic h was already registered land as of 1 Marc h 1994 as c an be seen from the wording of s 172(7) and (8). For unregistered land or land whic h bec omes registered land after that date, the applic able provisions are s 177(3) of the 1993 LTA. 

 Consistent with this view is Wong Kok Chin s c ase and also Tan Eng Khiam v Ultra Realty Pte Ltd [1991] 3 MLJ 234 whic h dealt with a similar c laim as that of Balwants under the repealed LTA. It was held there that where the adverse possessor had c ompleted the requisite period of 12 years possession before the land was brought under the repealed Ac t and a qualified c ertific ate of title issued, the adverse possessors interest would still subsist. This is bec ause where there had been 12 years of adverse possession before the land bec ame registered land, the rights of the doc umentary owner would already have been extinguished before the c onversion to registered land. Ac c ordingly s 50 of the new LTA would not apply to defeat the adverse possessors ac c rued c laim. The adverse possessors c laim in those c irc umstanc es were preserved by s 177(3) of the 1993 LTA. 

In **Shell Eastern Petroleum v Goh Chor Cheok** <span class="citation">[2000] 1 SLR 45</span> , in or about 1961, when developers 

built a block of flats on land adjoining the plaintiffs` land, they built a retaining wall which, it was 

since discovered, encroached on the plaintiffs` land. By 1973, the plaintiffs` right of action over the 

encroached portion would have been extinguished. Three events occurred since 1973. Firstly, in 

November 1992, the plaintiffs` then common law land was brought under the Land Titles Act and a 

qualified title issued. Secondly, the 1993 amendments to the Land Titles Act limited or abolished the 

acquisition of title by adverse possession in respect of both common law land and registered land. 

Thirdly, the caution on the qualified title was cancelled on 2 May 1996 upon the plaintiffs` application 

and their title became unqualified thereafter. The question before the court was whether any of these 

three events had any effect on the position, which had been reached by 1973, that action to recover 

the strip of land in question had become statute-barred. The adverse possessors did not lodge any 

caveat in respect of the disputed plot. 

Warren Khoo J dismissed the plaintiffs` claim. On the question of the failure to lodge a caveat, the 

judge referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Chan Sek Keong J in **Wong Kok** 

**Chin v Mah Ten Kui Joseph** <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR 161</span> : 

 11 The relevant provisions of s 20 read as follows: 

 (2) any person c laiming an interest in land whic h was subsisting at the date of issue of a qualified c ertific ate of title for that land may, so long as a c aution remains on the folio of the land-register, protec t that interest by a c aveat pursuant to sec tion 104, and the Registrar shall enter a notific ation of suc h a c aveat in the land-register. 


His honour held that the failure to lodge a c aveat did not have the effec t of 

reviving the title of the true owner whic h had been extinguished by limitation. 

He said: 

`It is c lear from s 20 of the Ac t that until the registered proprietor of land held 

under qualified title obtains the c anc ellation of the c aution, his title will always 

be subjec t to subsisting interests affec ting his title. 

The only person who is able to obtain title free from any prior interests 

affec ting suc h land is a purc haser when that c aution expires against him after 

five years from the date of c onversion and when the c aution is c anc elled on his 

applic ation.` 

His honour went on to say: 

`The c aveat referred to in s 42(3) is intended to protec t the rights of an 

adverse possessor against a purc haser, and not against the registered 

proprietor. The right of a person in adverse possession of registered land falling 

within the terms of s 42(3) c an only be defeated by a purc haser where suc h 

right is not protec ted by c aveat, or by the registered proprietor lodging a 

reassertion of ownership before his title has been extinguished by limitation.` 

12     Similarly, in the instant c ase, the plaintiffs` title to the disputed land had 

been extinguished when the land was brought under the provisions of the Ac t. 

The failure of the defendants to lodge a c aveat would only have had an adverse 

effec t on them in relation to a purc haser from the plaintiffs. Vis-.-vis the 

plaintiffs as the original registered proprietor against whom the defendants had 

ac quired title by adverse possession, the absenc e of a c aveat had no effec t on 

the defendants` title. 

### ... 

27     As for c aveats, there is no relevant differenc e between the provisions of the 

c urrent Ac t and those in the repealed Ac t. Sec tion 27(2) of the c urrent edition 

of the Ac t provides as follows: 

`Any person c laiming an interest in land whic h is subsisting at the date of the 

c reation of a qualified folio for that land other than an interest exc epted by 

sec tion 46 may, so long as the folio remains qualified as to title, protec t that 

interest by lodging a c aveat pursuant to sec tion 115, and the Registrar shall 

enter a notific ation of suc h a c aveat in that folio.` 

28     It seems c lear enough from s 25(2) that when a c aution lapses under that 

subsec tion, it lapses `in favour of any purc haser` ... 

### ... 

34     As for the fac t that the defendants have never lodged any c aveat to protec t 


 their title, here again, that failure is of c onsequenc e only in relation to a purc haser, but not in relation to the plaintiffs as the original registered proprietor upon the land being brought under the provisions of the Ac t. I would regard this point as having been settled by the Wong Kok Chin c ase. See the dic ta of Chan J in the passages earlier set out. I think what he said there is valid in a c ase where the title has bec ome unqualified as where it has not. 

 Conclusion 

 35 It is my c onc lusion, therefore, that the defendants adverse title, whic h had matured long before the land was brought under the provisions of the Land Titles Ac t, remains valid notwithstanding the fac t that they never lodged any c aveat while the land was subjec t to qualified title and notwithstanding that the plaintiffs title has sinc e bec ome unqualified as a result of the c anc ellation of the c aution. The defendants title, however, stands on an extremely prec arious footing. It is exposed to the risk of being over-reac hed by a purc haser from the plaintiffs, as it has not been notified on the register. That is a c onsequenc e to whic h all persons who have an interest in registered land whic h is not within the exc eptions in s 46 or whic h has not been notified on the register, are exposed. Whether the defendants c an still protec t their interest by lodging a c aveat in ac c ordanc e with the general provisions of s 115 is not a matter before me. 

Similarly, in **Chuan Hong Auto v Shell Eastern Petroleum** <span class="citation">[1996] 1 SLR 415</span> , the Court of Appeal 

held that the automatic lapsing of the caution did not affect the interest of equitable lessees of the 

land who had already lodged a caveat before the lapsing. 

The question of law in the present case therefore turns entirely on the effect of the owners of 1 and 

3       Bedok Rise not having lodged any caveat against the disputed plot before the expiration of the five

year period provided under s 25(2) of the Land Titles Act. Clearly, the company here is a purchaser of 

the entire estate or interest within the meaning of that subsection and no fraud has been alleged 

against it. 

Section 42 of the repealed Land Titles Act could not have applied to the land here as it was brought 

within the registered land regime only in June 1994. For the same reason, s 172(7) and (8) of the 

present Act can have no application to the land here. This is clear from the Court of Appeal`s 

reasoning in **_Balwant Singh_** (supra). Accordingly, s 177(3) of the 1993 Land Titles Act would protect 

the existing rights of the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise if adverse possession of the disputed plot has 

crystallized before 1 March 1994. 

However, there is great force in the company`s arguments that those owners ought to have been 

vigilant and lodged caveats, particularly as notice of the purchase of the land was given to them back 

in 1996, although no notice of the conversion to registered title appears to have been similarly given. 

It would appear from the Select Committee`s Report and the Parliamentary debates that a caveat is 

an essential step to protecting an adverse possessor`s claim should the land become registered land 

through the issue of a qualified certificate of title. This was also the view of Warren Khoo J in **_Shell_** 

**_Eastern Petroleum v Goh Chor Cheok_** (supra), at least where protection is sought against a 

purchaser of the registered land. Lodgment of a caveat is permissible under s 27(2) of the Land Titles 

Act. This is not an entirely new provision. It has a broad equivalent in s 20(2) of the repealed Act 


(see Warren Khoo J`s judgment in the abovementioned case). However, apart from this general 

provision which includes interests beyond adverse possession, there is no specific provision along the 

lines of s 42(3) of the repealed Land Titles Act which spelt out clearly that the right of an adverse 

possessor was protected only if `that right has been protected by caveat`. I therefore hold that s 

177(3) of the 1993 Land Titles Act applies here notwithstanding the failure of the owners to lodge 

caveats before the lapsing of the caution. The adverse possessors` rights are thereby preserved and 

Double L & T Pte Ltd`s and the company`s rights have been extinguished. 

Accordingly, on the question of law in issue, I held that, if adverse possession has crystallized before 

1 March 1994, the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise have become the owners of the disputed plot and 

their rights and interests over the said plot cannot be overreached by the events thereafter. I also 

ordered costs to be paid by the company to the said owners in respect of the arguments pertaining 

to this issue of law. 

## Outcome: 

Order accordingly.
