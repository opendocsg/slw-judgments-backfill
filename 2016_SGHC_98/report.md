**Introduction** 

1       Liew Kai Lung, Karl (“the appellant”) applied in Originating Summons (Bankruptc y) No 89 of 2015 (“OSB 89/2015”) to dismiss the applic ation by Ching Chiat Kwong (“the respondent”) for a Bankruptc y Order in Case No B 2552/2014 against the Plaintiff filed on 19 Dec ember 2014 (“the Applic ation”), or in the alternative, to stay all proc eedings on the Applic ation for suc h time as it is nec essary to determine by trial whether the appellant is indebted to the respondent. The appellant’s applic ation was dismissed by the Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) and he filed this Registrar’s Appeal No 11 of 2016 against the AR’s dec ision. 

2       At the c onc lusion of the hearing before me, I affirmed the dec ision below with c osts. The appellant has filed a notic e of appeal (in Civil Appeal No 21 of 2016) against my dec ision. I thus set out my reasons. 

**Factual and procedural background** 

3       The appellant was the direc tor of Realm Capital Limited (“Realm Capital”), and the respondent 

was the direc tor of Ever Tyc oon Limited (“Ever Tyc oon”). [note: 1] After Realm Capital failed to make 

payment to Ever Tyc oon under c ertain fac ility agreements [note: 2] and the appellant failed to make 

payment to Ever Tyc oon under c ertain personal guarantees, [note: 3] the appellant and respondent entered into the following: 

 (a) a deed of settlement dated 4 September 2012 (the Deed of Settlement”); [note: 4] 

 (b) a supplementary deed of settlement dated 4 Marc h 2013; [note: 5] 


 (c ) a sec ond supplementary deed of settlement dated 3 May 2013; [note: 6] and 

 (d) a third supplementary deed of settlement dated 16 Dec ember 2013. [note: 7] 

4       Under the Deed of Settlement, the respondent and Ever Tyc oon agreed to refrain from c ommenc ing legal proc eedings against, _inter alia_ , the appellant till 1 Marc h 2013 in respec t of an unpaid loan of $4m. The appellant was to repay $1.5m by 4 September 2012 and a further sum of $500,000 by 9 September 2012 (“the Settlement Payments”) in exc hange. It was undisputed that the appellant had made the Settlement Payments. Clause 1.1(ii) of the Deed of Settlement also provided that the aggregate liabilities and obligations of, _inter alia_ , the appellant towards the respondent and Ever Tyc oon after the Settlement Payments would not exc eed $2m; this was referred to in the Deed of Settlement as the “Balanc e Princ ipal”. Under c l 1.3 of the same deed, parties agreed to reac h an agreement regarding the reinvestment or settlement of the Balanc e Princ ipal by no later than 1 Marc h 

2013\. The three supplementary deeds (“the Supplementary Deeds”) served to extend the deadline and forbearanc e period up till 1 May 2014. Under c l 2.4 of the third supplementary deed, it was also provided that if the parties failed to reac h agreement under c l 1.3, the appellant and Realm Capital would be jointly and/or severally liable to pay to the respondent and Ever Tyc oon the Balanc e Princ ipal in addition to all ac c rued interest at the rate of 5% per annum from 9 September 2012 until the date of full payment. 

5       Parties failed to reac h an agreement under c l 1.3; the respondent then served a statutory demand on the plaintiff dated 14 Oc tober 2014 for a sum of $2,209,863.01 (“the SD”) pursuant to c l 

2\.4 of the third supplementary deed. [note: 8] The plaintiff had attempted, unsuc c essfully, to set aside the SD in Originating Summons (Bankruptc y) No 15 of 2015 (“OSB 15/2015”) and in the c onsequent Registrar’s Appeal No 89 of 2015 (“RA 89/2015”) (See _Liew Kai Lung Karl v Ching Chiat Kwong_ <span class="citation">[2015] 3 SLR 1204</span>). The main grounds relied on by the appellant in RA 89/2015 were that the servic e of the SD was irregular and that there was a dispute as to the debt owed, giving rise to a genuine triable issue. The appellant attempted to argue that the respondent was double c laiming for the Settlement Payments, whic h was a genuine triable issue; Chan Seng Onn J found the argument c ompletely unmeritorious sinc e it was quite apparent that the SD was for the Balanc e Princ ipal and thus a separate sum and dismissed the appeal. The Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No 77 of 2015 (“CA 

77/2015”) agreed with Chan J and dismissed the appeal. [note: 9] The appellant failed to c omply with the SD, so the respondent applied for a Bankruptc y Order in the Applic ation. The appellant brought OSB 89/2015 for a dismissal or, in the alternative, a stay of the Applic ation. 

6       The appellant’s main arguments in OSB 89/2015 before the AR were first, the fac ility agreements forming the foundation for the SD were never utilized and so there were no disbursement of funds by Ever Tyc oon to Realm Capital, and sec ond, the appellant was ac ting under a mistake of fac t that he had exec uted the personal guarantees in favour of Ever Tyc oon whic h formed the 

foundation for the SD, when he had never done so. [note: 10] Curiously, the appellant appeared to c ontradic t himself in his submissions by also c laiming that he was labouring under inc essant moral 

pressure exerted by the respondent when he exec uted those personal guarantees. [note: 11] The appellant c laimed that the personal guarantees that formed the basis of the dispute were “c ontrived”. [note: 12] He also c laimed that he was misled by his former solic itors, who were disc harged in May 

2015, into believing that he had exec uted those personal guarantees. The appellant also alleged that the respondent was fully aware of the lac k of disbursement under the fac ility agreements and the 

nonexec ution of the personal guarantees. [note: 13] The appellant implied that the Deed of 

Settlement and the Supplementary Deeds were invented, [note: 14] or should be void by virtue of the 


respondent’s knowledge. [note: 15] 

7       The appellant’s c ounsel argued that the appellant did not know and did not understand the issues as he was unrepresented when he filed the Appellant’s Case for CA 77/2015 in July 2015. Even when appellant’s c ounsel c ame onboard in late September 2015, it was too late to raise those 

arguments, and so benefit of the doubt should be given to the appellant. [note: 16] 

8       When the AR pointed out that CA 77/2015 was heard in November 2015, and so it was open to the appellant’s c ounsel to file an applic ation for leave to adduc e further evidenc e, the appellant’s 

c ounsel merely responded that he was too busy and did not have time to do so. [note: 17] 

9       The AR was of the view that the issue of whether the deed was signed under mistake was a substantive one that impinged on the validity of the SD; thus it should have been dealt with in Originating Summons (Bankruptc y) No 15 of 2015. Given that the Court of Appeal had already affirmed the validity of the SD in CA 77/2015, there was no basis to dismiss the Applic ation whic h was 

premised on a valid statutory demand; thus she dismissed Prayer 1 of OSB 89/2015. [note: 18] The AR found that the doc uments and fac ts that formed the basis for the appellant’s arguments in OSB 89/2015 were already in the appellant’s possession by May 2015 and were in fac t c anvassed in the 

Appellant’s Case for CA 77/2015, though those arguments were not raised at the appeal. [note: 19] She was of the view that there was no c ogent explanation as to why the arguments that were being raised before her c ould not have been c anvassed before the Court of Appeal in CA 77/2015 by way of 

an applic ation to adduc e new evidenc e. [note: 20] She thus dec ided that there was no basis to exerc ise the disc retion to stay the Applic ation and dismissed Prayer 2 of OSB 89/2015. 

**Parties’ Arguments** 

10     The appellant essentially repeated the same arguments that were put before the AR at para 6 

above, and also pointed out that there were at least three major triable issues, namely: [note: 21] 

 (a) Whether the appellant had exec uted the Deed of Settlement under a unilateral mistake of fac t; 

 (b) Whether the respondent was aware of the fac t that the appellant had exec uted the Deed of Settlement under a unilateral mistake of fac t; and 

 (c ) Whether the appellant only realised his unilateral mistake of fac t only after 11 May 2015. 

11     The appellant proffered the same reasons that were given to the AR at para 7 to explain why these issues c ould not have been raised in CA 77/2015. In addition, the appellant also c laimed that he had indic ated in para 15 of Appellant’s Case for CA 77/2015 that he would be taking out an 

applic ation for dismissal or stay of the proc eedings in Case No B2552/2014. [note: 22] The appellant also proffered another rather pec uliar reason whic h made no sense to me: that he was under the 

impression that his applic ation in OSB 89/2015 was distinc t from his appeal in CA 77/2015, [note: 23] and so it c ould not be said that there was an abandonment of the OSB 89/2015 arguments c overed in 

the Appellant’s Case for CA 77/2015. [note: 24] 

12     The respondent took the same position as in OSB 89/2015, that the SD was valid and unimpeac hable given the CA’s dec ision in favour of the respondents in CA 77/2015. They argued that this was the appellant’s attempt to get a sec ond bite of the c herry by trying to stay the Applic ation 


on grounds that were raised at the stage of setting aside the statutory demand but abandoned on 

appeal in CA 77/2015, thus c onstituting an abuse of proc ess. [note: 25] 

**My decision** 

13     In _Mohd Zain bin Abdullah v Chimbusco International Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2014] 2 SLR 446</span> (“ _Chimbusco_ ”), it was held by the Court of Appeal that the standard for obtaining a stay or a dismissal of bankruptc y proc eedings was no more than that for resisting a summary judgment applic ation, _ie_ , a debtor need only raise triable issues (at [16][17]). However, the Court of Appeal was also c areful to note that one c ould not stave off bankruptc y proc eedings _merely_ by alleging that there is a substantial and _bona fide_ dispute over the debt c laimed by the applic antc reditor. The c ourt has to take into ac c ount the protec tion of the interests of a meritorious c reditor and minimization of wastage of c ourt resourc es. 

14     I was of the view that the standard set out in _Chimbusco_ had not been met here. I was very doubtful that the issues raised by the appellant in this c ase were genuine. It appeared inc redible to me that the appellant only raised these purportedly triable issues after having gone through the proc eedings in OSB 15/2015 and RA 89/2015, when these issues were very fundamental to whether there is even a debt in the first plac e. The position up till CA 77/2015 had always been that the debt was not disputed; the appellant’s former c ounsel took that position explic itly when he was queried at 

the hearing of OSB 15/2015. [note: 26] The appellant had also made the Settlement Payments pursuant to the Deed of Settlement. The appellant was essentially asking me to believe that after nearly three years, during whic h deeds were signed that reflec ted outstanding loans under the fac ility agreements and were in fac t admissions of the appellant’s liability to the respondent, there had never been any monies disbursed from Ever Tyc oon and the respondent in favour of the appellant. This was plainly unc onvinc ing. Further, the c laim that the appellant was misled by his former solic itors, who were disc harged in May 2015, into believing that he had exec uted personal guarantees giving rise to the debt when he had not, was frivolous to me. Whether or not he signed those personal guarantees was a fac t that he would be in the best position to know, not his solic itors. There was no shred of evidenc e to indic ate that the appellant had been misled by his former solic itors, other than bare allegations. There was also no shred of evidenc e to show that the Deed of Settlement and the Supplementary Deeds were not genuine; it was undisputed that parties entered into the fac ility agreements and personal guarantees with the benefit of legal advic e. There was also no shred of evidenc e that the respondent had knowledge of the appellant’s purported mistake. 

15     Merits of the appellant’s c laims on the triable issue aside, given that the issues raised in the present c ase effec tively go to the validity of the SD, they should have been raised before the CA in the Appellant’s Case for CA 77/2015. The AR was right to find that the appellant had in fac t already c overed these identic al issues in his Appellant’s Case for CA 77/2015, under Sec tion B of the 

Appellant’s Case whic h pinpointed issues for the appeal. [note: 27] The appellant’s c laim that these 

points were raised only by way of “bac kground information” [note: 28] was thus plainly untrue. It was undisputed that the appellant did not pursue the arguments arising out of these issues before the Court of Appeal during the November hearing, and also did not seek leave to adduc e fresh evidenc e on these issues. This dec ision also appeared to be a c onsc ious one, rather than one made bec ause of the lac k of time, judging from the appellant c ounsel’s response to the AR at the hearing that had 

leave not been granted to adduc e new evidenc e, there c ould have been an issue of estoppel. [note: 29] 

16     I agreed with the respondent’s submissions that the present c ase falls into the situation 


desc ribed in _The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2015] 5 SLR 1104</span> (“ _TT International_ ”) (at [101]) where a litigant seeks to “argue points whic h were not previously determined by a c ourt or tribunal bec ause they were not brought to the attention of the c ourt or tribunal in the earlier proc eedings even though they ought properly to have been raised and argued then.” The Court of Appeal in _TT International_ noted that the “extended” doc trine of _res judicata_ , also known as abuse of proc ess, would apply in suc h situations; absent spec ial c irc umstanc es, a litigant should not be permitted to argue those points in order that there might be finality in litigation. In this aspec t they also highlighted (at [101]) Sir James Wigram VC’s c omments in _Henderson v Henderson_ (1843) 3 Hare 100; 67 ER 313 that this doc trine applied “not only to points upon whic h the Court was ac tually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounc e a judgment, but to every point whic h properly belonged to the subjec t of litigation, and whic h [the] parties, exerc ising reasonable diligenc e, might have brought forward at the time.” The Court of Appeal in _TT International_ (at [104]) rec ognized that in dealing with situations where the extended doc trine of _res judicata_ applies, the approac h should be a flexible, meritsbased one like that desc ribed in _Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck_ <span class="citation">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453</span>. The c ourt must look at all c irc umstanc es of the c ase, suc h as whether there is fresh evidenc e that might warrant relitigation or whether there are _bona fide_ reasons why a matter was not raised in the earlier proc eedings. 

17     On the fac ts of the c ase, the triable issues that the appellant sought to ventilate were c learly available at the time of the earlier proc eedings, and were in fac t c overed in the Appellant’s Case; this was not fresh evidenc e warranting relitigation. There were no _bona fide_ reasons for not raising them during the hearing before the Court of Appeal; the failure to apply for leave to adduc e new evidenc e was unjustifiable sinc e it was not as though the appellant’s c ounsel had c ome onboard right before the hearing. Even if that were to be the c ase, if the appellant’s position was really that these issues were genuine and should be ventilated, he should have sought an adjournment of the Court of Appeal hearing to prepare an applic ation for leave. As noted earlier, the appellant’s c ounsel’s reason for not applying for leave was that he was too busy and did not have time to do so. In my view, the only plausible inferenc e that I c ould draw from the handling of the matter was that the appellant had no c onfidenc e in the merits of those triable issues and c hose to abandon them on appeal. The appellant failed to raise these issues before the Court of Appeal in CA 77/2015 when he c ould have, and it would be an abuse of proc ess to allow him to try and raise them in the present proc eedings. 

**Conclusion** 

18     There were no merits in the purportedly triable issues raised by the appellant, and more importantly, he should not be allowed to raise them as it would c onstitute an abuse of proc ess. I therefore dismissed the appeal with c osts.
