**Andrew Ang J:** 

**Introduction** 

1       The present c ase arises from interpleader relief sought by the plaintiff, the Singapore branc h of the German bank, West Landesbank (“WestLB”). The subjec t of dispute are c ertain sums of money totalling US$16.8m and £4.2m (“the Funds”) whic h are presently held by Harry Elias Partnership LLP (“HEP”), the c urrent solic itors for the first and tenth defendants, _viz_ , Philippine National Bank (“PNB”) and the Republic of the Philippines (“the Republic ”), in an esc row ac c ount with WestLB. 

2       The Funds were originally part of a pool of assets held in various Swiss bank ac c ounts (“the Swiss Deposits”) by the family and c lose aides of Ferdinand E Marc os (“the Marc oses”). Ferdinand E Marc os was the President of the Republic of the Philippines from 1965 until 1986 when he was overthrown in a bloodless revolution and exiled from the c ountry. It is c ommon knowledge that during his tenure the Marc oses illic itly looted from public c offers to amass a huge personal fortune. These looted assets, valued at approximately US$567m, were parked in various Swiss bank ac c ounts. 

3       In 1998, following a c hain of events involving the Swiss and Philippines authorities (see [13]– [19] below), the Swiss Deposits were released by the Swiss authorities to PNB, to hold as esc row agent. PNB then deposited the Swiss Deposits in various banks in Singapore. These inc luded the Funds whic h were deposited with WestLB. 

4       Pursuant to an order of c ourt dated 24 Marc h 2004, made after the c ommenc ement of the interpleader proc eedings, WestLB was ordered to pay the Funds into an esc row ac c ount established by PNB’s then solic itors, Drew & Napier LLC (“D&N”), for the c redit of these proc eedings. Following a further order of c ourt dated 22 February 2006, the Funds were transferred to an esc row ac c ount held 


in the name of HEP for the c redit of these proc eedings. This remains the c urrent state of affairs, pending the c ourt’s determination of the question of entitlement to the Funds. 

**The parties claiming entitlement to the Funds** 

5       PNB is a bank inc orporated in the Republic of the Philippines with its princ ipal offic e in Manila and branc hes in various c ities inc luding Los Angeles, New York, Honolulu and Singapore. It is jointly represented together with the Republic , whic h was joined as a defendant in May 2006. The c laims by the Republic and PNB rest upon proc eedings involving the Swiss authorities, the Republic and PNB c onc erning the release of the Funds from the Swiss bank ac c ounts (see [24]–[28] below). The Republic and PNB refer to this c hain of events as “the Green Line”, whic h will be desc ribed in greater detail at [13]–[19] below. 

6       The seventh defendants (Plaintiffs in the Estate of Ferdinand E Marc os Human Rights Litigation in Case No MDL840R in the United States Distric t Court for the Distric t of Hawaii) were the plaintiffs in a c lass ac tion human rights litigation whic h was adjudic ated in the United States in _In re The Estate of Ferdinand E Marcos Human Rights Litigation_ , MDL No 840 (D Hawaii) (“the US Human Rights Litigation”). These human rights vic tims (“the HRVs”) c omprise 9,539 c ivilian c itizens of the Republic , their heirs and benefic iaries, who had, between September 1972 and February 1986, suffered human rights abuses, inc luding torture and summary exec utions, during the rule of Ferdinand E Marc os. The HRVs’ c laim to the Funds arises out of enforc ement proc eedings in the US in relation to the US Human Rights Litigation (see [9]–[12] and [29] below). 

7       The sec ond to sixth defendants, _viz_ , Maler Foundation, Avertina Foundation, Palmy Foundation, Vibur Foundation and Aguamina Corporation (c ollec tively “the Foundations”), are the named holders of the Swiss bank ac c ounts whic h originally held the Swiss Deposits before they were released by the Swiss authorities. The sec ond to fifth defendants were foundations established in Vaduz, Liec htenstein, while the sixth defendant was a c orporation inc orporated in Panama. The Foundations’ c laim to the Funds is premised on their status as the original legal owners of the same; they seek to impeac h the other parties’ c laims and argue that, in the event, the Funds must revert bac k to them as original owners (see [31]–[35] below). 

8       There were originally two other defendants to these proc eedings – the eighth defendant, the Estate of Roger Roxas; and the ninth defendant, The Golden Budha Corporation. However, they disc ontinued their c laims in Marc h 2006 and are no longer relevant to these proc eedings. 

**Background facts** 

**_The US proceedings_** 

9       Following the impeac hment of Ferdinand E Marc os, the US Human Rights Litigation was initiated against Ferdinand E Marc os in April 1986 by one Robert A Swift for and on behalf of the HRVs. After Ferdinand E Marc os’ death in September 1989, the Marc os Estate was substituted as the defendant, with Ferdinand E Marc os’ widow and son, _ie_ , Imelda Marc os Ferdinand R Marc os (“Marc os Junior”), as its legal representatives. 

10     In early 1995, the US Distric t Court of Hawaii ruled in favour of the HRVs and entered judgment for in exc ess of US$1.9b against the Marc os Estate (“the US Final Judgment”) ( _Celsa Hilao et al v Estate of Ferdinand E Marcos_ , 910 F Supp 1460 (D Haw 1995) (No 86-0390). These sums were to be paid out of the Foundations’ respec tive Swiss bank ac c ounts, whic h the c ourt found to be the property of the Marc os Estate. The c ourt further imposed a preliminary injunc tion on the Swiss 


Deposits to prevent the Marc os Estate and its agents from transferring or sec reting these away. The US Final Judgment was affirmed in its entirety by the US Court of Appeal in _Maximo Hilao v Estate of Ferdinand Marcos_ , 103 F 3d 767 (9th Cir 1996). 

11     Contempt proc eedings were subsequently initiated against Imelda Marc os and Marc os Junior for violating the above-mentioned injunc tion. By an Order Granting Additional Relief for Contempt dated 13 July 1995 (“the US Contempt Order”), the US Distric t Court of Hawaii ordered the assignment, for the benefit of the HRVs, of all rights, title and interest in the Swiss bank ac c ounts maintained in the names of various members of the Marc os family and their instrumentalities, whic h inc luded the Foundations. It direc ted Imelda Marc os and Marc os Junior to, _inter alia_ , exec ute an assignment of the relevant Swiss Bank ac c ounts to Robert A Swift for the HRVs’ benefit, failing whic h the Clerk of the US Court would be direc ted to exec ute the same on behalf of Imelda Marc os and Marc os Junior. Judge Manuel L Real ordered that: 

2\. All funds on deposit with banks in Switzerland in ac c ounts under [ _inter alia_ , the Foundations] were deposited by or on behalf of Ferdinand E. Marc os, are the property of his Estate, and available to pay [the HRVs] as judgment c reditors ... 

3\. ... 

4\. On or before July 10, 1995 Imelda R. Marc os and [Marc os Junior] shall exec ute an assignment of these bank ac c ounts ... in favour of [the HRVs] for deposit in ac c ordanc e with paragraph 10 of the [US Final Judgment] dated February 3, 1995, and deliver the same to [Robert A Swift]. 

5\. ... 

 6. In the event Imelda R. Marcos and [Marcos Junior] fail or refuse to execute the attached assignment, the Clerk of the Court is directed to execute the same on their behalf and deliver the same to [Robert A Swift]. 

 [emphasis added] 

12     The assignment was not exec uted by the legal representatives of the Marc os Estate. Consequently, on 14 July 1995, a deed of assignment of “all right, title and interest in and to bank ac c ounts maintained in Switzerland in the names of”, _inter alia_ , the Foundations, was exec uted by the Clerk of the United States Distric t Court for the Distric t of Hawaii (“Hawaii Distric t Court”), Walter A Y Chinn, on behalf of the Marc os Estate (“the Chinn Assignment”). The Chinn Assignment read as follows: 

 Assignment made this 14th day of July, 1995 on behalf of [the Marc os Estate] to [Robert A Swift] in the Estate of Ferdinand E. Marcos Human Rights Litigation , MDL No. 840. 

 The undersigned assign all right, title and interest in and to bank ac c ounts maintained in Switzerland in the names of: 

 [ inter alia , The Foundations] 

 to Robert A Swift ... for the benefit of [the HRVs] in the Estate of Ferdinand E. Marcos Human Rights Litigation , MDL No. 840 (D. Hawaii). All persons ac ting in the c apac ity or title of c ustodians, offic ers, direc tors or trustees of entities having authority over the above bank 


 ac c ounts are direc ted to perform all nec essary ac ts to effec t the transfer of the above bank ac c ounts forthwith. 

This Chinn Assignment forms the c hief basis of the HRVs’ c laimed entitlement to the Funds (see [29]– [30] below). 

**_The Swiss proceedings_** 

_The first request for international mutual assistance_ 

13     After Ferdinand E Marc os’ impeac hment, the Republic had slowly begun its efforts to rec over the Swiss Deposits. On 7 April 1986, it lodged a formal request for assistanc e from the Swiss authorities to loc ate and identify the ill-gotten assets of the Marc oses whic h had been deposited in Switzerland. The request was made pursuant to the Swiss Federal Ac t on International Mutual Assistanc e in Criminal Matters (20 Marc h 1981) (“IMAC”) whic h empowers the Swiss authorities to seize and forfeit the proc eeds of c riminal ac ts whic h are within Switzerland. 

14     Pursuant to the proc edures under IMAC, the Republic ’s request was proc essed by the Swiss Federal Offic e for Polic e Matters and forwarded to the c ompetent c antonal judic ial authorities for exec ution. After investigations, the magistrates of the Swiss c antons issued freezing orders against the Swiss Deposits (“the Swiss freeze orders”). By a dec ision dated 21 Dec ember 1990, _Swiss Federal Court Decision_ , IA 77, 79-84, 1990, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court upheld these freezing orders and gave direc tions for the in-princ iple transmission of the Swiss Deposits to the Republic. The Swiss Federal Supreme Court held that the ac tual transfer would be deferred until presentation of a dec ision by a Philippine c ourt legally c ompetent in c riminal matters: 

 2(b) The remittanc e to the requesting State of the assets bloc ked in Fribourg is in princ iple granted, their transfer however being deferred until an executory decision in the Sandiganbayan or another Philippine tribunal legally competent in criminal matters to pronounce on their restitution to those entitled or their confiscation. The proc eeding opened to these ends must c ommenc e within a maximum of one year from the pronounc ement of the present dec ision, failing whic h the seizure of the assets shall be lifted on the request of the interest parties. This proc eeding shall moreover satisfy the requirements of Artic les 4 and 58 Cst and Artic le 6 CEDH. 

 Before ordering enforc ement of a judgment of restitution to those entitled or of c onfisc ation the authorities of the requested State must examine if this judgment has been rendered as a result of a proc edure meeting the requirements -rec alled above -and if, by its c ontents, is [ sic ] c onforms to Swiss public polic y. 

 [emphasis added] 

15     Subsequently, on 17 Dec ember 1991, the Republic filed a Petition for Forfeiture before the Sandiganbayan, a spec ial c ourt in the Philippines having jurisdic tion over both c riminal and c ivil c ases involving graft, c orrupt prac tic es and other offenc es c ommitted by public offic ers in relation to their offic e. The Petition was made pursuant to Republic Ac t 1379 (“RA 1379”), a statute dec laring forfeiture in favour of the Republic any property found to have been unlawfully ac quired by a public offic er and in c onjunc tion with Exec utive Order Nos 1, 2, 14 and 14A. The defendants to the writ of petition were Ferdinand E Marc os, represented by his estate (“the Marc os Estate”) and Imelda Marc os. For c onvenienc e, these proc eedings will be referred to as “the forfeiture proc eedings”. 

_The second request for international mutual assistance_ 


16     In August 1995, the Republic filed a sec ond request with the Zuric h Distric t Attorney for the early transfer of the Swiss Deposits into an esc row ac c ount with PNB in advanc e of a final and binding dec ision of the Philippine Courts in relation to the entitlement to the Swiss Deposits. On 21 August 1995, the Zuric h Distric t Attorney granted the request for the transfer of the Swiss Deposits to PNB as the Republic ’s esc row agent, subjec t to the terms of c ertain esc row agreements (“the Esc row Agreements”) whic h were signed on 10 August 1995 between the PNB and the President Commission of Good Government (“PCGG”), whic h was established to assist in the rec overy of the allegedly looted public funds. Under the Esc row Agreements, PNB undertook not to dispose of the Swiss Deposits other than in ac c ordanc e with the following: 

 (a) a final and enforc eable judgment of the Sandiganbayan or any other c ompetent c ourt in the Philippines; 

 (b) written and identic al instruc tions from both the relevant Foundation and the PCGG; or 

 (c ) instruc tions rec eived from the PCGG as approved in princ iple by the Marc os Estate’s representatives. 

17     The orders of the Zuric h Distric t Attorney were affirmed by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court on 10 Dec ember 1997, subjec t to two additional requirements, _Swiss Federal Court Decision_ , 123 II 595, 

1997\. First, the Republic had to undertake to brief the Swiss authorities regularly on the judic ial c onfisc ation and repayment proc eedings as well as on the prec autions and proc edure pertaining to the c ompensation for the HRVs. Sec ond, and more signific antly, the Republic had to provide an assuranc e that the c onfisc ation or repayment of the assets in question would be handled through judic ial proc eedings that c omplied with the princ iples established in Art 14 of the International Civil and Politic al Rights Pac t (“Art 14”), whic h provides that: 

 All persons shall be equal before the c ourts and tribunals. In the determination of any c riminal c harge against him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a c ompetent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law. ... 

In this c onnec tion, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court held (at [5(bb)]) that: 

 The rec ords show that the rights of defense in the proc eedings against Imelda Marc os and her c hildren are in fac t being warranted; the defendants were allowed to defend themselves at length and have used their proc ess rights extensively. On the other hand, [the Foundations], formally the owner of the assets to be seized or restituted, has not been involved in the c ollec ting proc edure pending in the Philippines. Even though such opponent is nothing but a legal construction to hide the true ownership of the assets of the Marcos family , they nevertheless are entitled to a hearing as far as the proceedings are concerned with accounts which are nominally theirs. The guarantees of [the Republic ] therefore must inc lude the proc ess rights not only of the defendants but also the formal owners of the assets to be delivered. ... [emphasis added] 

18     Between April and July 1998, the Republic supplied the guarantees required and the Swiss authorities released the Swiss Deposits to PNB to hold as esc row agent. The Esc row Agreements empowered PNB to invest the Swiss Deposits in the money market or in sec urities, provided the relevant debtor or c ompany had a Standard & Poor’s rating of at least “AA”. The Swiss Deposits were ac c ordingly deposited in various banks, inc luding the Funds, whic h c ame to be deposited in WestLB. 

**_The Philippine proceedings_** 


19     The forfeiture proc eedings c ulminated in a judgment dated 15 July 2003 (“the Forfeiture Judgment”) by whic h the Philippines Supreme Court ordered the Swiss Deposits held in esc row by PNB to be forfeited in favour of the PCGG, _Republic of the Philippines v Sandiganbayan_ (GR No 152154) (July 15, 2003). The Philippines Supreme Court held that it did not matter that the Foundations were not made parties to the forfeiture proc eedings: 

 Respondent [Imelda Marc os] argues that [the Foundations] should have been impleaded as they were indispensable parties without whom no c omplete determination of the issues c ould be made. She asserts that ... the non-inc lusion of the foreign foundations violated the c onditions presc ribed by the Swiss government regarding the deposit of the funds in esc row, deprived them of their day in c ourt and denied them their rights under the Swiss c onstitution and international law. 

 The Court finds that petitioner Republic did not err in not impleading [the Foundations] ... 

 ... there was an admission by respondent Imelda Marc os ... that she was the sole benefic iary of 90% of the subjec t matter in c ontroversy with the remaining 10% belonging to the estate of Ferdinand Marc os. Viewed against this admission, [the Foundations] were not indispensable parties. Their non-participation in the proceedings did not prevent the court from deciding the case on its merits and according full relief to petitioner Republic. The judgment ordering the return of the $356 million was neither inimic al to [the Foundations’] interests nor inc onsistent with equity and good c onsc ienc e. The admission of respondent Imelda Marc os only c onfirmed what was already generally known: that [the Foundations] were established prec isely to hide the money stolen by the Marc os spouses from petitioner Republic. It negated whatever illusion there was, if any, that [the Foundations] owned even a nominal part of the assets in question. 

 The rulings of the Swiss court that [the Foundations], as formal owners, must be given an opportunity to participate in the proceedings hinged on the assumption that they owned a nominal share of the assets. But this was already refuted by no less than [Imelda Marcos] herself. ... But inasmuch as their ownership was subsequently repudiated by Imelda Marcos, they could no longer be considered as indispensable parties and their participation in the proceedings became unnecessary. 

 [emphasis added] 

20     The release of the Forfeiture Judgment was followed by a press release by the Swiss Federal Offic e of Justic e, issued on 5 August 2003, announc ing, _inter alia_ , that: 

 (a) the guarantees given by the Republic were satisfac tory; 

 (b) the Forfeiture Judgment c onfirmed the view of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court with regard to the c riminal origin of the moneys seized; 

 (c ) the Philippines government c ould dispose of the Swiss Deposits; and 

 (d) no further dec isions on this issue were due on the part of the Swiss authorities. 

21     Motions were subsequently made to the Philippines Supreme Court by the Marc os Estate, Imelda Marc os and Marc os Junior seeking rec onsideration of the Forfeiture Judgment. The Forfeiture Judgment was rec onsidered and affirmed by the Philippines Supreme Court in its Resolution of 18 November 2003 (“the Forfeiture Resolution”) (GR No 152154 (18 November 2003)). In rejec ting the 


applic ants’ argument that the summary nature of the forfeiture proc eedings, whic h they argued was penal in nature, violated their due proc ess rights as ac c used persons under RA 1379, Renato C Corona J held as follows (at pp 10–11): 

 A c areful study of the provisions of RA 1379 readily disc loses that the forfeiture proc eedings ... did not violate the substantive rights of respondent Marc oses. These proceedings are civil in nature, contrary to the claim of the Marcoses that it is penal in character. 

 ... 

 The proc eedings under RA 1379 do not terminate in the imposition of a penalty but merely in the forfeiture of the properties illegally ac quired in favor [ sic ] of the State. ... 

 The procedure outlined in the law leading to forfeiture is that provided for in a civil action : ... 

 [emphasis added] 

Corona J went on to hold in the Forfeiture Resolution as follows (at pp 18–19): 

 Respondent Imelda R. Marc os ... asserts that the fac tual findings that [the Foundations] involved in the instant forfeiture proc eedings were businesses managed by her and [Ferdinand E Marc os] will adversely affec t the c riminal proc eedings filed by the Republic against her. The c ontention is bereft of merit. The criminal cases referred to ... are actions in personam, directed against her on the basis of her personal liability. In c riminal c ases, the law imposes the burden of proving guilt on the prosec ution beyond reasonable doubt, and the trial judge in evaluating the evidenc e must find that all the elements of the c rime c harged have been established by suffic ient proof to c onvic t. 

 But a forfeiture proceeding is an action in rem, against the thing itself instead of against the person. Being c ivil in c harac ter, it requires no more than a preponderanc e of evidenc e. ... Henc e, the fac tual findings of this Court in [the Forfeiture Judgment] will, as a c onsequenc e, neither affec t nor do away with the requirement of having to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt in the c riminal c ases against her. 

 [emphasis added] 

**_Demands made on the Funds_** 

22     Pursuant to the Forfeiture Judgment, PNB proc ured the repayment of parts of the Swiss deposits from the various banks in Singapore with whom it had deposited the same. In this c onnec tion, PNB instruc ted WestLB to repay the Funds to PNB as and when the deposits matured. WestLB, however, would not release the Funds, in light of the HRV’s c ompeting c laim made known to WestLB on 8 September 2003. The Foundations also subsequently lodged their c ompeting c laims against the Funds. 

23     As mentioned at [4] above, the Funds were subsequently held in an esc row ac c ount by D&N for the c redit of these proc eedings before being transferred into an esc row ac c ount held in the name of HEP for the same purpose. This remains the c urrent state of affairs, pending the c ourt’s determination of the question of entitlement to the Funds. 

**Overview of the competing claims** 


**_The Republic’s case_** 

24     Counsel for the Republic and PNB, Mr Harry Elias SC (“Mr Elias”), argues that the Green Line, as desc ribed at [13]–[19] above, enc apsulates the c ompleted proc edure adopted by the Swiss and Philippines authorities pursuant to the IMAC for the rec overy of the ill-gotten gains of the Marc oses and subsequent determination of the entitlement to the Funds, _ie_ , as long as this c ourt finds that the Forfeiture Judgment c omplied with the terms of the Swiss orders and c onditions set out in the Esc row Agreements, it must also c onc lude that the Republic is entitled to the Funds. 

25     Ac c ording to Mr Elias, any other order would defeat the ac ts of the Swiss and Philippines authorities in the rec overy of the ill-gotten gains of the Marc oses. He seeks to invoke the ac t of state doc trine by pointing out that the Funds were deposited in WestLB pursuant to the Swiss orders, whic h pertained to the mutual assistanc e measures adopted by two sovereigns for the determination of the entitlement to the Funds by the Philippines Supreme Court, whic h determination has been ac c epted by the Swiss authorities. As suc h, Mr Elias argues that a finding by this c ourt on the title to the Funds must nec essarily involve a finding on whether the IMAC proc ess had been c omplied with, so as to render the doc trine applic able. 

26     In response, the Foundations and the HRVs seek to c irc umvent this “Green Line argument” by c harac terising the Republic ’s c laim as, in essenc e, an attempt to enforc e the Forfeiture Judgment in the Singapore c ourts. In this c onnec tion, they argue that (a) the Forfeiture Judgment is a judgment _in personam_ , and is therefore not c apable of binding them; and (b) the Forfeiture Judgment is penal in nature and therefore c annot be enforc ed in Singapore. 

27     Mr Elias disagrees that the Forfeiture Judgment should be viewed in isolation from the Green Line. In any event, he submits that (a) the Forfeiture Judgment is a judgment _in rem_ ; and (b) the Forfeiture Judgment is _not_ penal in nature as it merely restores ownership of the Swiss Deposits to the rightful owner, _ie_ , the Republic. Mr Elias also emphasises that the question of the penal nature of the Forfeiture Judgment does not arise as the Republic is not seeking to enforc e a c laim against the Funds as judgment c reditor but is merely requiring this c ourt to rec ognise the Forfeiture Judgment. 

**_PNB’s case_** 

28     On behalf of PNB, Mr Elias argues that even if the Green Line fails to establish the Republic ’s entitlement to the Funds, PNB would retain the same as esc row agent. Mr Elias argues that as esc row agent PNB had legal title to the Funds and still retains it through HEP. It is thus entitled to immediate repayment of them as and when the deposits mature. 

**_The HRVs’ case_** 

29     The HRVs rely on the Chinn Assignment to establish their purported benefic ial entitlement to the Funds arguing, through their c ounsel, Mr Kenneth Tan SC (“Mr Tan”), that the Chinn Assignment was effec tive under US law to transfer to the HRVs all rights, title and interest in the Funds held by the Foundations. In this c onnec tion, Mr Tan argues that the US c ourt was legitimately exerc ising _in personam_ jurisdic tion over the Marc os Estate by making the direc tions under the US Contempt Order and the Chinn Assignment. He points out that the US c ourt found that the Foundations were the instrumentalities of the Marc oses, arguing that the Foundations were therefore before the US c ourt, _ie_ , the Assignment thus bound the Foundations and the HRVs. Mr Tan argues that the HRVs’ title to the Funds as c onferred by the Chinn Assignment c annot be defeated by the Republic ’s c laim based on the subsequent Forfeiture Judgment, whic h Mr Tan argues is _in personam_ in nature. 


30     Further, Mr Tan argues that the expiration of the US Final Judgment as of February 2005, whic h is undisputed, has no bearing upon the HRVs’ c laim. First, he argues that the Chinn Assignment transferred the Foundations’ rights, title and interest in the Funds to the HRVs _at the time of its execution_. The HRVs’ interest in the Funds is thus unaffec ted by the subsequent expiration of the US Final Judgment. Sec ond, the US Final Judgment had (following its lapse in Hawaii) been registered in, _inter alia_ , California, New York, Illinois and Texas. Mr Tan argues that eac h registration of the US Final Judgment in another state c reated a new judgment c apable of being exec uted upon beyond February 

2005\. Mr Elias and the Foundations’ c ounsel, Mr Rethnam Chandra Mohan (“Mr Mohan”), disagree. Relying on the evidenc e of the US law experts, Margery Bronster (“Ms Bronster”) for the Republic and PNB, and Professor Ric hard M Buxbaum (“Prof Buxbaum”) for the Foundations, Mr Elias and Mr Mohan argue that the Chinn Assignment, whic h was a mode of enforc ement of the US Final Judgment, bec ame unenforc eable when the US Final Judgment expired in February 2005. For ease of referenc e, I shall refer to this as “the Re-registration issue”. 

**_The Foundations’ case_** 

31     The basis for the Foundations’ c laim to the Funds is fairly straightforward. Mr Mohan argues that sinc e it is undisputed that the Funds originally belonged to the Foundations, as long as the Foundations c an demolish the c laims by PNB, the Republic and the HRVs, the Funds must nec essarily revert to the Foundations as the original owners of the Funds. 

32     Mr Mohan argues that PNB, as esc row agent, was a mere c ustodian of the Funds until a c ompetent c ourt dec ides on the ownership, and had lost any title to the Funds when the Funds were interpleaded. He emphasised that PNB was merely a c onduit to c hannel the Funds to the rightful party and that its role bec ame superfluous when the Funds c ame to be held in esc row by HEP. Contrary to PNB’s position, Mr Mohan argues that HEP does not hold the Funds on behalf of PNB, but only holds the Funds for the c redit of these interpleader proc eedings as an administrative measure. 

33     Mr Mohan also argues that the Republic has no c laim to the Funds. As mentioned at [26] above, it is the Foundations’ c ase that they c annot be bound by the Forfeiture Judgment sinc e it was a judgment _in personam_ arising from the forfeiture proc eedings to whic h the Foundations were not parties. Mr Mohan also emphasises that the Republic failed to exec ute the guarantee it supplied to the Swiss authorities that it would involve the Foundations in the Forfeiture Proc eedings and so c annot now purport to bind them by finding that they were the _alter egos_ of the Marc oses. Further, Mr Mohan argues that the Forfeiture Judgment c annot, in any event, be rec ognised or enforc ed in Singapore as it is penal in nature. 

34     Mr Mohan argues that the HRVs’ c laim also fails. First, he argues that the US Final Judgment binds the HRVs and the Marc os Estate but c annot bind the Foundations, whic h were not party to the US Human Rights Litigation. Sec ond, the Chinn Assignment was an invalid mode of enforc ing a judgment under Hawaiian Law and so failed to pass title to the HRVs. Third, even if the Chinn Assignment was valid under Hawaiian law, it was extinguished when the US Final Judgment expired as of 3 February 2005. Fourth, the Chinn Assignment also failed to pass title to the HRVs under Swiss law, sinc e the Funds were at the material times subjec t to the Swiss freeze orders barring the Foundations from dealing with them. 

35     In light of the foregoing, Mr Mohan argues that title to the Funds must revert to the Foundations, whic h were the original ac c ount holders of the Swiss Deposits. 

**The issues** 


36     The c ompeting c laims raise interesting and c omplex questions of private international law and may be distilled as follows: 

 (a) In relation to the Republic ’s c laim, whic h rests c hiefly upon the Green Line c ulminating in the Forfeiture Judgment:

**Analysis of the Republic’s claim** 

**_(1) Whether the act of state doctrine applies in support of the Republic’s Green Line argument_** 

37     As mentioned (at [24]–[25] above), Mr Elias relies on the ac t of state doc trine to assert the propriety and purported unassailability of the events c onstituting the Green Line. He submits that the Swiss freeze orders, the in-princ iple grant of the transmission of the Swiss Deposits to the Republic , the delegation of the determination of title to the Philippines c ourts, the subsequent transfer of the Swiss Deposits to Singapore and the Forfeiture Judgment forfeiting the Funds to the Republic were all ac ts of state falling squarely within the ac t of state doc trine. The upshot is that these listed ac ts must be deemed valid and unassailable by this c ourt, _ie_ , the Green Line remains intac t and had validly vested the Republic with the title to the Funds. 

38     Despite the appealing simplic ity of the Green Line argument, however, it is fundamentally flawed in its assumption that the ac t of state doc trine applies in aid of the Republic ’s c laim. The ac t of state doc trine immunises from judic ial review the sovereign ac ts of a foreign state, whic h are automatic ally non-justic iable by reason of their sovereign nature. Where the doc trine applies, the forum c ourt will refrain from adjudic ating upon the propriety of the _legislative or executive acts_ of a rec ognised foreign state within the limits of its own territory (Ric hard Fentiman, _International Commercial Litigation_ (Oxford University Press, 2010) at paras 10.06 and 10.09; and Dic ey, Morris & Collins, _The Conflict of Laws_ , vol 1 (Sweet & Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006) (“ _Dicey, Morris & Collins_ , _vol 1_ ”) at paras 5– 041 and 5–043). In what was probably the earliest formulation of the modern ac t of state doc trine, Chief Justic e Fuller of the US Supreme Court held in _Underhill v Hernandez_ 168 US 250 (1897) that: 

 Every sovereign state is bound to respec t the independenc e of every other sovereign state, and the c ourts of one c ountry will not sit in judgment on the ac ts of the government of another done within its own territory. Redress of grievanc es by reason of suc h ac ts must be obtained through the means open to be availed of by sovereign powers as between themselves. 


39     The doc trine limits, for prudential rather than jurisdic tional, reasons, the forum c ourt from inquiring into the validity of a rec ognised foreign sovereign’s public ac ts c ommitted within the latter’s own territory ( _Honduras Aircraft Registry Ltd v Government of Honduras_ 131 F.3d 157 (11th Cir, 1997)). As suc h, it is separate and distinc t from the doc trine of sovereign immunity (David Epstein & Charles S Baldwin, IV, _International Litigation: A Guide to Jurisdiction, Practice and Strategy_ (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 4th Rev Ed, 2010) (“ _Epstein & Baldwin_ ”) at p 292). 

40     Suc h restraint stemmed from the judic ial rec ognition that c ertain disputes involving foreign sovereigns are not appropriately c onsidered by the c ourts ( _Epstein & Baldwin_ at pp 278, 281–282). As was observed in _Banco Nacional de Cuba v Peter L F Sabbatino_ 376 US 398 (1964) at 423: 

 The ac t of state doc trine ... arises out of the basic relationships between branc hes of government in a system of separation of powers. It c onc erns the c ompetenc y of dissimilar institutions to make and implement partic ular kinds of dec isions in the area of international relations. The doctrine as formulated in past decisions expresses the strong sense of the Judicial Branch that its engagement in the task of passing on the validity of foreign acts of state may hinder rather than further this country’s pursuit of goals both for itself and for the community of nations as a whole in the international sphere. ... [emphasis added] 

41     In _Underhill v Hernandez_ , the defendant was a general in c ommand of a revolutionary army in Venezuela whic h had seized the c ity Bolivar where the plaintiff, an Americ an c itizen, was resident. The plaintiff had c onstruc ted a waterworks system for Bolivar under a c ontrac t with the defeated government and also ran a mac hinery repair business. When he applied for a passport to leave the c ity, this was refused by the defendant who wished that the former would operate his waterworks and repair works for the benefit of the c ommunity and revolutionary forc es. When the plaintiff was finally allowed to return to the US, he c ommenc ed proc eedings in the Circ uit Courts to rec over damages c aused by, _inter alia_ , the defendant’s refusal to grant him a passport, his alleged c onfinement in his own house and for alleged assaults and affronts by the defendant’s subordinates. On appeal, Chief Justic e Fuller dec lined a dec ision on the merits. The revolutionary government under whic h the defendant was ac ting had sinc e been rec ognised by the US as the legitimate government of Venezuela. The defendant’s ac ts were thus the ac ts of the government of Venezuela and, as suc h, were not properly the subjec t of adjudic ation in the c ourts of another c ountry ( _Underhill v Hernandez_ at 254). 

42     For the ac t of state doc trine to apply, the “ac t” in question must be a public governmental ac t and the subjec t-matter of the ac t must be loc ated within the foreign sovereign’s territory at the material time ( _Epstein & Baldwin_ at pp 279, 289). Further, there must exist a “fac tual predic ate” for the doc trine to apply, _ie_ , ac t of state issues only arise when the outc ome of the c ase turns upon the effec t of offic ial ac tion by a foreign sovereign ( _W S Kirkpatrick & Co, Inc, et al v Environmental Tectonics Corporation, International_ 439 US 400 (1990) at 406). 

43     Turning to the present fac ts, the Green Line argument based on the ac t of state doc trine appears to be a red herring. First, the c hallenge mounted by the HRVs and the Foundations against the Republic ’s c ase is that _the Forfeiture Judgment_ did not validly vest in the Republic an entitlement to the Funds. The Forfeiture Judgment, whic h was rendered by the Philippines Supreme Court, was not a legislative or exec utive ac t to whic h the ac t of state doc trine applies. Sec ond, and more importantly, there is no issue arising for determination by this c ourt as to the propriety of any foreign sovereign ac t. A c lose examination of the c laims by the HRVs and the Foundations shows that neither c ontains a c hallenge as to the legitimac y of the Swiss freeze orders, the in-princ iple grant of the transmission of the Swiss Deposits to the Republic , the delegation of the determination of title to the Philippines c ourts and the subsequent transfer of the Swiss Deposits to Singapore. The ac t of state 


doc trine would have been relevant and of aid to the Republic had the c hallenge against its c ase been in relation to these listed ac ts. As this is not the c ase, the Republic ’s relianc e on the ac t of state doc trine appears somewhat misplac ed. 

44     As stated, the c rux of the dispute in relation to the Republic ’s entitlement to the Funds c entred on the legal _effect_ of the Forfeiture Judgment, _viz_ , whether it passed benefic ial title to the Republic , whic h would in turn depend upon whether the Forfeiture Judgment is _in personam_ and penal in nature, as the HRVs and the Foundations assert. Given the foregoing, the ac t of state doc trine does not apply in this c ase. 

**_(2) Whether the Forfeiture Judgment is an in rem judgment and, if so, whether the Philippines court had jurisdiction to issue such a judgment_** 

45     It is the HRVs’ and the Foundations’ c ase that the Forfeiture Judgment is a judgment _in personam_ whic h only binds parties to the forfeiture proc eedings, _ie_ , the Republic and the Marc oses. In response, Mr Elias argues that the Forfeiture Judgment is a judgment _in rem_ , drawing support from the Philippines Supreme Court’s statement in its Forfeiture Resolution that RA 1379 proc eedings were _in rem_ (see [21] above). After a c lose examination of the relevant authorities and the fac ts before me, I am of the view that the Forfeiture Judgment is by nature _in rem_. However, for reasons stated at [63]–[65] below, this c ourt nevertheless is unable to grant rec ognition to the Forfeiture Judgment. 

_Whether the Forfeiture Judgment is an in rem judgment_ 

The law 

46     A judgment _in rem_ determines the status of a thing or person and is binding on the world. By c ontrast, a judgment _in personam_ binds only parties to the proc eedings (Adrian Briggs & Peter Rees, QC, _Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments_ (Informa, 5th Ed, 2009) (“ _Briggs & Rees_ ”) at paras 7.44 and 7. and _Pattni v Ali and anor_ [2007] 2 AC 85 (“ _Pattni_ ”) at [21]). For example, while a divorc e dec ree may be a judgment _in rem_ in so far as it determines the status of the parties, an anc illary order dec laring the interests of those parties to the matrimonial assets binds only the parties personally and is a judgment _in personam_ ( _Murakami Takako (executrix of the estate of Takashi Murakami Suroso, deceased) v Wiryadi Louise Maria_ <span class="citation">[2007] 4 SLR(R) 565</span> (“ _Murakami Takako_ ”) at [33]). 

47     In determining whether a foreign judgment is _in rem_ or _in personam_ , it is not relevant whether the foreign c ourt rec ognises these c onc epts. The forum c ourt will have to undertake this inquiry independently, c onsidering the _nature_ of the proc eedings c ulminating in the foreign judgment, the _substance_ of the judgment and the _intended effect_ of the order on the parties to the proc eedings _(Murakami Takako_ at [30]). In _Pattni_ , for example, the English c ourt held that a Kenyan judgment ordering the respondents to transfer c ertain shares to the appellant “as per the said sale and purc hase agreement” was a c lassic order _in personam_ for spec ific performanc e, following an examination of the aim and intended effec t of the Kenyan judgment. Lord Manc e held ( _Pattni_ at [28]– [35]): 

 28 ... Whatever else might be in doubt about the c ourse of the Kenyan proc eedings, it is c lear that they involved c ontrac tual issues between parties to the proc eedings ... 

 29 ... The obvious aim and effect of [the Kenyan] orders was to establish and give effect to their rights inter se with regard to such shares and affairs. If some third party emerged subsequent to the Kenyan judgment and dec ree, and c laimed that Mr Pattni had, prior to 27 September 2001, agreed to on-sell the World Duty shares to him, nothing in the Kenya judgment 


 and decree could, or could have been intended to, preclude the third party from showing this. ... The Kenyan judgment and dec ree do not c onstitute or involve any form of adjudic ation or purported adjudic ation in rem relating to the shares in World Duty. Nor were the Kenyan judgment and order even purporting actually to transfer or deal with the shares, as opposed to determining the parties’ rights and duties relating to them. ... 

 30 ... It is ... a classic order in personam for specific performance in terms reflecting and predicating the judge’s findings of an agreement for sale and of its breach ... 

 ... 

 35 The suggestion ... that the Kenyan judgment purported to pass legal title to the shares has no foundation. ... the transfer of legal title to the shares would depend upon alteration of the shareholder’s identity in World Duty’s register of members kept in the Isle of Man. The Kenyan judgment did not purport to make any suc h alteration, but merely to order Mr Ali and Dinky to effec t a transfer. ... The judge was simply ordering that Mr Ali and Dinky give effect to his findings of an agreement and its breach by specifically performing their consequential obligations to transfer their shares to Mr Pattni. 

 [emphasis added] 

Lord Manc e emphasised that a judgment _in rem_ must relate to the status or disposition of property whic h is to be valid as against the whole world; the mere fac t that a judic ial determination relates to the existenc e of property rights between parties does not in itself mean that it is _in rem_ ( _Pattni_ at [23]). 

48     In another English dec ision, _Louis Castrique v William Imrie and anor_ (1869–1870) LR 4 HL 414 (“ _Castrique_ ”), the House of Lords examined the nature and effec t of c ertain Frenc h proc eedings before c onc luding that they were _in rem_. In that c ase, the original owner of the ship, one Claus, exec uted a mortgage of the ship in favour of one Harrison in November 1854. The mortgage was transferred to one Emley, who registered himself as the ship owner, and subsequently to one Castrique in April 1855. As Castrique only registered himself as owner in April 1857, Emley remained the owner under English law as of April 1855. In the interim, the ship embarked upon a voyage during whic h it stopped by in Melbourne to be repaired and furnished with nec essities. The c aptain Benson drew a bill on Claus for the amount due (“the Melbourne Bill”). 

49     The ship entered a Frenc h port on 4 May 1855. While it was there, Claus bec ame bankrupt and, in the meantime, the Melbourne Bill was indorsed to Frenc h subjec ts, who c ommenc ed a suit in the Tribunal de Commerc e in Franc e against Benson on the bill. Benson appeared but did not defend the suit. On 15 May 1855, judgment was entered against Benson (“the Frenc h judgment”) dec laring the debt “privileged on the ship”, _ie_ , having priority over others. The Frenc h authorities seized the ship pursuant to the Frenc h judgment. However, before it c ould be sold, the Tribunal de Commerc e’s judgment had to be ratified by the Frenc h Civil Tribunal whic h would first hear the ship owners. Although Claus and Benson rec eived notic es to appear before the Frenc h Civil Tribunal, they did not appear, and the judgment was c onfirmed and the ship’s sale ordered. When Castrique subsequently bec ame aware of those proc eedings, he c ommenc ed a suit in the Frenc h Civil Tribunal to replevy the ship, but was unsuc c essful. When the ship finally arrived in England, he demanded possession of it and brought a suit in an English c ourt to rec over it on the ground that the sale in Franc e was illegal and void as against his earlier title. 

50     The dec ision in _Castrique_ turned upon the nature of the Frenc h judgment; if the Frenc h 


judgment was _in rem_ , Castrique would fail in his c laim sinc e the ship was in Franc e at the time of the Frenc h proc eedings, _ie_ , the Frenc h _in rem_ judgment would bind the world, inc luding Castrique. On the other hand, the Frenc h judgment would not bind Castrique if it was _in personam_ , given that Castrique was absent from the Frenc h proc eedings. 

51     The distinc tion between judgments _in rem_ and _in personam_ was explained in some detail by Blac kburn J. If the c ourt ordered a litigant’s property to be sold in exec ution of a judgment against that litigant, there was nothing to prevent any third party from setting up his c laim to that property bec ause the tribunal neither had jurisdic tion to determine, nor did it determine, anything more than that the litigant’s property should be sold, and did not do more than to sell the litigant’s interest, if any, in the thing ( _Castrique_ at 427–428). The c ase was, however, different when the tribunal had jurisdic tion to determine not merely the rights of the parties but also the disposition of the thing, and did in the exerc ise of that jurisdic tion direc t that the thing, and not merely the interest of any partic ular party in it, be sold or transferred ( _Castrique_ at 428). Blac kburn J held ( _Castrique_ at 428– 430): 

 In Story on the Conflic t of Laws, it is said that the princ iple that the judgment is c onc lusive “is applied to all proc eedings in rem as to moveable property within the jurisdic tion of the Court pronounc ing the judgment. Whatever it settles as to the right or title, or whatever disposition it makes of the property by sale, revendic ation, transfer, or other ac t, will be held valid in every other c ountry where the question c omes direc tly or indirec tly in judgment before any other foreign tribunal. This is very familiarly known in the c ases of proc eedings in rem in foreign Courts of Admiralty, whether they be c auses of prize or bottomry, or salvage or forfeiture, of whic h suc h Courts have a rightful jurisdic tion founded in the actual or constructive possession of the subject matter .” 

 We may observe that the words as to an ac tion being in rem or in personam , and the c ommon statement that the one is binding on third persons and the other not, are apt to be used by English lawyers without attac hing any very definite meaning to those phrases. We apprehend the true princ iple to be that indic ated in the last few words quoted from Story. We think the inquiry is, first, whether the subject matter was so situated as to be within the lawful control of the state under the authority of which the Court sits; and, secondly, whether the sovereign authority of that State has conferred on the Court jurisdiction to decide as to the disposition of the thing, and the Court has acted within its jurisdiction. If these conditions are fulfilled, the adjudication is conclusive against the world. 

 ... The ship ... was in France , and if the transfer of the ship in c onsequenc e of the dec ree of the Frenc h Court was in France good against all the world, it c ould only be so on the ground that the judgment of the Frenc h Court was, ac c ording to the Frenc h law, a judgment in rem transferring the ship itself, and not merely the interest, if any, of Claus in the ship. 

 The first question ... is one of fact, namely, what was the nature of the proceeding before the Tribunal de Commerce at Havre, and what was the meaning and effect of the judgment on the 15th of May, 1855, pronounced against Benson. ... 

 [emphasis in original in italic s; emphasis added in bold italic s] 

52     In c onc luding that the Frenc h judgment was _in rem_ in nature, Blac kburn J held ( _Castrique_ at 432): 

 ... If the Tribunal of Commerce was merely awarding execution against the ship as far as it was 


 a debtor’s property, it was irrelevant and premature to say whether that debt would have priority of payment or not. ... And the subsequent proc eedings in the Civil Tribunal, ... seem to be very like the proc eedings in the Court of Admiralty after the ship is libelled. All those who had any claim on the ship ... were summoned to appear, and they having made default, a judgment was pronounced, not, as it appears to us, against them personally, but that the seizure of the ship should be confirmed, and that it should be sold; and notice of this judgment was served on Claus’ assignee in bankruptcy, who had thereby another opportunity given him to oppose the sale of the ship. 

 We c an, therefore, c ome to no other c onc lusion of fac t, than that this proc eeding has been c orrec tly stated to be a proc eeding against the ship. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

Lord Hatherley also c onc luded that the Frenc h judgment was a judgment _in rem_ ( _Castrique_ at 443– 445): 

 ... I think that it would be very difficult to say that a proceeding in rem was not one of the matters contemplated in the original judgment. ... 

 ... regard being had to the original proc eeding, being a proc eeding against Benson and the ship, and Benson himself being exc luded from any personal liability, and the judgment against him being by privilege upon the ship, it does appear to me that the word “privilege,” as used here, is used muc h more in the sense ... of a c harge upon a vessel whic h the person is entitled to realize by sale, than in the sense of saying simply that amongst all the several persons who may have c laims when the ship c omes to be sold, Benson is to stand in a favoured position. In other words, the Frenc h Court intended by the proc eeding taken to adjudge the sale of the vessel in order to satisfy this privilege. 

 But, beyond that, I think the case becomes somewhat clearer when it is carried to the Civil Tribunal, which ... summoned all who were supposed to be the owners of the ship. ... For what purpose did they c all Claus and his assignee? For the purpose of making them liable upon the bill, not bec ause Claus had ac c epted it, but only bec ause, being interested in the thing they were about to sell, they thought it right that Claus and his assignee should be present. 

 Therefore, upon the whole proc eeding, taking first the proc eeding against Benson and the ship, next, the detainer of the vessel by the Tribunal of Commerc e for the purpose of the sale being affirmed by the Superior Court, and then the Superior Court when it arrives at the question of sale or no sale, taking c are to summon those whom alone it c ould rec ognise as owners, I think there can be no doubt that the judgment of the Court was intended to be a judgment in rem , and therefore the Court intended to do that which by the French law it did, namely, to transfer the ownership in the vessel. 

 [emphasis in original in italic s; emphasis added in bold italic s] 

5       3 _Castrique_ was applied in _Minna Craig Steamship Company and James Laing v Chartered Mercantile Bank of India London and China_ [1897] 1 QB 55 (“ _Minna Craig_ ”). In that c ase, while a ship owned by the English plaintiff c ompany was loading in Bombay for a voyage to Hamburg, the master was fraudulently induc ed to sign bills of lading for goods whic h were never loaded onto the ship. The bills of lading were indorsed to the English defendants. Under German law, non-delivery of goods spec ified in a bill of lading entitles the bill holder to a lien upon the vessel. Upon the ship’s arrival in 


Germany, a winding-up order was made against the plaintiff. The defendants, who had in the meantime disc overed the fraud, arrested the ship and c ommenc ed proc eedings against her in a German c ourt to enforc e their lien. The German c ourt ordered the ship to be sold, and ordered that lien to be satisfied out of the sale proc eeds. Although the plaintiff had notic e of these proc eedings, it did not appear. Subsequently, liquidators of the plaintiff sued the defendants in England to rec over the fruits of the foreign judgment. The defendants argued that the German proc eedings were _in rem_ and binding on the plaintiff. Collins J agreed with the defendants ( _Minna Craig_ at 61): 

 ... I took time to go c arefully through the proc eedings in the German Court in order to satisfy myself whether they were or were not proc eedings in rem. I have c ome to the c onc lusion that they were prac tic ally undistinguishable [ sic ] from those whic h in Castrique v. Imrie were held by the House of Lords to be proc eedings in rem and not merely a roundabout method of getting exec ution upon a judgment in personam. ... It is true that the words “par privilége sur c e navire” are wanting here, but I do not think that makes any real differenc e. The proceedings were taken against the ship; the liability was limited to the value of the ship; and in each of their judgments the German Courts refer to the right of the bill-of-lading holders as a lien. Therefore I must treat the decision as one in rem. [emphasis in original in italic s; emphasis added in bold italic s] 

54     It is essential to the rec ognition of a foreign judgment _in rem_ that the _res_ should have been situated in the foreign c ountry c onc erned at the time of the proc eedings ( _Dicey, Morris & Collins, vol 1_ ([38] _supra_ ), at para 14–104; and _Briggs & Rees_ ([46] _supra_ ) at para 7.57). If the _res_ were so situated, jurisdic tion would exist even if the owner did not c onsent to its being there, _eg_ , where a yac ht is stolen and abandoned in a foreign port ( _Dicey, Morris & Collins, vol 1_ , at para 14–104). On the other hand, if the _res_ were situated elsewhere, the foreign c ourt would have had no suc h jurisdic tion ( _Dicey, Morris & Collins, vol 1_ , at para 14–101). 

55     A c ase in point is _Calyon v Irene Michailaidis and others_ [2009] UKPC 34 (“ _Calyon_ ”), whic h c onc erned an ownership dispute in relation to a c ollec tion of Eileen Gray furniture (“the Collec tion”). From about the 1970s until his death, Christo, who was part of a wealthy Greek shipping family, lived with one Robin in a house in Kensington. When Christo died in 1999, he was domic iled in Greec e and, under Greek law, his mother (“Irene”) and sister (“Despina”) were his heirs. In 2000, Robin sold the Collec tion through a Paris dealer for $15m. The Collec tion was flown to Switzerland for delivery to the buyer and the sale proc eeds were dissipated by Robin for various purposes. The Collec tion ended up with the Gibraltar branc h of a Frenc h bank (“Calyon”). 

56     Christo’s family disputed Robin’s right to sell the Collec tion, c laiming that the Collec tion belonged to Christo and had therefore passed to his heirs upon his death. On 23 February 2001, they started proc eedings against Robin and Robin’s c ompany (“RSL”) whic h had benefitted from the sale proc eeds. On the same day, Robin and RSL issued proc eedings in Athens seeking a dec laration that Robin was the owner of the Collec tion and joined Irene, Despina and the administrators as defendants. In June 2004, the Greek c ourt delivered judgment in favour of Irene and Despina. Armed with the Greek judgment, Irene and the administrators proc eeded to the c ourts of Gibraltar, asserting that Calyon had dishonestly assisted Robin in a breac h of trust. 

57     Lord Rodger held that, if it were treated as a judgment _in rem_ , it c ould not be granted rec ognition sinc e the Collec tion was never within the jurisdic tion of the Greek c ourt ( _Calyon_ at [20]): 

 ... the Collec tion was last seen as it was flown from London to Switzerland in April 2001 to be delivered to its purc haser. There is therefore no reason to suppose that the Collection was ever “so situated as to be within the lawful control of the State [Greece] under the authority of 


 which” the court which determined its ownership sat. So the Greek judgment does not satisfy the first test for a judgment in rem , laid down by Blac kburn J, giving the opinion of most of the c onsulted judges, and approved by Lord Chelmsford in Castrique v Imrie (1870) LR 4 HL 414, 429 and 448. The Court of Appeal duly held that the Greek judgment was not a judgment in rem. Counsel for the c laimants and respondents, Mr Steinfeld QC, did not c hallenge that c onc lusion. The Board agrees with it and therefore proc eeds on the basis that the Greek judgment was in personam. [emphasis added] 

58     As a judgment _in personam_ , the Greek judgment c ould not bind Calyon. This was bec ause Calyon had not been made a party to the Greek proc eedings ( _Calyon_ at [21]): 

 Equally c learly ... Calyon, was not a party to the c ounter-c laim in the Greek proc eedings. ... In these c irc umstanc es, since Calyon was not itself a party to the proceedings, the judgment of the Greek court could not give rise to any estoppel per rem judicatam against Calyon in the present proceedings – even if it would have given rise to suc h an estoppel against [Robin] and RSL. The Court of Appeal rightly so held and the respondents did not c ross-appeal against that dec ision. [emphasis added] 

The present fac ts 

59     As earlier stated at [45] above, I am of the view that the Forfeiture Judgment is a judgment _in rem_. The Philippines Supreme Court had explic itly stated in the Forfeiture Resolution that “a forfeiture proc eeding is an ac tion _in rem_ , against the thing itself instead of against the person”. It had also c learly indic ated its intention to finally determine the ownership of the Funds, stating, in the Forfeiture Judgment, that: 

 ... Almost two dec ades have passed sinc e the government initiated its searc h for and reversion of suc h ill-gotten wealth. The definitive resolution of suc h c ases on the merits is thus long overdue. If there is proof of illegal ac quisition, ac c umulation, misappropriation, fraud or illic it c onduc t, let it be brought out now. Let the ownership of these funds and other assets be finally determined and resolved with dispatc h, free from all the delaying tec hnic alities and annoying proc edural sidetrac ks. 

 We thus take c ognizanc e of this c ase and settle with finality all the issues therein. 

60     The _in rem_ nature of the forfeiture proc eedings may also be disc erned from the wording of RA 1379 pursuant to whic h the proc eedings were instituted. In partic ular, ss 2 and 6 of RA 1379 provide: 

 Section 2. Filing of petition. Whenever any public offic er or employee has ac quired during his inc umbenc y an amount of property whic h is manifestly out of proportion to his salary as suc h public offic er or employee and to his other lawful inc ome and the inc ome from legitimately ac quired property, said property shall be presumed prima facie to have been unlawfully acquired. ... 

 ... 

 Section 6. Judgment. If the respondent is unable to show to the satisfac tion of the c ourt that he has lawfully ac quired the property in question, then the court shall declare such property, forfeited in favor [sic] of the State, and by virtue of such judgment the property aforesaid shall become the property of the State : ... 


 [emphasis added] 

It is c lear, from the wording of these provisions, that the proc eedings under RA 1379 were direc ted against the _res_ in question – as long as the presumption of unlawful ac quisition is not adequately rebutted, the _res_ would bec ome vested in the State. That the forfeiture proc eedings were direc ted against the _res_ , _ie_ , the Funds in the present c ase, is also demonstrated by the fac t that the Funds were in the meantime parked in esc row ac c ounts pending final determination of their disposition (see [16] above). Further, the forfeiture proc eedings were brought in relation to Exec utive Order No 2 (12 Marc h 1986), whic h, _inter alia_ , required full disc losure from all persons and entities who had knowledge of possession of suc h ill-gotten assets, and prohibited them from c onc ealing, transferring or dissipating them and from otherwise frustrating or obstruc ting the rec overy efforts of the government. 

_Whether the Philippines court had jurisdiction to issue an in rem judgment_ 

Non-partic ipation of the Foundations in the forfeiture proc eedings 

61     Having found that the Forfeiture Judgment is _in rem_ in nature, what effec t does it have in the present proc eedings? Mr Mohan argues that the Philippines Supreme Court did not, in any event, have jurisdic tion to bind the Foundations, sinc e, c ontrary to the guarantees provided by the Philippines authorities to the Swiss authorities (see [17]–[18] above), the Foundations were not made parties to the forfeiture proc eedings. I disagree. 

62     As Mr Elias rightly points out, while the Philippines government guaranteed that the Foundations would be entitled to be heard in the forfeiture proc eedings, it did not undertake a duty to implead the Foundations. Signific antly, after the Forfeiture Judgment was released in July 2003, the Swiss Federal Offic e of Justic e issued a press release announc ing, _inter alia_ , that the guarantees provided by the Republic were satisfac tory and that the Philippines government c ould dispose of the Swiss Deposits (see [20] above). In the c irc umstanc es, there is no basis for this c ourt to find that the Philippines authorities had breac hed the c onditions set out by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court. As evidenc ed by Powers of Attorney exec uted by Imelda Marc os in favour of the Foundations’ Mr Patric k Foetisc h, the Foundations were aware of the forfeiture proc eedings and their right to partic ipate in the same. They c hose not to partic ipate in the forfeiture proc eedings despite having notic e of the same and c annot now rely on their non-partic ipation as a basis for arguing that the Forfeiture Judgment did not bind them (see, for example, _Minna Craig_ ) ([53] _supra_ ). 

Situs of the Funds at the material time 

63     In spite of the foregoing, there is an impediment to the rec ognition of the Forfeiture Judgment in that the Funds were not in the Philippines but in Singapore at the time of the Forfeiture Judgment. As disc ussed (see [54]–[57] above), it is essential to the rec ognition of a foreign judgment _in rem_ that the _res_ should have been situated in the foreign c ountry c onc erned at the time of the proc eedings. 

64     To c irc umvent this diffic ulty, Mr Elias argues that the Philippines Supreme Court had jurisdic tion to bind the world as the authorities of Switzerland, where the Funds were originally situated, had delegated jurisdic tion to it pursuant to the IMAC proc eedings, thus giving it c onstruc tive c ustody of the Funds. In other words, as the Funds were deposited in Singapore pursuant to and in ac c ordanc e with the Swiss orders, the _situs_ of the Funds in Singapore was immaterial to the forc e of the Forfeiture Judgment whic h was rendered in c omplianc e with the IMAC proc ess. 


65     Unfortunately, no authority has been c ited in support of suc h an extension of the princ iple of rec ognition of judgments _in rem_. While the referenc es to “ac tual or c onstruc tive possession of the subjec t matter” and “situated within the lawful c ontrol of the state” in, for example, _Castrique_ and _Calyon_ ([55] _supra_ ), may suggest that the princ iple may ac c ommodate situations where the foreign state only has c onstruc tive c ustody of the _res_ , in the absenc e of full and proper argument on this spec ific point, this c ourt would be slow to adopt suc h a position. In any event, _even if_ , as the Republic suggests, the jurisdic tional requirements were fulfilled on the basis of c onstruc tive c ustody, this c ourt would still be unable to grant rec ognition to the Forfeiture Judgment due to its penal nature, as explained below. 

**_(3) Whether the Republic’s claim depends upon the indirect enforcement in Singapore of a foreign penal law_** 

66     The HRVs and the Foundations argue that enforc ement of the Forfeiture Judgment in Singapore would amount to indirec t enforc ement of RA 1379, whic h, they aver, is a penal law. Ac c ordingly, they argue that the Republic ’s c laim, premised on the Forfeiture Judgment, must fail. 

_The law_ 

67     It is trite that a forum c ourt will not enforc e a foreign judgment if to do so would amount to a direc t or indirec t enforc ement of a penal law, revenue law or other public law of the foreign state ( _Dicey, Morris & Collins, vol 1_ , at para 5–020 and _Relfo Ltd (in liquidation) v Bhimji Velji Jadva Varsani_ <span class="citation">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 657</span> at [53]). As Lord Denning MR held in _Attorney-General of New Zealand v Ortiz_ [1984] 1 AC 1 (“ _Ortiz_ ”) at 20: 

 ... our c ourts will not entertain a suit brought by a foreign sovereign, direc tly or indirec tly, to enforc e the penal or revenue laws of that foreign state. We do not sit to c ollec t taxes for another c ountry or to inflic t punishments for it. ... 

68     This rule stems from the foreign state’s lac k of international jurisdic tion to enforc e its laws outside its own territory and the forum c ourt’s unwillingness to exerc ise its own jurisdic tion in aid of an attempt by the foreign state to ac t in exc ess of its own jurisdic tion ( _Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran v The Barakat Galleries Ltd_ [2008] 3 WLR 486 (“ _Barakat Galleries_ ”) at [97]). The rule was explained by Lord Denning MR in similar terms ( _Ortiz_ at 21): 

 ... By international law every sovereign state has no sovereignty beyond its own frontiers. The c ourts of other c ountries will not allow it to go beyond the bounds. They will not enforc e any of its laws whic h purport to exerc ise sovereignty beyond the limits of its authority. 

69     In _Banco de Vizcaya v Don Alfonso de Borbon y Austria_ [1935] 1 KB 140 (“ _Banco de Vizcaya_ ”), the Spanish Republic dec lared the exKing of Spain (“Alfonso”) to be a traitor, dec reed that all his property be seized for the benefit of the State and ordered all bankers in Spain having in deposit any suc h property to deliver the same to the Spanish Treasury. Certain sec urities belonging to Alfonso had been deposited in an English bank (“WBank”) to the order of the Spanish bank (“BV”), whic h was Alfonso’s agent. Both Alfonso and BV c laimed the delivery up of these sec urities. WBank took out an interpleader summons. Lawrenc e J held that BV was not in reality asserting its own c ontrac tual rights as they originally existed but the rights of the Spanish Republic. Consequently, BV’s c laim failed, sinc e to c ountenanc e it would amount to an enforc ement of an admittedly penal law of the Spanish Republic ( _Banco de Vizcaya_ at 143–145): 

 ... the substanc e of the right sought to be enforc ed by [BV] is the delivery to them of the 


 sec urities in question and the enforc ement of this right will direc tly or indirec tly involve the exec ution of what are undoubtedly and admittedly penal laws of the Spanish Republic. [BV’s] whole c ase is that they are bound by virtue of the dec rees to hand over the sec urities to the Spanish Government in defianc e of the mandate of [Alfonso], and, that being so, it seems to be unarguable that the enforc ement of [BV’s] right will not direc tly or indirec tly involve the exec ution of the dec rees. 

 ... But in the present c ase the penalty imposed is seizure by the State for its own benefit of all [Alfonso]'s properties, rights, and grounds of action, and this penalty is imposed in terms for high treason, and the only way in which [BV is] able to assert their claim that they are entitled as against [Alfonso] is by virtue of these decrees , and they are c ompelled to admit that they have no personal right or title to the property in the sec urities. ... I therefore hold that [Alfonso] and not [BV] is entitled to the sec urities in question. 

 [emphasis added] 

70     It is important to note that whether a foreign law is penal is to be determined by the forum c ourt ( _Barakat Galleries_ at [106]). “Penal law” was defined by the Privy Counc il in _Huntington v Attrill_ [1893] AC 150 (“ _Huntington v Attrill_ ”) at 156–157 as follows: 

 ... The rule has its foundation in the well-rec ognised princ iple that c rimes, inc luding in that term all breaches of public law punishable by pecuniary mulct or otherwise, at the instance of the State Government, or of some one representing the public , are loc al in this sense, that they are only c ognizable and punishable in the c ountry where they were c ommitted. Accordingly no proceeding, even in the shape of a civil suit, which has for its object the enforcement by the State, whether directly or indirectly, of punishment imposed for such breaches by the lex fori, ought to be admitted in the Courts of any other country. 

 ... 

 ... in Wisconsin v. The Pelican Insurance Company [127 U.S. (20 Davis) 265] ... Mr. Justic e Gray, after referring to the text books, and the dic tum by Chief Justic e Marshall already c ited, went on to say: “ The rule that the Courts of no country execute the law of another applies not only to prosecutions and sentences for crimes and misdemeanors, but to all suits in favour of the State for the recovery of pecuniary penalties for any violation of statutes for the protection of its revenues or other municipal laws, and to all judgments for such penalties .” 

 Their Lordships do not hesitate to ac c ept that exposition of the law, whic h, in their opinion, disc loses the proper test for asc ertaining whether an ac tion is penal within the meaning of the rule. 

 [emphasis added] 

In light of this nuanc ed definition, c are should be taken not to c onflate the c onc epts of “c riminal” with “penal”; the forum c ourt may c onc lude that the foreign law is penal even if it does not form part of the c riminal c ode of a foreign c ountry ( _Barakat Galleries_ at [108]). As observed in _Dicey, Morris & Collins, vol 1_ ([38] _supra_ ), at para 5–027, for the present purposes, a penal law c ould be one whic h punishes or prevents an offenc e. 

_The present facts_ 


 Mr Tan: The State doesn’t have to show that the jewellery, whic h is being forfeited, was ac tually bought with State funds. That’s not the purpose of the Ac t. 

 Mr Albano: Yes, bec ause it is--

71     In arguing that the Forfeiture Judgment was not penal in nature, Mr Elias emphasised that the Forfeiture Judgment and the Forfeiture Resolution had stated in no unc ertain terms that forfeiture proc eedings under RA 1379 are c ivil in nature and do not terminate in the imposition of a penalty (see [21] above). This, however, does not forec lose the issue sinc e, as mentioned at [70] above, whether a foreign law is penal is to be dec ided by this c ourt. That the proc eedings under RA 1379 were not c riminal in nature also does not determine the issue whether suc h law is of a penal nature. 

72     In _United States of America v Inkley_ [1989] 1 QB 255 (“ _Inkley_ ”), the US government brought an ac tion against the defendant for the enforc ement of a judgment for the amount of an appearanc e bond obtained in a Florida federal c ourt sitting as a c ivil c ourt. The defendant, who had been arrested in the US and c harged with c riminal offenc es, had been released on bail but had subsequently failed to appear to answer c riminal c harges. In refusing to enforc e the Florida judgment, the English Court of Appeal held that sinc e the purpose of the ac tion was part of a public law proc ess aimed to ensure attendanc e of persons ac c used of c rime before the c riminal c ourts, the general c ontext was c riminal and penal, and was unaffec ted by the fac t that it was dressed up in c ivil form ( _Inkley_ at 265–266): 

 ... the fact that in the foreign jurisdiction recourse may be had in a civil forum to enforce the right will not necessarily affect the true nature of the right being enforced in this country. 

 ... we have c ome firmly to the c onc lusion that the general c ontext and bac kground against whic h the appearanc e bond was exec uted was c riminal or penal. The power to require the exec ution of the bond arose from sec tion 3146 et seq. of the United States Code Annotated for Crimes and Criminal Proc edure. The c irc umstanc es in whic h it c ame into existenc e were c learly c riminal in nature and breac hes of the c onditions inc orporated in it c ould give rise to further c riminal proc ess. Finally, the whole purpose of the bond was to ensure, so far as it was possible, the presenc e of the exec utor of the bond to meet justic e at the hands of the state in a c riminal prosec ut ion. The fact that the obligations under the bond were the subject matter of a declaratory judgment in a civil court does not affect, in our judgment, the basic characteristic of the right which that judgment itself enforced, namely the right of the state as the administrator of public law and justice to ensure the due observance of the criminal law or the exaction of pecuniary penalties if that course was frustrated. Notwithstanding its civil clothing, the purpose of the action initiated by the writ issued in this case was the due execution by the United States of America of a public law process aimed to ensure the attendance of persons accused of crime before the criminal courts. 

 [emphasis added] 

73     I find that the HRVs and the Foundations are c orrec t in c ontending that the suc c ess of the Republic ’s c ase is dependent upon the indirec t enforc ement of a foreign penal law. RA 1379, whic h provides for the forfeiture of property in favour of the state whenever any property is found to have been unlawfully ac quired by a public offic er, is c learly of a penal nature sinc e it summarily forfeits property in the hands of public offic ials in c onsequenc e of a wrong c ommitted by the individual. Signific antly, during Mr Tan’s c ross-examination of the Republic and PNB’s Philippines law expert Mr Ed Vinc ent S Albano (“Mr Albano”), Mr Albano c onfirmed that the forfeiture proc eedings under RA 1379 did not apply to _revest_ originally state-owned property in the State but vested property in the State _by virtue of the forfeiture_ : 


 Mr Tan: Isn’t that c orrec t? 

 Mr Albano: ---bec ause it is the--

 Mr Tan: Just---just answer--

 Mr Albano: Yes. 

 ... Mr Tan: ... Even if that jewellery was bought with---not with State funds, bec ause of the net asset ac c ounting, you c an’t explain how you got this addition of 1 million, this property is just dec lared forfeited. “You’re punished. We take this property”, that’s how it works, isn’t it? 

 Mr Albano: Yes, bec ause here the--

 Mr Tan: Yes. Mr Albano: ---the person is given the right to explain how he---how he got it. If he cannot explain it then that is ordered forfeited in favour of the State. Mr Tan: ... It’s after the forfeiture and divestment that it becomes the property of the State. Mr Albano: Yes. 

 Mr Tan: Thank you. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

 Mr Tan: RA 1379 is a spec ific enac tment in The Philippines and it authorises the forfeiture to the State of property of a public offic er or employee in c ertain c irc umstanc es. That’s c orrec t, isn’t it? Mr Albano: Yes, Sir. 

 Mr Tan: Now, the forfeiture c omes about when it’s found that what the public offic er or employer has, is manifestly out of proportion to his salary as suc h public offic er or an employee, when c ompared with his other lawful inc ome and the inc ome from legitimately ac quired property. 

 Mr Albano: Yes, Sir. Mr Tan: If it’s found that there is this unexplained wealth, what RA 1379 authorises is the forfeiture of the illegally ac quired property. Mr Albano: Yes, Sir. 

 Mr Tan: By the forfeiture, it means that this property is divested from the public officer without compensation. 

 Mr Albano: Er, yes, Sir, because of illegal act that is committed. 

 ... 

74     Indeed, the intrinsic ally penal nature of the forfeiture proc eedings under RA 1379 was borne out during Mr Tan’s c ross-examination of Mr Albano: 


 Mr Tan: So this divesting of property, this forfeiture, is a punishment imposed on RA 1379 on the offic er. 

 Mr Albano: It is in the form of a punishment because he is divested. 

 ... 

 Mr Tan: ... So it is the law of The Philippines that any forfeiture under RA 1379 amounts to a penalty bec ause it punishes the public offic er found liable. 

 Mr Albano: It does not pun---it---it, er, it is---it is in that sense but it does not punish in the sense---in the sense that he’s sent to prison. 

 Mr Tan: Other than the fact that it---he’s not sent to prison, he is punished by the divestment of his property. 

 Mr Albano: Yes, Sir, because the property that he stole or amassed is returned to the rightful owner which is the State. 

 [emphasis added] 

 Mr Mohan: So, when the Supreme Court here says forfeiture partakes the nature of a penalty? 

 Mr Albano: Y es. Because, er, the property that was illegally gotten by the public officers , er, whic h is not proportionate to his inc ome goes bac k to the government---to the legally---to the, er, government whic h is the---or to the state, who is the legal owner. 

 Mr Mohan: And---and that you agree with me is a penalty? Mr Albano: Penalty in the sense that it is---it is forfeited. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

That RA 1379 was penal in c harac ter was also c onc eded by Mr Albano during his c ross-examination by Mr Mohan: 

In the premises, I find that the Forfeiture Judgment was penal in nature, and c onsequently dismiss the Republic ’s c laim. 

**Analysis of the HRVs’ claim** 

75     The HRVs’ primary c ase is that the Chinn Assignment validly transferred all right, title and interest in the Funds from the Foundations to the HRVs. Their argument is based on the assumption that the issue is the validity of the Chinn Assignment _vis-a-vis_ the assignor and assignee, and that suc h issue is to be determined by US law. They rely on the evidenc e of their US law expert, Professor David I Levine (“Prof Levine”), to support their c laimed entitlement to the Funds pursuant to the Chinn Assignment under US law. 

76     The Republic and PNB disagree, arguing that it is Swiss law whic h governs the question of validity of the Chinn Assignment. In any event, they argue that the Chinn Assignment is invalid under _both_ Swiss law and US law. For this, they rely on the evidenc e of their Swiss law expert, Dr Andres 


Lanzlinger (“Dr Lanzlinger”), and the evidenc e of Ms Bronster. The Foundations did not, in their c losing submissions, address the question of the appropriate law governing the issue. However, like the Republic and PNB, their position is that the Chinn Assignment was ineffec tive in passing title to the HRVs under _both_ Swiss law and US law. They rely on the evidenc e of Prof Buxbaum, who testified on the c ontent of US law, and the evidenc e of Dr Lanzlinger on the c ontent of Swiss law. 

77     Two questions arise. First, is there a true c onflic t between US law and Swiss law on the relevant issues to be dec ided? As mentioned, although only the Republic and PNB have tendered expert evidenc e on Swiss law, parties have all produc ed evidenc e in relation to US law and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the US law experts have provided varying opinions on the validity and effec t of the Chinn Assignment. The possibility of a false c onflic t thus presents itself sinc e the Chinn Assignment c ould very well be ineffec tive to pass title under _both_ US law and Swiss law. Sec ond, if US law and Swiss law differ in their treatment of the Chinn Assignment, whic h system of law applies? As will be seen (at [109] below), these questions will in turn determine the Re-registration issue. 

78     A c ourt seeking to disc over the _lex causae_ ( _ie_ , governing law) typic ally embarks on a threestage proc ess involving, _viz_ : 

 (a) the c harac terisation of the relevant issue; 

 (b) the selec tion of the c hoic e of law rule whic h lays down a “c onnec ting fac tor” for that partic ular issue; and 

 (c ) the identific ation of the system of law whic h is tied by that c onnec ting fac tor to the relevant issue ( Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc (No 3) [1966] 1 WLR 387 (“ Macmillan No 3 ”) at 391–392; Raiffeisen Zentralbank Ősterreich AG v Five Star Trading LLC [2001] QB 825 (“ Raiffeisen ”) at [26]). 

79     Although, generally, the three-step “searc h” for the _lex causae_ is undertaken after a determination of the presenc e of a true c onflic t situation (Janeen M Carruthers, _The Transfer of Property in the Conflict of Laws_ (Oxford University Press, 2005) (“ _Carruthers_ ”) at para 4.10), there is, in the present c ase, value in first setting out the appropriate c harac terisation of the issue and the relevant c onnec ting fac tor bec ause (as will be seen from the analysis) muc h of the disagreement on the effec t of the Chinn Assignment may be attributed to a misc harac terisation of the relevant issue, feeding into the failure to pinpoint the appropriate c onnec ting fac tor and, henc e, the appropriate governing law. In undertaking the three-step inquiry, the following observations by Manc e LJ in _Raiffeisen_ at [26]–[29] are borne in mind: 

 26 ... The proc ess falls to be undertaken in a broad internationalist spirit in ac c ordanc e with the princ iples of c onflic t of laws of the forum, ... 

 27 While it is c onvenient to identify this three-stage proc ess, it does not follow that c ourts, at the first stage, c an or should ignore the effec t at the sec ond stage or c harac terising an issue in a partic ular way. The overall aim is to identify the most appropriate law to govern a particular issue. ... A mec hanistic applic ation, without regard to the c onsequenc es, would c onflic t with the purpose for whic h they were c onc eived. ... 

 28 ... 

 2 9 There is in effect an element of interplay or even circularity in the three-stage process identified by Staughton LJ. But the conflict of laws does not depend (like a game or even an 


 election) upon the application of rigid rules, but upon a search for appropriate principles to meet particular situations. 

 [emphasis added] 

**_Stage 1: Issue characterisation_** 

80     Mr Tan frames the issue as one c onc erning the validity of the assignment as between the assignor and assignee, _ie_ , the Foundations and the HRVs. I find this to be too narrow a c onstruc tion of the dispute at hand, bearing in mind its c ontext as an interpleader ac tion. By foc using purely on the assignor-assignee relationship, Mr Tan has essentially c harac terised the issue as a c ontrac tual one. This, however, is problematic. First, framing the issue in c ontrac tual terms is artific ial when one c onsiders the involuntary nature of the Chinn Assignment. Sec ond, and more importantly, a “c ontrac tualisation” of the issue ignores the fac t that the Chinn Assignment had expressly direc ted “all persons ac ting in the c apac ity or title of c ustodians, offic ers, direc tors or trustees of entities having authority over the bank ac c ounts” to effec t the transfer of the Funds as direc ted. This putative third party reac h of the Chinn Assignment c annot be ignored. 

81     As Mr Elias rightly points out, the c ourt is ultimately c onc erned with determining who has proprietary entitlement to the Funds. In the fac e of the c ompeting c laims, the issue is more appropriately framed in property terms, _viz_ , whether the Chinn Assignment effec tively vests in the HRVs proprietary rights to the Funds whic h are good against the whole world. 

**_Stage 2: The choice of law rule_** 

82     Parties have suggested various c onnec ting fac tors that might apply on the present fac ts. Given the manner in whic h Mr Tan has framed the issue (see [80] above), he argues that US law applies as t he _lex loci actus_ , and that, pursuant to US law, the Foundations’ rights, title and interests in the Funds were validly assigned to the HRVs under the Chinn Assignment. Alternatively, he argues that the appropriate governing law should be the law governing the assignor and the assignee ( _ie_ , the proper law of the assignment), and that sinc e both were subjec t to the jurisdic tion of the US c ourt at the relevant time, the _lex causae_ is US law. Mr Elias, on the other hand, argues that the validity of the Chinn Assignment, whic h was an involuntary assignment akin to an attac hment or garnishment of debt, should be determined based on the _lex situs_ of the debt, that being Swiss law. As mentioned, Mr Mohan takes the view that it is immaterial whic h law applies as the HRVs would have no c laim in any event. 

83     However, the _lex loci actus_ , the _lex situs_ and the proper law of the assignment appear to be inappropriate in c ases of involuntary assignments of intangible movable property, suc h as the present. After reviewing the authorities, I am of the view that the law governing the question whether the HRVs had obtained a proprietary right to the Funds under the Chinn Assignment is the proper law _of the debt_ , whic h is in this c ase Swiss law. This is distinc t from the proper law of the _assignment_. I will examine eac h c onnec ting fac tor raised by the parties before explaining why the proper law of the debt is the most appropriate law to govern the issue. 

_(i) US law as the lex loci actus_ 

84     The HRVs rely on the leading c ase of _Republica de Guatemala v Nunez_ [1927] 1 KB 669 (“ _Nunez_ ”) in support of their position that US law applies as the _lex loci actus_. _Nunez_ c onc erned moneys whic h were deposited with London bankers by a former president of the Republic of Guatemala (“ROG”), Cabrera, who was domic iled in Guatemala. The moneys had allegedly been 


wrongfully misappropriated by Cabrera from the ROG. Cabrera subsequently assigned the moneys, by way of gift, to his son, Nunez, who was also domic iled in Guatemala. An interpleader ac tion was brought by the London bankers to determine the title issue between the ROG and Nunez. To do so, the English c ourt had to determine the validity of the purported assignment based on either English law as the _lex situs_ , under whic h the assignment was valid, or Guatemalan law, under whic h the assignment was void. The English c ourt opted for the latter position. Unfortunately, due to the lac k of unanimity in the judges’ reasoning, it is unc lear whether Guatemala law applied as the _lex domicilli_ or the _lex loci actus_ , sinc e those two c onnec ting fac tors c oinc ided on the fac ts (Mark Moshinsky in _The Assignment of Debts in the Conflict of Laws_ (1992) 108 LQR 591 (“ _Moshinsky_ ”) at pp 598–599, 601). However, regardless of whether Guatamala law applied as the _lex domicilli_ or _lex loci actus_ , _Nunez_ does not really advanc e the HRVs’ c ase as it dealt with a _voluntary_ assignment, as distinc t from the Chinn Assignment. 

85     I also note that the emphasis on the _loci actus_ as a c onnec ting fac tor appears now to have bec ome outmoded even in the c ontext of voluntary assignments, sinc e modern c onditions may render the plac e of the transac tion to be purely fortuitous (JHC Morris, _The Conflict of Laws_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2009) (“ _Morris_ ”) at para 15–027, _Moshinsky_ at p 601 and _Macmillan No 3_ at 402). _A fortiori_ in the c ontext of involuntary assignments. 

_(ii) US law as the proper law of the assignment_ 

86     The HRVs also suggest that US law may apply as the proper law of the assignment. There are, however, at least two reasons for rejec ting this suggestion. First, it would not be sensible for the proper law of the assignment to be pivotal in c ases of involuntary assignments. As I have explained, the c ontrac t metaphor in c ases of involuntary assignments is not well-founded, and c onsequently, foc using on the ac t c onstituting the assignment, may not be the most appropriate option. Sec ond, it is important to note that there are two tiers of relationships involved in assignment of debts, _viz_ : 

 (a) the relationship between the assignor ( ie , the Foundations) and assignee ( ie , the HRVs); and 

 (b) the relationship between the third party debtor ( ie , the Swiss Banks) and the assignor or assignee. 

As we are c onc erned with the proprietary effec t of the Chinn Assignment, it would not be appropriate to foc us purely on the relationship in the first tier. As was observed in _Moshinsky_ at pp 594–595: 

 It is true that in prac tic e assignments are often made in c onjunc tion with, or effec ted by, a c ontrac t to assign. In English law and some other legal systems the line between c ontrac t and property is blurred bec ause a present c ontrac t to assign an existing debt operates as a c onveyanc e of the debt in equity, and indeed the c ontrac t of assignment is itself sometimes referred to as an “assignment.” However this should not be allowed to obsc ure the distinc tion between the c ontrac tual and the proprietary effec ts of the transac tion. ... Questions concerning the contractual relationship between the assignor and assignee, such as what warranties the assignor has given the assignee, (e.g. recourse in the case of non-payment by the debtor), are governed by the proper law of the contract between them. ... Questions concerning the proprietary aspects of the assignment, particularly whether title to the debt has passed to the assignee, should be referred to the most appropriate law for the transfer of property. [emphasis added] 

_(iii) The lex situs and proper law of the debt_ 


87     As Mr Elias argues, despite the labelling of the Chinn Assignment as an “assignment”, its putative effec t is essentially to effec t a garnishment of the Swiss ac c ounts in whic h the Funds were deposited. Questions relating to the effec t of garnishment of debts may be broadly divided into two c ategories. First, whether the Singapore c ourt should garnish a debt; and sec ond, whether the Singapore c ourt should rec ognise a foreign c ourt’s garnishee order or its equivalent as having disc harged a debt (P J Rogerson, _The Situs of Debts in the Conflict of Laws – Illogical, Unnecessary and Misleading_ (1990) 49(3) CLJ 441 (“ _Rogerson_ ”) at p 447). 

88     These two c ategories of c ases may be further sub-divided. Under the first c ategory, the Singapore c ourt may be asked to dec ide whether to make a garnishee order over a debt situated: 

 (a) in Singapore; or 

 (b) in another c ountry. 

 (a) Under the sec ond c ategory of c ases, whic h raises more diffic ult questions, the Singapore c ourt may have to determine the validity of a garnishee order made in a foreign c ountry over: 

 (c ) a debt situated in Singapore; or 

 (d) a debt situated in yet another foreign c ountry. 

 (b) This c ourt’s assessment of the Chinn Assignment falls within situation (d), whic h raises the most c omplex questions. There is, unfortunately, a dearth of c ases dealing with situation (d). It thus bec omes nec essary to c onsider c ases within situations (a) to (c ) in order to draw out the relevant and underpinning princ iples. 

Situation (a) and (b) c ases 

89     When determining whether to garnish a debt, c ourts have c onc entrated on the _situs_ of the debt as an important fac tor in c oming to a dec ision. As observed in _Rogerson_ at p 450: 

 ... It appears that so long as, inter alia , the debt has a situs in England, i.e. , the debtor is resident [in England], the [English] c ourt will normally exerc ise its jurisdic tion and make an order. Alternatively, if the situs of the debt is outside England then the c ourt will normally not make the order. 

The emphasis on the _situs_ of the debt stems from the c onc ern that the potential garnishee may otherwise be fac ed with the “double jeopardy” problem of multiple c laims if the English c ourt makes a garnishee order whic h does not disc harge the debt of the potential garnishee to the judgment debtor ac c ording to the law governing the debt ( _Morris_ at paras 15–042 and 15–043; and _Carruthers_ at para 6.65); Philip R Wood, _Conflict of Laws and International Finance_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 2007) explains at para 10–018: 

 ... If an attac hment is rec ognised here but not rec ognised there, the third party debtor (the garnishee) may have to pay twic e – onc e to his original c reditor, the judgment debtor, and then again to the judgment c reditor. 

90     In _Societe Eram Shipping Co Ltd v Cie Internationale de Navigation_ [2004] 1 AC 260 (“ _Societe Eram_ ”), a Romanian shipping c ompany sought to enforc e a judgment against judgment debtors residing in Hong Kong. Exec ution was sought against moneys standing to the judgment debtors’ c redit 


in a Hong Kong bank ac c ount. In third party proc eedings, the Romanian c ompany obtained an English garnishee order _nisi_ against the bank but, on applic ation for the order to be made absolute, the undisputed evidenc e was that Hong Kong law did not rec ognise suc h an order made in England in relation to a debt sited in Hong Kong. The House of Lords upheld the trial judge’s dec ision to disc harge the order _nisi_. Lord Bingham of Cornhill held ( _Societe Eram_ at [16]): 

 In a muc h-quoted passage of his judgment in Ellis v M’Henry (1871) LR 6 CP 228, 234, Bovill CJ sitting in the Court of Common Pleas said: 

 “In the first plac e, there is no doubt that a debt or liability arising in any c ountry may be disc harged by the laws of that c ountry, and that suc h a disc harge, if it extinguishes the debt or liability, and does not merely interfere with the remedies or c ourse of proc edure to enforc e it, will be an effec tual answer to the c laim, not only in the c ourts of that c ountry, but in every other c ountry. This is the law of England, and is a princ iple of private international law adopted in other c ountries. ... Secondly, as a general proposition, it is also true that the discharge of a debt or liability by the law of a country other than that in which the debt arises, does not relieve the debtor in any other country ; ...” 

 This statement remains good law. ... 

 It is evident that the Hong Kong law and procedure ... which deny recognition to a third party debt or garnishee order made in England in relation to a debt sited in Hong Kong is not an unusual or idiosyncratic rule but one which reflects general international practice. 

 [emphasis added] 

9       1 _Societe Eram_ was affirmed in _Kuwait Oil Tanker Co SAK and another v Qabazard_ [2004] 1 AC 300 (“ _Qabazard_ ”). Having obtained judgment in an English c ourt, the judgment c reditor sought exec ution against moneys standing to the judgment debtor’s c redit in a Swiss bank ac c ount. The English c ourt refused to make a garnishee order. Lord Hoffmann held that ( _Qabazard_ at [16]–[17]: 

 16 ... It is not c orrec t to c harac terise the garnishee or third party debt order as a c laim in personam made against the third party in England. It is enforcement of the judgment in rem against the debt, which in this case is situated in Switzerland. Artic le 16(5) therefore c onfers exc lusive jurisdic tion on Switzerland and it is understandable that UBS’s Swiss law expert should have said that a Swiss c ourt would regard the order as an infringement of its sovereignty. ... 

 17 The other point is also governed by your Lordships’ judgment in [the Societe Eram ] c ase. The Swiss debts, if any, are foreign debts and will not be discharged by compliance with the English order. So even without article 16(5), Langley J was right not to make the order. 

 [emphasis added] 

9       2 _Societe Eram_ and _Qabazard_ may be c ontrasted against _Swiss Bank Corporation v Boemische Industrial Bank_ [1923] 1 KB 673 (“ _Boehmische_ ”) where a garnishee order was made absolute by the English c ourt. The plaintiff (“SBC”) obtained judgment against a Czec h bank (“BIB”) c arrying on business in Prague. SBC then obtained a garnishee order _nisi_ in an English c ourt attac hing a debt owed by an English bank to BIB. The garnishee order was made absolute by the English Court of Appeal whic h held that there was no signific ant risk that the English bank would be c ompelled to pay twic e. Banks LJ plac ed muc h emphasis on the _situs_ of the debt, holding ( _Boehmische_ at 678–680): 


 ... [A question is raised as to] whether there is any real risk that the garnishees, if they pay the judgment c reditors under a garnishee order ... will be c alled upon to pay that amount over again in any proc eedings whic h may be taken against them in Prague or elsewhere in any foreign c ountry. 

 The decision of that question depends upon where the debt sought to be attached is situate. If the debt is situate, or in other words if it is properly rec overable, in this c ountry, then it would be disc harged by payment under an order of our Courts and the garnishee need have no fear of being required to pay it a sec ond time; but if the debt is situate, that is properly rec overable, in a foreign c ountry, then it is not disc harged by payment in this c ountry under an order of the Courts of this c ountry, and the debtor may be c alled upon to pay it over again in the foreign c ountry. ... 

 ... It is c learly expressed by Bovill C.J. in Ellis v. M’Henry ... “that a debt or liability arising in any country may be discharged by the laws of that country, and that such a discharge, if it extinguishes the debt or liability, ... will be an effectual answer to the claim, not only in the Courts of that country, but in every other country. This is the law of England, and is a principle of private international law adopted in other countries. ” ... The debt in this case is situate in England and is discharged in whole or in part by payment under a garnishee order in England , whic h is not mere proc edure and is rec ognized in international law. ... The appeal must be allowed and the garnishee order must be made absolute. 

 [emphasis added] 

It is c lear, from this extrac t, that the underlying c onc ern is, as disc ussed, the risk of exposing the third party debtor to multiple c laims. Atkin LJ also plac ed muc h emphasis on the _situs_ on the debt, holding ( _Boehmische_ at 684–685): 

 ... The plaintiffs having got judgment by an order of the Court now seek to get exec ution by attac hing a debt whic h to my mind c learly “arises” and “is situate” within the territorial limits of the jurisdic tion of the English Courts, if there is any differenc e between the two expressions. ... suc h proc ess when exec uted has the effec t of disc harging the person who owes the debt thus attac hed from further liability to pay it. ... Martin v Madel is plainly distinguishable, and its only c laim to be c onsidered in this c ase is by reason of a sentenc e in the judgment of Vaughan Williams L.J. ... “By international law an exec ution whic h has been c arried into effec t in a foreign c ountry under foreign law, and has taken away part of a man’s property, is not rec ognized as binding.” ... I feel satisfied that the very learned judge ... c annot have intended the wide meaning now attributed to the words used. ... I think, when he used the words “execution which has been carried into effect in a foreign country under foreign law," the learned Lord Justice intended to exclude that foreign country in which the property happened to be situate. ... [emphasis added] 

Situation (c ) and (d) c ases 

93     Situation (c ) and (d) c ases involve the forum c ourt having to determine the validity of a foreign garnishee order. Ac c ording to _Morris_ ([85] _supra_ ) at para 15–044, whether an English c ourt gives effec t to a foreign garnishee order depends on whether the debt is situated, _ie_ , properly rec overable, in the foreign c ountry where the garnishee order was made. The signific anc e of the _lex situs_ in these situations is also rec ognised in _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ , vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2009) at para 75.326: 


 A foreign garnishee order may be rec ognised in the forum if the following c onditions are satisfied: (1) the judgment whic h the garnishee order had been granted to enforc e must be one rec ognized under the private international law of the forum; (2) the situs of the garnished debt must be within the territory of the c ourt granting the order; and (3) payment of the garnished debt by the garnishee must have the effec t under the foreign law of disc harging the debt. On the basis that the garnishment proc ess is ac tually expropriation of property, this appears to be an applic ation of the lex situs princ iple, and not any rule relating to the rec ognition of foreign judgments or orders. ... 

There are, unfortunately, few c ases on this point, though two c ases, _viz_ , _Rossano v Manufacturers’ Life Insurance Co Ltd_ [1963] 2 QB 352 (“ _Rossano_ ”) and _Power Curber International Ltd v National Bank of Kuwait SAK_ [1981] 1 WLR 1233 (“ _Power Curber_ ”) are c onsistent with this formulation. 

94     In _Rossano_ , the plaintiff Egyptian national (“Rassano”) bought c ertain insuranc e polic ies from the defendant c ompany (“MLI”) whic h was inc orporated ac c ording to Canadian law with branc hes in many c ountries, inc luding Egypt. When the polic ies matured, Rassano brought an ac tion in England c laiming the money due under them. In defenc e, MLI argued, _inter alia_ , that it was not liable to pay Rossano suc h sums as there were garnishee orders served upon MLI’s Egyptian branc h by the Egyptian tax department in respec t of tax alleged to be due by Rassano and that payment to Rossano would expose MLI to the risk of having to pay the money twic e. Signific antly, the polic ies presc ribed the mode of payment as “in banker’s demand draft on London” or “on New York”, _ie_ , the _situs_ of the debt was _not_ Egypt ( _Rosanno_ at 379). Following the position taken in _Morris_ (see [93] above), one might surmise that the Egyptian garnishee orders should not be rec ognised sinc e the debt was not situated in Egypt. However, Mc Nair J relied upon a different ground to refuse rec ognition of the validity of the garnishment orders, _viz_ , that rec ognition of those orders would offend against the wellsettled princ iple that an English c ourt would not enforc e a foreign revenue law. It was thus stric tly unnec essary for Mc Nair J to address the parties following arguments on the c hoic e of law question outlined by the learned judge ( _Rossano_ at 376): 

 On behalf of [MLI] it was submitted (1) that whatever be the proper law of the c ontrac t, the debt is and was situated in Cairo and that debt has been validly attac hed in the c ountry where it was situated [ ie , Egypt]; (2) that an English c ourt will as a matter of private international law rec ognise and give effec t to the validity of that attac hment and not put the garnishee [ ie , MLI] in peril of having to pay twic e, and that it does not matter whether the attac hment proc eedings are in respec t of a revenue c laim; (3) that if the debt is not situated in Egypt, the English c ourt will as a matter of c omity give effec t to the proc eedings and will not put the garnishee in peril of having to pay twic e if the c ourt is satisfied (a) that by the law of the plac e of attac hment the situs of the debt is in that plac e, that is, Egypt; or (b) that by the law of the plac e of attac hment there is jurisdic tion over the debtor [ ie , Rossano], the garnishee [ ie , MLI] and the garnishor [ ie , the Egyptian tax department]. 

 [Rossano], on the other hand ... submitted (1) that the situs of the debt was not Egypt; (2) that the garnishee orders were invalid ... (3) that the garnishee orders provide no defenc e sinc e (a) no payment has been made under either or (b) Neither of them was made until after the maturity date on whic h [MLI] should have paid; (4) that this c ourt should not rec ognise the garnishee [order] as to do so would be indirec tly at least to enforc e a foreign revenue law; and (5) that the orders being in the nature of administrative orders and not orders of any c ourt, an English c ourt will not enforc e them. 

 Many of the points raised in these submissions raise diffic ult questions of private international law upon whic h English authority is sc anty. But as I have reac hed the c onc lusion that the 


 fundamental objec tion to the rec ognition of these orders is that their rec ognition would offend against the well-settled princ iple that the English c ourt will not rec ognise or enforc e direc tly or indirec tly a foreign revenue law or c laim, it is not nec essary for me as a matter of dec ision to deal with many of the other points raised. ... 

Mc Nair J observed _obiter_ ( _Rossano_ at 381–382) as follows: 

 ... on the assumption that the garnishee orders or either of them are valid by Egyptian law, and by that law binding upon [MLI] ... being garnishee or sequestration orders imposed by the ac t of the exec utive, and not the result of any judic ial proc eedings, must or should an English c ourt afford them rec ognition? ... The editors of Dicey when stating in rule 92 that the validity and effect of an attachment or garnishment of a debt is governed by the lex situs of the debt are clearly referring to garnishee orders made by a competent court. I should not be disposed on general princ iples to extend the rec ognition further. 

 ... I now turn to the third submission advanc ed on behalf of [MLI]. This may be stated as follows: That the English c ourts will as a matter of c omity give effec t to foreign garnishee proc eedings if the c ourt is satisfied (a) that by the law of the plac e of attac hment the situs of the debt is in the c ountry of attac hment, namely, Egypt, or (b) that by the law of the plac e of attac hment there is jurisdic tion over the garnishee, the debtor and his garnishor. 

 As to the first limb of this proposition I have already stated my views as to the situs of the debt and need not develop this point further since so far as I know no separate authority was relied upon under this branch of the argument. 

 As to the sec ond limb of this submission based upon the jurisdic tion of the foreign c ourt over the debtor the garnishee and the garnishor, as at present advised I should not be prepared to ac c ept that on the fac ts proved the Egyptian c ourt had jurisdic tion over Rossano. ... Even if the attac hment order had been an order of the Egyptian c ourt upon Rossano personally so as to have the status of a judgment of a foreign c ourt, as at present advised I should not have c onc luded that the Egyptian c ourts had suc h jurisdic tion over Rossano as to justify enforc ement of that judgment at c ommon law in the English c ourts. 

 [emphasis added] 

9       5 _Power Curber_ , on the other hand, involved a Kuwaiti garnishment of sums payable in North Carolina under a letter of c redit. The fac ts may be stated briefly. An Americ an c orporation (“PC”) supplied goods to a Kuwaiti firm, Hammoudeh. In return, Hammoudeh asked its bank in Kuwait to issue a letter of c redit to banks in the US. Subsequently, there was a Kuwaiti c ourt order for provisional attac hment of the sums payable by the Kuwaiti bank under the letter of c redit to PC, whic h purported to prevent the Kuwaiti bank from making any further payments under the letter of c redit. An ac tion was brought by PC against the Kuwaiti bank in England for summary judgment _vis-a-vis_ the sums due to PC under the letter of c redit. In holding that the Kuwaiti order did not provide the bank with a defenc e against a c laim for payment under the letter of c redit, Griffiths J observed ( _Power Curber_ at 1242–1243) as follows: 

 ... The bank submit that the judge should give leave to defend bec ause payment of the sums due under the letter of c redit is unlawful ac c ording to the proper law of the c ontrac t. ... In my view the proper law of the letter of credit was the law of the state of North Carolina. ... The bank could not have discharged its obligation by offering payment in Kuwait. ... 


 Sec ondly, it was submitted that payment was unlawful ac c ording to the lex situs of the debt whic h it is said is Kuwait. But ... [t]he] lex situs of the debt is North Carolina, and this ground for giving leave to defend c annot be supported. 

 ... 

 ... [The English court] must face the choice between enforcing the obligation upon the bank to pay under its irrevocable letter of credit or recognising the order of the Kuwait court. 

 I have no doubt that we should uphold the obligation to pay under the irrevocable letter of credit and remove the stay. Letters of c redit have bec ome established as a universally ac c eptable means of payment in international transac tions. ... they have been rightly desc ribed by that most distinguished c ommerc ial lawyer Kerr J. as “the life-blood of international c ommerc e”: ... 

 ... 

 There is no recognised rule of international law that compels this court to recognise this ex parte order of the Kuwaiti court. It is of c ourse entitled to be treated with respec t and wherever possible this c ourt will in the interests of c omity seek to rec ognise and uphold the order of the c ourt of a friendly state. But unhappily in this c ase the approac h of the Kuwaiti c ourt appears to be so out of step with that of our own c ourts and the c ourts of other trading nations that I fear we c annot rec ognise it. The c hoic e lies between upholding the world-wide prac tic es of international c ommerc e or the order of the Kuwaiti c ourt. I c hoose the first option and would remove the stay. 

 [emphasis added] 

In short, the c ourt refused to rec ognise the Kuwaiti order whic h was ineffec tive to disc harge the debt under North Carolina law. It is unc lear whether North Carolina law was applied as the _lex situs_ or proper law of the letter of c redit sinc e those c onnec ting fac tors c oinc ided on the fac ts. What was c lear was the obvious c onc ern that the banks c ould otherwise be exposed to multiple c laims. 

The _lex situs_ or the proper law of the debt? 

96     The c ases disc ussed thus far indic ate that the _lex situs_ assumes a large measure of signific anc e in issues to do with garnishee orders involving foreign elements. This position has however been c ritic ised. The most obvious c ritic ism arises from the artific iality of treating debts as c apable of having a _situs_ ( _Rogerson_ ([87] _supra_ ) at pp 454–455): 

 The debt is only a right, a c laim; and although it takes on the appearanc e of other physic al property bec ause of its value and its transmissibility it has different c harac teristic s whic h are fundamentally important. It c an only exist anyway in an abstrac t sense and it depends on the willingness of some system of law to enforc e it as an obligation in order to exist at all. That system of law – usually referred to in c onflic ts terms as the proper law of the debt – may well not be the residenc e of the debtor, nor the situs of the debt as c hosen by the English c ourt. Thus, the idea of a debt having a situs is illogic al: first, bec ause it does not have one in a generally ac c eptable sense; sec ondly, bec ause that situs may not c oinc ide with the more generally ac c epted governing law. 

97     Flowing from this is the more fundamental objec tion that using the _situs_ as a c onnec ting fac tor 


adds an extra unnec essary layer to the c hoic e of law analysis, whic h obfusc ates rather than c larifies the _actual_ c onnec ting fac tor relied on by the c ourts. This objec tion has been stated in the following terms ( _Rogerson_ at p 453): 

 By asc ribing a situs to it the c ourt is going through an extra, unnec essary proc ess. ... in order to dec ide what the lex situs is the c ourt has had to use its rules of asc ription of a situs to debt – whic h is, broadly, the plac e of the debtor’s residenc e. By using a c hoic e of law rule whic h hides this fundamental proc ess the c ourt deludes itself as to the real basis for its dec ision and also denies itself any opportunity to ask whether the c hoic e of law rule is appropriate. ... 

In other words, as a debt does not _in reality_ have a _situs_ , deferring to the _lex situs_ requires the c ourt to attempt to loc ate the _situs_ by asking further questions, _eg_ , where the debtor is resident, where the debt is enforc eable, _etc_. This obsc ures the true basis for the c ourt’s c onc lusion on the c hoic e of law and results in the _situs_ being an unstable c onnec ting fac tor. Suc h a situation is not desirable bec ause a c hoic e of law rule requires a c onnec ting fac tor that, ideally, points to a _single_ system of law. The _situs_ of the debt fails to ac hieve this as ( _Rogerson_ at 455): 

 ... A debtor may have more than one residenc e, the debt may be enforc eable in any c ountry in whic h a c ourt will assert jurisdic tion over the debtor and the debt may be payable in more than one plac e. ... 

Indeed, it must not be assumed that, where a debt is situated in England, there will never be a risk of double jeopardy and that jurisdic tion will always be assumed (Cheshire, North & Fawc ett, _Private International Law_ (Oxford University Press, 14th, 2008) at p 1239; Dic ey, Morris & Collins, _The Conflict of Laws_ , vol 2 (Sweet & Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006) (“ _Dicey, Morris & Collins, vol 2_ ”) at para 24– 082). 

98     In _Deutsche Schachtbau-und Tiefbohrgesellschaft mbH v Shell International Petroleum Co Ltd (trading as Shell International Trading Co)_ [1990] 1 AC 295, a German c ompany (“DST”) was awarded, pursuant to arbitration, a sum of money from a c ompany inc orporated in R’As alKhaimah (“Rakoil”). The arbitration award was rec ognised under English law but not under the law in R’As alKhaimah. Before the English c ourt, DST sought to garnish a debt owed to Rakoil by Shell International Petroleum (“Shell”) whic h was the English subsidiary of an AngloDutc h group of c ompanies. Shell was subjec t to the jurisdic tion of the English c ourt and the debt was situated in England. It was, however, c lear that the garnishee order would not be rec ognised in R’As alKhaimah. Payment to DST under an English garnishee order would therefore not disc harge Shell from its obligations under R’As alKhaimah law. It also appeared that the c ourts of R’As alKhaimah were in a position to forc e Shell to pay. As it would have been unfair to make Shell pay twic e, the House of Lords held that the garnishee order should not have been made. 

99     Against this bac kground, several authors have proposed that the _lex causae_ should be the proper law of the _debt_ , rather than the _lex situs_ ( _Rogerson_ at pp 459–460, _Carruthers_ at paras 6.31– 6.32). Indeed, the authors of _Dicey, Morris & Collins, vol 2_ , at paras 24–082 to 24–083 suggest that greater attention should be given to the proper law of the debt in c ases of involuntary assignments: 

 24–082 ... it is unc lear why no direc t attention is paid to the identity of the lex contractus. The disc harge of a debt is normally thought to be a matter governed by the lex contractus , and if that is taken to be a general rule, English legislation will only disc harge a debt whic h is governed by English law. The c orrec t response to this point, ... may be that if another c ourt may refuse to rec ognise the disc harge of the debt as resulting from the English order even though the debt was situated in England, and would hold the third party’s liability to the judgment c reditor to remain 


 undisc harged, the c ourt should dec line to make the order absolute. 

 ... The best illustration of this is Deutsche Schachtbau v Shell International Petroleum Co Ltd. 

 24–083 ... Although the point has not arisen for decision, it is plainly arguable that a foreign order in the nature of a garnishment or third party debt order should not be recognised in England as discharging the liability of the third party to the judgment debtor unless the debt is considered to be so discharged by the lex contractus. 

 [emphasis added] 

100    Similarly, it is observed in _Carruthers_ at paras 6.31–6.32 that: 

 6.31 To formulate a mec hanic al c hoic e of law rule – whether based on the law of the domic ile, or the law of the plac e where the ac t or transac tion oc c urred, or the law of the situs – whic h is intended to govern every question whic h potentially may arise in c onnec tion with the assignment of intangible movable property, c learly is c ontentious. A more viable rule is one whic h is more flexible, and whic h permits ac c ount to be taken of eac h fac tor relevant to the issue in question. The diffic ulty inherent in applying a rigid, exc lusive c onnec ting fac tor, stemming from a resolute c harac terization of the problem in issue, was highlighted in F&K Jabbour v Custodian of Israeli Absentee Property , and more rec ently in Raiffeisen Zentralbank Ősterreich v Five Star General Trading LLC. Staughton LJ in Macmillan saw the benefits of applying in relation to simple c ontrac t debts not the situs rule, per se, but the related, though more flexible, fac tor of ‘proper law of the right’. 

 6.32 ... that is, to the legal system with which the right has its closest and most significant connection; the proper law of the right, in many cases, will constitute the law of the situs of the intangible movable property. But the proper law approach, while leading often to application of the law of the situs, permits additional flexibility insofar as the constituent parts of a particular transaction (eg c apac ity of the parties, formal validity of the transac tion, essential validity of the transac tion etc ) may be referred to the particular legal system with which those issues, respectively, enjoy the closest and most significant connection. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

In light of the foregoing, it is important to note that although the proper law of the debt often c oinc ides with the _lex situs_ , they are c onc eptually different and there may be situations where both lead to the applic ation of different laws. 

**_Stage 3: The governing law_** 

101    Having explained that the appropriate c onnec ting fac tor where the forum c ourt must assess the validity of a foreign garnishee order _vis-a-vis_ a foreign debt is the proper law of the debt ( _ie_ , the system of law bearing the c losest and most signific ant c onnec tion to the debt), I am satisfied that the law governing the issue at hand is Swiss law. At the time of the exec ution of the Chinn Assignment in July 1995, the debt, being the Swiss Deposits, were in Switzerland, the third party debtors were Swiss banks and the Swiss Deposits were the subjec t of the Swiss freeze orders. By c ontrast, the only c onnec tion between the debt and US law was the fac t of the Chinn Assignment itself, arising from proc eedings brought in the US c ourt by Americ an parties. In light of this, I find that it is Swiss law, and not US law, whic h bore the c losest and most signific ant c onnec tion with the Swiss Deposits at the material time. 


102    Dr Lanzlinger was the sole expert on Swiss Law, appearing on behalf of the Republic and PNB. He testified that the Chinn Assignment had no legal effec t whatsoever in Switzerland, reasoning that, as an assignment, the Chinn Assignment had no effec t on the Swiss Deposits and the Foundations sinc e the Foundations were separate and distinc t from the Marc os Estate. In his words: 

 ... what I see here is we have representatives of the estate of Mr Marc os disposing over a c laim they don’t have bec ause it’s not their c laim; it’s the c laim of the Foundations. So therefore under Swiss c ontrac t law, this assignment doesn’t really affec t the banks and it doesn’t affec t the relationship between the banks and the Foundations bec ause for getting there, you would have the Foundations assign the c laim and not someone else. And for the purposes of Swiss law, the representatives of the estate of Marc os are someone else. Therefore, under Swiss law, that assignment of the c laimants of the Foundations against the banks did not take plac e with this piec e of paper. 

103    The forc e of this argument is of c ourse attenuated in light of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court’s holding that the Foundations were “nothing but a legal c onstruc tion to hide the true ownership of the assets of the Marc os family” (see [17] above). However, Dr Lanzlinger had three extra strings to his bow. First, he testified that _even if_ it was assumed that the Foundations were physic ally present during the US proc eedings giving rise to the Chinn Assignment and had purported to assign their interests in the Funds under the Chinn Assignment, the Chinn Assignment would nevertheless be ineffec tive, given the existenc e of the Swiss freeze orders at the material time, whic h froze the Foundations’ ability to transfer their rights _vis-a-vis_ the Funds: 

 But let’s go that far and say let’s assume that as well. Now at the time [the Foundations] signed this piec e of paper purportedly, under the assumption, those assets have already been the subjec t of a freeze order for a long time. So therefore, even if [the Foundations] had transferred or attempted to transfer their rights under their contract with the banks in a legal--theoretically legal correct manner, it would still not have any effect because those---those relationships have been frozen and their rights has been to dispose all the assets has been frozen as well, so to speak, so they couldn’t really assign the claim pending the freezing order. So in effec t, and that is I refer to that dec ision in my dec laration. There is Supreme Court dec ision of the year 2000, the Swiss Supreme Court, whic h, made it c lear that pending a freeze of a c laim, you c annot assign that c laim, whic h is what would happen here as well. [emphasis added] 

104    Sec ond, Dr Lanzlinger explained that assuming that the Chinn Assignment was a c ourt order, it had no effec t whatsoever in Switzerland sinc e it was not registered and dec lared enforc eable in Switzerland: 

 Assuming it is a Court order, whic h I understand it to be, it would only then have effec t in Switzerland against the banks and the parties over whic h Swiss Courts have jurisdic tion. If that order has been dec lared is enforc eable in Switzerland bec ause the Hawaiian Court ac tion do not have any effec t in the Swiss territory unless it’s been dec lared enforc eable. And that there was no attempt to get there and if---if they were, intend to get there, it would not have been dec lared enforc eable. ... 

105    Third, Dr Lanzlinger stated in his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief that the Swiss c ourts would, in any event, refuse to rec ognise the Chinn Assignment bec ause the Swiss deposits were already subjec t to existing c riminal Swiss freeze orders: 

53\. At the time the Chinn Assignment was signed in 1995, the Marc os Assets were already the 


 Mr Elias: My first question on this is, why is it that you have not mentioned the freezing order in Switzerland in all your affidavit? Why did you ignore the fac t that there was a freezing order in Switzerland as early as 1986? Is there a reason you omitted it from your opinion and affidavit? Prof Levine: I was only asked to assume c ertain fac ts in the c ase, er, I don’t think it’s relevant either to what I have to say about the assignment. Mr Elias: Let’s try my question again, why did you ignore it? Bec ause your instruc tions were not to foc us on it or pay attention to it? Prof Levine: Nobody has shown me a freezing order. 

 ... 

 Mr Elias: So basic ally I c an put this very simply. Bec ause you were not told about this, you didn’t pay any attention to it and the c onsequenc es thereof has not been c onsidered by you. For a--

 subjec t of [the Swiss freeze orders] ... The orders freezing the Marc os Assets issued by the Swiss c antonal authorities ... were entered pursuant to [the IMAC proc edures], and ac c ordingly, are deemed c riminal c ourt orders under Swiss law. 

54\. [The Swiss freeze orders] were still in effec t when the Chinn Assignment was entered and remained in effec t while the Marc os Assets were in Switzerland. In fac t, the Marc os Assets were subjec t to [the Swiss freeze orders] until the moment they were transferred out of Switzerland to the PNB esc row ac c ounts, as per the judgments of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court in its 10 and 19 Dec ember 1997 dec isions. 

55\. Ac c ordingly, _a Swiss court would not recognize the Chinn Assignment as having any effect whatsoever on the Marcos Assets_. 

 [emphasis added] 

106    In light of the foregoing, the HRVs’ c laim in this interpleader also fails as, under Swiss law, the Chinn Assignment did not vest in the HRVs any proprietary right, interest or title to the Funds. While this c ourt sympathises with the HRVs’ plight during the rule of Ferdinand E Marc os, it must ac t in a princ ipled manner when dealing with suc h questions of law and is bound by the enunc iated princ iples to rejec t the HRVs’ c laim. This result is of c ourse unfortunate, sinc e, as c onfirmed by the c hairman of the PCGG during c ross-examination, no c ompensation of the HRVs has taken plac e out of the sum in exc ess of US$600m whic h has been rec overed by the Republic from the Marc os Estate. However, some c omfort may be drawn from the testimony of the c hairman of PCGG c onfirming that legislation for the c ompensation of the HRVs is being debated. There is thus some hope that the HRVs will soon rec eive the redress they long await. 

107    I should also add that the same result would have been reac hed had US law been the governing law _vis-a-vis_ the effec t of the Chinn Assignment. In this c onnec tion, Ms Bronster testified that under Hawaii law a c ourt has neither the power to exec ute an assignment of property as a means of exec uting a money judgment nor the power to assign out-of-state assets as a means of exec uting a judgment. I note that while Prof Levine for the HRVs argued that the US c ourt had suc h power to order the Chinn Assignment, his opinion was rendered in ignoranc e of the existenc e of the Swiss freeze orders at the material time: 


 Prof Levine: There are a lot of things I wasn’t told about. 

 Mr Mohan: Professor, you will agree with me that as a matter of pure legal princ iples between parties to an assignment, if the parties are under a disability, if one of the parties to an assignment is under any form of disability, the assignment would be ineffec tive? 

 Prof Levine: Correc t. 

 Mr Mohan: Okay. And likewise as between parties to an assignment, third parties would not be affec ted by the assignment. ... 

 Prof Levine: The ownership interest would be unchanged. Mr Mohan: Will be unc hanged, c orrec t. 

 ... 

 Mr Mohan: ... Was any ac t---ac t done to effec t the transfer of the above assets to Robert A Swift? 

 Prof Levine: You mean in---with---with respec t to the banks we’ve talked about? 

 Mr Mohan: Yes. Prof Levine: I don’t---I don’t believe so. 

 Mr Mohan: So on what basis are you saying that the assignment has taken effec t? 

 Prof Levine: Bec ause the assignment took effec t between, as I’ve said, the two parties in front of the Court. It’s---it’s---it’s---again, it c omes bac k to the separate issue of was this the right forum to have the banks do something? That’s a---that’s a separate question on the basis of the assignment. Mr Mohan: Do you agree with me that at this point in time, the funds were not before the Distric t Court in Hawaii? Prof Levine: Correc t. 

 Mr Mohan: ... What jurisdic tion did the Hawaii Court have to deal with assets whic h are in a foreign jurisdic tion? ... 

 Prof Levine: They---they wouldn’t. I mean, they wouldn’t. They would have jurisdic tion over the parties in front of them and then you might need further steps elsewhere. 

 Mr Mohan: So the Court would not have any jurisdic tion in respec t of the funds themselves. Am I c orrec t? 

During c ross-examination by Mr Mohan, Prof Levine c onfirmed again that he had not been aware of the Swiss freeze orders at the time his opinion was rendered. 

108    Furthermore, the HRVs themselves agree that third parties, _eg_ , the Swiss Banks who were not subjec t to the jurisdic tion of the US Court, were not bound to c omply with the direc tion in the Chinn Assignment to “perform all nec essary ac ts to effec t the transfer of the above bank ac c ounts forthwith”. In Prof Levine’s words, “the ownership interest would be unc hanged”: 


 Prof Levine: In a sense like in rem jurisdiction or something, they did not have that jurisdiction. 

 Mr Mohan: Neither would the Court be in a position to determine any questions of ownership of the funds independent of the parties who were before it. Am I correct? 

 Prof Levine: Correct. 

 [emphasis added] 

109    In light of the foregoing, I am of the view that the Chinn Assignment did not vest in the HRVs the title to the Funds at the date of the Chinn Assignment. This c onc lusion renders the Reregistration issue (see [30] above) moot; regardless of whether the Chinn Assignment remained alive after February 2005, its effec t under Swiss law and even US law, was _not_ to vest in the HRVs’ title to the Funds. Consequently, the HRVs’ c laim is dismissed. 

**Analysis of PNB’s claim** 

110    The HRVs deny that, as esc row agent, PNB ever held legal title to the Funds. Instead, they submit that PNB was a one-time c ustodian of the Funds with the bare right of immediate possession, _ie_ , a right to repayment _vis-a-vis_ WestLB, whic h terminated when WestLB interpleaded the Funds and the Singapore c ourts appointed a new esc row agent for the c redit of the present proc eedings. Alternatively, the HRVs argue that PNB renounc ed legal title to the Funds on the day the Forfeiture Judgment was passed and its role as esc row agent terminated. 

111    On c onsideration of the relevant authorities, I rejec t the argument that PNB never held legal title to the Funds. When the Swiss authorities ordered the Funds to be paid to PNB, it did so with the intention of making PNB a stakeholder. The position of a stakeholder was desc ribed in _Harington v Hoggart_ (1830) 1 B & Ad 577 by Lord Tenterden CJ at 586: 

 ... A stakeholder does not rec eive the money for either party, he rec eives it for both; and until the event is known, it is his duty to keep it in his own hands. If he think fit to employ it and make interest of it, by laying it out in the funds or otherwise, and any loss ac c rue, he must be answerable for that loss. ... 

Similarly, c l 2(vii) of the Esc row Agreements c learly imposed on PNB a duty to hold the moneys pending the outc ome of “a final and enforc eable judgment of the Sandiganbayan or any final and enforc eable judgment of any c ompetent c ourt in the Philippines”. 

112    In _Thomson Hill Pte Ltd v Chang Erh and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR(R) 366</span> (“ _Thomson Hill_ ”), our Singapore Court of Appeal c onsidered the legal position of a stakeholder. At [11], it first took c ognisanc e of Lord Denning MR’s dissenting dec ision in _Burt v Claude Cousins & Co Ltd_ [1971] 2 QB 426 at 435–436, where his lordship desc ribed a stakeholder as a trustee for both vendor and purc haser. It observed that Lord Denning’s statement appeared to have been approved by the House of Lords in _Sorrell v Finch_ [1977] AC 728 ( _Thomson Hill_ at [11]), before noting that that position had been c hallenged by Pennyc uic k VC in _Potters v Loppert_ [1973] Ch 399 ( _Thomson Hill_ at [15]): 

 ... Ac c ording to Denning MR in ... Burt v Claude Cousins , the status of a stakeholder is that of a trustee. However, this view of the matter was dissented from by Pennyc uic k VC in Potters v Loppert [1973] Ch 399, who felt perplexed that Denning MR should on the one hand desc ribe the 


 stakeholder as a trustee and yet on the other hand say that the stakeholder was not liable for interest arising from the deposit. It has always been a rule of equity that a trustee is accountable for profit derived from his trust estate. Pennyc uic k VC preferred to hold that the stakeholder’s liability was of a c ontrac tual nature. We would be inc lined to ac c ept the latter as the c orrec t view of the matter. There is no need to further label the stakeholder as a trustee or agent. The position of a stakeholder is no doubt similar to that of a trustee, but they are not identical. [emphasis added] 

113    The diffic ulty the Court of Appeal in _Thomson Hill_ fac ed with c harac terising the stakeholder as trustee without qualific ation was the stakeholder’s entitlement to interest arising from the deposit. That diffic ulty does not arise in this c ase sinc e the Esc row Agreements spec ific ally provided that the interest would follow the esc row funds. Signific antly, the Esc row Agreements state that PNB was “authorised to perform trust func tions” and instruc ted PNB to ring fenc e the Funds, _and interest on the Funds_ , in separate ac c ounts. The material portions of the Esc row Agreements are as follows: 

 This ESCROW AGREEMENT exec uted ... between: 

 [PCGG] 

 -and

 [PNB], a c ommerc ial banking c orporation ... authorized to perform trust func tions through its Trust Banking Group ... 

 ... 

1\. Certain funds (the Esc row Funds) will be delivered and deposited in ac c ordanc e with an order by Examining Magistrate Peter Cosandy, or any order upon appeal (the “Order”) ... into an ac c ount of [PNB]. 

2\. [PNB] will 

 (i) keep the Esc row Funds rec eived ... and any interest and other earnings on said Esc row Funds in an ac c ount ... referred to as the “Ac c ount”); 

 (ii) keep the Esc row Funds and any interest or other earning in the c urrenc y as rec eived unless reinvested in ac c ordanc e with the Investment Polic y [ordered by the Swiss authorities]; 

 (iii) keep any shares, bonds or other sec urities as rec eived unless reinvested in ac c ordanc e with the Investment Polic y; 

 (iv) ... 

 (v) invest any moneys or time deposits rec eived with or through any of the banks named or desc ribed in the Order, or to reinvest the proc eeds of any shares, bonds or any other sec urities by way of payment, repayment or otherwise, in either time deposits or, in c ase of bonds or similar, in equivalent sec urities, all subjec t to instruc tions as follows, and all with the general aim to retain the value of the Esc row Funds rec eived. 

 ... 


5\. We hereby guarantee that the Esc row Funds, if invested with a Philippines’ bank or otherwise, will not bec ome the asset of suc h bank or other body where the investment is made, but remain the Esc row Funds whic h the Ac c ount is entitled to, and therefore suc h Esc row Fund will not be affec ted by any rec eivership, bankruptc y, insolvenc y or other measure taken over suc h banks or the other body’s Esc row Funds, and that suc h Esc row Funds will not be pledged or enc umbered otherwise save in ac c ordanc e with the agreement between [the Foundations] and the [PCGG]. 

In light of the foregoing, I am of the view that PNB holds legal title to the funds as trustee of the same. 

114    Even if I am mistaken in my c harac terisation of PNB’s legal position as trustee, it still remains c ertain that legal title to the Funds was transferred to PNB. This was the finding of fac t made by the Court of Appeal in an earlier dec ision on an interloc utory summons on the same matter: see _Republic of the Philippines v Maler Foundation_ <span class="citation">[2008] 2 SLR(R) 857</span> (“ _CA 7/2007_ ”). In partic ular, the c ourt held ( _CA 7/2007_ at [29]) that: 

 The legal relationship between PNB, as the depositor of the Funds and the original ac c ount holder, and [WestLB], as the depositee bank, was originally that of c reditor and debtor. As suc h, PNB had the legal title to the Funds and was entitled to immediate repayment of the Funds as and when the deposits matured. PNB did demand repayment of the Funds from [WestLB], but was unable to obtain payment as [WestLB] had by then rec eived adverse c laims from [the Foundations]. [emphasis added] 

The c ourt in _CA 7/2007_ went on to hold at [63(c )] that: 

 There was no reason for PNB to make a c laim to the Funds on [the Republic ’s] behalf when PNB itself as in a position to c laim the Funds on its (PNB’s) own behalf. As the original account holder and the legal owner of the Funds while they were held in accounts at [WestLB], PNB was in as good a position as [the Republic] to recover the Funds from [WestLB]. Any ac tion taken by PNB to rec over the Funds for itself would have been done not on behalf of [the Republic] (whic h c laimed a proprietary interest in the Funds by reason of the Forfeiture Order), but on its (PNB’s) own behalf, albeit for the benefit of [the Republic]. [emphasis in original in italic s’ emphasis added in bold italic s] 

115    PNB was not divested of its legal title when the Funds were ordered to be held by D&N, and subsequently HEP, sinc e it is c lear that any order made by the c ourt for deposit of the property pending determination of title is intended to release the applic ant from the proc eedings as soon as possible, and is not in and of itself a determination of title (GP Selvam, _Singapore Civil Procedure_ (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2007) at para 17/5/12). This is in line with the rationale behind the interpleader proc ess whic h is instituted to provide relief to an applic ant who is harassed by c ompeting legal c laims against the same property suc h that he does not know to whom the property ought to be delivered, henc e c ompelling him to prosec ute the c laims and have them adjudic ated upon (see _De La Rue v Hernu, Peron & Stockwell Ltd_ [1936] 2 KB 164 at 171–172). An alleged adverse c laim c annot divest the initial owner of his _prima facie_ title; the initial owner retains an interest in the property to remain a c laimant in the interpleader. As the c ourt in _CA 7/2007_ held at [14]: 

 On 24 Marc h 2004, the c ourt ... ordered the Funds to be transferred to an esc row ac c ount in the name of PNB’s then solic itors, [D&N], “for the c redit of these proc eedings”. However, the c ourt did not remove PNB as the esc row agent (and this would be c onsistent with the princ iple of c omity as PNB had been appointed as suc h by [Esc row Agreements] between [the Republic ] and 


 the Swiss authorities). As suc h, D&N (and later [HEP]) presumably held the Funds as PNB’s nominee, but subjec t to the c ontrol of the c ourt for the c redit of the interpleader proc eedings. ... [emphasis added] 

D&N, and subsequently HEP, held the Funds as PNB’s nominees, subjec t to the c ourt’s c ontrol for the c redit of these proc eedings. In other words, until title is c onc lusively determined in these proc eedings, PNB’s position as ac c ount holder of the WestLB bank ac c ount gives it a _prima facie_ interest in the Funds whic h it may assert in the interpleader. 

116    Finally, the argument regarding PNB’s alleged “renounc ement of title” is untenable as the ac tual legal status of the property is a matter of law to be determined by the c ourt; parties’ perc eption of their status c annot affec t the c ourt’s judgment of the matter. 

**Conclusion** 

117    For the reasons stated above, I dismiss the c laim by the Republic. The Republic ’s c laim was premised on the Forfeiture Judgment, whic h this c ourt c annot rec ognise given that the Funds were never in the Philippines (see [63]–[65] above). In any event, I have explained (see [66]–[74] above) that the Republic ’s c laim depends on this c ourt’s indirec t enforc ement of a foreign penal law (RA 1379), whic h this c ourt would dec line to do. 

118    The HRVs’ c laim is also dismissed sinc e the Chinn Assignment, whic h they seek to rely on, failed to transfer title in the Funds to them under Swiss law (see [102]–[109] above). On the other hand, the c laim by PNB, whic h ac quired legal title to the Funds via the Esc row Agreements is allowed. Consequently, the Foundations have failed to demolish all the other opposing c laims. Their c laim is, ac c ordingly, also dismissed. 

119    I will hear the parties on c osts.
