**George Wei J:** 

**Introduction** 

1       This suit revolves around a patent for an in-vehic le c amera that c an be used to rec ord events before, during and after an ac c ident. The plaintiff c ommenc ed the ac tion c laiming that the defendant’s offering of three of its devic es for sale c onstitutes an infringement of the plaintiff’s patent. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff’s patent is invalid, and if valid, is not infringed. It c ounterc laims for groundless threats of proc eedings. 

2       The trial of this suit was heard over four days in August 2016, with c losing submissions filed on 30 September 2016. I now deliver my judgment. 

**Background facts** 

3       The plaintiff, Mr Lee Tat Cheng (“the Plaintiff”), is the proprietor of a patent known as an “automotive ac c ident rec ordal system” (Patent No 87795) (“the Patent in Suit”). The patent spec ific ation states that the invention relates to “a system whic h may be installed in a vehic le, in partic ular, an automobile, to rec ord visual data leading up to the event of a dangerous situation 

requiring sharp braking or an ac c ident”. [note: 1] 


 Claim Description 

 1 A rec ording system, for installation in or on a vehic le, c omprising a system c ontroller, at least one optic al rec order, at least one sensor and an ignition monitor, the ignition monitor providing means to send a signal to the system c ontroller on detec tion of an ignition voltage, the system c ontroller bring c onnec ted to the at least one optic al rec order to switc h on operation thereof on rec eiving said ignition monitor signal, wherein the at least one sensor is provided to send a signal to the system c ontroller on detec tion of a dec eleration or impac t, the system c ontroller providing means to switc h off the at least one optic al rec order after a fixed interval after rec eiving the sensor signal. 

 2 A rec ording system as c laimed in Claim 1 further c omprising a standby power supply and a timer switc h c onnec ted to the at least one sensor, the standby power supply being c onnec table to the at least one optic al rec order on operation of the timer switc h. 

 3 A rec ording system as c laimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the at least one optic al rec order is provided with an internal memory store. 

 4 A rec ording system as c laimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the at least one optic al rec order is c onnec ted to a separate memory store. 

 5 A rec ording system as c laimed in any prec eding c laim wherein the at least one sensor is an ac c elerometer. 

 6 A rec ording system as c laimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4 wherein the at least one sensor is an impac t detec tor. 

 7 A rec ording system as c laimed in any prec eding c laim wherein the at least one optic al rec order is a digital c amera. 

 8 A rec ording devic e as c laimed in any of Claims 1 to 6 wherein the at least one optic al rec order is a digital c amc order. 

4       The Patent in Suit was filed on 1 April 1999, published on 16 April 2002 and granted on 31 May 

2002\. [note: 2] Sinc e then, the Plaintiff has renewed the Patent in Suit on a yearly basis, most rec ently on 26 January 2015. The Patent in Suit c onsists of 22 c laims, of whic h only Claims 1 to 8 are in issue in this c ase. For c onvenienc e, these are set out in the table below: 

5       It is undisputed that Claims 2 to 8 relate bac k to Claim 1. [note: 3] 

6       The mec hanic s or the working of the invention protec ted by the Patent in Suit will be expanded on later in the judgment. For now, it suffic es to note that the invention essentially relates to an invehic le c amera whic h turns on automatic ally and begins rec ording images when the driver turns the ignition key of the vehic le. The c amera rec ords in a c yc lic al fashion. Later pic tures override earlier rec orded images suc h that only the most rec ent images are stored. Upon impac t or sudden dec eleration, suc h as in the event of an ac c ident, the main power supply to the c amera turns off. The c amera instead rec eives alternative power from a “standby power supply” and will c ontinue rec ording for a fixed interval of five to ten sec onds after the main power supply has been terminated. Thereafter, the standby power supply switc hes off and the rec ording of images stops. The most rec ently rec orded images ( _ie_ , those just before and after the ac c ident) are stored in memory. 


7       The defendant, Maka GPS Tec hnologies Pte Ltd (“the Defendant”), is a c ompany inc orporated in Singapore having its registered offic e address at 2 Alexandra Road, #02-03, Singapore 159919. It c arries on the business of a wholesaler and retailer of telec ommunic ation equipment and c ar ac c essories parts and servic es. It is the exc lusive distributor of the following devic es in Singapore: [note: 4] 

 (a) Marbella MX5 HD Digital Rec order (“MX5”); 

 (b) Marbella MX6 HD Digital Rec order (“MX6”); and 

 (c ) Marbella QB6 HD Digital Rec order (“QB6”). 

(Collec tively, “the Devic es”) 

8       The Devic es are marketed under the name “RoadCorder”, and are on-board c ameras for 

automobiles whic h c ontinuously rec ord the road ahead while the vehic le is in motion. [note: 5] It was undisputed that the tec hnic al spec ific ations and mode of operation of eac h of the Devic es are similar. [note: 6] The differenc es between the Devic es c an be summarised as follows: MX5 is the most basic 

model of the three. MX6 is an improved version of MX5 and produc es rec ordings of a higher resolution and c larity. QB6 is a further improvement on MX6, and is designed to rec ord the view from both the 

front and rear of the automobile in high-definition resolution. [note: 7] These differenc es, however, are not relevant for the purposes of the present suit. 

9       Mr Huang Shih Chia @ Johnny Huang (“Mr Huang”) is the managing direc tor of the Defendant. [note: 8] 

**_The cease and desist letters_** 

10     It is undisputed that prior to the c ommenc ement of the present Suit No 228 of 2015 (“the present suit”), the Plaintiff’s solic itors sent two c ease and desist letters to the Defendant. 

11     In the first letter dated 13 February 2014 (“the 13 February 2014 letter”), the Plaintiff c laimed that by selling the _MX5 (only)_ , the Defendant had infringed the Patent in Suit. The Plaintiff demanded that the Defendant exec ute a Letter of Undertaking to c ease selling the MX5 immediately and to, 

within seven days of the Letter of Undertaking: [note: 9] 

 (a) deliver up all units of the MX5 in its possession; 

 (b) pay the sum of $50,000 as damages allegedly suffered by the Plaintiff; and 

 (c ) pay the sum of $2,000 for the Plaintiff’s legal and investigative c osts. 

12     Some eight months later, in the sec ond letter dated 28 Oc tober 2014 (“the 28 Oc tober 2014 letter”), the Plaintiff c laimed that _all_ the three Devic es had infringed the Patent in Suit. The letter stated that the Plaintiff was minded not to enforc e its stric t legal rights, provided that the Defendant, 

within seven days of the 28 Oc tober 2014 letter: [note: 10] 

 (a) Signed a Letter of Undertaking, ac knowledging that it had infringed the Patent in Suit and agreeing to the terms detailed in (b)–(e) below; 


 Product Infringing particulars 

 MX5 (a) MX5 c omprises all the features of Claim 1 of the Patent in Suit; (b) MX5 c omprises all the features of Claims 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and/or 8 of the Patent in Suit. 

 MX6 (a) MX6 c omprises all the features of Claim 1 of the Patent in Suit; (b) MX6 c omprises all the features of Claims 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and/or 8 of the Patent in Suit. 

 QB6 (a) QB6 c omprises all the features of Claim 1 of the Patent in Suit; (b) QB6 c omprises all the features of Claims 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and/or 8 of the Patent in Suit. 

 MX5, MX6 and/or QB6 Claim 4 of the Patent in Suit is infringed when: 

 (1) an external (and separate) memory store is offered to the c ustomers, for free, at the same time when these c ustomers purc hase MX5, MX6 and/or QB6, for use with MX5, MX6 and/or QB6; and/or (2) the Devic es’ optic al rec order is c onnec ted to a separate (and external) memory store (in the form of a memory c ard. 

 (b) Ac c ounted to the Plaintiff the number of units of eac h produc t sold, and paid the sum of $12 per unit sold as a lic ense fee; 

 (c ) Entered into a Lic enc e Agreement for the future sale of the Devic es; 

 (d) Paid c osts of $3,750 for the expert opinion obtained to c onfirm that the Devic es infringed the Patent in Suit; and 

 (e) Paid c osts of $7,500 for the investigation fees and professional fees inc urred with regards to the infringement of the Patent in Suit by the Devic es. 

13     It appears that the Defendant did not c omply with the Plaintiff’s demands in both the 13 February 2014 letter and the 28 Oc tober 2014 letter (c ollec tively, “the c ease and desist letters”). 

**The Plaintiff’s pleaded case** 

14     On 10 Marc h 2015, the Plaintiff c ommenc ed the present suit against the Defendant, alleging that “by offering the [Devic es] for sale in Singapore and/or an external memory store for use with the [Devic es] without obtaining the Plaintiff’s c onsent, the Defendant has infringed the Plaintiff’s Patent” 

under s 66(1) of the Patents Ac t (Cap 221, 2005 Rev Ed). [note: 11] The partic ulars of the alleged 

infringement are as follows: [note: 12] 

15     The Plaintiff c laims the 28 Oc tober 2014 letter made known to the Defendant that he was infringing the Plaintiff’s patent. The Defendant however c ontinued to offer the Devic es for sale, and 

failed, refused and/or neglec ted to pay the Plaintiff any lic ense fees. [note: 13]

16     The Plaintiff thus c laimed a delivery up of the Devic es, an ac c ount of profits for the sale of the 

Devic es or damages to be assessed, interest and c osts. [note: 14] 

**The Defence and counterclaim** 

**_Invalidity_** 

17     The Defendant’s defenc e is two-fold. First, the Defendant alleges that the Patent in Suit is and 

has always been invalid. [note: 15] In this respec t, the Defendant filed partic ulars of objec tion against the Patent in Suit pursuant to O 87A r 3(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). 

18     The Defendant alleges that the Patent in Suit is not a patentable invention bec ause it is not 

novel and does not involve an inventive step, [note: 16] c iting the following doc uments as prior art: 

19     The Defendant’s position is that Claim 1 is not novel in light of D3, as all the features of Claim 1 

of the Patent in Suit have been disc losed by D3. [note: 17] In other words, the prior art relied on for the assertion that Claim 1 is antic ipated is limited to D3. 

20     The Defendant also asserts that the Claims in the Patent in Suit lac k an inventive step by 

reason of various c ombinations of D1 to D5, as well as c ommon general knowledge. [note: 18] 

**_Non-infringement_** 

21     In the alternative, in the event that the Patent in Suit is held to be valid, the Defendant argues that it is nonetheless not infringed by the Defendant’s ac ts. In this regard, the Defendant’s position is 

that the essential features of Claim 1 of the Patent are not found in the Devic es: [note: 19] 


 Means to send a signal to the system c ontroller on detec tion of an ignition voltage 

 No c omponent to detec t ignition voltage and c onsequently, no means to send a signal to the system c ontroller on detec tion of an ignition voltage 

 Means to switc h off at least one optic al rec order after a fixed interval after rec eiving the sensor signal 

 No software or hardware operating as timer or timer switc h 

22     The Defendant argues that sinc e Claims 2 to 8 are dependent c laims ( _ie_ , c laims that relate bac k 

to Claim 1), they are c onsequently also not infringed by any of the Devic es. [note: 20] 

**_Counterclaim_** 

23     The Defendant c ounterc laims that prior to the issuanc e of the writ of summons and statement of c laim on 10 Marc h 2015, the Plaintiff made threats by the c ease and desist letters. The c ease and desist letters state that the Defendant has infringed the Patent in Suit by selling MX5 and/or the Devic es. The Defendant c laims that the c ease and desist letters are groundless threats of 

infringement proc eedings. [note: 21] 

24     The Defendant thus c laims a dec laration that the Patent in Suit is invalid and an order that the Patent be revoked. Alternatively, if the Patent in Suit is found valid, the Defendant seeks a dec laration that there is non-infringement of the Patent in Suit by the Defendant. It also seeks a dec laration that the threats in the c ease and desist letters are unjustified, an injunc tion to restrain the Plaintiff from c ontinuing suc h threats against the Defendant, its offic ers, servants or agents, as 

well as damages to be assessed. [note: 22] 

**The witnesses** 

25     At the trial, the Plaintiff and the Defendant eac h c alled one fac tual witness and one expert witness. The Plaintiff was his own fac tual witness. The Defendant’s fac tual witness was Mr Huang, who it will be rec alled is the managing direc tor of the Defendant. Eac h party also engaged its own patent agent as an expert witness. The Plaintiff engaged Mr Martin Sc hweiger (“Mr Sc hweiger”) while the Defendant appointed Dr Freeman Yu Zhenhua (“Dr Yu”). Eac h expert prepared three reports. I will refer to these reports, where relevant, in the c ourse of my dec ision. 

**Issues** 

26     In light of the above, the main issues before this c ourt are as follows: 

 (a) Patent c onstruc tion; 

 (b) Validity of the Patent in Suit; 

 (c ) Infringement of the Patent in Suit; and 

 (d) The Defendant’s c ounterc laim for groundless threats of proc eedings. 

27     Before delving into the main issues, I make a few preliminary observations about the expert witnesses in this trial. This is nec essary sinc e the parties’ submissions have raised some issues on the reliability of the expert evidenc e, in partic ular, the evidenc e of the Defendant’s expert, Dr Yu. 


**Preliminary observations: expert evidence** 

**_The legal principles_** 

28     I begin by summarising the role of experts in legal proc eedings involving patent law. In patent invalidity and patent infringement proc eedings, experts are almost always c alled to give evidenc e to assist the c ourt. This would inc lude evidenc e on the meaning of tec hnic al words and phrases in the patent spec ific ation, the sc ope of the c laims in the patent and what exac tly is disc losed by the prior art: see David Llewelyn, “The Use of Experts in Legal Proc eedings in Singapore Involving Intellec tual Property Rights” (2013) 25 SAc LJ 480 (“ _Llewelyn_ ”) at para 4. The questions of law that must be answered depend on the legal issue that has arisen. For example, in some c ases it may be whether there was suffic ient disc losure of the c laimed invention in the spec ific ations suc h that the c laimed invention c an be performed by the skilled reader. In other c ases, it may be whether the c laimed invention is novel ( _ie_ , antic ipated by the prior art) or involves an inventive step. Frequently, it will c onc ern the question as to whether the defendant’s produc t or proc ess infringes the plaintiff’s patent by reason of it embodying all the essential elements of the c laimed invention. No matter what the question of law is, expert evidenc e c an be helpful in explaining tec hnic al language, to demonstrate the prac tic al working of the invention and to point out differenc es between the prior art and the c laimed invention as well as differenc es between the c laimed invention and alleged infringement. But when all is said and done, the questions of law are for the Court alone to dec ide. 

29     In short, the expert’s role is to assist the c ourt in its task of viewing the patent c laims through the eyes of the person skilled in the art at the time the patent was applied for. This person is also known as the “notional skilled reader”. The notional skilled reader has long been rec ognised as an artific ial legal c onstruc t. He is not nec essarily an individual who is an “expert” in the relevant field. The desc ription of the attributes of the notional skilled reader by Laddie J in _Pfizer Ltd’s Patent_ [2001] FSR 16 at [62] bears repeating: 

 ...[The notional skilled reader] is a legal c reation... He is deemed to have looked at and read public ly available doc uments and to know of public uses in the prior art. He understands all languages and dialec ts. He never misses the obvious nor stumbles on the inventive. He has no private idiosync ratic preferenc es or dislikes. He never thinks laterally. He differs from all real people in one or more of these c harac teristic s. ... 

30     In essenc e, a notional skilled reader should fulfil the following c riteria: 

 (a) possess c ommon general knowledge of the subjec t matter in question; 

 (b) have a prac tic al interest in the subjec t matter of the patent or be likely to ac t on the direc tions given in it; and 

 (c ) Whilst unimaginative, be reasonably intelligent and wish to make the direc tions of the patent work. 

See _Mcghan Medical UK Ltd v Nagor Limited_ (Case No CH 1999 1720), c ited in _A Guide to Patent Law in Singapore_ (Alban Kang gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2009) (“ _A Guide to Patent Law in Singapore_ ”) at para 7.2.5. It is well-established that it is ultimately for the c ourt to dec ide who the relevant person skilled in the art is. For example, in _Ng Kok Cheng v Chua Say Tiong_ <span class="citation">[2001] 2 SLR(R) 326</span>, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) found (at [23]) that the defendant’s expert did not possess the skills and attributes of the notional skilled reader to whom the patent spec ific ation was addressed. Bec ause of this finding, Prakash J held that the defendant had failed to adduc e any expert 


evidenc e on the art. 

31     The learned author of _A Guide to Patent Law in Singapore_ c omments (at para 7.2.9) that “[a]s far as possible, experts should possess the relevant tec hnic al knowledge or experienc e”. The author also states that “[p]atent agents... are not deemed to be an expert even though they have the relevant tec hnic al qualific ations”. The question as to whether a patent agent c an give expert evidenc e must depend on the fac ts and c irc umstanc es of eac h c ase. This will inc lude the experienc e of the patent agent in working in the relevant field of art (if any). I also agree with the observation by Jac ob LJ in in _SmithKline Beecham plc and others v Apotex Europe Ltd and others_ [2004] All ER (D) 431 at [52] that what is important is “not so muc h the expert’s personal view but his reasons for that view”. The c ourt must examine the expert’s reasons against the standard of “the notional unimaginative skilled man”. 

32     In _Mühlbauer AG v Manufacturing Integration Technology Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2010] 2 SLR 724</span> (“ _Mühlbauer_ ”), Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA undersc ored (at [48]) the reality that many experts would not themselves fall within the c ategory of the notional skilled reader, as the expert might possess extraordinary knowledge whic h goes _beyond_ what a reasonable person skilled in the art would possess. Indeed, the real-life expert is likely to possess imagination and the ability to think outside of the box. Take for example, Albert Einstein who was an assistant patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Offic e at the time when his ground-breaking papers on Brownian motion, the photoelec tric effec t (for whic h he was awarded the Nobel Prize 1921), spec ial relativity and the relationship between mass and energy were published in 1905. On the other hand, as Laddie J also observed in _Pfizer Ltd’s Patent_ (at [63]), the genius (real-life expert) c an sometimes also miss the obvious. 

33     Above all, an expert must realise that he is not an advoc ate for the position adopted by the party retaining him, and “his advoc ac y is limited to supporting his independent views and not his c lient’s c ause” ( _Vita Health Laboratories Pte Ltd v Pang Seng Meng_ [2004] SLR(R) 162 (“ _Vita Health_ ”) at [83]). He must “remain detac hed from the fray and should not have any interest in the outc ome of the proc eedings nor partiality to the fac ts in issue”: _Vita Health_ at [80]. 

34     This is partic ularly evident from O 40A r 2 and r 3(2)( _h_ ) of the Rules of Court whic h make it c lear that the expert’s duty to the c ourt is _higher_ than that to his c lient: 

 Expert’s duty to the Court (O. 40A, r. 2) 

**2.** —(1) It is the _duty_ of an expert to _assist the Court_ on the matters within his expertise. 

 (2) This duty overrides any obligation to the person from whom he has received instructions or by whom he is paid. 

 Requirements of expert’s evidence (O. 40A, r. 3) 

 ... 

 (2) An expert’s report must — 

 ... 

 ( h ) c ontain a statement that the expert understands that in giving his report, his duty is to the Court and that he complies with that duty. 


 [emphasis added] 

35     Unfortunately, it has been observed that despite the c lear legislative provisions, the diffic ulties generated by the issue of bias with regards to experts for the respec tive parties (whether with or without merit) are “perennial in nature” ( _Mühlbauer_ ([32] _supra_ ) at [44]), perhaps bec ause of the fac t that at the very c ore, every expert is appointed and remunerated by the party who has engaged his or her servic es. In c ases of suc h allegations, the relevant test is that of _actual_ partiality, rather than merely the _appearance_ of partiality: _Mühlbauer_ at [47]. Indeed, _Llewelyn_ c omments at para 26 that the expert need not be independent (he c ould be an employee in appropriate c irc umstanc es), although he usually is in order to avoid ac c usations of bias. 

**_Is the Defendant’s expert a person skilled in the art?_** 

36     I now move on to deal with some preliminary issues relating to the expert witnesses in the trial of the present suit, whic h the Plaintiff raises. The first relates to the qualific ations of the expert witness. This mainly arises from the Plaintiff’s submission that Dr Yu, the Defendant’s expert witness, “does not have suffic ient experienc e and/or knowledge in the art”. Ac c ording to the Plaintiff, this is ostensibly bec ause Dr Yu has never been direc tly engaged in the automobile or automobile-related industry. Instead, his work experienc e mainly involved the maintaining of blast furnac es, automation 

equipment in the c lothing industry, and the designing of irons. [note: 23] The Plaintiff also relies on Dr 

Yu’s own c andid admission at trial that he was “a c ompetent person, not a skilled person”. [note: 24] By c ontrast, the Plaintiff says that its own expert, Mr Sc hweiger, is well-versed in the relevant art as 

demonstrated by his _curriculum vitae_. [note: 25] 

37     I find the Plaintiff’s allegation that Dr Yu does not possess the nec essary experienc e and knowledge to provide expert evidenc e to be without merit. In my view, Dr Yu, who is a patent agent, qualifies as an expert who is able to assist this c ourt on the meaning of the tec hnic al words used in the spec ific ations and c laims, the prior art, the workings of the c laimed invention and the alleged infringing Devic es. 

38     In reac hing this dec ision, I am mindful that a qualified patent agent does not bec ome an “expert” simply bec ause of that qualific ation. Instead, I have reac hed my c onc lusion on Dr Yu’s suitability to provide expert evidenc e based on his engineering qualific ations and previous work experienc e. Dr Yu possesses a Graduate Diploma in Metallurgic al Mac hinery from the Shanghai College of Metallurgy (1990), a Bac helor’s Degree in Mec hatronic Engineering (Robotic s) from Shanghai University (1995) and a Doc tor of Philosophy in Engineering from the University of Birmingham, UK (2000). Dr Yu is also a Member of the Institution of Mec hanic al Engineers, UK and the Institution of Engineering and Tec hnology, UK. One of his spec ialisations, as stated in his _curriculum vitae_ , is in 

mac hinery and elec tronic s. [note: 26] Indeed, Dr Yu has work experienc e in the area of c omputer-aided 

design and c omputer-aided manufac turing. [note: 27] The view that I have formed is that his qualific ations and his work experienc e in area of elec tronic s and c ontrol systems is c onsistent with Dr Yu possessing c ommon general knowledge of the subjec t matter of the Patent in Suit. While Dr Yu has not worked in the spec ific area of automobile equipment, elec tronic s or optic al rec ording equipment, I am nonetheless satisfied that Dr Yu is able to ac t on the direc tions provided by the Patent in Suit. 

39     I am also c ognisant of the observation by the Court of Appeal in _Mühlbauer_ ([32] _supra_ ) at [48] that a person skilled in the art need not assume knowledge and expertise that goes beyond what a _reasonable_ person skilled in the art would possess, and the person does not need to be someone who possesses _extraordinary_ knowledge and expertise. In reac hing this c onc lusion, I find support in the c omments by _Llewelyn_ at para 26 that the expert need not himself be skilled in the art in question, 


although he usually is. The important question is whether the c hosen “expert” is able to assist the c ourt in viewing the patent c laims _through the eyes of the person skilled in the art_. On the whole, I found Dr Yu’s analysis to be logic al, c lear, and of assistanc e to this c ourt. This is not surprising given his professional qualific ations in engineering and his work experienc e in industry prior to bec oming a patent agent. Where appropriate, his opinions have been ac c epted, as will bec ome c lear later in my judgment. The areas where I have preferred the view of the Plaintiff’s expert, Mr Sc hweiger, will also be made c lear. 

**_Are the experts neutral?_** 

40     Ac c ording to the Plaintiff, Dr Yu “has shown ac tual bias in his evidenc e” as “amply demonstrated” when he went out of his way to find the existenc e of an “ignition monitor” (a term used in the Patent in Suit) in D1 and D3. On the other hand, the Plaintiff asserts that Mr Sc hweiger’s 

evidenc e was given matter-of-fac tly. [note: 28] 

41     While the Defendant does not go so far as to expressly state that Mr Sc hweiger was biased, it also points out that Mr Sc hweiger’s evidenc e was inc onsistent and c ontradic tory at numerous 

instanc es, and that he was not objec tive. [note: 29] 

42     An allegation of bias is serious. It requires the demonstration of _actual_ partiality rather than merely the _appearance_ of partiality (see [35] above). As will bec ome apparent below, although the experts in the present suit eac h adopted positions that supported his c lient’s c ase, the positions taken were generally tenable or at least arguable. There is, in my view, no basis for the allegation of _actual_ bias on the part of either expert, muc h less – in the Plaintiff’s words – an “ampl[e] demonstrat[ion]” of it. 

43     I should, however, again emphasise the importanc e of experts c ontinuously bearing in mind their overriding duty to the c ourt, over and above their duties to their c lients, under O 40A r 2 of the Rules of Court. The c ourt, espec ially when adjudic ating c omplex tec hnic al issues that often arise in patent litigation, will only be assisted by an impartial, c lear and objec tive presentation of the issues by the experts on either side. Even though the expert is retained by his c lient, it would only serve to jeopardise his c lient’s c ase if an expert insists on taking indefensible or extreme positions, or appears overly aggressive and unc ooperative to the opposing party’s c ounsel during the trial. 

44     With that, I now turn to the substantive c ase. 

**Patent construction** 

**_The legal principles_** 

45     The first issue is how the c laims in the Patent in Suit are to be c onstrued. Claim c onstruc tion is vital and arises in c onnec tion with a variety of legal issues in a patent suit. These inc lude: (i) whether the spec ific ations set out an adequate disc losure of the invention; (ii) whether the c laims are supported by the spec ific ations; (iii) whether the c laimed invention is patentable; and (iv) whether the defendant has infringed the patent. The third and fourth issues arise in the present suit. 

46     The relevant provision relating to c laim c onstruc tion is s 113(1) of the Patents Ac t: 

**113.** —(1) For the purposes of this Ac t, an invention for a patent for whic h an applic ation has been made or for whic h a patent has been granted shall, unless the c ontext otherwise requires, be taken to be that spec ified in a _claim_ of the spec ific ation of the applic ation or patent, as the 


 c ase may be, as interpretated by the description and any drawings contained in that specification , and the extent of the protec tion c onferred by a patent or applic ation for a patent shall be determined ac c ordingly. 

 [emphasis added] 

47     Sec tion 25(4) of the Patents Ac t provides that the purpose of a patent spec ific ation is to disc lose the invention in a manner whic h is c lear and c omplete for the invention to be performed by a person skilled in the art. Put broadly, this requires disc losure of suffic ient information to enable the skilled reader to work the c laimed invention. 

48     Sec tion 25(5) of the Patents Ac t goes on to set out the func tion of patent c laims. These are to (a) define the matter for whic h the applic ant seeks protec tion; (b) be c lear and c onc ise; (c ) be supported by the desc ription; and (d) relate to one invention or to a group of inventions whic h are so linked as to form a single inventive c onc ept. 

49     The well-known English c ase of _Catnic Components Limited and Another v Hill & Smith Limited_ [1982] RPC 183 (“ _Catnic_ ”) emphasised (at 242) that a patent spec ific ation c omprises a unilateral statement by the patentee in words of his own c hoosing, addressed to those likely to have a prac tic al interest in the subjec t matter of his invention, by whic h he informs them what he c laims to be the essential features of his invention. There is no doubt this is also the approac h taken in Singapore. The task before the c ourt is to asc ertain what the patentee’s words were intended to c onvey to the notional skilled reader as at the date of the patent applic ation. 

50     The general princ iples as to c onstruc tion and the relationship between spec ific ations and c laims are well-settled. In asc ertaining the sc ope of the patented invention, the c laims themselves are the _principal_ determinant, while the desc ription and other parts of the spec ific ation may _assist_ in the c onstruc tion of the c laims: _First Currency Choice Pte Ltd v Main-Line Corporate Holdings Ltd and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2008] 1 SLR(R) 335</span> (“ _First Currency Choice_ ”) at [23]. 

51     In this respec t, words used in the c laims may be affec ted or defined by what is said in the body of the patent spec ific ation. Claims should not be viewed independently but should instead be c onstrued as part of the whole spec ific ation: _First Currency Choice_ at [24]. 

52     It is not, however, permissible under Singapore patent law to put a gloss on the meaning or to expand the c laims by relying on statements in the spec ific ation where the meaning of the words used in the c laim are c lear and unambiguous. By this, what is meant is that if the c laims have a plain meaning, relianc e ought not be plac ed on the language used in the body of the spec ific ation to make the c laim mean something different. Instead, suc h c laims must be read and given their ordinary and natural meaning without inc orporating extrac ts from the body of the spec ific ation into them: _First Currency Choice_ at [24]. On the same note, it is stated in NgLoy Wee Loon, _Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2014) (“ _Ng-Loy_ ”) at para 33.3.5 that “whilst it is perfec tly legitimate to refer to these other parts in the spec ific ations to assist in c laim c onstruc tion, these other parts are ultimately sec ondary”. 

53     It is also well-established that where there are ambiguities in the language of the c laim, the c laims should be purposively interpreted, in that the interpretation should be highly sensitive to the c ontext of, and bac kground to, the partic ular utteranc e (see _Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd_ [2005] RPC 9 at [32]), rather than a literal interpretation derived from “metic ulous verbal analysis”: _Catnic_ at 243, adopted in _FE Global Electronics Pte Ltd and others v Trek Technology (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 874</span> at [14], and most rec ently affirmed in 


_Mühlbauer_ ([32] _supra_ ) at [22]. 

54     This (purposive) c onstruc tion is an _objective_ one, assessed from the perspec tive of what the notional skilled person would have understood the patentee to mean by the use of the language of the c laims: _Mühlbauer_ ([32] _supra_ ) at [25]. The notional skilled reader interprets the words against the prior art and with c ommon general knowledge. This method of patent c onstruc tion strikes a balanc e between the rights of the patentee and those of third parties: on the one hand, it would give the patentee “the full extent, but no more than the full extent of the monopoly whic h a reasonable person skilled in the art, reading the c laims in c ontext, would think that [the patentee] was intending to c laim” ( _Mühlbauer_ at [24]); on the other hand, it would also allow third parties to know the area within whic h they will be trespassers. 

55     I pause to undersc ore again the point that the addressee of the patent spec ific ations and c laims is the notional skilled reader who is armed with c ommon general knowledge. On this basis, the question is whether the notional skilled reader would find that the words of the c laim are c lear and unambiguous in and of themselves. It does not matter if the lay person ( _ie_ , the non-skilled reader) would think that the meaning of a word or phrase in the c laim is c lear. It appears that this is the reason why Susanna H S Leong, _Intellectual Property Law of Singapore_ (Ac ademy Publishing, 2013) (“ _Susanna Leong_ ”) c omments at para 18.054 that literalism still plays a limited role in Singapore. The problem, however, that was alluded to by Phang JA in _Mühlbauer_ at [40]—[43] is that there is always a danger in adopting an overly high level of abstrac tion when delineating the essential features of a c laimed invention. Put in another way, the question of whether a word or term in the c laim is ambiguous may depend at least in part on what the notional skilled reader thinks the patentee intends to be the essential elements of the c laimed invention. 

56     Bearing these princ iples in mind, I now turn to the c onstruc tion of the Patent in Suit. There are two main parts or expressions used in Claim 1 that are espec ially in dispute between the parties: “ignition monitor” and “a signal sent by the ignition monitor.” 

**_“Ignition monitor”_** 

57     One of the c entral disputes between the parties is in relation to the meaning of an “ignition monitor” in Claim 1. Ac c ording to the Plaintiff, an ignition monitor simply monitors the amplitude of the _direct current (“DC”) voltage_ in the ignition system, whic h is elec tric al in nature. The Plaintiff argues that this is c lear from the wording in the spec ific ation, whic h states that when the ignition monitor detec ts a DC voltage in exc ess of a threshold value, a signal is sent from the ignition monitor to the 

system c ontroller to start up the c amera. [note: 30] The Plaintiff relies on the point that the threshold 

value is expressly stated as lying between 10 and 15 volts. [note: 31] The ignition monitor therefore 

only monitors the ignition _voltage_ and _not_ the engine or engine ignition ac tivities. [note: 32] 

58     I note in passing that the Plaintiff asserts in his submissions that the inventive step in Claim 1 is 

the use or inc lusion of the ignition monitor. [note: 33] The evidenc e of the Plaintiff was that if a driver forgot to turn off his “c ommunic ation devic e” and turned on the c ar engine, the power surge would 

c ause damage to the c ommunic ation devic e. [note: 34] This is bec ause the elec tric al power required to operate the starter motor and to start the engine is very high, in the region of 2,000 volts. This level of power would or c ould damage elec tric al equipment suc h as a radio c ommunic ation devic e that was turned on and c onnec ted to the system. The Plaintiff submits that the detec tion of a “stable ignition voltage” that exc eeds the threshold value (10-15 volts) was essential to avoid power surges that 

may damage elec tronic equipment. [note: 35] The func tion of the ignition monitor was therefore not to 


monitor the voltage at the spark plug. [note: 36] 

59     Under c ross-examination, the Plaintiff’s expert witness, Mr Sc hweiger, explained that the ignition system of a c ar is divided into two c irc uits: he primary c irc uit, whic h operates at a voltage that is almost equal to the c ar battery’s voltage, and a sec ondary c irc uit, whic h has a step-up 

transformer to inc rease the voltage to ignite the spark plugs. [note: 37] In c ases where the ignition system of a vehic le is operated by means of a key, the evidenc e was that a typic al ignition switc h 

would have four positions (labelled “0” to “3” for c onvenienc e): [note: 38] 

 (a) In position 0, the vehic le is essentially powered down as the power supply is disc onnec ted. 

 (b) In position 1, only the vehic le’s ac c essories c an be used. In some models of vehic les, the c igarette lighter is also operable in position 1. The sourc e of the power in position 1 is the c ar battery. 

 (c ) In position 2, the c ar’s ignition c irc uit is powered and all ac c essories would draw power from the ignition system. 

 (d) When the key is engaged in position 3, power is sent to the starter motor and the engine of the c ar is turned on. When the key is in position 3, all ac c essories are switc hed off. The ignition switc h returns automatic ally to position 2 after the key is released. The ac c essories are onc e again powered. When the engine is running and the key is in position 2, the engine also rec harges the c ar battery through an alternator. 

60     The Defendant takes a different view. Ac c ording to the Defendant’s expert, Dr Yu, an “ignition 

monitor” is not a c ommonly used or ac c epted word in the relevant tec hnic al field. [note: 39] The two words should thus be c onstrued separately. With referenc e to the _Cambridge English Dictionary_ , Dr Yu argues that the word “ignition” refers to the elec tric al system in an internal c ombustion engine c ausing the fuel to burn or explode in order to start the internal c ombustion engine. The word “monitor” means a mac hine that regularly tests something. Therefore, c ollec tively, “ignition monitor” would be understood by the skilled person to be a devic e that regularly, periodic ally or c ontinuously 

examines firing ac tivities of an internal c ombustion engine, that is, the ignition system, [note: 40] whic h in turn, produc es the voltage itself. 

61     Dr Yu does not give any reasons as to why the words should be c onstrued separately and by referenc e to standard dic tionary definitions. Indeed, I am c ognisant that where words used in the c laim are ambiguous, there should be a purposive interpretation of the c laim, rather than a literal interpretation derived from “metic ulous verbal analysis” (see [53] above). Given Dr Yu’s view that the phrase is not c ommonly used in the tec hnic al field, it must follow that it would be helpful to look to the desc ription and other parts of the patent spec ific ation to assist in the c onstruc tion of this term in the c laim. After all, the question is what the notional skilled reader would understand the patentee to mean by the words “ignition monitor”. 

62     In the c ontext of the c ore purpose of the c laimed invention, I am unable to see why the notional skilled reader would regard the term as meaning something that regularly, periodic ally or c ontinuously examines _firing activities of an internal combustion engine_. In my assessment, the term “ignition monitor” in Claim 1 does not have a plain and ordinary meaning that c an be simply derived from a standard dic tionary. I am of the view that the notional skilled reader c onfronted by the phrase “ignition monitor” would pause and ask the question: what is the _purpose_ of the ignition monitor? 


63     In my c onstruc tion of the Patent in Suit, I have found the following parts of the spec ific ations espec ially helpful: 

 (a) The ignition monitor is expressly said to provide the means to send a signal to the system c ontroller on detec tion of an ignition voltage. [note: 41] It is also expressly stated in the spec ific ations that the operation of the system is automatic and does not require a skilled operator. [note: 42] 

 (b) The invention is said to c omprise the steps of “monitoring the ignition system of a vehic le” and “providing a signal on detec tion of a voltage in the ignition system” [note: 43] [emphasis added]. 

 (c ) With referenc e to Figure 1 below, in desc ribing an embodiment of the invention by referenc e to Figure 1 below, the ignition monitor 2 is said to monitor the “amplitude of the DC voltage” in the ignition system [note: 44] , and send a signal to the system c ontrol unit 1 when the ignition monitor detec ts a “DC voltage in exc ess of a threshold value, i.e. when the vehic le’s ignition system is ac tivated to start the vehic le”. [note: 45] 

 (d) With referenc e to Figure 1 below, the ignition monitor 2 is direc tly c onnec ted to the ignition system of the vehic le via an input 6. [note: 46] 

 (e) Operationally, the voltage produc ed in the ignition system detec ted by the ignition monitor is as a result of a driver operating the ignition system to start the engine. [note: 47]

 Items 6, 10, 12: Input 

 Items 7, 8, 11: Output 

64     Construed as part of the whole spec ific ation and bearing in mind the language and purpose, I agree with the Plaintiff’s submission that the notional skilled person would have understood the term “ignition monitor” used in Claim 1 to refer to a devic e that monitors the amplitude of the DC voltage in 

the ignition system of a vehic le. [note: 48] It is c lear that the “ignition” monitor is used to monitor the “ignition” status of the ignition system, in order to turn the in-vehic le c amera on and off. Although there are many other ways of detec ting the status of the ignition system, the Patent in Suit for this partic ular invention essentially desc ribes one suc h tec hnique. The method detec ts the amplitude of 

the ignition voltage at about 10-15 volts, and lasting longer than five sec onds. [note: 49] The “voltage” that is detec ted by the ignition monitor is _from or produced by_ the ignition system, and not 

the voltage from any other sourc e, suc h as from the spark plug in a vehic le. [note: 50] The ignition monitor is not a devic e that monitors the engagement of the starter motor and spark plugs (2, volts) and the operation of the sec ondary c irc uit of the ignition system. 

65     The Defendant submits that the use of words “ignition monitor” is deliberate bec ause the presenc e of ignition ac tivity would signify that the internal c ombustion engine has been started. The use of the term “ignition monitor”, it is argued, must mean that Claim 1 requires ac tual ignition of an 

internal c ombustion engine. [note: 51] Indeed, the Defendant submits that a “purposive approac h” using the ordinary meaning of the word “ignition” as used in Claim 1 indic ates that there is a 

requirement for ac tual ignition of an internal c ombustion engine. [note: 52] I note that the spec ific ations do refer at various plac es to the driver of the vehic le operating the ignition system to 

start the engine. [note: 53] 

66     Nevertheless, I disagree with the Defendant’s submission. It is c ommon knowledge that the ignition switc h of c ars (those operated by a key) has several func tions, as reflec ted in the key positions desc ribed at [59] above. The ignition system of a c ar is a c omplex system that is not only about turning on the starter motor to engage the engine and spark plugs. At intermediate positions, the switc h is also used to draw power to operate ac c essories suc h as the radio and to engage the c igarette lighter power soc ket. It is also c learly part of c ommon general knowledge that power surges c an c ause severe damage to elec tric al equipment. Indeed, the spec ific ations make c lear that what was being detec ted was the stable (and muc h lower) DC voltage of between 10 to 15 volts. It was the engagement of the primary c irc uit and not the sec ondary c irc uit that was being monitored. At the end of the journey, when the driver switc hes off the ignition, there would be a drop in the DC voltage prompting a signal to be sent to the system c ontrol unit to turn off power supply to the c amera. [note: 54] 

67     I note that under c ross-examination, in answer to the question of what he understood by the word “ignition”, Mr Sc hweiger’s evidenc e was that “in the c ontext, it means an ignition of a vehic le 

whic h has an internal c ombustion engine”. [note: 55] But this does not mean that “ignition” refers to the ac tual firing up of the engine by means of engagement of the starter motor and spark plugs. When it was put to Mr Sc hweiger that the ignition monitor was monitoring for ignition voltage _of 2, volts_ , he explained that this was not the position, sinc e what was detec ted was only a threshold value of _between 10 and 15 volts_. His evidenc e was that the sec ondary c irc uit, whic h c arried 2, 

volts, would never be touc hed as that c ould endanger life. [note: 56] Therefore, I ac c ept the Plaintiff’s submission that, an ignition monitor referred to in Claim 1 monitors the amplitude of the DC voltage in 


the ignition system. 

**_“Signal” sent by the ignition monitor_** 

68     The next issue relates to the nature of the “signal” that (referring to Figure 1 at [63] above) the ignition monitor 2 sends to the system c ontroller 1. Ac c ording to the Plaintiff, the transmission of 

elec tric al _power_ is suffic ient to c onstitute a “signal”. [note: 57] 

69     However, ac c ording to the Defendant, the plain and ordinary meaning of the word “signal” refers to an indic ator that _conveys data or information_ about the c orresponding behaviour or attribute of some phenomenon, material or physic al proc ess, and _not_ the physic al proc ess itself. 

Therefore, signal c annot be the transmission of elec tric al power only. [note: 58] 

70     In my view, the plain and ordinary meaning of the word “signal”, read in the c ontext of the Patent in Suit, entails a c onveyanc e of _information about_ the voltage; it is insuffic iently c aptured by the passing of _voltage_ (elec tric al power) _itself_. This c onstruc tion is supported by the wording of Claim 1, whic h states that “the ignition monitor provid[es] [a] means to send a _signal_ to the system 

c ontroller on detec tion of an _ignition voltage_ ” [emphasis added]. [note: 59] In this light, the information that is passed by the “signal” referred to in Claim 1 is that a voltage of between 10 to 15 volts has been detec ted. Consequently, the c amera c an be powered up. 

71     This c onstruc tion of the term “signal” is also evident when I take into ac c ount another part of the spec ific ation, whic h states (with referenc e to Figure 1 at [63] above) that upon sudden dec eleration exc eeding a threshold value, the impac t sensor, via output 8, will send a “signal” to the 

system c ontroller unit 1 and standby power supply 4. [note: 60] This “signal”, as used in this part of the spec ific ation, is _not_ triggered as a result of the detec tion of voltage or elec tric al power, but from the _deceleration_ of a vehic le. It c onveys _information_ that an ac c ident (evidenc ed by sudden braking or dec eleration) has oc c urred, suc h that the c amera c an c ontinue rec ording for a fixed interval and then be switc hed off. The word “signal” must, in the absenc e of evidenc e to the c ontrary, be presumed to be used c onsistently ac ross the spec ific ation to refer to the c onveyanc e of _information_ about c ertain phenomenon (suc h as ignition or dec eleration), rather than the mere transmission of power. 

72     That said, I note that the distinc tion between transmission of power and sending a signal may not always be easy to apply as the two c onc epts may be c losely related. When a light switc h is turned on in a dark room, this is nothing more than the sending of elec tric al _power_ to turn the light bulb on for the c onvenienc e of the individual. But suppose the purpose of turning on of the partic ular light bulb was to send a signal to an outside observer that the oc c upant was in a partic ular room? The turning on of the light bulb then bec omes a _signal_ as it involves the transmission of information to the outside observer by means of the light signal. 

**Validity of the Patent in Suit** 

73     Having dealt with the way that the Patent in Suit is to be c onstrued, I move on to the next substantive issue of whether the Patent in Suit is valid. For an invention to be valid and patentable, there are three c onditions that need to be satisfied under s 13(1) of Patents Ac t: 

 (a) the invention is new; 

 (b) it involves an inventive step; and 


 (c ) it is c apable of industrial applic ation. 

74     Only (a) and (b) are in c ontention in the present suit. As highlighted above, the Defendant asserts that the Patent in Suit should be invalidated as it lac ks novelty and inventiveness. 

**_Novelty_** 

_The legal principles_ 

75     Sec tion 14(1) of the Patents Ac t states that “[a]n invention shall be taken to be new if it does not form part of the state of the art.” Sec tion 14(2) defines the “state of the art” broadly as: 

 ...c ompris[ing] all matter (whether a produc t, a proc ess, information about either, or anything else) whic h has at any time before the priority date of that invention been made available to the public (whether in Singapore or elsewhere) by written or oral desc ription, by use or in any other way. 

76     It has been said that an assessment of novelty involves a two-step proc ess: see _Ng-Loy_ ([52] _supra_ ) at para 30.1.25. 

77     First, all the relevant piec es of prior art must be identified. In this c ase, it is not disputed that D1 to D5 (see [18] above) are prior art. The sec ond step is to ask whether the invention has been antic ipated by any of these piec es of prior art. While the two-step approac h is broadly c orrec t, embedded within the two-steps is the vital task of interpretation. 

78     In _The General Tire & Rubber Company v The Firestone Tyre and Rubber Company Limited and others_ [1972] RPC 457 (“ _General Tire_ ”), the English Court of Appeal held (at 483) that the earlier public ation (the prior art) must be interpreted as at the date of its public ation, having regard to the relevant surrounding c irc umstanc es then existing, and without regard to subsequent events. The patent c laims must also be interpreted to determine the sc ope of the matter c overed at its relevant date. In both c ases, the interpretation is from the perspec tive of the reader skilled in the art having regard to the state of knowledge at the relevant date. 

79     It follows that the quantity of prior art material that may be available in determining novelty is potentially enormous. There are no temporal (going bac kwards from the priority date) or geographic al limits on the material that is available. It c omprises all matter made available at any time before the priority date to the public whether in Singapore or elsewhere. It does not matter whether the “making available” is by desc ription or use or in some other manner. The size of the disc losure does not matter. Even if the matter has been made available to one person, if it is free from any obligation of c onfidentiality, it will generally be regarded as having been made available to the public. Further, the requirement of disc losure to the public is satisfied if it has been made available in the public domain, even if no one has inspec ted it: see _Ng-Loy_ ([52] _supra_ ) at para 30.1.29, c iting _Institut Pasteur and Another v Genelabs Diagnostics Pte Ltd and Another_ <span class="citation">[2000] SGHC 53</span> at [188] and _Dien Ghin Electronic (S) Pte Ltd v Khek Tai Ting (trading as Soon Heng Digitax)_ <span class="citation">[2011] 3 SLR 227</span> at [29]. 

80     While a bright line approac h has been taken to _when_ material or matter enters the prior art, it is c lear the c laimed invention is only antic ipated if the prior art reveals the same thing. The fac t that the prior art taught something c lose or similar is not enough to c onstitute antic ipation. In mountaineering terms, the fac t that a previous c limber got to within 100 feet of the summit of an unc limbed peak is c lose but not c lose enough. The prior art c limber must have planted the flag at the very summit in question. 


81     An oft-c ited test to determine antic ipation is the so-c alled “would it infringe” test. Does the prior art in question infringe the patent c laim in question? If it does, there is every reason to c onc lude the patent c laim lac ks novelty. To infringe, all the essential elements of the c laimed invention (properly interpreted) must have been usurped. Transposed into the novelty inquiry, the question is whether the prior art matter or material in question already disc loses all the essential elements of the c laimed invention. 

82     I pause to note that the relationship between disc losure and enablement c onc epts was disc ussed at some length by Lord Hoffmann in _Synthon BV v SmithKline Beecham Plc’s (Paroxetine Methanesulfonate) Patent_ [2006] RPC 10 (“ _Synthon BV_ ”). In the c ase of disc losure, Lord Hoffmann summarised (at [22]) that the prior art must _disclose_ a subjec t matter whic h, if performed, would nec essarily result in an infringement of the patent (see also _Mühlbauer_ ([32] _supra_ ) at [17], c iting _General Tire_ ). 

83     Lord Hoffmann c ontinued (at [26]) that enablement, on the other hand, meant that the ordinary skilled person would have been able to perform the invention whic h satisfies the requirement of disc losure. The key point made was that for the c laimed invention to be antic ipated by the prior art, the prior art must not only disc lose the same subjec t matter; it must also enable the notional skilled reader to perform (or make) the invention. The c ase relied on for this proposition was the dec ision of the House of Lords in _Asahi Kasei Kogyo KK’s Application_ [1991] RPC 485. In that c ase, on assumed fac ts, there had been a prior disc losure of the same invention (a polypeptide) but neither the disc losure nor c ommon general knowledge would have enabled the notional skilled reader to make it. _Susanna Leong_ ([55] _supra_ ) at para 16.141 c orrec tly c ites _Synthon BV_ as undersc oring the point that disc losure and enablement are distinc t c onc epts. Eac h must be satisfied to c onc lude that the alleged invention forms part of the state of the art. 

84     In Singapore, the leading authority is the Court of Appeal dec ision in _Mühlbauer_ ([32] _supra_ ). Phang JA noted (at [17]) that the prior public ation must not only identify the subjec t matter of the later patent, but must also set out an _enabling_ disc losure. In other words, an invention “would be antic ipated by a piec e of prior art if the teac hings disc losed in this prior art _are sufficiently clear and complete to allow [_ ie _, enable] the skilled addressee to make the invention_ ” [emphasis in original] (see _Ng-Loy_ ([52] _supra_ ) at para 30.1.43). It is c lear that the referenc e to enabling disc losure is c onsistent with the distinc tion referred to above between disc losure and enablement. 

85     I also note that it is generally _not_ permissible, in the c ontext of an assessment of novelty, to assemble all the piec es of prior art together into a “mosaic ”, and then c ompare the invention in question against this “mosaic ”. The invention must instead be c ompared against eac h _individual_ piec e of prior art, and the question repeated eac h time: has this partic ular piec e of prior art antic ipated the invention? ( _Mühlbauer_ ([32] _supra_ ) at [68] and _Ng-Loy_ ([52] _supra_ ) at para 30.1.38) 

86     In the present c ase, c ounsel for the parties have produc ed a joint table (“Table of Disputes on Invalidity”) whic h analyses the issue of novelty by c omparing the elements of eac h of the c laims in the Patent in Suit against eac h of the prior arts, D1 to D5. However, it is c lear from the pleadings, and even at trial, that only D3 is used by the Defendant to invalidate the c laims of the Patent in Suit. [note: 61] I will, therefore, foc us on D3 in my analysis of the issue of novelty. 

_Prior art D_ 

87     D3 is a patent whic h relates to a c amera that c an be mounted on a vehic le, and whic h enables the c auses of an ac c ident to be verified by means of photographs of the surroundings. The main c laim 


[note: 62] states that it is: 

 A method for enabling the c auses of an ac c ident involving a vehic le to be verified, c omprising the obtaining..., following vehic le start or after an enabling signal ..., of images of the environment in whic h said vehic le is in a stationary or moving state, memorizing ... said images while the vehic les is moving or until a halt-memorization signal is generated..., said memorizing in any event ceasing within a predetermined time period subsequent to a c ollision undergone by the vehic le while retaining in memory the images obtained up to that time, these images being able to be subsequently viewed to verify the c auses of said c ollision. 

 [emphasis added; referenc es to numbers in diagrams omitted] 

88     Ac c ording to the Defendant, “[a]ll features of the independent Claim 1 of the Patent [in Suit] have been disc losed by D3”. This is bec ause D3 disc loses a rec ording system for installation in or on a vehic le. The rec ording system c omprises a system c ontroller, at least one optic al rec order, at least one sensor and an ignition monitor. D3 also disc loses at least one c ollision sensor whic h sends a signal to the system c ontroller on detec tion of dec eleration or impac t. The system c ontroller then provides the means to switc h off at least one optic al rec order after a fixed time interval after rec eiving the 

sensor signal. [note: 63] 

89     I will now examine some of the key aspec ts of D3 as c ompared to various elements of the c laims in the Patent in Suit. 

_Claim 1: The system controller, optical recorder, sensor and ignition monitor_ 

90     It will be rec alled that Claim 1 of the Patent in Suit relates to: 

 A rec ording system, for installation in or on a vehic le, c omprising a system controller , at least one optical recorder , at least one sensor and an ignition monitor , the ignition monitor providing means to send a signal to the system controller on detection of an ignition voltage , the system c ontroller being c onnec ted to the at least one optic al rec order to switc h on operation thereof on rec eiving said ignition monitor signal, wherein the at least one sensor is provided to send a signal to the system c ontroller on detec tion of a dec eleration or impac t, the system c ontroller providing means to switc h off the at least one optic al rec order after a fixed interval after rec eiving the sensor signal. 

 [emphasis added] 

91     The Plaintiff c onc edes that D3 is a rec ording system for installation on a vehic le, that D c onsists of a system c ontroller (whic h is termed the “c ontrol unit”), and that D3 has at least one 

optic al rec order (the “telec amera”) and at least one sensor (the “c ollision sensor”). [note: 64] 

92     The main disagreement between the parties is whether D3 “implic itly disc loses” an “ignition 

monitor”, [note: 65] whic h provides the means to send a signal to the system c ontroller on detec tion of an ignition voltage. 

93     Referring to Figure 2 below, the relevant part of the spec ific ation in D3 states: [note: 66] 

 ...the vehic le ignition key 29 is known to be able to assume two different positions , namely a vehicle rest position (S) or a vehicle operation-enabling position (M). When in this latter position... 


 it closes a mechanical contact 30 in a first elec tric al power branc h 31 c onnec ting the devic e of the invention to a usual vehic le battery 32. Parallel to the elec tric al branc h 31 but c onnec ted to the same pole of the battery 32 as this latter branc h there is another power branc h 33 in whic h there is a mec hanic al c ontac tor 34, whic h is open when the key 29 is in the position M. This power branc h... 33... is also c onnec ted to a timer relay 35 arranged to operate on a mec hanic al c ontac tor 36... The c ontac tor 36 is normally open... when the key 29 is in the position M. ... [T]here is [also] a mec hanic al c ontac tor 41 c ontrolled by a relay 40 c onnec ted to the power branc h 31 downstream of the c ontac tor 30. The contactor 41 is normally closed when the key 29 is in position M. 

 In this manner and following a vehicle start enabling signal originating from the block 28 (key 29 in position M), the contactors 30 and 41 close to power the device. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

94     In his Sec ond Invalidity Opinion, Dr Yu, the Defendant’s expert, argues (referring to Figures 2 and 3 below) that the “ignition monitor” of D3 is the ignition switc h bloc k 28 (“Bloc k 28”) with key 29 in position M. Dr Yu observes that the vehic le ignition key 29 in position M is c onnec ted to the vehic le battery 32. An “ignition monitor signal” is sent to the c ontrol unit 50 on detec tion of an ignition voltage of the vehic le battery 32, via relay 35 and c ontac tor 36. For these reasons, the Defendant’s 

position is that D3 implic itly disc loses the “ignition monitor” of the Patent in Suit. [note: 67]

95     The Plaintiff’s position is that the Defendant’s analysis is flawed for two main reasons: 

 (a) First, D3 neither explic itly nor implic itly disc loses an ignition monitor. Bloc k 28 is only a simplified version of a vehic le ignition bloc k, ie , the part of the vehic le where the vehic le key would be inserted in order to turn on the vehic le, as evidenc ed by Claim 20 of D3. [note: 68] Its func tion is simply to enable the vehic le to start, after key 29 is turned from position S (vehic le rest position) to position M (vehic le operation-enabling position). [note: 69] Bloc k 28 does not represent a c onventional ignition switc h of a c ar, whic h typic ally has four (instead of only two) positions. [note: 70] 

 (b) Sec ond, Bloc k 28 (with key 29 in position M) does not have the c harac teristic s of the “ignition monitor” of the Patent in Suit. It does not have the ability to “monitor the amplitude of the DC voltage in the ignition system” or to detec t a DC voltage in exc ess of a threshold value. It simply ac ts as a switch to close a circuit. [note: 71] Further, a signal is not sent to the “system c ontroller” 50. Even if a “signal” is sent in the form of the “start enabling signal”, this merely results in a mec hanic al c losing of c ontac tors 30 and 41, when the ignition key is brought to the position M, so as to mec hanic ally power the devic e. [note: 72] 

96     Having c arefully c onsidered the parties’ arguments, I now set out my findings. 

97     It will be rec alled that the ignition monitor of the Patent in Suit, with referenc e to Figure 1 


above ([63] _supra_ ), is desc ribed as follows: [note: 73] 

 An input 6 of the ignition monitor unit 2 is c onnec ted to the ignition system of the vehic le, whic h is c onnec ted to the vehic le’s battery... An output 7 of the ignition monitor unit 2 is c onnec ted to an input 12 of the system c ontrol unit 1. The ignition monitor unit 2 monitors the amplitude of the DC voltage in the ignition system. When the unit 2 detec ts a DC voltage in exc ess of a threshold value [preferably between 10 and 15 volts], i.e. when the vehic le’s ignition system is ac tivated to start the vehic le, a signal is sent from output 7 to the system control unit 1. 

 [emphasis added] 

98     It is c lear from the extrac t of the spec ific ation above that there are two func tions c arried out by the ignition monitor (the “dual func tions”). The first func tion is to monitor or detec t ignition voltage, that is, voltage emanating from the ignition system. Onc e an ignition voltage in exc ess of the threshold value (between 10 and 15 volts) is detec ted for a period greater than five sec onds, the ignition monitor serves its sec ond func tion, whic h is to transmit a signal, c onveying the information that the ignition system has been switc hed on, to the system c ontroller. It is not immediately apparent why the ignition monitor requires five sec onds or more of the required voltage value before it sends the signal to the system c ontroller. 

99     Viewed in this light, a few observations may be made. First, Bloc k 28 of D3 (with key 29 in the M position) does not “monitor” the voltage originating from the ignition system. I agree with the Plaintiff that Bloc k 28 is simply a vehic le ignition bloc k. Its func tion is to enable the vehic le to start, when key 29 is turned from position S (vehic le rest position) to position M (vehic le operation-enabling position). When this happens, Bloc k 28 is the very _cause_ of the vehic le ignition, and henc e the ignition voltage; it does not “detec t” the ignition voltage. Sec ond, the “start enabling signal” whic h is sent by Bloc k 28 simply c auses the c ompletion of the elec tronic c irc uit 3 by c losing c ontac tors 30 and 41; this is a mec hanic al proc ess. Signific antly, when the c ontac tors 30 and 41 c lose, the c amera is 

powered _directly_. [note: 74] Although c ontac tors 30 and 41 are in the elec tronic c irc uit 3, whic h also c ontains the c ontrol unit 50, it does not appear that any signal is sent from Bloc k 28 _to control unit 50_ , before another output is transmitted from the c ontrol unit 50 to the telec amera 4 to power it up. This c an be c ontrasted with the sec ond func tion of the ignition monitor of the Patent in Suit, in whic h it is expressly stated that the ignition monitor proves a means to send a signal _to the system controller_ on detec tion of an ignition voltage. The system c ontroller is in turn c onnec ted to a c amera. Upon rec eiving the said ignition monitor signal, the system c ontrol unit is the one that supplies power to the c amera via an output. 

100    For these reasons, I am of the view that Bloc k 28 (with key 29 in position M) in D3 is _not_ the same as, and does not implic itly disc lose, the dual-func tion “ignition monitor” referred to in Claim 1 of the Patent in Suit. I am of the view that Claim 1 is not antic ipated by D3. 

_The “dependent claims”_ 

101    Turning to Claims 2 to 8, I note the Plaintiff’s submissions simply assert that these c laims are “dependent” on Claim 1. Onc e it is found that Claim 1 is novel, the Plaintiff submits that it must follow 

that Claims 2 to 8 are also novel. [note: 75] 

102    The Defendant makes the c onverse argument that sinc e Claims 2 to 8 are dependent c laims, if 

Claim 1 is invalid then Claims 2 to 8 must all be invalid. [note: 76] 


103    However, I note that “dependent c laim” or “subsidiary c laim” does not appear anywhere in the Patents Ac t or the Patents Rules (Cap 221, R1, 2007 Rev Ed). Neither does the term “independent c laim” feature in the legislation. Indeed, these expressions are not even found in the c laims and spec ific ation of the Patent in Suit. Thus, what is important in this c ontext is to foc us on the words used in eac h c laim and ask what the essential elements of the invention as set out in eac h c laim are. The label “dependent c laim” should not be used too readily without first c onsidering the ac tual language of the c laims. The learned authors of _Terrell on the Law of Patents_ (Colin Birss gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2016) at para 9-318 rightly c omment that the c ourt will, if possible, c onstrue c laims so as to give a different meaning to different c laims. The learned authors also rec ognise that if after properly c onstruing the spec ific ations and c laims, little or no differenc e c an be found between two c laims, this is not a reason for departing from the reasonable and natural meaning of the language. 

104    I ac c ept that it may well be c orrec t for a c ourt, in assessing the validity of the first or what may loosely be c alled the “independent c laim”, to obtain guidanc e from the “dependent c laims” or “subsidiary c laims” whic h refer bac k to the independent c laim and inc orporates all its features, as an aid to interpreting the proper sc ope of the independent c laim. But it does not follow that the novelty of subsequent c laims must _ipso facto_ stand or fall on the fate of the independent c laim. Muc h will depend on the sc ope of the invention as set out in the subsequent c laims. The label “dependent c laim” or “subsidiary c laim” should not distrac t the c ourt from the enquiry whic h it is tasked to undertake, whic h is whether the elements or features in the subsequent c laim(s) taken together with the invention as set out in the prec eding c laim meet the requirements of novelty. 

105    A subsequent c laim may serve a variety of objec tives. For example, the subsequent c laim may add a new or extra feature that was not set out in the previous c laim at all. This is permissible provided the c laims relate to a single inventive c onc ept. Alternatively, it may be that the subsequent c laim simply serves to c larify, limit or restric t the sc ope of an element referred to in the prec eding c laim. This may be done to restric t the prior art that is relevant, or simply to add to or improve the c larity of the c laims. The subsequent c laims may delineate or spec ific ally identify a partic ular member of a broad c lass that has been set out in the prec eding c laim. For example, the first c laim may refer to an invention with an element that is made from a “hard and rigid” material. The subsequent c laim may relate to the same invention but spec ific ally c laim the element made from “tungsten”. It may be desirable to tighten the subsequent c laim where the prec eding c laim is drafted in very broad terms. 

_Claim 2: The standby power supply and timer switch_ 

106    I move on to the first “dependent c laim” whic h c onc erns the “standby power supply” referred to in Claim 2 of the Patent in Suit. Referring to Figure 1 above, the “standby power supply” of the Patent in Suit is desc ribed as follows: 

 ...if during operation of the vehic le an ac c ident oc c urs, the impac t sensor 3 will be triggered if the dec eleration in exc ess of the sensor’s threshold value is experienc ed. A signal is sent on output 8 to the system c ontrol unit 1 and the standby power supply 4. In response, the system c ontrol unit 1 switc hes output 11 to turn off the main power supply to the c amera 5. At the same time, the timer switch of the standby power supply 4 is switched on by the signal from the impac t sensor 3. As a result power is supplied to the camera 5 for an additional 5 to 10 seconds after the termination of the main power supply from the system control unit 1. [note: 77] 

 [emphasis added] 

107    In the spec ific ation of D3, there is referenc e to a “buffer battery” whic h is desc ribed, by 


referenc e to Figure 4 below, as follows: 

 ... Between the branc hes 101 and 102 there is a branc h 100A in whic h there is a buffer battery 103... to maintain the device D powered... even after a collision which damages the vehicle electrical installation. [note: 78] 

 [emphasis added] 

 Figure 4: Fig 10 of D3 

_Selected legend_ 

_Unit 29Ignition key_ 

_Unit 103Buffer battery_ 

108    The Defendant argues that the buffer battery 103 is c learly the “standby power supply” in the Patent in Suit. Further, referring to Figure 3 at [94] above, the c loc k generator 59 fulfils the meaning 

of a timer switc h, as it provides timing for the c ontrol unit 50. [note: 79] 

109    The Plaintiff, however, takes the position that buffer battery 103 is not a “standby power 

supply” but a “power supply bac kup”. [note: 80] In this respec t, the Plaintiff makes two submissions. First, he argues that the standby power supply of the Patent in Suit is deliberately designed to be _automatically activated_ upon the detec tion of a suitably strong c ollision or dec eleration, as the main power supply would be turned off in suc h an event. The c amera would be immediately powered by the standby power supply for a fixed interval after the ac c ident or dec eleration. In c ontrast, the buffer battery 103 of D3 operates _only if_ the c onnec tion with the vehic le battery is interrupted following a c ollision. If there is no disruption to the vehic le battery following an ac c ident, the buffer battery 103 is not envisaged to operate. Sec ond, the Plaintiff points out that unlike the Patent in Suit, there is no timer switc h c onnec ted to buffer battery 103 of D3, and D3 would tec hnic ally c ontinue to operate as 

long as the buffer battery provides suffic ient power. [note: 81] 

110    Before c oming to my findings on this element of the c laim, I first note that there is some c onfusion as to whether the term “buffer battery” used in two different parts of the spec ific ation of D3 refer to the same c omponent. The first time the term is used in the spec ific ation of D3 has been outlined at [107] above. The sec ond part of the spec ific ation whic h again mentions the term is, 


referring to Figure 3 at [94] above, as follows: [note: 82] 

 A c loc k generator 59 is also c onnec ted to the bus 51 to provide timing for the unit 50. ... [I]n other words the generator 59 ac ts as a c loc k-c alendar and is provided with its own buffer battery. It enables the date on whic h the images were obtained to be exac tly defined... 

 [emphasis added] 

Dr Yu, the Defendant’s expert, stated at trial that the two terms refer to the same c omponent. [note: 83] 

111    With respec t, I disagree with Dr Yu’s view that the “buffer battery” highlighted at [107] above is the same as the “buffer battery” outlined at [110], even though the same term is used. From a c areful reading of the term in the c ontext of the spec ific ation, the former refers to the buffer battery of _D3 itself_ and is labelled “103” in Figure 4 (at [107] above). By c ontrast, the latter refers to the “ _clock generator 59[’s]_ ... _own [separate] buffer battery_ ”. For the purposes of examining this element of Claim 2, I will foc us on the term “buffer battery” _of D3_ , as used at [107] above. 

112    I move on to the parties’ substantive arguments. First, although I agree that the “buffer battery” 103 in D3 and the “standby power supply” in the Patent in Suit c ome into operation differently, I am of the view they nonetheless have the same purpose and perform the same func tion of providing bac kup battery supply to the c amera in the event of an ac c ident. In my judgment, the buffer battery 103 disc loses a “stand-by power supply” within the ambit of Claim 2 as interpreted by the notional skilled reader. I also ac c ept that it provides an enabling disc losure that suffic iently disc loses all that is nec essary for the skilled reader to make the invention of the “standby power supply” in the Patent in Suit, whic h direc tly and immediately supplies power to the c amera in the event of an ac c ident. 

113    Sec ond, I am unable to agree with the Defendant’s argument that the “timer switc h” referred to in the Patent in Suit is equivalent to the c loc k generator 59 of D3. In my view, it is c lear that c loc k generator 59 serves a different func tion from that of the timer switc h of the Patent in Suit. Cloc k generator 59 enables the images or data c aptured by telec amera 4 to be allotted a date and time, _ie_ , it ac ts as a c loc k c alendar (whic h has its own buffer battery in the sense desc ribed in [110] above). As explained in D3’s patent spec ific ation, this enables the date on whic h the images were obtained to be exac tly defined together with their exac t suc c ession in time, in order to define ac c ident c auses 

and responsibilities. [note: 84] By c ontrast, the timer switc h in the Patent in Suit is used to supply standby power to the c amera for a fixed period of about five to ten sec onds after termination of the main power supply. The purpose of the timer switc h in the Patent in Suit is different: it is to ensure that the rec orded pic tures c over the period before and immediately after any ac c ident (and will not be overridden). Thus, c loc k generator 59 does not set out a “disc losure” whic h unmistakeably instruc ts the reader to make the timer switc h as referred to in the Patent in Suit. 

114    Nonetheless, it seems to me that relay 35 in D3 disc loses the feature of a timer switc h as desc ribed in the Patent in Suit, although this was not argued by either party. Ac c ording to the spec ific ation of D3, following vehic le stoppage, for example after an ac c ident, the c ontac tor 34 is c losed and relay 35 sets a defined time period in whic h c ontac tor 36 is c losed. Consequently, during the moments following vehic le stoppage, the devic e is operative, and is able to memorise the images obtained by telec amera 4, until relay 35 opens the c ontac tor 36 after the defined time period to 

interrupt the c onnec tion to the battery 32, switc hing off the c amera. [note: 85] Relay 35 therefore sets out, in my view, a “disc losure” whic h enables the making of the timer switc h referred to in the 


Patent in Suit. 

115    For these reasons, I am of the view that the _added elements_ of Claim 2 of the Patent in Suit (a standby power supply and a timer switc h) are, in and of themselves, not novel. However, I note that Claim 2 and Claim 1 are c learly linked, in that the additional features in Claim 2 relate to the same invention in Claim 1 (in respec t of whic h the ignition monitor is an essential feature). The fac t that the prior art disc loses the c onc epts of a standby power supply and a timer does not affec t novelty of the invention as set out in Claim 1. In this regard, sinc e Claim 2 c omprises the same devic e as Claim 1 (albeit with added features), the invention set out in Claim 2 is also new as a whole. 

_Claim 3: The internal memory store_ 

116    In the present c ase, Claim 3 c overs a “rec ording system as c laimed in c laim 1 or c laim 2 wherein the at least one optic al rec order is provided with an _internal memory store_ ” [emphasis added]. This adds a feature to that outlined in Claim 1. The internal memory store is in itself antic ipated by D3, whic h c ontains two internal memory stores, 54 and 60 (see Figure 5 at [118] below), and is therefore not novel. However, given my finding that the invention as set out in Claim 1 is novel, it must follow that the invention as set out in Claim 3 is also novel. This is bec ause the invention in Claim 3 is the same invention in Claim 1 together with the spec ific referenc e in Claim 3 to the invention in Claim 1 c ontaining an optic al rec order with an “internal memory store”. 

_Claim 4: The separate memory store_ 

117    Claim 4 of the Patent in Suit relates to a rec ording system as c laimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 

wherein at least one optic al rec order is c onnec ted _to a separate memory store_. [note: 86] The spec ific ations teac h that more than one c amera may be used. Eac h c amera may have its own internal memory or the c ameras may be linked to a single separate memory store. 

118    Referring to Figure 5 below, the Defendant argues that telec amera 4 in D3 is c onnec ted to memory 60, whic h is the separate memory store. Further, the spec ific ation of D3 also refers “other 

memory supports external to the devic e, for example to enable the images to be viewed”. [note: 87] 

 Figure 5: Fig 8 of D3 

_Selected legend_ 

_Unit 54Memory_ 

_Unit 60Memory_ 

119    The Plaintiff takes a different position. He c ontends that memory 54 or 60 of D3 are _internal_ memory stores, and any referenc e to a _separate_ memory store in D3 only refers to the ability for the 


rec ordings, whic h are stored in the internal memory store, to be transferred out of the devic e D3. [note: 88] I note that the spec ific ations for D3 c learly and explic itly state that the memory store 

(whether 54 or 60) is to be suffic ient to enable the rec ordings to “be _transferred_ onto other memory 

supports external to the devic e...” [note: 89] [emphasis added] 

120    If “separate memory store” means (from the perspec tive of the notional skilled reader) an external memory store, as distinc t from and additional to the internal memory, the fac t that D3 disc loses an _internal_ memory store does not disc lose exac tly the same subjec t matter. The question is whether D3 nonetheless disc loses c lear direc tions to make available an external memory store to enable the “memorised” images to be viewed. In my judgment, the presenc e of an internal memory store in D3, with the possibility of transferring data from the internal to an external storage medium, c ontains c lear and c omplete direc tions to enable the Plaintiff to make a devic e with a separate external memory store altogether. It bears repeating that the notional skilled reader is tasked with 

interpreting the D3 at the date of its public ation: 11 January 1996. [note: 90] 

121    Overall, therefore, I am similarly of the view that although the additional feature of Claim 4 (the separate memory store) is not novel in and of itself, the additional feature relates bac k to the main Claim 1. Bec ause Claim 4 c omprises the same devic e as Claim 1 (albeit with an additional feature), the invention set out in Claim 4 is also new overall. 

_Claims 5, 6, 7 and 8_ 

122    Claim 5 refers to a rec ording system as set out in any of the prec eding c laims wherein at least one sensor is an “ac c elerometer”. Claim 1, while referring to (at least one) “sensor”, did not spec ify what the sensor is. Instead, it desc ribed the sensor in terms of its _function_ , whic h was to detec t 

dec eleration or impac t. [note: 91] All that Claim 5 does is to label the sensor as an “ac c elerometer”. While it may be thought that the spec ific referenc e to an “ac c elerometer” adds nothing to Claim 1, it does at least make expressly c lear what was already implic it in Claim 1. The same is true for Claim 6 whic h refers to at least one sensor being an “impac t detec tor”. 

123    Claim 7 refers to a rec ording system as set out in any of the prec eding c laims wherein at least one optic al rec order is a “digital c amera”. Claim 8 is similar, save that it requires at least one optic al rec order to be a “digital c amc order”. In the same vein as Claims 5 and 6, Claims 7 and 8 add c larity or spec ific ity to a key element in Claim 1 that the rec ording system must have at least one optic al rec order. Claims 7 and 8 make c lear that a “digital c amera” and a “digital c amc order” are c overed within the framework of the rec ording system and the c laimed invention. 

_Conclusion on novelty_ 

124    In summary, Claim 1 of the Patent in Suit is novel and not antic ipated by D3. The subsequent Claims 2 to 8 are also novel. Although the additional features set out in Claims 2, 3 and 4 (the standby power supply, the timer switc h and the memory stores) are not novel in and of themselves, when analysed in light of the novel Claim 1 to whic h they relate to and inc orporate, these c laims are novel as well. 

**_Inventive step_** 

_The legal principles_ 

125    The next main issue is whether there is an “inventive step” embodied in the invention of the 


Patent in Suit. The four-step test in _Windsurfing International Inc v Tabur Marine (Great Britain) Ltd_ [1985] RPC 59 was applied and summarised as follows in _Mühlbauer_ ([32] _supra_ ) at [20]: 

 (a) Identify the inventive c onc ept embodied in the patent in suit. 

 (b) The c ourt then assumes the mantle of the normally skilled but unimaginative addressee in the art at the priority date, imputing to him what was, at that date, c ommon general knowledge in the art in question. 

 (c ) Identify what, if any, differenc es exist between the matter c ited as being “known or used” and the alleged invention. 

 (d) The c ourt then asks itself the question whether, viewed without any knowledge of the alleged invention, those differenc es c onstitute steps whic h would have been obvious to the skilled man or whether they require any degree of invention. 

Referenc e should also be made to s 15 of the Patents Ac t, whic h states that “[a]n invention shall be taken to involve an inventive step if it is _not obvious_ to a person skilled in the art, having regard to any matter whic h forms part of the state of the art...” [emphasis added]. 

126    As VK Rajah JA observed in _First Currency Choice_ ([50] _supra_ ) at [44], the first three steps of this test lay the ground work for the final c ritic al question of _non-obviousness_ : is the alleged invention obvious in the eyes of the notional skill reader? As disc ussed earlier, while the c ourt is often assisted in the assessment of obviousness by experts, the ultimate dec ision on non-obviousness is one of fac t, impression and judgment whic h only the c ourt c an answer. 

127    The answer to the question of what the c laimed inventive step is will naturally shape the Court’s assessment of whether the invention is obvious. In this regard, the invention being examined is that whic h is set out in the c laim in question. 

128    The dec ision of the UK House of Lords in _Conor Medsystems Incorporated v Angiotech Pharmaceuticals Inc_ [2008] UKHL 49 (“ _Conor Medsystems_ ”) illustrates the importanc e of defining the c laimed invention by referenc e to the c laims in the assessment of inventive step. The patent c onc erned a stent c oated with taxol for treating or preventing rec urrent stenosis. A stent is tubular metal sc affold inserted into a bloc ked artery to keep the artery open. The prior art revealed a serious problem, namely, the injury c aused by the insertion of the stent to the inner walls of the artery. This often resulted in an exc essive healing response, resulting in proliferation of new tissue whic h unfortunately would c onstric t the arterial c hannel. This problem was referred to as restenosis. This was apparently a c ommon problem and “no one knew what to do about it” (at [5]). It was said that one group of Dutc h sc ientists even published an artic le in 1993 entitled: “Pharmac ologic al Approac hes to the Prevention of Restenosis Following Angioplasty: The Searc h for the Holy Grail?” 

129    The prior art suggested a number of possible avenues for researc h. One view was that the proliferation of tissue may be similar to proliferation of c ells in a c anc er tumour. On this basis, treatment by anti-proliferative drugs was a possible researc h path. A different view favoured use of antithrombotic agents suc h as heparin. 

130    In 1991, a medic al researc her who was studying angiogenesis (the proc ess by whic h c apillary blood vessels grow) c ame up with the idea that one approac h to the undesired c ell proliferation was to inhibit angiogenesis. This was bec ause most c ell tissues are unable to proliferate without blood supply. The researc her (together with others) dec ided to try to find an anti-angiogenic agent whic h 


c ould be used to inhibit tissue growth in restenosis. To this end, they used standard assay tests to look for substanc es with anti-angiogenic properties. In 1993, the team tested a rec ently disc overed substanc e c alled taxol. Taxol was, at that time, in the news as a possible c anc er treatment bec ause of its anti-proliferative properties. The team disc overed that taxol had remarkable anti-angiogenic properties. Stents c oated with even minute amounts of taxol were effec tive against restenosis and were a “great c ommerc ial suc c ess”. The Holy Grail, at least in this c ontext, had been found. 

131    The question was whether the invention was obvious. Lord Hoffmann held (at [17]) that it is “the c laimed invention whic h has to involve an inventive step. The invention means _prima facie_ that spec ified in the c laim...” Lord Hoffmann also states (at [19]) that the patentee was entitled to have the question of obviousness determined by referenc e to his c laim and not “to some vague paraphrase based upon the extent of his disc losure in the desc ription”. The c laim was for a stent c oated with taxol. The question was therefore whether _that invention as embodied in the claim_ involved an inventive step. The alleged inventiveness lay in the c laim that the produc t would have a partic ular property, namely, to prevent or treat restenosis. That being so, Lord Hoffmann held (at [17]) that the question of obviousness was whether it was obvious to use a taxol-c oated stent for this purpose. 

132    In answering this question, Lord Hoffmann stressed (at [17]) the importanc e of not c onflating the obviousness question with questions relating to suffic ienc y or support. The question was whether it was obvious to make a stent c oated with taxol. The question was not whether it was obvious that taxol might have the desired effec t or was worth trying. As Lord Hoffmann explained (at [16]), “[i]t was c ommon ground that taxol was, like many other anti-proliferative drugs, worth a try. And that was obvious.” With respec t to the question of whether it was obvious to make a stent c oated with taxol, there was c onflic ting expert opinion. One expert gave evidenc e that he would have rec ommended the researc hers to try taxol as it was at the time a highly public ised new drug for c anc er. Another expert stated that he would have advised against taxol, on ac c ount of its toxic properties (at [14]). 

133    In Lord Hoffmann’s view, the c ited prior art merely taught that the solution may lie in a large and undifferentiated number of drugs whic h _could_ be tried. This was not the point. Bearing in mind the c laimed invention, the question was whether the prior art showed that it was obvious that taxol _would_ prevent restenosis (at [41]). Lord Hoffman then referred (at [42]) to Diploc k LJ’s judgment in in _Johns-Manville Corporation’s Patent_ [1967] RPC 479 that a test for obviousness based on the idea of something being obvious to try was only useful in a c ase where there was a fair expec tation of suc c ess. Indeed, Lord Hoffmann c onc ludes that a test for obviousness based on whether it was obvious to try it _without any expectation of success_ was “an oxymoronic c onc ept” whic h had no prec edent in the law of patents. To put it another way, if the prior art teac hes many paths one of whic h might lead to the solution, the obvious thing to do will be to try all those paths. A dec ision to try a _particular_ path, with no (fair) expec tation that this path will in fac t lead to suc c ess, is inventive. 

134    In the present c ase, the c laimed invention c omprises a produc t (a rec ording system for installation in vehic les) with c ertain defined features. These features inc lude a dual-func tion ignition monitor whic h detec ts an ignition voltage and whic h also sends a signal to the system c ontroller. While the invention c omprises a number of other features, it is apparent from the spec ific ations that the c onc ept of using an ignition monitor is c entral to the c laimed invention. Following _Conor Medsystems_ , the question is whether the notional skilled reader would, at the priority date of the Patent in Suit, have found it obvious to make a produc t with the ignition monitor (as c onc eptualised and defined in the Patent in Suit), given the stated purpose of rec ording visual data leading up to and during a dangerous situation involving sharp braking or an ac c ident. 


135    Before I turn to c onsider the prior art, I note that unlike the assessment of novelty, mosaic ing is permitted when assessing whether the invention c onstitutes an inventive step, unless mosaic ing itself would not be obvious to the hypothetic al skilled person: _Mühlbauer_ ([32] _supra_ ) at [93]. The notional skilled person assesses the obviousness of an invention by referenc e to the _whole of the state of the art_ relevant to the invention. (inc luding c ommon general knowledge). The “mosaic ” is one whic h is “put together by an unimaginative man with no inventive c apac ity”: _Technograph Printed Circuits Ltd v Mills & Rockley (Electronics) Ltd_ [1972] RPC 346 at 355, c ited in _Mühlbauer_ at [93]. 

136    In this c ase, I find that the notional skilled reader who has ac c ess to the whole prior art would have regard to the various piec es of prior art c ited against the invention in the Patent in Suit. The c ited prior art essentially c onc ern systems involving “in vehic le” c ameras. In my judgment, the notional skilled person would not find it too far-fetc hed to mosaic these piec es of prior art to form a c onsidered view of the state of the art (see _Mühlbauer_ ([32] _supra_ ) at [94]). To rec ap, the piec es of prior art c ited may be summarised as follows: 

 (a) D1, a patent relating to an “audio visual video tape rec ording system mounted in or on a land vehic le” and whic h is “automatic ally ac tivated when the ignition is turned ‘ON’ to rec ord events forward and rearward simultaneously”. [note: 92] 

 (b) D2, a patent entitled “Car Cam” in whic h a “typic al applic ation [is] the use of the devic e to doc ument automobile ac c idents”. [note: 93] 

 (c ) D3, a patent has been referred to already in some detail above (see [87] for a fuller desc ription). 

 (d) D4, a patent entitled “Apparatus for VideoRec ording Fortuitous Events Related to Moving Means of Any Nature”. [note: 94] 

 (e) D5, a patent whic h relates to a “vehic le ac c ident rec ording system employ[ing] a digital c amera c onnec ted to a c ontroller, a non-volatile memory, and an ac c ident-sensing interrupter”. [note: 95] 

137    The Defendant does not provide a detailed analysis on the inventive step said to be embodied in the Patent in Suit. It argues that its submissions in respec t of novelty in respec t of D3 apply with equal forc e with respec t to lac k of inventive step of the Patent in Suit. In addition, the Defendant submits that D1 to D5 are in the same tec hnic al field and aim to solve similar tec hnic al problems as the Patent in Suit, and are readily available to the person skilled in the art to selec t and c ombine. [note: 96] 

138    In its Partic ulars of Objec tion (Amendment No 2), the Defendant argues that the c laims in the Patent in Suit are not inventive in light of various c ombinations (or “mosaic s”) of the five prior art doc uments (D1 to D5) and the c ommon general knowledge. In brief, this is bec ause the teac hings in 

one or more of the prior art doc uments make various elements of the c laims obvious. [note: 97] Slightly different c ombinations of the prior art and c ommon general knowledge are produc ed in Annex A to the Defendant’s c losing submissions, but the Defendant does not explain why the “mosaic ing” of those partic ular c ombinations of prior art mean that the Patent in Suit lac ks inventive step. 

139    The Plaintiff, on the other hand, in his c losing submissions, mainly foc uses on the ignition monitor in Claim 1, whic h he c laims is absent in eac h of the prior art doc uments. The Plaintiff foc uses 


on what I have termed the “dual func tions” of the ignition monitor (see [98] above) as set out espec ially in Claim 1. It is not the Plaintiff’s position that the inventive step lies in the ignition monitor being _connected to the vehicle ignition system_. To rec ap, these two func tions are namely, (i) the ability to _monitor/detect_ ignition voltage (voltage produc ed by the ignition system); and (ii) the ability to send a signal to the system c ontroller. The Plaintiff submits that bec ause of the absenc e of an ignition monitor in eac h of the prior art, Claims 2 to 8, whic h are dependent on Claim 1, are 

inventive and thus valid. [note: 98] The Defendant does not dispute that D2 and D4 do not have ignition monitors but argues that a c omponent equivalent to an ignition monitor exists in eac h of prior arts D1, D3 and D5. 

_Prior art D1_ 

140    D1 relates to an audio-visual video tape rec ording system to be used in or on a land vehic le. The system is automatic ally ac tivated when the ignition switc h is turned on by the operator, after whic h the forward and rearward c ameras will switc h on. Both c ameras then rec ord all audio and visual 

events at the front and rear of the vehic le within the sc ope of their rec eption simultaneously. [note: 99] I pause to undersc ore that unlike the Patent in Suit where the ignition monitor waits five sec onds 

after detec ting the required voltage before sending the “turn on” signal to the system c ontroller, the c amera in D1 is automatic ally ac tivated and switc hed on (immediately) when the ignition switc h is turned on. 

141    Dr Yu, the Defendant’s expert, argues that the ignition switc h in D1 is in effec t an ignition 

monitor as desc ribed in the Patent in Suit. [note: 100] The ignition switc h 5 in D1, referring to Figure 6 below, is desc ribed as follows in the patent spec ific ation: 

 ...the operator turns on the ignition switc h 5 thereby energizing the forward c amera 14 and the c entral rec ording unit 4 through the forward signal transmission c able 10F and the rearward c amera through rearward signal transmission c able 10R ... 

 Figure 6: Fig 2 of D1 

Dr Yu states that the forward and rearward signal transmission c ables 10F and 10R are “c oaxial 

c ables” whic h, to an elec tric al or elec tronic engineer, is a “signal wire” or “signal c able”. [note: 101] 

142    The Plaintiff, on the other hand, takes the position that the ignition switc h 5 in D1 simply works as a switc h to c lose the c irc uit along whic h it is installed. It is unable to detec t a DC voltage in exc ess of a threshold value and does not send a signal to the system c ontrol unit. In fac t, in his c losing submissions, the Plaintiff’s position is that there is not even a system c ontrol unit in D1 


(although he appears elsewise to ac c ept that the c entral rec ording unit 4 is the system c ontroller [note: 102] ). Instead, he argues that when the ignition switc h 5 is turned on, the forward and 

rearward c ameras are direc tly “energised” by way of an elec tric al c urrent. [note: 103] 

143    I ac c ept Dr Yu’s opinion that a c oaxial c able c an be used to transmit a signal, as his unc hallenged evidenc e is that c oaxial c ables have traditionally been used to transmit data to a 

c omputer. [note: 104] Indeed, I note that the spec ific ation in D1 itself uses the words “ _signal transmission_ c able” [emphasis added] to desc ribe the c oaxial c ables 10F and 10R in Figure 6 above. 

144    Although the foc us of the parties is on the dual func tions of the ignition monitor, it is in my view more helpful to take a step bac k and examine the broader question of what the overall func tion of the ignition monitor (whic h is c laimed to be the inventive step) is meant to be. In my judgment, the overall func tion of the ignition monitor is to enable power to be drawn direc tly from the vehic le’s ignition system (rather than from any other sourc e), in order to start up the c amera. In this regard, 

the Patent in Suit is direc tly c onnec ted to the primary c irc uit of the ignition system. [note: 105] 

145    However, D1 and, indeed, D3 are both c onnec ted to the ignition switc h, whic h is part of the 

primary c irc uit of the ignition system, [note: 106] suc h that power from the ignition system is also drawn, in the c ase of D1, direc tly to energise the c amera, and in the c ase of D3, to c lose mec hanic al switc hes in order to turn on the c amera. Further, I am also of the view that it is c ommon general knowledge that if a devic e were to be c onnec ted to the ignition system, it is only viable to c onnec t the devic e to the _primary circuit_ of the ignition system. 

146    It will be rec alled that ac c ording to the Plaintiff’s expert, Mr Sc hweiger, there are two c irc uits in the ignition system, a primary c irc uit and a sec ondary c irc uit. As stated earlier, it is dangerous for a person to attempt to interfere with the sec ondary c irc uit as it is of a very high voltage (about 2,000 

to 3,000 volts). [note: 107] It might be said that the inventiveness of the Patent in Suit is apparent in light of the opinion of Mr Sc hweiger, at trial, that the ignition system of a vehic le is rarely, if ever, 

meddled with. [note: 108] Bec ause the Plaintiff’s invention is dependent on c onnec ting the ignition monitor to the ignition system direc tly, and in c ontradistinc tion to other methods of detec ting ignition (suc h as engine revolutions per minute (“RPM”)), might it be said that he “c ontributes something new by showing that, c ontrary to the mistaken prejudic e, the idea will work or is prac tic al”? In short, he must have “shown something new” and demonstrated that the “apparent ‘lion in the path’ is merely a paper tiger”. If so, in this way “his c ontribution is novel and non-obvious and he deserves his patent”: _Pozzoli SpA v BDMO SA_ [2007] FSR 37 at [27], c ited in _Mühlbauer_ ([32] _supra_ ) at [100]. The diffic ulty, however, in the present c ase is that the notional skilled reader will be aware of the dangers of c onnec ting devic es to the sec ondary ignition c irc uit. Indeed, the prior art already taught that video or image rec ordings devic es c ould be powered up by c onnec tion with the primary c irc uit of a c ar ignition system. What is different is the use of the dual-func tion “ignition monitor” in the c laimed invention whose func tions have been explained above. 

147    The key question is whether the requirement of the _ignition monitor_ goes beyond novelty: does it also involve an inventive step? I ac knowledge that the _precise mechanism_ or proc ess by whic h the c amera is ultimately switc hed on is different in eac h of D1, D3 and the Patent in Suit. In the Patent in Suit, the Plaintiff has c onnec ted an _ignition monitor_ to the primary c irc uit of the c ar’s ignition system as part of the proc ess to ac tivate the c amera. The question is: would the notional skilled reader find it obvious to use an ignition monitor as part of that system? This is a matter of judgment. On the evidenc e and material before me, I have c ome to the view that the use of the ignition monitor (bearing in mind its dual func tions and the five-sec ond delay) is inventive. While the prior art does 


teac h that elec tronic devic es (ac c essories) may be c onnec ted to the primary c irc uit, the prior art c ited does not suggest a dual ignition monitor with a built in five-sec ond delay before the sending of the “turn on” signal. I do not think the notional skilled reader would have found these partic ular features “obvious”, even if he was aware that the devic e c ould be wired into the primary c irc uit. 

_Prior art D5_ 

148    For c ompleteness, I shall deal with D5, whic h is a vehic le ac c ident rec ording system whic h employs a digital c amera c onnec ted to a c ontroller, a non-volatile memory and an ac c ident-sensing interrupter. The c ontroller ac c esses images from the digital c amera periodic ally and stores the images. When the storage is full, the newest image overwrites the oldest stored image. In the event of an ac c ident, the interrupter c eases the storage of any more new images (and thus prevents the overriding of older images). The result is that there is a rec orded history of images spanning a time 

period up to the oc c urrenc e of the ac c ident. [note: 109] There are also vehic le operation transduc ers whic h c apture vehic le operation data useful for vehic le ac c ident investigation, suc h as speed, distanc e, braking, steering and engine RPM. The rec ording of the vehic le data operates c ontinuously as long as the vehic le ignition system is on, but sensors of engine RPM stop the rec ording of the 

vehic le data when the engine is not operating, whic h would oc c ur in the event of an ac c ident. [note: 110] 

149    With regards to D5, Dr Yu argues that the “sensors of engine RPM” mentioned in the prec eding 

paragraph, or alternatively the “transduc ers” mentioned in Claim 13 of D5 [note: 111] are c ollec tively the “ignition monitor” of D5. Claim 13 of D5 states: 

 A c omputerized vehic le log system as in c laim 12 wherein the one or more transduc ers measure one or more of speed, fuel flow, ac c eleration and dec eleration, engine RPM, and engine temperature. 

Dr Yu explained at trial that a “transduc er”” is the same as a “sensor”. [note: 112] 

150    During c ross-examination of Dr Yu, the Plaintiff’s c ounsel pointed out that the “[s]ensors of engine RPM” used in the spec ific ation of D5, when read in c ontext, are used to “ _stop_ the rec ording of 

vehic le data when the engine is not operating” [note: 113] [emphasis added]. Dr Yu was thus given an opportunity to address the c ourt on whether and where the spec ific ation of D5 states that sensors of 

engine RPM c an also be used to _start_ the rec ording devic e. [note: 114] On the following day of the trial, Dr Yu proffered the explanation that this feature is disc losed in Claim 13 of D5. He explains that in order for the engine of a vehic le to rotate, there must first be ignition. These engine rotations will be c aptured by the sensors, also c alled transduc ers, whic h will send out a signal that triggers the 

operation of the c amera. [note: 115] 

151    With respec t, I am unable to follow the explanation of Dr Yu. It is not c lear to me, from the wording of Claim 13 of D5, that the sensors or transduc ers in D5 are used to “start up” a c amera. Instead, it is c lear from other parts of the spec ific ation that the sensors of engine RPM “are used to”, _ie_ , they serve only to, _terminate_ the rec ording of vehic le data. This, as the Plaintiff argues, is c ontrary to the purpose of the ignition monitor in the Patent in Suit, whic h is used to send a signal to 

the system c ontroller, to _turn on_ or _start_ the rec ording proc ess of the c amera. [note: 116] 

_Conclusion on inventive step_ 


152    Looking at the prior art doc uments as a whole, I am of the view that the “ignition monitor” is not obvious to a notional skilled person, and c onstitutes an inventive step, in light of the prior art and c ommon general knowledge. The need or desirability for an in-vehic le c amera rec ording system to c apture a vehic le’s external surroundings in c onnec tion with ac c idents is obvious. Indeed, suc h devic es existed in one form or another in the prior art. The question was whether it was obvious to try the partic ular solution devised by the inventor. In my judgment, it was not. 

**_Conclusion on validity of the Patent in Suit_** 

153    In the light of my foregoing findings, I am satisfied that the Patent in Suit is valid and the Defendant’s objec tions in its defenc e fail. Thus, I shall turn to the Defendant’s alternative arguments. 

**Infringement of the Patent in Suit** 

154    The Defendant’s c ase is that in the event that the Patent in Suit is held to be valid, it is in any event not infringed by any of the Defendant’s alleged ac ts (see [21] above). 

155    Sec tion 66(1) of the Patents Ac t states: 

**66.** —(1) Subjec t to the provisions of this Ac t, a person infringes a patent for an invention if, but only if, while the patent is in forc e, he does any of the following things in Singapore in relation to the invention without the c onsent of the proprietor of the patent: 

 ( a ) where the invention is a produc t, he makes, disposes of, offers to dispose of, uses or imports the produc t or keeps it whether for disposal or otherwise; 

 ... 

156    The Defendant’s main defenc e is that three elements of Claim 1 of the Patent in Suit have not been taken by the Devic es, namely, (i) the monitoring of ignition voltage; (ii) the means to send a signal to the system c ontroller on detec tion of an ignition voltage; and (iii) the means to switc h off at least one optic al rec order after a fixed interval after rec eiving the sensor signal. I shall examine eac h of these elements in turn. It bears repeating that it is established law that to infringe the Patent in Suit, the Defendant must take all the essential elements of the c laimed invention. The essential elements are, of c ourse, what c laim c onstruc tion is all about. The remarks of William Cornish, David Llewelyn & Tanya Aplin, _Intellectual Property: Patents, Copyrights, Trade Marks & Allied Rights_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2013) at para 6-02 bear repeating: 

 An artic le with the attributes c alled for in the c laim remains an infringement, even if further things are added to it and even if those things make it more suc c essful. ... But a thing will c ease to be within a c laim if one or more of the essential elements is omitted or substituted by something different—something whic h does not fall within the desc ription used in the c laim. 

 ... 

 It was always law ... that while an infringer must take eac h and every one of the essential integers of a c laim, “non-essential” integers may be omitted or replac ed by mec hanic al equivalents. ... 

**_The monitoring of ignition voltage_** 


157    The Defendant’s c ase is that the Devic es are not c onfigured to be c onnec ted to any part of a 

vehic le or the vehic le’s engine. [note: 117] Indeed, they do not require the ignition of an internal c ombustion engine to work. Instead, they will switc h on and begin rec ording whenever they rec eive an inc oming stable and c ontinuous DC elec tric al power of about 5 volts from any sourc e. In this 

respec t, the Devic es have USB ports whic h c an be c onnec ted to any power sourc e. [note: 118] This 

may be the Devic es’ own internal battery [note: 119] , an external c harger (provided with the Devic es) plugged into the vehic le’s c igarette lighter soc ket, or an external battery supply (suc h as an external power bank or c omputer). In this sense, the Devic es will work even in an elec tric vehic le whic h has no 

internal c ombustion engine. [note: 120] Indeed, Mr Sc hweiger, the Plaintiff’s expert, c onc eded at trial 

that the Devic es will also work when the ignition key of a vehic le is in position 1, [note: 121] _ie_ , when the vehic le’s ac c essories, suc h as the radio, are supplied with power from the vehic le’s battery, but 

there is no ignition of the engine. [note: 122] What this means is that if the driver c onnec ts any of the Devic es to the c igarette lighter soc ket and engages the ignition position 1, the Devic e will still be powered up. For these reasons, the Defendant’s argument is that the Devic es do not monitor engine 

ignition ac tivities at all. [note: 123] This is different from the Plaintiff’s devic e, whic h is wired direc tly to the primary ignition c irc uit and whic h uses an ignition monitor to detec t the requisite stable power voltage and to send a signal to the system c ontroller. 

158    The Plaintiff’s c ase is, however, that the Defendant’s Devic es c ontain “ignition monitors” bec ause the Devic es c ontain the means for detec ting whether a c ar’s ignition is ac tive or not. This position is based on several of Mr Sc hweiger’s experiments outlined in his expert reports: 

 (a) In relation to the MX5, Mr Sc hweiger plugged the external c harger of the MX5 into a c igarette lighter soc ket, c onnec ted to a variable voltage sourc e. He first reduc ed the variable voltage sourc e to about 1 volt, and switc hed the MX5 off. He then gradually inc reased the voltage supplied to the MX5 in steps of about 0.1 to 0.3 volts. When the voltage had reac hed about 6.9 volts, the MX5 switc hed on and began rec ording images. In a variation of this experiment, he used an “on-off” voltage switc h, in whic h the voltage of the c igarette lighter was c hanged from 0 volt to 12 volts (the ignition voltage of a c ar) instantly, rather than inc rementally. He therefore c onc luded that the MX5 had an ignition monitor whic h would allow it to be switc hed on when the c ar ignition is ac tivated. [note: 124] These experiments were repeated by the Plaintiff and Mr Sc hweiger in c ourt on the first day of the trial, produc ing largely the same results (exc ept that in the first experiment, the MX5 only turned on when the voltage was inc reased to about 8 volts). [note: 125] 

 (b) In relation to the MX6 and QB6, Mr Sc hweiger plugged eac h of their external c hargers into a c igarette lighter soc ket supplied with a 12-volt voltage. The MX6 and QB6 eac h turned on automatic ally and began rec ording images. From this, he c onc luded that the MX6 and QB6 will also automatic ally switc h on upon engine ignition. [note: 126] 

159    The Defendant submits that Mr Sc hweiger’s experiments merely demonstrate that (i) the Devic es would power up upon the Devic es rec eiving a c ertain voltage (6.9 or 8 volts); and (ii) c an also switc h on when supplied with the voltage of a typic al ignition system of a vehic le (12 volts). The Defendant’s point appears to be that the experiments do not prove that the Devic es c annot be powered by another sourc e _independent_ from the vehic le’s ignition system. Indeed, it bears repeating that Mr Sc hweiger ac c epted that the Defendant’s Devic es will still switc h on when the ignition switc h is at position 1, suc h that the Devic es rec eive only power from the c ar battery, through the c ar c igarette lighter soc ket, without any engine ignition. 


160    To be c lear, the fac t that the Defendant’s Devic es have a number of different ways of turning on and drawing power (suc h as by (i) c onnec tion to the c igarette lighter soc ket of the c ar; or (ii) c onnec tion to an external power bank via a USB port) does not in itself mean that they are not infringing. They will still infringe if one method of turning on and drawing power is _by means of connection to the ignition system_. 

161    After c onsidering the submissions, I am of the view that the Defendant’s Devic es, whic h c an draw power by being c onnec ted with the c ar’s battery through the c ar c igarette lighter soc ket, falls outside the sc ope of Claim 1. By c ontrast, as I have earlier explained (at [64] above), an “ignition monitor” detec ts the requisite voltage _from or produced by_ the ignition system. This involves wiring to the primary c irc uit of the ignition system. 

162    While this fac tor alone is suffic ient for a finding of non-infringement, for c ompleteness, I now go on to c onsider whether the Defendant’s devic es fall outside of Claim 1 for other reasons. 

**_The means to send a signal to the system controller on detection of an ignition voltage_** 

163    The next issue relates to what I have termed the sec ond func tion of the ignition monitor of the Patent in Suit. The Defendant’s position is that the Devic es do not have the means to send an ignition monitor signal to the system c ontroller on detec tion of an ignition voltage, for the simple reason that there is no ignition monitor. Instead, the Devic es will simply switc h on when they rec eive suffic ient, stable and c ontinuous elec tric power. This is no different from any other elec tric al devic e. 

The turning on and off of elec tric power does not amount to an elec tric “signal”. [note: 127] 

164    On the first day of the trial, Dr Yu, the Defendant’s expert, gave a short demonstration in this regard using a USB c able whic h c ontained multiple wires. He modified the USB c able, c utting off the white and green “signal” wires (used to transmit data), and leaving intac t the red and blac k “power” wires whic h transmit a DC voltage of 5 volts. He then c onnec ted the MX6 to this modified USB c able. The result was that the MX6 likewise turned on and began rec ording images. By this experiment, Dr Yu c onc luded that whenever the MX6 (and any of the other Devic es) rec eive a _power supply_ of 5 

volts, it will begin to rec ord images; no “signal” was required to be transmitted. [note: 128] This c an be distinguished from the invention in the Patent in Suit. 

165    Given my finding (at [70] above) that the plain and ordinary meaning of the word “signal” is a c onveyanc e of information about the voltage, not just voltage (elec tric al power) itself, I agree with the Defendant’s position. Bec ause the Devic es c an be switc hed on even when signal c ables are c ut, this must mean that no “signal” was transmitted to the c ameras, but merely power. In any event, there does not appear to be the equivalent of a “system c ontroller” in any of the Devic es, to whic h any signal c an be sent. Instead, the c ameras in the Devic es are powered direc tly when they rec eive power through the USB c ables. Thus, even if I am wrong in finding that the Defendant’s Devic es do not infringe on the basis that they do not detec t the requisite voltage _from or produced by_ the ignition system, the Defendant’s devic es still fall outside of Claim 1 as they do not have an ignition monitor whic h _sends a signal to a system controller upon detection of the requisite voltage_. 

**_The means to switch off at least one optical recorder after a fixed interval after receiving the sensor signal_** 

166    The next issue in c ontention is the part of Claim 1 of the Patent in Suit whic h deals with whether the optic al rec orders may be switc hed off after a fixed interval upon detec tion of dec eleration or impac t. Ac c ording to the Defendant, the Devic es will c ontinue to operate as long as 


they rec eive steady DC power supply. For example, if the vehic le’s elec tric power supply is 

terminated, the Devic es will c ontinue to operate until the in-built battery is depleted. [note: 129] The Defendant points out that in the experiments desc ribed in Mr Sc hweiger’s first expert report, Mr Sc hweiger had to physic ally disc onnec t the Devic es from the c igarette lighter soc ket before they c ould be switc hed off. Further, in the sec ond opinion of Mr Samuel Yuen (“Mr Yuen”), an advoc ate and solic itor from Yuen Law LLC engaged by the Plaintiff, he also c onc luded that his experiments “do not show evidenc e of this feature [ _ie_ , a system c ontroller providing means to switc h off the optic al 

rec order after a fixed interval after rec eiving a sensor signal]”. [note: 130] I pause to note that Mr Yuen, who was not c alled as a witness for the trial, was engaged by the Plaintiff to provide opinions prior to the engagement of Mr Sc hweiger. As will be disc ussed below, these opinions were rendered in c onnec tion with the c ease and desist letters. For the avoidanc e of any doubt, it is evident that Mr Sc hweiger c onduc ted his own experiments. I add, with respec t, that Mr Yuen’s qualific ations to give expert opinion evidenc e is in any event rather doubtful. No relianc e was plac ed on the views that he expressed. 

167    The Plaintiff’s submission appears to be premised on different understandings of the term “optic al rec order” and what it means for an optic al rec order to be “switc hed off”. 

168    The Plaintiff first draws a distinc tion between an “optic al _recorder_ devic e” and an “optic al _capture_ devic e”. The former, ac c ording to the Plaintiff, stores images permanently while the latter 

merely “observes” images without the means to store them permanently. [note: 131] Thus, the Plaintiff argues, the Defendant’s interpretation of an “optic al rec order” as a c amera, and c onc lusion that the Devic es c ontinue to operate ( _ie_ , the c amera does not switc h off ) even after an impac t, is too 

simplistic. [note: 132] 

169    Instead, the Plaintiff argues that the c ameras of the Devic es, without any storage media, ac t purely as an “optic al _capture_ devic e” that c apture images in front of them. It is only when a storage media (suc h as a memory c ard) is inserted that the Devic es bec ome both an optic al _capture_ devic e and an optic al _recorder_ devic e (by storing optic al images c aptured through the c amera on the storage media). Therefore, it is in fac t the _memory card_ of the Devic es that is the optic al _recorder_ 

devic e desc ribed in Claim 1, bec ause it is the repository in whic h optic al images are stored. [note: 133] 

170    After the Devic es undergo a simulated c ollision (done by applying a stroke with a sc rewdriver to the top of the Devic es), a “key” symbol appears on the display sc reen of the c amera. This means that the rec ordings (post-“c ollision”) are “loc ked” and the data c annot be overridden. When 

extrac ted, it results in a “read only” file. [note: 134] In this way, what I understand the Plaintiff to be arguing is that the optic al _recorder_ devic e will “switc h off” upon detec tion of c ollision or impac t (in that the storage medium is no longer able to store any more images to override the loc ked file), even though the _camera_ itself ( _ie_ , the optic al _capture_ devic e) does not. 

171    With respec t, I am unable to agree with the Plaintiff’s submission. In my view, the distinc tion drawn by the Plaintiff between an “optic al _recorder_ devic e” and an “optic al _capture_ devic e” is not evident in any part of the Patent in Suit. Instead, from a perusal of the c laims, it appears that the term “optic al rec order” is simply a broad, generic phrase whic h, as exemplified in later c laims, c overs a digital c amera (Claim 7) and a digital c amc order (Claim 8) (see [123] above). For example, in one embodiment of the invention in the Patent in Suit shown in Figure 1 above ([63] _supra_ ), item 5 in Figure 1 is referred to as a “digital c amera”, whic h is one variant of an optic al rec order. There is no evidenc e, as the Plaintiff argues, that the _external storage device_ (suc h as a memory c ard) is the “optic al rec order” referred to in Claim 1. Indeed, an “optic al rec order” is distinc t from a “memory 


store”, as is c lear from the drafting of Claims 3 and 4: 

3\. A rec ording system as c laimed in c laim 1 or c laim 2 wherein the at least one _optical recorder_ is provided with an _internal memory store_. 

4\. A rec ording system as c laimed in c laim 1 or c laim 2 wherein the at least one _optical recorder_ is c onnec ted to _a separate memory store_. 

 [emphasis added] 

172    Sinc e an optic al rec order is the c amera itself, rather than the storage devic e, the “switc hing off” of the optic al rec order c annot be taken to mean the termination of storage of images and the c reation of the “read-only” file, as the Plaintiff argues. Instead, the plain and ordinary meaning of “switc hing off” an optic al rec order refers to the physic al turning off of it. This must also have been what is meant in Claim 1 of the Patent in Suit. Ac c ording to the spec ific ation of the Patent in Suit, when the impac t sensor detec ts sudden dec eleration or impac t, a signal is sent to the system c ontroller to turn off the main power supply to the c amera (one example of an optic al rec order) and the standby power supply is turned on to supply power to the c amera instead. The c amera thus 

c ontinues to rec ord for a c ertain amount of time until the standby power supply is switc hed off. [note: 135] It is in this c ontext that the Patent in Suit elaborates that “system c ontroller provid[es] means 

t o _switch off_ the...optic al rec order after a fixed interval after rec eiving the sensor signal” [emphasis 

added]. [note: 136] Without power from either the main or standby power supply, the optic al rec order would be physic ally switc hed off. 

**_Conclusion on infringement_** 

173    For the above-mentioned reasons, the Defendant’s offering of the Devic es for sale does not infringe the Patent in Suit. A dec laration of non-infringement is granted to the Defendant. 

**The Defendant’s counterclaim for groundless threats of proceedings** 

174    Finally, I turn to deal with the Defendant’s c ounterc laim for groundless threats of infringement proc eedings. This is based on the two c ease and desist letters, the c ontents of whic h have been set out at [10] to [12] above. 

**_The legal principles_** 

175    Sec tion 77 of the Patents Ac t states: 

**77.** —(1) Where a person (whether or not the proprietor of, or entitled to any right in, a patent) by c irc ulars, advertisements or otherwise _threatens another person with proceedings for any infringement of a patent_ , a person _aggrieved by the threats_ (whether or not he is the person to whom the threats are made) may, subjec t to subsec tion (4), bring proc eedings in the c ourt against the person making the threats, c laiming any relief mentioned in subsec tion (3). 

 (2) In any suc h proc eedings, the plaintiff shall, if he proves that the threats were so made and satisfies the c ourt that he is a person aggrieved by them, be entitled to the relief c laimed unless — 

 ( a ) the defendant proves that the ac ts in respec t of whic h proc eedings were threatened c onstitute or, if done, would constitute an infringement of a patent ; and 


 ( b ) the patent alleged to be infringed is not shown by the plaintiff to be invalid in a relevant respec t. 

 (3) The said relief is — 

 ( a ) a declaration to the effec t that the threats are unjustifiable ; 

 (b) an injunction against the c ontinuanc e of the threats; and 

 ( c ) damages in respec t of any loss whic h the plaintiff has sustained by the threats. 

 (4) Proc eedings may not be brought under this sec tion for a threat to bring proc eedings for an infringement alleged to c onsist of making or importing a produc t for disposal or of using a proc ess. 

 ... 

 [emphasis added] 

176    The referenc e to “plaintiff” in s 77 of the Patents Ac t inc ludes a plaintiff in a c ounterc laim, suc h as the Defendant in the present suit. For c onvenienc e, and to avoid c onfusion, I shall use the names of the parties in disc ussing the c laim under s 77. The plaintiff in the c ounterc laim is Maka GPS Tec hnologies Pte Ltd (“Maka GPS Tec hnologies”) while the person against whom the relief is sought is Mr Lee Tat Cheng (“Mr Lee”), the patentee and defendant in the c ounterc laim. 

177    A “threat” c an be determined by looking at the letter (whic h is said to c ontain the reported threats) through the eyes of a _reasonable and normal recipient_ and thereafter dec ide whether there c ould be a reasonable argument that the said letter would be understood as a threat of patent proc eedings: _Flexon (Pte) Ltd v Bean Innovations Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">[2000] 3 SLR(R) 492</span> at [47]. In the present c ase, the c ease and desist letters c learly amount to a threat of infringement proc eedings for the purposes of s 77(1). This is espec ially bec ause the c ease and desist letters demanded fees and damages in lieu of Mr Lee’s enforc ement of his stric t legal rights, whic h must inc lude infringement proc eedings. Maka GPS Tec hnologies, being the rec ipient of the c ease and desist letters c ontaining the threats, is a “person aggrieved by the threats” referred to in s 77(1). I should add that there is no indic ation that the “person” who is aggrieved has to be a _natural_ person, sinc e s 2 of the Patents Ac t defines the term “person” used in the Patents Ac t to inc lude the Government. 

178    Under s 77(2) of the Patents Ac t, the burden is on Maka GPS Tec hnologies to prove that (i) threats of infringement proc eedings were made; and (ii) that it is a person aggrieved by the threats. Onc e Maka GPS Tec hnologies suc c eeds in establishing these two elements, it is _prima facie_ entitled to the relief, unless the threat is justified. Suc h a threat is justified if (a) Mr Lee proves that the ac ts in respec t of whic h he had threatened proc eedings c onstitute or would c onstitute an infringement of his patent; _and_ (b) the patent (in respec t of whic h infringement proc eedings were threatened) is not shown by Maka GPS Tec hnologies to be invalid in a relevant respec t: see _ASM Assembly Automation Ltd v Aurigin Technology Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">[2010] 1 SLR 1</span> at [66]. Both c onditions must be satisfied in order for Mr Lee’s threats to be justified. 

179    In this c ase, the threat is not justified bec ause one of the two c umulative c onditions has not been satisfied. Even though the Patent in Suit is valid ( _ie_ , c ondition (b) is satisfied), I found earlier that Maka GPS Tec hnologies’ ac ts _do not_ c onstitute an infringement of the Patent in Suit. Therefore, relief under this sec tion may be available. 


180    I turn then to the question of disc retion and the grant of relief. In the rec ent c ase of _Singsung Pte Ltd v LG 26 Electronics Pte Ltd (trading as L S Electrical Trading)_ <span class="citation">[2016] 4 SLR 86</span> (“ _Singsung_ ”), the Court of Appeal analysed the groundless threat provisions, albeit in the c ontext of c opyright law. Whilst the Court of Appeal was c onc erned solely with the equivalent provision in s 200 of the Copyright Ac t (Cap 63, 2006 Rev Ed), the views expressed on the underlying polic y behind the statutory ac tion for groundless threats may be relevant to other areas of intellec tual property law, inc luding patent law. 

181    The Court of Appeal held (at [133]) that the purpose of a c laim of groundless threats is to provide a statutory remedy for aggrieved parties whose business or reputation might be affec ted by threats emanating from another party, without the need to prove bad faith on the part of the threatening party. 

182    The Court of Appeal also opined (at [129) that the rationale underlying the groundless threat provisions is to establish a balanc e between the protec tion of existing intellec tual property rights and the prevention of “bullying” tac tic s in whic h right-holders use the threat of legal proc eedings direc ted at their c ompetitors or c ustomers to c hill their legitimate ac tivities. 

183    In this regard, the possible high c osts assoc iated with defending an ac tion for infringement of an intellec tual property right may have the effec t of frightening away c ompetitors, even those whose ac tivities are not in fac t infringing, but who are nonetheless unprepared to fac e the c osts and time involved in establishing their innoc enc e: _Singsung_ at [129]. On the other hand, overly broad groundless threats provisions may instead have a “c hilling” effec t on the proprietors of intellec tual property rights, bec ause the fear of exposure to liability for groundless threats may mean that those with fewer resourc es will hesitate to enforc e, or perhaps even forgo the legitimate enforc ement of, their rights in the first plac e: _Singsung_ at [138]. 

184    The Court of Appeal opined (at [148]) that the task of the c ourt is to c onsider whether, in all the c irc umstanc es, there is any reason for it to grant relief upon a c laim of a groundless threat that is founded on a failed allegation of infringement. In this regard, the Court of Appeal stated that it does not follow that where an allegation of infringement has failed, this _must_ nec essarily result in any relief being granted; instead, the grant of relief by the c ourt is _discretionary_. In eac h c ase, the question of whether relief ought to be granted will be a fac t-sensitive inquiry as to whether the ac tion was warranted and whether any relief is required at all. The c ost c onsequenc es flowing from a failed c laim would also be a relevant c onsideration. 

185    Although the above polic y c onsiderations are broadly relevant to patent law, I note that the Copyright Ac t c loaks the relief available under s 200 in disc retionary language. Sec tion 200(1) of the Copyright Ac t provides that where a person threatens another person with proc eedings for c opyright infringement, a person who is aggrieved may bring an ac tion and “may” obtain a dec laration that the threats are unjustified and an injunc tion, and “may” rec over damages, unless the ac ts in respec t of whic h proc eedings were threatened c onstituted or would c onstitute an infringement of c opyright. 

186    Sec tion 77(2) of the Patents Ac t, on the other hand, employs language whic h, at least at first sight, is far more prosc riptive in nature. It states that the plaintiff shall, if he proves that the threats were so made and satisfies the c ourt that he is a person aggrieved by them, be _entitled_ to the relief c laimed, _unless_ the threats were justified (on whic h, see [178] above). The reliefs available are set out in s 77(3) (quoted in full at [175] above). 

187    Whilst there are similarities between s 200 of the Copyright Ac t and s 77 of the Patents Ac t, the language and struc ture of the provisions is not the same. 


188    In my view, the stronger language of s 77(3) of the Patents Ac t should be taken into ac c ount. The provisions in s 77 represent a c areful balanc ing of the interests of the plaintiff and the defendant. This is evident from the c areful and detailed alloc ation of burdens of proof and the various elements required to be established by s 77 of the Patents Ac t. Ac c ordingly, the Court does not appear to have disc retion as to whether to award relief under s 77. Onc e the plaintiff has established all the requisite elements – namely that he is _prima facie_ entitled to relief ( _ie_ , threats were made and he is an aggrieved person) _and_ the threats are not shown to be justified – the plaintiff is _entitled_ to be granted a form of relief. 

189    I turn now to the type of relief that may be applied for. The nature of the relief is, of c ourse, a relevant c onsideration. The grant of an injunc tion, on general princ iples, is a disc retionary remedy. Under s 77(3) of the Patents Ac t, the injunc tion is limited to an order against the c ontinuanc e of the threats. It may be that there will be c ases where there is no likelihood that the threats will be repeated. In suc h a c ase, I am of the view that the c ourt is not bound to grant the injunc tion. Nevertheless, if it is found that the threats are unjustified within the terms of s 77, and taking into ac c ount the language and struc ture of the provisions, the plaintiff would still be entitled to damages for any loss whic h it has sustained by the threats. The burden, of c ourse, is on the plaintiff to show a loss that was c aused by the threats. If he is unable to establish any loss, it must follow that there is no basis for any award (save possibly of a notional sum). Finally, there is the question as to whether dec laratory relief ( _ie_ , a dec laration that the threat is unjustified) should be granted. 

**_The parties’ submissions_** 

190    Ac c ording to Maka GPS Tec hnologies, there are a few reasons why the c ease and desist letters 

c onstitute groundless threats of infringement proc eedings. [note: 137] First, it argues that there was no reasonable basis for the c ease and desist letters. Prior to the sending of the c ease and desist letters, Mr Lee did not seek the advic e of a qualified registered patent agent, but only engaged Mr Yuen, an advoc ate and solic itor, to provide three infringement opinions. These opinions were not grounded on a tec hnic al analysis undertaken by a patent agent or someone skilled in the art. Further, Mr Yuen had opined that the experiments he had c arried out on the MX6 _did not_ disc lose one of the essential elements of the Patent in Suit, namely, the system c ontroller providing means to switc h off the optic al rec order after a fixed interval after rec eiving a sensor signal. 

191    Sec ond, Mr Lee’s demand for damages in the c ease and desist letters were not justified. It appears that the 13 February 2014 letter, whic h demanded damages amounting to $50,000, was based on the Plaintiff’s “market study” that essentially c omprised walking around a c ar park in Singapore and c ounting the number of c ars with c ar c ameras, rather than any analytic al study. The Plaintiff was also unable to explain how he c ame up with the figures (demanded in the 28 Oc tober 2014 letter) of a lic enc e fee of $12 per unit of the Devic es sold, $3,750 for the expert opinion and 

$7,500 for investigation fees and professional fees. [note: 138] 

192    Third, the point is made by Maka GPS Tec hnologies that the writ of summons for the present suit was issued belatedly on 10 Marc h 2015, more than a year after the 13 February 2014 letter. 

193    Mr Lee’s argument was simply that, based on his submissions, there was no groundless threat bec ause the Patent in Suit was valid and subsisting, and the Devic es have been shown to infringe the 

Patent in Suit. [note: 139] Unfortunately, I am unable to ac c ept this argument bec ause I have earlier found that the Devic es did not infringe the Patent in Suit. 

**_Decision_** 


194    In the c irc umstanc es, I have already found that the c ease and desist letters c onstitute threats and that Maka GPS Tec hnologies is entitled to relief bec ause Mr Lee has failed to establish one of the two c umulative fac tors for a threat to be justified (see [177] and [179] above). I shall, however, make a few c omments about the parties’ submissions. First, I am of the view that the first point raised by Maka GPS Tec hnologies ( _ie_ , that there was no reasonable basis for the c ease and desist letters) is not a relevant c onsideration in determining whether there is a right to c laim relief. The question is simply whether the threat of proc eedings for patent infringement was made. The ac tion set out in s 77 is not limited to c ases where the person making the threat ac ted unreasonably. 

195    I am also of the view that the sec ond c omplaint raised ( _ie_ , unjustified sums of damages and lic ense fees c laimed in respec t of the alleged infringement) is also irrelevant to the question of whether the threat of proc eedings was made. However, I ac c ept that the ac tions of the person making the threat and the severity or quantum of the “requests” or “demands” made against the alleged infringer c an be relevant to the loss suffered by the alleged infringer. It will be rec alled that in _Singsung_ ([180] _supra_ ), the Court of Appeal held that the purpose of groundless threat proc eedings is to provide a statutory remedy for aggrieved parties _whose business or reputation might be affected by threats_ emanating from another party (see [181] above). It follows that it is inc umbent on Maka GPS Tec hnologies to show loss in the sense that its business or reputation was affec ted. I will return to this point shortly. 

196    Finally, I deal with the third point raised by Maka GPS Tec hnologies, whic h is the one-year delay in issuing the writ of summons for the present suit. In my view, the timing of the subsequent c ommenc ement of proc eedings – or indeed whether proc eedings are c ommenc ed at all – is and should be irrelevant to the issue of groundless threats. 

197    First, it would be noted from the wording of s 77 of the Patents Ac t that it is the _threat_ of proc eedings, rather than the _actual commencement_ of it, whic h is ac tionable. Indeed, the ac tion c reated by s 77 of the Patents Ac t is entitled “Remedy for groundless _threats_ of infringement proc eedings” [emphasis added]. The justifiability of the threat depends solely on the two c umulative fac tors in s 77(2) of the Patents Ac t, as set out at [178] above, and not on whether and when legal proc eedings are in fac t c ommenc ed thereafter. 

198    Sec ond, if the timing of the subsequent c ommenc ement of proc eedings (after the threat) was a relevant c onsideration, there would be an “anomaly” in that not only would the c ommenc ement of suits _per se_ be enc ouraged (a c onc ern in _Singsung_ ([180] _supra_ ) at [134]), but there would also be a perverse inc entive for the _speedy_ c ommenc ement of proc eedings. It is not unimaginable that in suc h a c ase, holders of intellec tual property rights would hastily c ommenc e legal ac tions in a bid to avoid liability for groundless threats, without even giving the opposing party time to c onsider its next c ourse of ac tion. This would c learly be against the general polic y of enc ouraging out-of-c ourt settlement of disputes, but would instead proliferate the “sue first, talk later” approac h that has perturbed legal prac titioners and the judic iary (see _Singsung_ at [135]). 

199    In the light of my c omments, it is evident that the parties’ submissions do not alter my earlier finding that Maka GPS Tec hnologies is entitled to relief. I now turn to the appropriate form of relief to be granted to Maka GPS Tec hnologies. In this regard, the learned authors of _CIPA Guide to the Patents Acts_ (Paul G Cole ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2011) (“ _The CIPA Guide_ ”) state (at para 70.06) that “[t]o obtain an award of damages, the c laimant must prove a financ ial loss arising from the threat”. An example provided is _Carflow Products (UK) Ltd v Linwood Securities (Birmingham) Ltd and Others_ [1998] FSR 691, where Laddie J dec lined to award damages bec ause the retailer had only withdrawn the produc ts from its c atalogue _after_ a writ was served against it. The loss suffered by the retailer in withdrawing those items was held not to be c aused by the threat, but by its own 


dec ision to withdraw its produc ts. 

200    I note that _The CIPA Guide_ also states (at para 70.06) that a suc c essful c laimant is entitled to an inquiry into damages even when the c ourt has deep suspic ions that he would rec over very little indeed. To this end, the issues of liability and quantum should be heard together. 

201    However, in the evidenc e before me, the only “damage” that Maka GPS Tec hnologies suffered was its alleged diffic ulty in obtaining financ ing, whic h arose _after_ the _commencement of legal_ 

_proceedings_. [note: 140] There is no evidenc e at all as to what the impac t was (if any) on their business or reputation. Indeed, there is no evidenc e that Maka GPS Tec hnologies had ac c eded to any of the demands by Mr Lee. Thus, Maka GPS Tec hnologies has failed to show that any c onc eivable damage has arisen from the demands being made in the c ease and desist letters, whic h c annot now be c ompensated by a c osts order against Mr Lee for having issued an unwarranted threat. Consequently, I dec line to make any award of damages to Maka GPS Tec hnologies. 

202    While Maka GPS Tec hnologies is _prima facie_ entitled to a dec laration that the threats made were unjustifiable, I am of the view (like the Court of Appeal in _Singsung_ ([180] _supra_ )) that this relief is unnec essary bec ause I have already found that Mr Lee’s c laim for infringement fails and I have ordered that a dec laration of non-infringement be granted to Maka GPS Tec hnologies. 

203    While there is nothing to suggest that Mr Lee will make further threats, I am of the view that this is an appropriate c ase to grant an injunc tion against the c ontinuanc e of the threats. 

**Conclusion** 

204    In sum, although the c laims of the Patent in Suit are novel and inventive, and therefore valid, the Defendant’s offering of the Devic es for sale does not infringe the Patent in Suit and the Plaintiff’s c laims fail. A dec laration of non-infringement is granted to the Defendant. The Defendant suc c eeds in its c ounterc laim for groundless threats of infringement proc eedings. An injunc tion is granted to the Defendant against the c ontinuanc e of the threats by the Plaintiff. 

205    Costs for the c laim and c ounterc laim are to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant, to be agreed or taxed.
