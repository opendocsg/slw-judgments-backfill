### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

This was an appeal from the dec ision of distric t judge Jasvender Kaur who c onvic ted the appellant on a c harge of c riminal intimidation under s 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) by threatening t o kill one Belen C De Vera, one Merc edes J Padillo and one Anelita S Domingo. The appellant was sentenc ed to six months’ imprisonment. She appealed against both her c onvic tion and sentenc e. I dismissed the appeal against c onvic tion but allowed the appeal against sentenc e. I now set out my reasons. 

**_Background facts_** 

2       The appellant, one Salvac ion Dalayon Woon ("Woon"), is a Singapore c itizen but a Filipino by birth. She is 38 years old and worked as an assistant manager with Signature Employment Agenc y. ("the agenc y"). The c omplainants spec ified in the c harge – Belen C De Vera ("Belen"), Merc edes J Padillo ("Merc edes") and Anelita S Domingo ("Anelita") are all Filipinos who had been rec ruited to work here as domestic maids by the agenc y. A fourth c omplainant, one Marilyn Ventura Ober ("Marilyn") was also initially spec ified in the c harge but her name was subsequently deleted on applic ation by the prosec ution. 

3       The four maids were required to pay the agenc y a sum of S$2,010 eac h as fees for arranging their employment here. This was to be paid in instalments via deduc tions from their monthly pay. At the time of the offenc e, eac h of them was still owing money to the agenc y in differing amounts. 

**_Prosecution case_** 

4       The relevant events happened on 8 August 2001. On the afternoon of that day, all four maids were at the agenc y, in the kitc hen. Sometime in the late afternoon, a c ouple and their son went to t h e agenc y. They sat together with Woon and one Ruth Marie Low Chew Lo Tec k ("Ruth"). Subsequently, an argument broke out between the c ouple and Woon. All four maids c ame out from the kitc hen to peep at the quarrel and returned to the kitc hen after it ended. 


5       After the quarrel, Woon went to the kitc hen and asked them if they were still willing to work in Singapore. All four remained silent. Woon then returned to her offic e and c alled the four maids in. They c omplied. In the offic e also at that time were Ruth and another Filipino maid c alled MaryLou. 

6       Woon sc olded the four maids for not answering her earlier and c alled both Anelita’s aunt and Marilyn’s agent in the Philippines. Woon told Anelita’s aunt to prepare 70,000 pesos to pay the agenc y if Anelita wished to return to Philippines. Anelita was then told to speak with her aunt. Similarly, she told Marilyn’s agent to prepare money. Marilyn and Belen (who had the same agent) were told to speak with the agent. 

7       Woon then told the four maids that they would have to pay 70,000 pesos to return home, or she would hire someone to kill them in the Philippines and pay him 20,000 pesos to do so. The four maids testified that Woon was very angry when she uttered the threat. All three of the maids in c ourt testified that they were very frightened and worried by the threat. 

8       Subsequently, Woon and Ruth left the agenc y. The maids were left to spend the night there. After disc ussions, they dec ided to esc ape from the agenc y. They sawed through the padloc k on the gate and took a taxi to the Philippine embassy. It was shortly after midnight and the embassy was c losed. 

9       Anelita then c ontac ted one Joc elyn Bayduan ("Joc elyn"), a Filipino domestic maid working here, for help. Joc elyn and her employer met the four maids and took them to a polic e station. 

10     Joc elyn testified under c ross-examination that Anelita had told her that the agenc y had threatened them when she met the four maids. At the polic e station, Anelita then told her about the details of the threat, that " _the agency had asked them to pay a big sum of money, failing which the agency would hire someone to kill them._ " 

**_Appellant’s Defence_** 

11     Woon made a statement P3 on 11 August 2001 to the Investigating Offic er one M Saravanan ("Saravanan"). In subsequent investigations, Woon refused to sign her s 122(6) statement taken by Saravanan on 8 January 2002. 

12     Ruth was also c alled as a defenc e witness. Ruth gave a statement P4 to Saravanan on 22 August 2001. 

13     In c ourt, Woon testified that on 8 August 2001, MaryLou had informed both her and Ruth that the maids were planning to esc ape. They had not taken this seriously. 

14     After the quarrel with the c ouple, she had asked Ruth to c all the four maids from the kitc hen. This was to tell them to prepare themselves as Woon wished to bring them home so as to take them to the zoo the next day. The maids remained silent and she asked Ruth to tell them to return to the kitc hen. 

15     At around 6.30 pm, Woon asked Ruth to c all Marilyn to the offic e to talk to her agent. Woon c alled the agent on the telephone and asked Marilyn to speak with him. Marilyn remained silent. After that, at about 7.29 pm, the appellant again asked Marilyn to speak to her agent. Onc e more, Marilyn remained silent. At this time, only Woon, Ruth, Marilyn and MaryLou were present. Ac c ording to Woon, she then turned behind to Ruth and said _"Na_ (meaning Ruth) _, if Marilyn behaviour like this in Philippines can be killed."_ Woon further c laimed that she was c rying at this time. Ruth c omforted her 


and sent the two maids into the kitc hen. 

16     Ruth’s version of events given in c ourt was substantially similar to Woon’s. 

**_The decision below_** 

17     The prosec ution applied to impeac h Woon and Ruth based on the inc onsistent statements that they had given previously. Both were given the opportunity to explain the inc onsistenc ies. 

18     Woon c laimed that she was c onfused due to problems with her c hildren at the time of the statements and also that she did not say what had been rec orded. Similarly, Ruth c laimed that she had been c onfused at the time of making the statement. 

19     The distric t judge rejec ted their explanations and found that both had had their c redit impeac hed. She then allowed the two statements into evidenc e pursuant to s 147(3) of the Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97). She ac c epted the maids’ evidenc e that Woon had threatened them, that all of them had been in the presenc e of Woon when the threat was made, and also as to the details of the threat. She found further support for this finding from the testimony of Joc elyn. 

**_The appeal against conviction_** 

20     The grounds of appeal c onsisted of c hallenges to the findings of fac t made below. It is trite law that the appellate c ourt will not disturb the findings of fac t of a lower c ourt unless they are c learly reac hed against the weight of evidenc e – _Lim Ah Poh v PP_ <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 704</span>. An appellate c ourt must not merely entertain doubts about whether the dec ision is right but must be c onvinc ed that it is wrong: _PP v Azman bin Abdullah_ <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 704</span>. 

21     Woon c ontended that as the findings of the lower c ourt arose primarily from inferenc es made from the c ontent of a witnesses’ evidenc e here, the appellate c ourt was in as good a position to review the evidenc e and c ome to its own c onc lusions. Counsel c ited my judgement in _PP v Choo Thiam Hock_ <span class="citation">[1994] 3 SLR 248</span> as support. In my opinion, this arose from a misunderstanding of what I said in that c ase. In both _Choo_ and _PP v Tubbs Julia Elizabeth_ <span class="citation">[2001] 4 SLR 75</span>, I had emphasised that it would only be in exc eptional c ases where " _logic clearly militates against findings of fact made by the trial judge_ " that the appellate c ourt would review the findings of the lower c ourt, even when the demeanour of the witness was not in issue in the determination of his/her c redibility. 

22     It should be c larified t hat _Choo_ does not lower the bar for appellate intervention. The signific anc e of a finding based primarily on evidenc e for the appellate c ourt would only be that it is better equipped to c onc lude that the judge below was plainly wrong. The princ iples enunc iated in _Lim Ah Poh_ and like c ases must still be applied and kept foremost in the mind of the appellate c ourt. 

23     The grounds of appeal c ould be broadly dealt with under the following headings: 

 (1) Whether the judge below had been mistaken in her reliance on the portions of the appellant’s (P3) and Ruth’s (P4) statements by taking them out of context 

24     The material portions of P3 and P4 are as set out: 

 P 

 "5. On 8 August 2001, I had called ‘Marilyn’ and ‘Anelita’. I 


 told them that there 

 had still owed their respective agents money for coming to Singapore. As such, it was difficult to have them send back. They insisted and I blew my top. I told them that I would have someone kill them. During this conversation, ‘Mercedes’ and ‘Belen’ were also around the office and I believe that they could have heard the threat. I wish to say that I have no intention of carrying out the threat." [emphasis added] 

 P 

 "4. On 8 August 2001, I was in the office together with 

 [the appellant], Anelita and Marilyn. [Woon] had allowed Marilyn and Anelita to talk on the phone. Thereafter Susan and the 2 maids engaged themselves in a conversation. During the conversation, [Woon] got angry, as both were indecisive of wanting to work in Singapore. She told them that she would kill them. I then advised them about their well-being and to work properly for the next employer. They were laughing and went back to the kitchen area. During our conversation, Mercedes and Belen were in the kitchen. I went home at about 8.00pm." [emphasis added] 

25     Woon c ontended that, in relying on the highlighted portions to find that she had made the threat to _all four_ maids, the judge below had erred as the c ontext of the statements set out was that the appellant had made a threat _only_ to Anelita and Marilyn 

. Thus, the distric t judge took the portions out of c ontext in her relianc e on them to find that the threat had been made to the four maids. 

26     In support, I was quoted the guidelines laid down in _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP_ <span class="citation">[1999] 1 SLR 25</span> at 58-59 on the fac tors to c onsider in determining the weight of a statement admitted under s 147(3) of the Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97). Spec ific ally, I was referred to the following part of my judgement: 

F o u r t h , re ga rd s ho uld be ha d to the co nte xt o f the s ta te me nt. Subs e ctio n (6) do e s no t re s trict co ns ide ra tio n to o nly the ma king o f the s ta te me nt but re quire s co ns ide ra tio n o f a ll the circums ta nce s a ffe cting its a ccura cy. Thus , the co urt mus t co ns ide r the co nte xt o f the inco ns is te nt po rtio ns , w hich re quire s tha t the w ho le o f the s ta te me nt be e xa mine d**. Reliance cannot be placed on a portion of the statement that is taken out of context**. [e mpha s is a dde d] 

27     I found this c hallenge to be misc onc eived. The judge below did not rely on the statements in finding that the ac c used had made a threat to the maids; her relianc e on them in this respec t was limited to the _tenor of the words_ whic h the ac c used uttered. This was evident in 71 of her Grounds of Dec ision: 

 The material portion of the ac c used’s statement that she ha d threatened the maids by stating that she would hire someone to kill them was consistent with the threat which the maids had testified was made. [emphasis added] 

28     It was c lear here that the judge below was c onc erned with the _details_ of what Woon had 


said, not whom she had said it to. There was c learly nothing wrong in relying on the statements in this way. While relying on the highlighted portions to show that a threat was made to all the maids might have infringed the princ iple from _Kelvin Chai_ , the same c ould not be said of relianc e on it merely as evidenc e of what was said by the ac c used at the relevant time. 

**(2) Whether the judge below erred in her selective reliance on P3 and P** 

29     Woon’s c hallenge here was that the judge below had rejec ted portions of the statements inc onsistent with the prosec ution c ase without giving good reasons in c oming to her findings. Spec ific ally, they pointed to her findings that all four maids were c alled to the offic e and threatened, that Woon, Anelita, Marilyn and Belen had used the telephone in the inc ident and that the maids had all been alarmed by the threat. 

30     I found these c ontentions without merit. All the inc onsistenc ies raised had been dealt with fully by the judge below. It was only in respec t of the last issue that she had failed to give c onsideration to Ruth’s statement (P4) that the two maids were " _laughing and went back to the kitchen area"_ after the threat. In my opinion, the judge below should have given her reasons for rejec ting this, sinc e it related to the important issue of the effec t the threat had on the maids. However, in view of her finding that: 

 i four maids had been involved in the inc ident, rather than two as the statement c laimed; as well as the fac t that 

 ii there was strong evidenc e that the maids were sc ared by the threat suc h as the c irc umstanc es of their esc ape and the evidenc e given by both Joc elyn and the polic e offic er on duty, to whom the maids had made their polic e report to the effec t that the maids had looked sc ared and worried; 

I found her lac k of reasons to be of little c onsequenc e. 

**(3) Whether the judge below was correct in rejecting the Woon’s explanation for her inconsistent statements** 

31     Woon had tried to explain her inc onsistent statement by c laiming that she was c onfused at the time of its making. This was due to the fac t that she suspec ted her maid of having sexually abused her daughter and also that her son had been injured. Woon c ontended that the effec t of an apprehended sexual assault on her daughter should have been c onsidered by the judge below. 

32     In my view, the judge below was c orrec t in rejec ting this explanation. First, Woon had not been c onsistent in her explanations to the c ourt. When she was first c ross-examined on the inc onsistenc ies, she c laimed that she was unable to rec all if she had indeed said the things rec orded i n the statement. On later c ross-examination, she c larified that she was _only_ c onfused about 5 (reproduc ed above) and 9 (not relevant to the c harge) of the statement. However, on reexamination, the appellant was suddenly able to list out in detail what she had told to Saravanan in _every paragraph_ , espec ially with regards 5. This was also where she alleged that the statement rec orded was _not_ what she said. The mirac ulous rec overy of her rec ollec tion flies plainly in the fac e of her alleged "c onfused" state. 

33     This was further reinforc ed by Woon c laiming to have said the last sentenc e of 5, that she did not intend to c arry out the threat, yet c onc urrently deny that she had said the other parts of 5. 


34     Sec ondly, Woon’s statement was materially similar in c ontent to Ruth’s statement. Although Ruth was also apparently "c onfused" when she made the statement, it was c ertainly not for the same serious reasons as Woon. As appropriately put by the judge below at 66 of her Grounds of Dec ision, it was "... _incredible that_ (Woon and Ruth) _were confused and ended up making the same mistake."_ 

35     Finally, evidenc e given by the defenc e showed that Woon had taken her daughter to a doc tor on 5 August 2001, and the results of the doc tor’s examination had been that there was no evidenc e of sexual abuse. In view of all the above, the judge below was c learly right to rejec t Woon’s explanation. 

**(4) Whether the judge below erred in accepting the testimonies of the maids given the numerous discrepancies in their evidence** 

36     The appellant alleges that the trial judge erred in ac c epting the evidenc e of the maids, given the numerous disc repanc ies in their testimonies in c ourt about the events of that day and in relation to eac h other. These related to, _inter alia_ , whether they all stayed in the agenc y on 7 August 2001, the fac t that they c ould not rec all the argument between the appellant and the c ouple and their c onflic ting testimonies as to who used the telephone at the time of the offenc e. 

37     After c arefully c onsidering all the evidenc e, I was of the opinion that there was nothing wrong with the findings of the judge below. In _Ng Kwee Leong v PP_ <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 942</span>, the c ourt stated c learly that immaterial disc repanc ies would not detrac t from the verac ity of witnesses on material issues. As the Chief Justic e held in that c ase, 

 Adequate allowanc e must be given to human fallibility in the prec ise assessment of short spans of time. 

In addition, the maids’ ac c ounts were c orroborated to some extent by the testimony of Joc elyn. 

38     One point, however, stood out. Counsel for Woon c ontended that the possibility of c ollusion by the maids should have been c onsidered by the judge below sinc e their testimonies c oinc ided on many material aspec ts. While it is true that a trial judge should always be alive to the possibility of prepared testimonies by witnesses, it is surely plausible that testimonies c oinc ide bec ause the fac ts desc ribed within are true. 

39     Numerous other grounds of appeal were raised, but I found of them to be of little or no merit. Ac c ordingly, I found no reason to disturb the distric t judge’s findings and dismissed the appeal against c onvic tion. 

**_The appeal against sentence_** 

40     The offenc e of whic h Woon had been c onvic ted fell under the sec ond limb of s 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) for being a threat to c ause death. The maximum punishment is a term of imprisonment up to seven years or a fine or both. She had been sentenc ed to six month’s imprisonment, whic h was the normal tariff for an offenc e of this nature. 

41     Taking into ac c ount the c irc umstanc es of the c urrent c ase, I was of the view that the sentenc e meted out by the judge below was manifestly exc essive. 

42     It bears remembering that while an objec tive view is taken of the words uttered and their effec t, for the purposes of determining whether an offenc e under s 506 was made out and whic h limb 


it fell to be punished under, the c onsiderations for the c ourt in passing sentenc e are very different. 

43     In determining the appropriate sentenc e to be passed in offenc es of this nature, the c ourt has to c onsider c arefully the events and c irc umstanc es surrounding its c ommission. The question to be determined is always this: to what extent c an there be said to have been a serious threat made? In determining this, both the intention of the maker of the threat as well as the fear that the vic tim was put in due to the threat are of great relevanc e: see _Lee Yoke Choong v PP_ [1964] 1 MLJ 1964, _PP v Luan Yuanxin_ <span class="citation">[2002] 2 SLR 98</span>. 

44     In the present c ase, I did not think that there was any question that the threat was neither seriously intended to be a threat to life, nor understood as suc h by the vic tims. First, it was undisputed that Woon was extremely angry when she uttered the threat. Sec ondly, the threat took plac e in the presenc e of two other people – Ruth and MaryLou. Thirdly, the vic tims were put in no immediate fear for their lives. No weapons were used; neither did the c ontext of the threat itself lead to an apprehension of _immediate_ hurt. 

45     The trial judge had herself found that " _there can be no doubt that the accused never intended to carry out the threat._ " The ac tual effec t of the threat of death on the vic tims was also not severe. While they were frightened enough to esc ape, all of them testified that they had wanted to return to the Philippines after the threat was made despite their fear. 

46     In addition, none of them were harmed. Woon had left them alone in the agenc y after the inc ident and, ac c ording to the maids’ evidenc e, had even offered to take one of them to the zoo with her the following day. The threat was also not prolonged; the maids were sent to the kitc hen immediately after Woon uttered the threat. 

47     A perusal of past c ases shows that the present situation is distinguishable. In _Ramanathan Yogendran v PP_ <span class="citation">[1995] 2 SLR 563</span>, the ac c used solic itor had uttered the threat to kill over the telephone after a quarrel with the vic tim the previous day. In reduc ing the sentenc e from a year’s imprisonment to six months, I stated that " _a_ **_threat to kill someone which is made in all seriousness_** _is not something to be taken lightly"_ [emphasis added]. I found the present c ase, where the threat was uttered in anger and very obviously on impulse, to be of even lesser gravity than in _Ramanathan_ , where the phone c all was c learly pre-meditated. 

48     In _PP v N_ <span class="citation">[1999] 4 SLR 619</span>, where the ac c used had also threatened to kill his wife via telephone, a sentenc e of one years’ imprisonment was imposed. There were many aggravating fac tors in this c ase, not least the fac t that it was in the c ontext of a violent domestic relationship where there was every likelihood of the threat being c arried out, as well as the fac t that three other c harges had been taken into c onsideration for sentenc ing. This was not the situation here. It was the evidenc e of the maids that they had been well-treated by Woon prior to the inc ident. 

49     The other c ases c ited by the DPP in support of the sentenc e passed were also distinguishable as they c onc erned threats made using weapons, whic h were c learly aggravated. 

50     The c ontext of the threat in the c irc umstanc es of the present c ase was unique. Woon was not a mafia boss or c riminal mastermind, she was only a manager in a maid agenc y. While it is undoubted that the maids were put in fear by her threat to hire a killer, the amount of fear thus induc ed c ould not have been as great as in the c ases previously disc ussed. 

51     I was also of the opinion that part of their fear stemmed from the demand for payment Woon had made of them. This is shown by the exc erpt below from Merc edes’ testimony: 


 "Q: What was discussed? 

 A: We did plan to escape because of the money the Accused is asking us to pay and the threat of killing us." 

 [emphasis added] 

In similar vein, Anelita also stated in her Examination in Chief: 

 "Q. Why did you not stay at 329 Changi Road. Why did you have to get out? 

 A. The reason why we did not stay and thought of escaping was because we were told to pay the 70, pesos and we were so scared and that is why we did not stay and because of the threat to us." 

 [emphasis added] 

52     Counsel for Woon argued strenuously that the present c ase did not merit a c ustodial sentenc e. I disagreed. Threats to c ause death, no matter how c asually said, are a serious matter and are so regarded by the c ourt. Offenc es under the sec ond limb of s 506 are invariably punished with c ustodial sentenc es bec ause of the seriousness of these offenc es. 

53     However, having taken the fac tors disc ussed above into ac c ount, I was of the view that a sentenc e of three months imprisonment would be more appropriate in this c ase. I therefore allowed the appeal against sentenc e and varied it ac c ordingly.
