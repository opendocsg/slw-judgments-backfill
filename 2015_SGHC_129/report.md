**Introduction** 

1       This review c onc erns two partyandparty bills rendered by the Applic ant, the Singapore Medic al Counc il (“SMC”), against the Respondent, Dr Susan Lim (“Dr Lim”): 

 (a) Bill of Costs No 111/2014 (“B/C 111/2014”) for work done for hearings before two disc iplinary c ommittees from 20102012 (the “DC hearings”); and 

 (b) Bill of Costs No 110/2014 (“B/C 110/2014”) for work done for an appeal to a Court of Three Judges. 

2       On 4 September 2014, B/C 111/2014 and B/C 110/2014 (“the Bills”) were taxed by an Assistant Registrar (“AR”) in the following amounts (all exc luding GST): 


 (ii) Sec ond legal assessor’s fees: $235,635. 

 (ii) Sec ond legal assessor’s fees: $20, 

 (ii) Sec ond legal assessor’s fees: $22, 

 (iii) Dr Tan Yew Oo’s fees: $12, 

 (iii) Dr Tan Yew Oo’s fees: $6, 

 (iii) Dr Tan Yew Oo’s fees: $9, 

 (iv) Dr Hong Ga Sze’s fees: $40,

 110/2014 1 $150,000 $40,000 $70, 

 2 $ 3,000 $ 1,000 $ 1, 

3       SMC then filed Summonses Nos 4444 of 2014 and 4443 of 2014 to seek a review of the AR’s taxation of Sec tions 1, 2 and 3 of BC 111/2014 and Sec tion 1 of BC 110/2014 respec tively. 

4       The Bills arose from disc iplinary proc eedings against Dr Lim. She was c harged and found guilty on 94 c harges of professional misc onduc t in respec t of one and the same patient. The first 83 c harges were for allegedly invoic ing the patient medic al fees that were far in exc ess of and disproportionate to the servic es rendered by Dr Lim and her medic al team. The remaining 11 c harges were for allegedly invoic ing the patient medic al fees that were far in exc ess of and disproportionate to the servic es rendered as well as falsely representing that suc h fees had been invoic ed by and/or would be payable to c ertain named doc tors, when Dr Lim knew or ought to have known that suc h representation was not true bec ause she had added a signific ant and undisc losed markup to the ac tual fees c harged by those doc tors. 

5       Although the disc iplinary proc eedings against Dr Lim are not the same as the usual c ivil or c riminal proc eedings in the High Court, it is c ommon ground that in taxing the c osts of a party to suc h proc eedings, the c ourt will have regard to all the relevant c irc umstanc es and, in partic ular, to the fac tors stipulated in O 59 Appendix 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (see _Shorvon Simon v Singapore Medical Council_ <span class="citation">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 182</span> (“ _Shorvon_ ”) at [19]). The fac tors stipulated in Appendix 1 of O 59, some of whic h overlap, are: 

 ( a ) the c omplexity of the item or of the c ause or matter in whic h it arises and the diffic ulty or novelty of the questions involved; 

 ( b ) the skill, spec ialised knowledge and responsibility required of, and the time and labour expended by, the solic itor; 

 ( c ) the number and importanc e of the doc uments (however brief) prepared or perused; 

 ( d ) the plac e and c irc umstanc es in whic h the business involved is transac ted; 

 ( e ) the urgenc y and importanc e of the c ause or matter to the c lient; and 

 ( f ) where money or property is involved, its amount or value. 


6       It was also c ommon ground that the c harges raised issues of importanc e to both the SMC and to Dr Lim espec ially in the light of the quantum involved and the extent of the alleged overc harging. Dr Lim had c harged the patient an aggregate total of $24m. She subsequently offered to withdraw c ertain invoic es or disc ount her fees so that the aggregate would be reduc ed to about $12.6m. Even then, the Court of Three Judges agreed that the $12.6m figure would still be several times more than what she ought to have c harged the patient. 

7       WongPartnership (“WP”) ac t for SMC. WP submitted that there were fundamentally important issues whic h were raised in the disc iplinary proc eedings. As the Court of Three Judges said in _Lim Mey Lee Susan v Singapore Medical Council_ <span class="citation">[2013] 3 SLR 900</span> (“ _Susan Lim_ ”) at [1] and [2]: 

 1 ... [T]his appeal raises several related issues of fundamental importanc e. In partic ular, is there an ethical obligation on the part of all doc tors who prac tise medic ine in Singapore to c harge a fair and reasonable fee for their servic es? If so, is suc h an obligation an inherent one, or must it first be embodied within published legislation or rules before it c an be enforc ed? If suc h an ethic al obligation exists, is it inoperative in the face of a binding contract between a doctor and his or her patient (assuming that the c ontrac t in question is not otherwise rendered invalid under the general princ iples of contract law )? These questions raise, in turn, an even more fundamental question – what does it mean to be a professional? More spec ific ally, is a professional bound by ethical obligations whic h trump his or her commercial obligations and interests? If so, should a distinc tion be drawn between lawyers on the one hand and doc tors on the other, given that for lawyers, the answer to the lastmentioned question is in the affirmative, whilst c ounsel for the Appellant has argued that the c ontrary should obtain for his c lient instead? 

 2 There are also numerous important issues of application as well. ... 

 [emphasis in original] 

8       For Dr Lim, a finding that she had overc harged the patient was likely to attrac t a severe sanc tion suc h as suspension from prac tic e or something else more severe in the light of the huge aggregate sum involved and the allegations of the extent of overc harging. Her professional reputation was very muc h at stake too. 

9       As for c omplexity, the AR noted WP’s argument that the c harges nec essitated an understanding of the tec hnic al medic al servic es provided. The AR also noted that Rajah & Tann 

(“R&T”) who ac t for Dr Lim, did not really c hallenge the c omplexity of the matter. [note: 1] Indeed, as WP pointed out, the written submissions for Dr Lim to the Court of Three Judges stated: 

 “This is a c ase that involves very c omplex and novel issues of law. It involves very c omplex and intric ate fac ts almost none of whic h have been analysed or presented in c omprehensible form ...” 

10     Even so, the AR was of the view that the fac tual c omplexity of Dr Lim’s matter was not of the level as that in _Pang Ah San v Singapore Medical Council_ <span class="citation">[2014] 1 SLR 1094</span> (“ _Pang Ah San_ ”) or that in 

_Shorvon_. [note: 2] 

11     The AR observed that in _Pang Ah San_ , it was nec essary to examine the medic al proc edure performed bec ause one of the key issues of fac t was whether the loopperc utaneous endosc opic gastronomy proc edure performed was generally ac c epted by the medic al profession. 

12     The AR also observed that in _Shorvon_ , “a thorough understanding of sc ientific and medic al prac tic es, methodologies, ethic s ...” was required as was observed by the Court of Appeal in that 


c ase. Also several of the c harges in _Shorvon_ involved an examination of whether the doc tor there had failed to safeguard the best interests and health of patients afflic ted with Parkinson’s disease by exposing them to unnec essary risks. 

13     It was therefore no surprise that R&T seized on the AR’s observations to argue that Dr Lim’s c ase was not as c omplex as c laimed by WP. 

14     I am of the view that while the disputes in Dr Lim’s c ase did not involve a c onsideration of a medic al proc edure as in _Pang Ah San_ , Dr Lim was fac ing 94 c harges whereas in _Pang Ah San_ , the doc tor was fac ing one main c harge. While it is true that the 94 c harges were grouped into two main c ategories, there were a further six subc ategories. The SMC, as the prosec ution, had the burden of establishing eac h and every c harge even though there would be some overlap for similar servic es. Indeed, the Court of Three Judges noted that SMC had in fac t plac ed a detailed rendition of eac h c harge before the DC (see _Susan Lim_ at [77]) and the Court of Three Judges themselves also sc rutinised all the 94 c harges. Dr Lim did not c onc ede the fac t or extent of overc harging and it was only late in the day, as I shall elaborate later, that she said that she was not going to c all any evidenc e on her behalf. 

15     Furthermore, doc uments totalling 12,531 pages were involved for the proc eedings at the inquiry stage before the two disc iplinary c ommittees. While there was overlap of doc uments between the SMC and Dr Lim, this c ase was obviously doc ument intensive. 

16     As for _Shorvon_ , there were a number of c harges but not c lose to 94 and while some fac tual issues there were c omplic ated, that c ase was not as doc ument intensive as Dr Lim’s c ase. It seems to me that, bearing in mind the legal and fac tual issues, Dr Lim’s c ase was more c omplex that Dr Shorvon’s. Furthermore, Dr Shorvon did not appear or have anyone represent him to c ontest the SMC’s c ase unlike Dr Lim whose solic itors vigorously c ontested the c harges. 

17     Therefore, it was no wonder and it is worth reiterating that the submissions for Dr Lim to the Court of Three Judges stated that the c ase involved “very c omplex and novel issues of law” and involved “very c omplex and intric ate fac ts”. 

18     SMC and Dr Lim were eac h represented by senior c ounsel and eac h senior c ounsel had a team of solic itors to assist him. While R&T stressed that SMC did not obtain a c ertific ate for two or more c ounsel, the c omplexity of the matter was still a matter to be c onsidered. 

19     For the rest of my judgment, I will first c onsider the work done for the inquiry before the disc iplinary c ommittees and then the work done for the appeal to the Court of Three Judges. 

**B/C 111/** 

**_Section 1_** 

20     The number of hearing days is a guide for the c ourt but it is only a rough guide. There were two disc iplinary c ommittees as the first one dec ided to rec use itself after the c lose of the prosec ution’s c ase in the light of an objec tion raised by Dr Lim whic h I need not elaborate on here. I will refer to the two disc iplinary c ommittees as “the First DC” and “the Sec ond DC” respec tively. 

21     WP alleged that there was a total of 13.5 days of hearing before the First DC and the Sec ond DC. R&T initially suggested that the total was 8.5 days if one were to adopt the method of c ounting hearing days whic h the SMC had used in _Pang Ah San_ but, eventually, R&T proc eeded on the basis of 


 Before the First DC

 Melanie Ho $290, 

13     days. R&T said they used 13 days as they exc luded a half day when the First DC rec used itself. I am of the view that that half day should be inc luded as a start. Whether Dr Lim is liable to pay for that half day is a separate matter. 

22     After the c lose of the prosec ution’s c ase, Dr Lim made a submission of no c ase to answer. Written submissions were tendered by eac h side. However, on 29 July 2010, after the written submissions had been tendered, the First DC dec ided to rec use itself in the light of an objec tion by Dr Lim. Thereafter, a Sec ond DC was c onstituted on 14 September 2010. However, Dr Lim took up judic ial review (“JR”) proc eedings to c hallenge the legality of the Sec ond DC. Her applic ation was heard and eventually dismissed by a single judge on 26 May 2011. Her appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed on 30 November 2011. 

23     Thereafter, the inquiry before the Sec ond DC was to c ontinue. However, Dr Lim stated, through c orrespondenc e from R&T of 28 February 2012, that she was not going to c all any evidenc e on her own behalf. Had she adduc ed evidenc e, the number of hearing days would have inc reased. In any event, WP had already done their getting up to establish the 94 c harges and presented SMC’s c ase. They had also prepared to c rossexamine Dr Lim’s witnesses until she said she was not c alling any evidenc e. I understand from c ounsel that in the meantime Dr Lim dec ided not to pursue the argument of no c ase to answer, on whic h there was no ruling yet, sinc e she was not going to c all evidenc e in any event. Parties then proc eeded with c losing submissions. 

24     The AR had used the average daily rate of hearings from the taxation of c osts in _Pang Ah San_ and in _Shorvon_ as a guide. WP submitted that there were higher daily rates from other taxation prec edents and said that it was not c lear why the AR had not used those other rates. In my view, this was an unfair c omment. The AR had explained that those other c ases were taxed on the basis of two c ounsel whereas in Dr Lim’s c ase, SMC did not obtain a c ertific ate for two c ounsel. The AR had used the average daily rates in _Pang Ah San_ and _Shorvon_ as a c omparison bec ause in these two c ases, the c osts were taxed on the basis of one c ounsel. 

25     Even then, the number of hearing days is a rough guide only as I have said. To put it another way, it is one of the fac tors to be c onsidered. As already mentioned, Dr Lim’s c ase involved 94 c harges and was doc ument intensive. Muc h of the fac tual getting up would have already been done before the first day of hearing before the First DC. Indeed, WP argued that it had to spend muc h time to present the fac ts in the form of a detailed table although R&T sought to minimise the work done by desc ribing some of the work as a c ut and paste exerc ise using Dr Lim’s own invoic es. I think that that argument was rather unkind as the work was more than just a c ut and paste exerc ise. 

26     Aside from the number of hearing days, another relevant and perhaps more useful fac tor, was the number of hours spent in the getting up and in submissions. 

27     WP alleged that they had spent in all 1900 hours and $1,229,804 in total time c osts for the inquiry before the disc iplinary c ommittees. The 1900 hours was already a reduc ed figure as they had given a disc ount to take into ac c ount the fac t that there was overlap of work when one solic itor took over from another. Thereafter, they reduc ed the aggregate c laim for the c osts of the inquiry to $900,000. The breakdown is as follows: 


 Before the Sec ond DC 

 Alvin Yeo SC $224, 

 Lim Wei Lee $ 96, 

 Total: $900, 

28     R&T argued that the number of hours c laimed by WP was exc essive and should not be allowed for various reasons. 

29     First, there was muc h overlap in the getting up on the fac ts. Before the hearing before the Sec ond DC c ommenc ed, WP had already reviewed the fac ts twic e more after the First DC had rec used itself. The first time was for the JR proc eedings before the single judge and the sec ond time was for the JR proc eedings before the Court of Appeal. R&T also stressed that WP had c laimed to do extensive work for both JR proc eedings when taxing the bills of c osts for the same. These bills had been taxed before the two bills of c osts for the disc iplinary proc eedings ( _ie_ , before the disc iplinary c ommittees and the Court of Three Judges) were taxed. Sinc e SMC had already been granted quite substantial c osts in the taxation of c osts for the JR proc eedings, this should be taken into ac c ount for the taxation of c osts for the disc iplinary proc eedings. Yet, signific antly, R&T did not allege that there had been double c ounting. For example, R&T did not allege that the number of hours whic h WP had said they had spent on the inquiry proc eedings before the disc iplinary c ommittees inc luded work done for either of the JR proc eedings. Their point was that, given the familiarity with the fac ts, WP should not have had to inc ur so many hours for the inquiry proc eedings. 

30     Sec ondly, R&T argued that while they ac c epted that WP would still have to do some refresher work for the proc eedings before the Sec ond DC, Dr Lim should not be liable for suc h refresher c osts whic h were inc urred through no fault of hers. They estimated suc h refresher c osts to be 20% of the total c osts for the inquiry. I will c ome bac k to the refresher c osts later. 

31     Thirdly, R&T stressed that SMC was entitled to c laim for c osts of one c ounsel alone as SMC did not obtain a c ertific ate for c osts of two or more c ounsel. There were six solic itors on WP’s team, two of whom were replac ed by another two solic itors whic h in turn resulted in unnec essary c osts being inc urred as replac ement solic itors would go over some of the same ground already done by those they were replac ing. Furthermore, there was inadequate breakdown of the work done by the solic itors. 

32     R&T argued that by inc luding both Mr Alvin Yeo, SC (“Mr Yeo”) and another solic itor in the c laim for c osts as set out above at [27], WP was trying to c irc umvent the fac t that SMC was entitled to c laim c osts for one c ounsel/solic itor only. They suggested that only the time c osts (and hourly rate) of Mr Yeo should be allowed. 

33     Ac c ording to the AR, SMC had submitted before her that it was only c laiming for the c osts of one c ounsel. At eac h point in time of the inquiry, the c osts being c laimed were with respec t to a single c ounsel. WP had submitted that before the First DC, Mr Yeo had handled the opening statement and the preliminary arguments while Ms Melanie Ho (“Ms Ho”) had led evidenc e for the prosec ution; and before the Sec ond DC, Mr Yeo prepared for c rossexamination of Dr Lim’s witnesses and presented the written submissions while Ms Lim Wei Lee drafted the submissions for the Sec ond 


## DC. 

34     The AR did not ac c ept this argument for various reasons. First, suc h a breakdown was absent from the relevant bill of c osts. Sec ondly, different hourly rates apply to different c ounsel. In the AR’s view, SMC’s approac h had the insidious effec t of making redundant the sec uring of a c ertific ate for more than one c ounsel. 

35     However, it was not disputed that even though SMC was entitled to c laim c osts for one c ounsel alone, this did not mean that one c ounsel must do all the work himself. For example, if another solic itor and not Mr Yeo, had spent time to prepare the table whic h I referred to above at [25], then the number of hours he put in and his hourly rate should be taken into ac c ount. The fac t that his hourly rate is different does not prec lude the c laim from being made but it means that WP has to be more c areful and give a more detailed breakdown. While WP did stipulate the number of hours spent by eac h solic itor and the hourly rates of eac h, WP did not spec ify how eac h solic itor had spent his or her time, for example, how muc h time was spent on preparing the table or doing researc h on a point of law. While it is true that it is not prac tic al to go into every detail, there must be enough breakdown so that one c an better gauge whether there was overlapping work and the extent of the overlap espec ially sinc e the amount c laimed for Sec tion 1 was a huge sum of $900,000. For example, it did not help for WP to submit that Mr Yeo had handled the opening statement and the preliminary arguments while Ms Ho had led evidenc e for the prosec ution before the First DC. Both of these solic itors would have had to read and study the c harges and the fac ts although to different degrees. They would c over the same ground to some extent and the question was how muc h the overlap was. The same point applies in princ iple to the other solic itors in the team. 

36     Fourthly, R&T submitted that WP had c laimed to have spent even more hours for the JR proc eedings before a single judge and was allowed only $230,000 for Sec tion 1 for the relevant bill of c osts. Applying that amount to the number of hours allegedly spent then, R&T submitted that even the $180,000 allowed by the AR was generous. However, R&T’s argument assumed that the $230, whic h was allowed was for the entire number of hours c laimed for the JR proc eedings before a single judge. If the entire number of hours c laimed was allowed, the amount allowed for taxation would have been muc h more. The fac t that “only” $230,000 was allowed means that the c ourt did not ac c ept that the JR issues required so many hours to be put in even if that many hours were in fac t spent. 

37     While the JR proc eedings before the single judge involved diffic ult legal issues as well as an understanding of the fac ts and the numerous c harges, I am of the view that most of the fac tual getting up was done before the inquiry proc eedings first started. 

38     Furthermore for all R&T’s attempts to downplay the c omplexity of the c ase and the appropriate amount of time spent, R&T c hose not to say how many hours they themselves (or any other relevant firm of solic itors) had spent for the inquiry. In my view, for all the c omparison that one may make with other c ases, the best c omparison is, _prima facie_ , what one’s opponent had said or done for the same c ase. For example, if R&T had submitted before the disc iplinary c ommittees or the Court of Three Judges that there were c omplex issues of fac t, then it was diffic ult for R&T to argue otherwise when it c ame to taxation. Again, if R&T had spent, say, 1700 hours for the inquiry as c ompared with WP’s c laim for 1900 hours, then again it would be diffic ult for R&T to argue that 1900 hours was c learly exc essive and to suggest a muc h lower figure. 

39     R&T said they were not in a position to say how many hours they had spent. I do not think that this meant that they had not kept time sheets or a rec ord of hours spent and by whom. What R&T meant was that they would prefer not to elaborate. Ac c ordingly, they undermined the strength of their arguments. 


40     I note that the sec ond legal assessor (“the Sec ond LA”) had sent an invoic e for $235,200 on the basis that he had spent 224 hours at $1,050 per hour. R&T did not dispute the amount of time spent by the Sec ond LA. Instead, R&T’s position was that the Sec ond LA had done more work than he should have done bearing in mind the sc ope of his duty as a legal assessor. I will address that submission later. For the time being, the fac t that the Sec ond LA had spent 224 hours was itself also an indic ation that the c harges raised c omplex issues and the inquiry was doc ument intensive. Furthermore, even if the Sec ond LA had done more work than he should have, there was no suggestion that he did more work than WP for the inquiry. Ac c ordingly, his fee of $235,200 suggested that the $180,000 allowed by the AR for the inquiry was too low. 

41     I am mindful that the first legal assessor (“the First LA”) had sent an invoic e for $52,644 but he did not elaborate on his hourly rate or how many hours he had spent. It was also not c lear whether he was c harging only for his attendanc e at the inquiry and in internal disc ussions with members of the First DC or he had inc luded time spent to peruse doc uments. 

42     Nevertheless, it was still for WP to establish its c laim for $900,000. 

43     In my view, notwithstanding that there were diffic ult and c omplex legal and fac tual issues and the various fac tors I have set out above, I am of the view that there is substantial overlapping of work. Again, I must emphasise that SMC is entitled to c laim c osts for one c ounsel only in so far as the inquiry itself is c onc erned. 

44     In all the c irc umstanc es, I am of the view that an appropriate amount for Sec tion 1 for the inquiry (before the First and Sec ond DC) is $400,000 if there is no refresher c osts. 

45     As for refresher c osts, R&T had submitted before the AR and the AR had ac c epted that Dr Lim should not be liable for refresher c osts as the rec usal of the First DC was through no fault of Dr Lim. However, I am of the view that that is not the point. The starting point is what order of c osts was made by the Sec ond DC. Its c osts order was as follows: 

 That the [Respondent] pay to the [Applic ant] the c osts and expenses of and inc idental to these disc iplinary proc eedings, inc luding the (First DC), suc h c osts to inc lude the fees, disbursements and other expenses of c ounsel for the [Applic ant] and the fees, disbursements and other expenses of the legal assessor appointed to this DC, pursuant to sec tion 45(4) read with sec tion 45(7) of the Ac t. 

46     If this order meant that Dr Lim was liable for all c osts of the inquiry proc eedings, then it was too late for Dr Lim to argue that she should not be liable for refresher c osts or any other fees or c osts assoc iated with the rec usal of the First DC. Likewise, if the order meant that she was not liable, then it did not matter whether she ought to be liable. 

47     It is true that the order did not explic itly say that Dr Lim was liable for refresher c osts. However, that did not nec essarily mean that the order exc luded suc h c osts. R&T must have realised this and that is why their argument was not that that order had exc luded suc h c osts but that Dr Lim should not be liable for suc h c osts. Implic it in that argument is an ac knowledgement that the order did inc lude suc h c osts but that Dr Lim should not have been made liable for the same. 

48     In any event, I am of the view that the order means that Dr Lim is liable for all c osts of the inquiry before the First DC and the Sec ond DC. This inc ludes refresher c osts as well as the half day during whic h the First DC rec used itself. While there may be some merit in the argument that Dr Lim should not have been made liable for refresher c osts, I am afraid that it is too late for her to say so 


now. Dr Lim should have made the point to the Sec ond DC after the Sec ond DC had made the c osts order. If there was any ambiguity, she should have sought a c larific ation. She took neither of these steps. Furthermore, the c osts order was part of Dr Lim’s overall appeal to the Court of Three Judges. Yet no arguments were made for her in that forum in respec t of the c osts order. R&T suggested to me that that was bec ause the c osts order would follow the outc ome of the appeal but that was not nec essarily the c ase sinc e it is her own c ase that, whatever the substantive outc ome, she should not be liable for refresher c osts. 

49     Just as SMC is c onstrained by the fac t that there is no c ertific ate for c osts of two or more c ounsel for the inquiry proc eedings, Dr Lim is also c onstrained by the c osts order. 

50     In the c irc umstanc es, Dr Lim is liable for refresher c osts. Bearing in mind the number of oc c asions whic h WP had to go through the fac ts although not nec essarily to the same extent eac h time, I am of the view that $20,000 is a fair sum for refresher c osts for one c ounsel. 

51     Therefore, for Sec tion 1 of B/C 111 of 2014, I allow $400,000 + $20,000 = $420,000, exc luding GST. 

**_Section 3_** 

52     I will next deal with some disputed items under Sec tion 3 before I c ome bac k to Sec tion 2. 

53     WP had initially wanted a review on the c ost of eac h ring binder but this was eventually not pursued. Four other items under Sec tion 3 remained in dispute. 

54     The first two c onc erned the fees of the legal assessors and the next two c onc erned the fees of two medic al experts. 

55     Before I c ontinue, I should mention that before the AR, WP submitted that the assessors’ fees are not subjec t to taxation and that therefore the SMC was entitled to c laim full reimbursement of the 

assessors’ fees. [note: 3] WP also referred to s 61(3) of the Medic al Registration Ac t (Cap 174, 2014 Rev Ed) (“MRA”) and observed that there is no qualific ation that the assessors’ fees have to be reasonable. However, WP did also try to persuade the AR that the fees of the assessors were in any event reasonable. 

56     Sec tion 61(3) MRA states: 

 The Medic al Counc il may pay to persons appointed to ac t as assessors suc h remuneration, to be paid as part of the expenses of the Medic al Counc il, as the Medic al Counc il may determine. 

57     The AR was of the view that the c riterion of reasonableness must apply to the taxation of fees of legal assessors as it applies to the taxation of expert’s fees. Just bec ause suc h fees are inc urred 

as disbursements, it does not mean that the requirement of reasonableness has no applic ation. [note: 4] I agree. While it is for the SMC to pay suc h remuneration to a legal assessor as it may determine, 

this does not mean that the doc tor in question has to reimburse the SMC in full. Otherwise, it will be tantamount to giving the SMC or the legal assessor a blank c heque. 

58     In the applic ation for review before me, WP no longer took the position that SMC did not have to establish that the quantum c laimed by eac h legal assessor is reasonable. Ac c ordingly, WP sought to persuade me that the fees of both legal assessors were reasonable. 


59     The First LA was Mr Giam Chin Toon, SC. He c harged $49,200. The AR awarded $45,000 after c onsidering the fees of legal assessors c laimed in other c ases. 

60     R&T submitted that SMC should not be allowed to c laim against Dr Lim for the time spent by the First LA outside of the statutory sc ope of work for a legal assessor. SMC c ould only c laim for his time in attending hearings and not for disc ussion with members of the First DC. 

61     As it was, the invoic e of the First LA was unfortunately short on elaboration. It c ontained two lines stating that it was for professional servic es rendered by him as legal assessor to the DC on c ertain spec ified dates whic h was the only elaboration given. 

62     WP had sought to explain how the First LA had spent his time but R&T pointed out that their explanations were not c onsistent. In any event, R&T’s point was that not all the time of the First LA was spent at hearings. Some were allegedly spent on disc ussions with members of the First DC. Henc e, R&T’s submission was that SMC c ould not c laim for the time of the First LA in attending disc ussions with members of the First DC. This was said to be outside the statutory sc ope of a legal assessor. R&T submitted that suc h meetings c ould not have been for the legitimate purpose of advising the First DC on questions of law arising from the inquiry. If suc h advic e had been given, Dr Lim would have been informed as required under the Medic al Registration Regulations (Cap 174, Rg 1, 2000 Rev Ed). 

63     I am of the view that R&T’s submission was based on a very restric tive view of the sc ope of a legal assessor’s duty. It is true that a legal assessor under those regulations had c ertain spec ific duties, that is: 

 (a) to advise a DC only on questions of law arising from the disc iplinary proc eedings; and 

 (b) to inform the DC of any irregularity in the c onduc t of suc h proc eedings and advise them of his own motion where it appears that, but for suc h advic e, there is a possibility of a mistake of law being made. 

However, I am of the view that the above does not mean that the legal assessor is to attend only the formal hearings and not any internal meetings with the DC. 

64     I do not think it is in the interest of any medic al prac titioner who is fac ing disc iplinary proc eedings or the SMC or the public to try and straitjac ket the role of a legal assessor although there may be arguments that it is for the DC and not the legal assessor to make the dec ision. I am of the view that the sc heme under the regulations does not prohibit the legal assessor from attending internal meetings of a DC to ensure that the DC does not run afoul of any substantive, proc edural or evidentiary law (see also _Medical Council of Hong Kong v Helen Chan_ [2010] HKCU 1041 (“ _Helen Chan_ ”) at [33]). I also understand that new regulations have been made and they c ome into operation on 1 Dec ember 2010. Suc h regulations suggest that a legal assessor may attend internal meetings as he may be present during deliberations of a Disc iplinary Tribunal. I would add that under the new regulations, the relevant body is desc ribed as a “Disc iplinary Tribunal” and not a “Disc iplinary Committee” although Reg 67 (whic h spec ifies the duties of a legal assessor) refers to a Disc iplinary Tribunal along with other bodies therein as “the Committee” for c onvenienc e. 

65     R&T’s sec ond reason to objec t to the quantum of fees of the First LA was that no hearings took plac e on 4, 5 and 8 February 2010 whic h were three dates mentioned in the invoic e of the First LA. However, this did not mean that the First LA was bac k at his offic e. It appears to be ac c epted that he did go to the venue where the hearings were to take plac e but there was no formal hearing. 


Ac c ordingly, the First LA should be entitled to c laim for his attendanc e there in princ iple. 

66     On the other hand, I agree that it is not c lear how many hours the First LA was c laiming for eac h of the days in question or what his hourly rate was although one c ould infer his hourly rate from a proc ess of deduc tion to be muc h below that of the Sec ond LA whic h I shall c ome to later. 

67     It appears that SMC or WP had simply ac c epted the invoic e of the First LA without requiring an elaboration. This may be understandable if the amount c laimed is easily justifiable based on information known to all parties. Otherwise, elaboration should be sought. Nevertheless, it seems to me that after taking into ac c ount the fac tors mentioned above in the disc ussion of the SMC’s c osts for the inquiry and the sc ope of a legal assessor’s role, the overall fee of the First LA is reasonable. I am of the view that I should not reduc e the amount c laimed by him and I will allow it in full, _ie_ , $49,200. 

68     I now c ome to the fees of the Sec ond LA Mr Vinodh Coomaraswamy, SC. His invoic e was for $235,200 for his fees and $435.40 for his disbursements. His fees were based on 224 hours at an hourly rate of $1,050 per hour. The invoic e c overed a period of about 23 months from 27 August 2010 to 17 July 2012. Unlike the bill from the First LA, the bill from the Sec ond LA did set out the numbers of hours spent and the hourly rate. It also had more elaboration on the work done, _ie_ : 

 (a) attending nine preinquiry c onferenc es; 

 (b) attending five inquiry hearings on 21 to 27 May 2012, 21 June 2012 and 17 July 2012; 

 (c ) attending internal meetings with DC members; and 

 (d) reviewing inquiry submissions. 

69     There was also a general c lause in the bill referring to the perusing and reviewing of doc uments, c orrespondenc e, telephone c alls, c onduc ting researc h and all other inc idental work. 

70     The AR allowed only $22,000 for the fees of the Sec ond LA. Nothing was said about his disbursements whic h may have been overlooked. 

71     The AR noted that the bill of the Sec ond LA was for work done for a period c ommenc ing 27 August 2010 to 17 July 2012. The date of 27 August 2010 was before the date when the Sec ond DC was c onstituted, _ie_ , 14 September 2010. This was a point whic h R&T also made. However, it was not suggested that the date of 27 August 2010 was a false one or was inserted by error. Ac c ording to WP, the Sec ond LA had perhaps been informed of his appointment (and would have started work) before the Sec ond DC was c onstituted. If so, then the work he did would have been done in any event whether before or after the Sec ond DC was c onstituted. I do not think that his fees should be reduc ed bec ause of a tec hnic ality. Having said that, I am of the view that this sc enario should not be repeated. Steps should be taken by the relevant authority to ensure that a legal assessor is not appointed until a DC is appointed. 

72     The AR doubted whether the Sec ond LA had drafted the grounds of dec ision of the Sec ond DC. This was an explanation given by WP on instruc tions when elaborating on the work done by the Sec ond LA. However, the AR noted that his invoic e did not mention that he had drafted the grounds of dec ision. I also doubt if the Sec ond LA had done suc h work for the same reason given by the AR. WP did not say that they had personal knowledge that the Sec ond LA had c arried out suc h work. In the c irc umstanc es, it is not nec essary for me to dec ide whether the drafting of the grounds of 


dec ision is outside the sc ope of work of a legal assessor, a point taken by R&T. In Hong Kong, the position appears to be that suc h work is within the sc ope of work of a legal assessor (see _Helen Chan_ ). In Singapore, new regulations have c larified that a legal assessor may assist to draft the grounds of dec ision but not to partic ipate in or influenc e the dec ision of a DC. 

73     The AR also noted that the Sec ond LA was c harging $1,050 per hour. This appeared high when c ompared with the approximate hourly rate of $570 per hour of the First LA whic h the AR had deduc ed. However, the c omparison did not nec essarily mean that the hourly rate of the Sec ond LA was exc essive. On the c ontrary, it may be that the hourly rate of the First LA was rather low. I am of the view that that was the c ase and it may be that the First LA had given a disc ount for work done as a legal assessor. However, the Sec ond LA was not obliged to give a disc ount and R&T did not suggest that he must. Instead R&T argued that a legal assessor has a limited role and therefore his c harges should not be as if he were ac ting as c ounsel. 

74     I have already stated above that the sc ope of work a legal assessor may undertake even under the relevant regulations (before the c urrent ones) is not as limited as R&T suggests. Nevertheless, I agree that a legal assessor does not have to do as muc h work as c ounsel from either the prosec ution or the defenc e. For example, he does not have to do as muc h getting up on the fac ts or on the law as c ounsel would have to. However, that would already be reflec ted in the number of hours he puts in. It does not mean that the hourly rate of $1,050 is exc essive. 

75     In my view that hourly rate is reasonable given the c omplexities of the c ase whic h I will not repeat. 

76     The next question then is whether the number of hours that the Sec ond LA had spent was reasonable in the c irc umstanc es. The AR was of the view that the Sec ond LA would have spent no more than 32 hours for the nine preinquiry c onferenc es and five hearings for the inquiry proper as stated in the invoic e. This would leave a balanc e of about 180 hours. I believe that sinc e the Sec ond LA had spent 224 hours, the remaining number of hours should be 192 hours (and not 180 hours). The AR noted that it may be that the bulk of his time was spent on internal meetings with the DC but there was no elaboration on the number of meetings and the number of hours spent. She thought that without suc h information, it would be diffic ult to say whether any of those internal meetings may 

properly be treated as part of the sc ope of his work. [note: 5] 

77     With respec t, I do not see how the number of meetings or the number of hours spent in eac h meeting will assist the c ourt to determine whether the meetings were within the sc ope of the Sec ond LA’s work. It seems to me that the question is whether he is allowed to attend internal meetings or not. I have already said above that a legal assessor may attend internal meetings of the DC even before the new regulations were made. 

78     Furthermore, I am of the view that the 192 hours were probably not spent only on internal meetings but also on reviewing doc uments suc h as the transc ripts of proc eedings before the First DC and the various submissions. This is within the sc ope of a work of a legal assessor. 

79     This brings me to the next point whic h arises from the rec usal of the First DC. 

80     The AR was of the view that bec ause the need for the Sec ond LA arose from the rec usal of the First DC, Dr Lim should not be made to bear the full brunt of the rec usal by paying for all 224 hours of 

the Sec ond LA at $1,050 per hour. [note: 6] 

81     This observation raises two subpoints. First, that it was not fair for Dr Lim to have to pay the 


fees of a legal assessor based on a rate higher than the rate of the First LA. The AR’s reasoning was that if the First DC had not rec used itself, the First LA would have c ontinued. That may well be the c ase but one did not know then whether the Sec ond LA’s hourly rate would be higher or lower or the same as that of the First LA. What if his hourly rate was lower? Should Dr Lim not have the benefit of the lower hourly rate? The answer is obvious. Whoever has to pay has to take the risk of the hourly rate being higher. 

82     The sec ond subpoint is that the Sec ond LA’s work would overlap with work already done by the First LA. For example, he would have to review doc uments whic h the First LA had already done. Even his review of the transc ripts of proc eedings before the First DC would be without the benefit of his personal attendanc e at the hearings for whic h the First LA would have c harged. However, here again, the question is not whether Dr Lim should be liable for the overlap. As disc ussed above, under the relevant c osts order, she is liable for all c osts assoc iated with the rec usal of the First DC. 

83     Finally, the question is whether the $235,200 is a reasonable sum inc urred by the Sec ond LA. I agree that it appears exc essive when c ompared with the fees of other legal assessors in past c ases but that is not the point. As I have said, I do not think his hourly rate of $1,050 per hour is unreasonable in view of the c omplexities in the c ase. This brings us to the number of hours he spent on internal meetings and reviewing doc uments. I have already mentioned the c omplexities and the doc ument intensive nature of the dispute. In addition, the Sec ond LA would have been aware of the rec usal of the First DC. He (and the Sec ond DC) would have had to be extra c areful to ensure that the Sec ond DC did not trip up over any point. 

84     In the c irc umstanc es, I am of the view that the 224 hours is reasonable and I allow his fees of $235,200. As there was no dispute on his disbursements, I will allow them at $435.40. 

85     I now c ome to the fees of the two medic al experts. The first expert was Dr Tan Yew Oo (“Dr Tan”). His fees were $12,145. The AR allowed $9,000. 

86     Dr Tan gave some breakdown of the work he did, the time spent and his c harges. From the breakdown, one c ould deduc e the hourly rate he was applying. For perusing doc uments and writing his expert report and attending disc ussions with c ounsel, he c harged $6,500 for 13 hours, _ie_ , $500 per hour. For appearing at a hearing whic h was c anc elled, he c harged $1,000 for two hours, _ie_ , $500 per hour. For waiting time, he c harged $400 for two hours, _ie_ , $200 per hour. For being questioned while on the witness stand, he c harged $4,200 for six hours, _ie_ , $700 per hour. 

87     R&T submitted that Dr Tan’s own c harges for an extended medic al c onsultation was $240$ per hour if c alc ulated on his published c harges of $60$80 for eac h bloc k of 15 minutes of c onsultation. Dr Tan’s c harge for writing a spec ialised medic al report was $200$500 per report. Therefore, as Dr Tan was engaged in rendering a subjec tive opinion on what he would bill for c ertain medic al servic es, his work was nonmedic al. Therefore his hourly rate should be less than what he would c harge for medic al work. R&T submitted that Dr Tan’s nonmedic al role was relevant to what he was entitled to c harge, c iting the judgment of the Court of Three Judges for the appeal by Dr Lim at [82] and [104]. 

88     The AR noted that Dr Tan was not c harging for his servic es as a medic al spec ialist but she did not say that this nec essarily meant that he must c harge an hourly rate less than his published rates for c onsultation or writing a report. Based on taxing prec edents whic h I will c ome bac k to, she reduc ed Dr Tan’s fees. 

89     I am of the view that while Dr Tan was not exerc ising his spec ialist skills, this does not 


nec essarily mean that he must c harge less than his fees for c onsultation or for writing a spec ialist report. Reading doc uments and writing a report for litigation is no easy task. Dr Tan would have been outside his usual range of work and would realise the importanc e of the litigation. The responsibility he was undertaking was important. The effort he would have had to put in would be more than for his usual range of work. In the c irc umstanc es, $500 per hour seems reasonable to me. In fac t he even c harged only $200 per hour for waiting time. As for his c harge of $700 per hour while being on the witness stand, the time spent then would be the most intensive for him whether he was being questioned on a medic al proc edure or billing amounts. In my view a c harge of $700 per hour seemed reasonable too. 

90     What then of the taxing prec edents? I will c ome to three prec edents whic h the AR referred to. 

91     The first was the c ase c onc erning Dr Eric Gan Keng Seng. The dispute in that c ase involved a proc edure used to remove a stone in the c ommon bile duc t. The prosec ution’s expert’s fees were allowed at $8,050 (on a 70% basis). However, based on WP’s table at Annex D of WP’s submissions, it seems that that expert c laimed $11,500 in all. This c omprised $500 for one hour’s work for preparing a report and $11,000 for attendanc e at an inquiry totalling 22 hours. The latter also worked out to $ per hour with no differentiation between waiting time and time on the witness stand. I am of the view that this prec edent did not suggest that Dr Tan’s hourly rates were exc essive unless a distinc tion was to be drawn between the spec ialist evidenc e that was being given in that c ase and the evidenc e whic h Dr Tan was giving about reasonable amounts for billing of c ertain servic es. For reasons mentioned above, I do not draw suc h a distinc tion. The work done in either c ase would be for litigation. One might even argue that giving evidenc e on a familiar area or topic is less diffic ult than on a less familiar topic. 

92     The sec ond prec edent was the c ase c onc erning A/Prof Eu Kong Weng where the dispute arose out of a proc edure performed on a patient without informing him of other alternatives and explaining the risks of possible c omplic ations to him. The sum c laimed was $23,500 as a lump sum and 70% of that sum was allowed at $16,450. No hourly rate was given. 

93     The third prec edent was the c ase c onc erning Dr Wong Yoke Meng. There the dispute was over the applic ation of c ertain proc edures whic h were not medic ally proven and outside the respondent’s registered spec iality. The total sum c laimed by the medic al experts was $7,900 but there were no details of the hourly rates. 

94     It seemed to me that the sec ond and third prec edents were not helpful without the hourly rates although the AR relied on the three prec edents and drew a distinc tion between evidenc e on medic al proc edures or servic es, on the one hand, and evidenc e on the reasonableness of fees on the other hand, with the former being more “valuable” evidenc e than the latter. As mentioned above, I do not think that suc h a distinc tion should be drawn. 

95     However, R&T relied on another taxing prec edent. They submitted that in Dr Pang Ah San’s c ase, the expert’s fee was $7,000 (it was ac tually $6,542 if GST is not yet taken into ac c ount as in the other prec edents) and his report was 12 pages long with seven piec es of medic al literature annexed. It was an extremely c omplex and tec hnic al c ase and his report was relied on heavily by the DC. I note that the report there was seven pages long with an eighth page c ontaining diagrams exc luding the medic al literature. Dr Tan’s report was slightly over 11 pages. While the issue of the reasonableness of Dr Lim’s bills was not medic ally c hallenging, it was still fac tually intensive and c omplex. As Dr Tan said at para 16 of his report, “I spent a lot of time trying to understand the multiple invoic es submitted by Dr Lim and her related c ompanies for the various servic es provided. I find it extremely c hallenging to understand the invoic es and I like to highlight several instanc es of 


 (a) Expert evidenc e on 8 April 2010 $14, 

 (b) Standby for trial 4 February 2010 $6, 

 (c ) Trial preparation : 18 Marc h 2009 to 3 February 2010 for pretrial disc ussion with WP 

## $14, 

 (d) Preparation of trial report $6, 

“unusual c harges” by Dr Lim whic h appear to be inordinately high and disproportionate to the servic es provided.” Dr Tan then proc eeded to list out these unusual c harges. Furthermore, I do not know how muc h overall time the expert in Dr Pang Ah San’s c ase had spent. 

96     In the c irc umstanc es, I c onsider the hourly rates of Dr Tan to be reasonable and the 23 hours he spent (inc luding two hours of waiting time) to be reasonable. I allow his fees of $12,145. 

97     I now c ome to the fees of Dr Hong Ga Sze (“Dr Hong”) who was also a medic al expert giving evidenc e on the reasonableness of Dr Lim’s fees. He c laimed $40,000 as his fees. His tax invoic e gave the following breakdown without stating the number of hours he had spent: 

The AR allowed $5,000 for Dr Hong’s fees. 

98     Without the number of hours whic h Dr Hong had c laimed to have spent, it was diffic ult to say whether his fees were reasonable or not. Nevertheless, I c onsidered his report. It was four pages long and was less detailed than Dr Tan’s. However, WP said that Dr Hong spent five to seven hours to prepare his report based on a c rossexamination of Dr Hong. Perhaps this inc luded time to peruse doc uments for whic h Dr Tan spent six hours. It seemed to me that he had spent less time than Dr Tan to prepare his report and yet he was c laiming $6,000 to prepare his report c ompared with Dr Tan’s $1,000 for his own report. 

99     Sec ondly, R&T submitted that Dr Hong’s oral testimony was just under five hours whereas Dr Tan’s was just over six hours. Dr Tan was more senior than Dr Hong in terms of number of years after graduation and had more years in c linic al experienc e than Dr Hong. 

100    WP submitted that perhaps the reason for the apparent disc repanc y between Dr Tan’s c harges and Dr Hong’s was that Dr Tan was c harging a lower rate out of goodwill. WP submitted that the expert in A/Prof Eu Kong Weng c harged a lump sum of $23,500 as c ompared with Dr Hong’s $34, and the former c ase was shorter in duration and involved less doc uments. I should mention that Dr Hong’s total c harges, exc luding GST, was $40,000 and not $34,000 as WP had said. 

101    It seems to me that the best c omparison is the fee c harged by Dr Tan. Where Dr Tan’s fee for the inquiry was based on a rate of $500 or more per hour, suc h a rate would already be higher than his c onsultation rate. Therefore, it was diffic ult to c onc lude that Dr Tan was c harging a lower rate for the inquiry than he was entitled to do. Even if Dr Tan was c harging a lower rate, how muc h higher should Dr Hong be entitled to c harge? Furthermore, Dr Hong did not say how many hours he had spent in total. The only indic ation was from R&T who said that his oral testimony was of a slightly shorter duration than Dr Tan (see [99] above) for whic h he c harged $14,000 c ompared to Dr Tan’s $4, and Dr Tan was already c harging $700 per hour for the time spent on the witness stand. Also, as mentioned above, Dr Tan’s report was more detailed than Dr Hong’s. In the c irc umstanc es, Dr Hong’s invoic e for $40,000 appears exc essive and should be less than Dr Tan’s although the $5,000 allowed by the AR for Dr Hong appears low. I will allow $8,000 for Dr Hong’s fees. 


102    I understand that Dr Hong’s fees are the subjec t of a c omplaint to the SMC. R&T had therefore proposed that Dr Hong’s fees be exc luded from BC 111/2014 but WP did not agree. In the c irc umstanc es, I add that the view I have expressed on his fees is based on the information that I have and is not binding on the tribunal that is c onsidering the c omplaint. 

103    I think SMC or its solic itors should alert legal assessors and medic al experts to provide elaboration in their invoic es of the work done and should provide some guidanc e on what details should be inc luded and the nature of the breakdown. SMC or its solic itors should also be prepared to seek elaboration where nec essary and not assume that invoic es of assessors or experts will be paid as presented. 

104    For the avoidanc e of doubt, the amounts I have allowed for eac h of the legal assessors and the two medic al experts do not inc lude GST whic h may be inc luded where applic able. 

**_Section 2_** 

105    I will hear c ounsel on Sec tion 2, whic h c onc erns the c osts for the taxation of BC 111/2014, now that they are aware of my dec ision on the disputed items in Sec tions 1 and 3. 

**B/C 110/** 

106    I do not intend to repeat what I have said in respec t of various fac tors whic h I c onsidered for B/C 111/2014. 

107    Unlike the bill of c osts for the appeal to the Court of Appeal in respec t of the JR proc eedings, WP was c laiming for the c osts of two c ounsel for the hearing before the Court of Three Judges in B/C 110/2014. This it was entitled to do. 

108    First, WP stressed that the hearing before the Court of Three Judges lasted five hours in c ontrast to typic al hearings of between 1.5 to three hours. 

109    Sec ondly, at the request of Dr Lim’s c ounsel, the Court had direc ted that SMC’s and Dr Lim’s solic itors file submissions and reply submissions respec tively after the hearing. 

110    Thirdly, WP were direc ted by the Court to provide, within one week, referenc es to any other invoic e whic h Dr Lim had issued c overing the same treatment in respec t of the c harges relating to Dr Lim’s pre2007 invoic es involving servic es of other doc tors. This was done and a table of 232 pages was prepared within the week. 

111    WP stated that 292 hours were spent by seven solic itors. WP c laimed a total of $150, exc luding GST ( _ie_ , $90,000 for work done by Mr Yeo and $60,000 for work done by Ms Ho). Presumably, WP was trying to c laim for work done by a notional two c ounsel. 

112    I have taken into ac c ount the extra work done even after the hearing before the Court of Three Judges. 

113    I will allow WP $100,000 for Sec tion 1. For the avoidanc e of doubt, this sum exc ludes GST.
