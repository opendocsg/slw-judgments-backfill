_Arbitration_ – _Discharge of Arbitrator_ 

8       Oc tober 2013 

**Quentin Loh J:** 

1       The plaintiffs (“Plaintiffs”) have filed a notic e of appeal against my dec ision on 27 Oc tober 2011 whic h gave leave to an arbitrator, Mr Chow Kok Fong, (“Mr Chow”) appointed by this c ourt in Originating Summons No 1200 of 2008 (“OS 1200”), to withdraw from his appointment. The time for the Plaintiffs to file their notic e of appeal against my dec ision has long passed. There is no effec tive defendant to c hallenge the Plaintiffs bec ause the defendant (“Defendant”) stopped attending these proc eedings at an early stage, c iting financ ial c onstraints. 

**The Facts** 

2       OS 1200 is but one in a series of many proc eedings c ommenc ed by the Plaintiffs over the renovation of their property at No. 2 Siglap Valley, Singapore 455810. They entered into a c ontrac t 

on the Singapore Institute of Arc hitec ts Form (Lump Sum, 6th Ed, August 1999) with the Defendant to demolish their one storey house and to c onstruc t a two-storey house with an attic , basement and swimming pool at the end of Dec ember 1999. Disputes arose between the Plaintiffs and the Defendant, and they proc eeded to arbitration in August 2001. The Singapore Institute of Arc hitec ts (“SIA”) nominated an arbitrator, Mr John Ting Kang Chung (“Mr John Ting”), and the ensuing arbitration went through what I c an only desc ribe as a frac tious and stormy c ourse with the Plaintiffs eventually not partic ipating in the hearing. The award that was issued was c hallenged by the Plaintiffs in OS 1807 of 2006 (“OS 1807”). I heard OS 1807 and OS 1231 of 2008 as a c onsolidated originating summons in Dec ember 2009 and issued my judgment on 18 January 2010 (see _Ting Kang Chung John v Teo Hee Lai Building Constructions Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">[2010] 2 SLR 625</span>). For the reasons set out in my judgment, I set aside the arbitral award. 

3       This resulted in the Plaintiffs c ommenc ing OS 1200 for, _inter alia_ , the appointment of another arbitrator bec ause the SIA, whic h had nominated Mr Chow, had allegedly failed to do so within the presc ribed time limits. Further, the Plaintiffs wanted the c ourt to appoint the arbitrator so there would be no future dispute as to the validity of the appointment. It should be noted that I pointed out to the Plaintiffs that they c ould c arry on with the arbitration, whic h would involve arbitration c osts, or proc eed with a c ourt ac tion as they c ould argue the Defendant had abandoned the arbitration agreement. The Plaintiffs were given an opportunity to c onsider their options over the lunc h 


adjournment. They c ame bac k after lunc h and told me they wanted to proc eed with arbitration. I ac c ordingly made, _inter alia_ , the following orders on 1 February 2011: 

 ... Pursuant to the Building Contrac t entered into between the Plaintiffs and the Defendant, and upon the SIA’s failure to appoint an arbitrator within the time limits set out in General Condition 37(1), and pursuant to the Arbitration Ac t (Cap 10, 1985 Rev Ed), Mr Chow Kok Fong is hereby appointed Arbitrator in respec t of the disputes that have arisen between the parties. 

 ... 

 Liberty to apply – if Chow Kok Fong says he c annot for some reason or other be the Arbitrator. 

 (a) I also refused the Plaintiffs’ other applic ations in relation to the provision of sec urity for the arbitration by the Defendant. 

4       Unfortunately, the arbitration before Mr Chow also bec ame stormy for two reasons. First, bec ause of problems in transferring the doc uments from the former arbitrator, Mr John Ting, to Mr Chow. Sec ondly, bec ause the relationship between Mr Chow and the Plaintiffs also deteriorated, and I hasten to add not due to any fault of Mr Chow. 

5       The former problem arose bec ause Mr John Ting had possession of the doc uments filed with him for the first arbitration hearing. This resulted in the Plaintiffs c ommenc ing OS 1179 of 2010 (“OS 1179”) on the 22 November 2010, naming Mr John Ting as the defendant, for the retrieval of these doc uments and drawings. The matter c ame before me on 6 April 2011 and took a c onsiderable time to sort out bec ause of the ac rimonious attitude taken by the parties. To be fair to the Plaintiffs, the doc uments were handed over to Mr Chow in a rather disorganised and inc omplete state with poor indexing, resulting in the doc uments being handed over in batc hes. Also, the audio tapes had gone missing. The Plaintiffs made these c omplaints in their joint skeletal written submission (ASNK:1179/SUM 1333/JWS1) dated 27 Oc tober 2011 at para 30(f): 

 John Ting and his solic itors returned the doc uments to us in suc h [a] jumbled up, haphazard fashion. The doc uments were neither arranged in c hronologic al order nor in any rational or logic al sequenc e or c lassific ation. This is evident from the 67-page index prepared by [the] Defendant’s solic itors to desc ribe the doc uments returned to us. [ refer to our c omments at page 25 to 44 of our affidavit Anwar Siraj ASNK:TKCJ 3 rd : 22.06.11]. However , in sharp contrast John Ting and his solicitors [who] handed over what was purportedly “the contractor’s documents submitted in the arbitration” arranged in chronological order as evident in the 87-page index prepared by them to describe what was handed over. It is amazing how within 3 weeks John Ting and his solicitors, were able to re-arrange, add to the bundle what was not given to us and meticulously edit the description as well as even “editing” the contents of some of the documents. John Ting and his solicitors also appear to have taken great pains to remove any and all documents that would reflect the wrongdoings of himself, as arbitrator or the contractors (the Claimants in the abortive Arbitration) thus making the handover a highly selective presentation of the case for the contractors. Such was the extent of their attempt to influence the new Arbitrator. 

 [emphasis in bold in the original] 

6       There were hearings for OS 1179 in c hambers before me on 4 July 2011, 27 Oc tober 2011, 20 Marc h 2012 and 9 July 2012 to deal with this matter and tax the c osts. Subsequently, there were minor disputes on some of the items taxed whic h I duly dealt with at the 12 August 2013 hearing. 


7       The Plaintiffs c omplained that Mr John Ting transferred not only doc uments whic h were the Defendant’s doc uments submitted in the arbitration, but other doc uments of the Defendant; Mr Chow read those doc uments, whic h the Plaintiffs say he should not have, and therefore he was “c orrupted” by c onsidering all these other doc uments from the Defendant. The Plaintiffs alleged that Mr Chow rec eived some 529 doc uments when he should only have rec eived 129 doc uments (this latter figure was later inc reased to 135 doc uments). It was c ertainly no fault of Mr Chow’s that these doc uments c ame to him. It was the result of the Plaintiffs’ applic ation for the handover of doc uments from Mr John Ting to Mr Chow. 

8       The Plaintiffs also alleged that Mr Chow gave direc tions that were somehow unfair or inc orrec t and disagreed with his direc tions on the proc edure for the hearing. Mr Siraj submitted on 27 Oc tober 2011 that: 

 But he has given us proc edural orders, he set the time table. Fine, we have to follow him, not us. His time table gave us 3 weeks, 3 weeks, 3 weeks to write, not just our affidavit verifying list, he also made us to write---then we had to do was to get a witness then bec ause I said, “I did try, doc uments only, arbitration, bec ause everything is historic al. 

9       How the sec ond arbitration before Mr Chow also desc ended into frac tiousness and ac rimony is well doc umented in a letter dated 3 Oc tober 2011 written by Mr Chow to the c ourt setting out his reasons for applying for leave to be disc harged as the appointed arbitrator. It is worth setting out most of this letter as it doc uments the perfec tly normal direc tions issued by Mr Chow in the beginning, how the rec eipt of doc uments from Mr John Ting to Mr Chow bec ame a problem, how the Plaintiffs started to disagree with Mr Chow and his c onduc t of the arbitration, the ensuing unc alled for personal and unwarranted attac ks made by the Plaintiffs against Mr Chow, and the language in whic h the Plaintiffs c ame to express themselves: 

1\. I refer to the Order of Court dated 1 February 2011, wherein the c ourt had appointed me as     Arbitrator in respec t of the dispute that had arisen between the Plaintiffs and Defendants, with liberty to apply. 

2\. Pursuant to the order for liberty to apply, I respec tfully seek a hearing before the     Honourable Justic e Quentin Loh to apply for leave for me to be disc harged as the appointed Arbitrator. 

3\. In view of the remarks made in several letters that were written by the Plaintiffs, I had written to both the Plaintiffs and Defendants on 23 September 2011 to seek their c onsent to my disc harge as the arbitrator. I asked for their reply by 27 September 2011. I did not c onsider that     I should c ontinue as the Arbitrator if I did not enjoy the c onfidenc e of the parties, nor should I have to subjec t myself to remarks and insinuations made against me by the Plaintiffs. 

4\. By letter 27 September 2011, the Plaintiffs wrote to inform me that they “have no objec tion whatsoever” to me applying to the High Court to disc harge myself as the Arbitrator, “save as to c osts”. 

5\. The Defendants, although having been informed of the proc eedings throughout, did not reply. The Defendants in fac t have never partic ipated in the proc eedings, nor c orresponded with me sinc e my appointment. 

6\. The events leading up to my dec ision, and the remarks made by the Plaintiffs are as follows: 


(a) Following my appointment, I c onduc ted a 1st Preliminary Meeting on 18 Marc h 2011 (attended only by the Plaintiffs although the Defendant was also notified) and issued direc tions for the parties to file their respec tive Statement of Case by 29 April 2011 and 

Statement of Defenc e within 6 weeks after servic e of the Statement of Case. The 2nd Preliminary Meeting was sc heduled for 16 June 2011. 

(b) On 26 April 2011, Stamford Law Corporation, solic itors for the previous Arbitrator Mr John Ting, wrote to me and enc losed 5 arc h lever files of doc uments c ontaining doc uments submitted by the Defendants during the earlier arbitration under Mr John Ting. Stamford Law Corporation stated that they had been direc ted to do so by the Honourable Justic e Quentin Loh on 6 April 2011. 

(c ) On 29 April 2011, the Plaintiffs submitted their Statement of Case ac c ordingly. 

(d) On 12 May 2011, the Plaintiffs wrote to ask for leave to inspec t the doc uments that had been forwarded to me by Stamford law Corporation. 

(e) On 13 May 2011, I wrote to the Plaintiffs and ac c eded to their request for inspec tion. In that same letter, I also notified the Defendants that they were entitled to be present during the inspec tion. The inspec tion was fixed for 14 June 2011. 

(f ) On 10 June 2011, with the Defendants having failed to file any Statement of Defenc e, the Plaintiffs wrote to me to seek a doc uments-only arbitration, stating that it would be a “judic ious approac h” for the expeditious resolution of the matter. 

(g) On 16 June 2011, I held a 2nd Preliminary Meeting whic h was attended by the Plaintiffs but not the Defendants. The Plaintiffs withdrew their applic ation for a doc uments-only arbitration after I referred the meeting to matters whic h had to be c onsidered in the event that proc eedings proc eed in the absenc e of one of the parties (pp. 220 and 221 of _Russell on_ 

_Arbitration_ , 22nd Edition, Sweet & Maxwell 2003). I gave direc tions for the exc hange of the list of doc uments, inspec tion and witness statements. I also gave direc tions that parties should c onsider the c ase and address the princ iples of c ausation and proof of damage as set out in the c ases of _Robertson Quay Investments Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2008] 2 SLR 623</span> and _Sunny Yap Boon Keng v Pacific Prince International Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2009] 1 SLR 385</span>. 

(h) On 7 July 2011, the Plaintiffs served their Affidavit Verifying List of Doc uments. 

(i) Only 9 July 2011, the Plaintiffs wrote to me to inform me that they objec t to me having sight of and/or review of and/or referenc e to the doc uments handed over to me by Stamford Law Corporation on 26 April 2011. They further stated that at a spec ial hearing for direc tions before the Honourable Justic e Quentin Loh held on 4 July 2011, the learned Judge had direc ted that the Plaintiffs be allowed time to c omplete their inspec tion of the doc uments that had been handed over to me by Stamford Law Corporation. 

(j) On 14 July 2011, I wrote to the Plaintiffs and Defendants to state that I had not sought the doc uments, but that they had been deposited with me by Stamford Law Corporation following the direc tion of the Honourable Judge. My inspec tion of them was also just to ensure that the doc uments rec eived into my c ustody ac c ords with the list of doc uments provided by Stamford Law Corporation. I had already afforded all parties on opportunity to inspec t the doc uments on 16 June 2011, and the Plaintiffs did take up the 


opportunity to inspec t the doc uments in my presenc e. In order to address the Plaintiff’s objec tions, I therefore direc ted that both parties were to file written submissions by 29 July 2011, and that the submissions should deal with the issue of the prejudic e that my inspec tion of the doc uments is likely to have on the Plaintiffs’ c ase, and to state the spec ific reliefs that are sought. 

(k) On 28 July 2011, the Plaintiffs wrote to me to state that they were “quite upset and disturbed by the tone and tenor of the Arbitrator’s letter”, and that they were “shoc ked by the requirement to file and exc hange submissions given stric t timelines and spec ify c ontent” (sic ). Paragraph 13 of their letter was entitled “The Tribunal and Only the Tribunal Knows”, and they stated that “(a) the Tribunal and only the Tribunal knows the extent to whic h the doc uments in his c ustody have been ‘c hec ked’ or inspec ted (b) The Tribunal and only the Tribunal knows the extent to whic h the c hec king of the c ontents c over some or part of the c ontent (c ) The Tribunal and only the Tribunal knows the extent, if any, the c ontent of the doc uments partic ularly letters from John Ting and/or direc tions from John Ting c an and will affec t his determination in the arbitration. 

(l) On 1 August 2011, I wrote to the parties to rec ord that sinc e neither party had filed submissions, after c onsidering the basis on whic h the notic e of objec tion c ontained in the Plaintiffs’ letter dated 9 July 2011 was lodged, I dismissed the objec tion and direc ted that the Tribunal’s fees of $500 should be borne by the Claimants. 

(m) On 5 August 2011, the Plaintiffs filed their witness statements sworn by 3 witnesses. I did not rec eive any filings from the Defendants. 

(n) On 18 August 2011, I wrote to the parties to c onfirm that the arbitration hearing was 

sc heduled for the 2nd to the 5th of Oc tober 2011. 

(o) On 31 August 2011, the Plaintiffs filed their Opening Statement in 6 volumes. The Defendants did not. 

(p) On 2 September 2011, I wrote to ac knowledge rec eipt of the Opening Statement and to set out the proc edure at the 3-day hearing. In the interest of saving time, I direc ted that the Opening Statement would be taken as read, the Claimants would be entitled to introduc e 

evidenc e of their fac tual witnesses on the 1st and 2nd days, and 3rd day would be reserved for me to c larify any further issues with respec t to the Opening Statement and the evidenc e adduc ed. 

(q) On 5 September 2011, the Plaintiffs wrote to request for further inspec tion of the doc uments that had been handed over to me by Stamford Law Corporation previously. 

(r) On 6 September 2011, I ac c eded to the Plaintiffs’ request and sc heduled the inspec tion for 14 September 2011. 

(s) On 13 September 2011, I wrote to the parties to seek a further deposit of $40, sinc e the matter was proc eeding towards a hearing in Oc tober 2011. 

(t) On the same day, the Plaintiffs wrote to me in respec t of my letter of 2 September 2011 where I had set out the proc edure for the 3-day arbitration. They c ommented that the entire proc eedings c ould be c ompleted in less than half the time if the Defendants c hose to be absent. They also stated that “[u]nless the Tribunal states otherwise” the “witness 


statements ought to be taken as read...”. The Plaintiffs also then stated in 6 paragraphs how the hearing c ould be reduc ed to at most 1.5 days. 

(u) On 14 September 2011, the Plaintiffs inspec ted the doc uments. 

(v) On 16 September 2011, I wrote to the parties to explain my direc tions for the inspec tion of the doc uments, alloc ation of time at the hearing and the doc uments that were handed over to me by Stamford Law Corporation. 

(w) On 20 September 2011, the Plaintiffs wrote and made numerous remarks as follows: 

 (i) “With all due respec t we note that the Honourable Arbitrator, Mr Chow Kok Fong has ignored and/or neglec ted and/or refused to respond to the letters and submissions referred to above” 

 (ii) “Under the c irc umstanc es it is imperative that the Honourable Arbitrator Mr Chow Kok Fong ac ts positively before the Final Hearing on the following: 

 ( a ) assures the Respondents that the Respondents’ Doc uments submitted by the Respondents in the abortive Arbitration and now in Mr Chow Kok Fong’s c ustody mixed and interspersed with other ‘c orruptive doc uments’ will be sieved and separated from the other ‘c orruptive doc uments’ and be taken into c onsideration by the Arbitrator...” 

 ( b ) acts upon the written assurance to the Respondents and makes such action seen to be done; 

 ( c ) assures the Claimants in writing that the Honourable Arbitrator, Mr Chow Kok Fong, will not have any sight of the ‘c orruptive doc uments’ inproperly (sic )and unlawfully handed over by John Ting Kang Chung and/or his solic itors; 

 (d) ac ts upon the written assuranc e to the Claimants and makes suc h ac tion seen to be done by sealing ‘the c orruptive doc uments’ and in the presenc e of the parties sealed (sic ) the c orruptive doc uments in the presenc e of the parties and retaining same pending a dec ision by the Courts on its disposal; 

 (e) grants permission to both the Claimants and the Respondents to sort, separate and segregate the c orruptive doc uments from the doc uments submitted by the Respondents in the abortive arbitration and to witness the sealing of the c orruptive doc uments; 

 (f ) c onfirm that the Honourable Arbitrator, Mr Chow Kok Fong will be able to c arry out the above on or before 3 Oc tober 2011...” 

 (emphasis are as found in the original text) 

 (iii) “The Claimants are indeed, most disappointed (sic ) that despite having raised c ritic al outstanding matters to the Honourable Arbitrator, Mr Chow Kok Fong, the Tribunal has selec ted to ignore matters and/or neglec ted to ac t fairly, impartially, expeditiously and ec onomic ally for the resolution of the disputes at hand.” 

 (iv) “Up to the time of writing and hand delivery/rec eipt of this letter by the Arbitrator, 


 the Claimants have still not rec eived any response. This is most telling” 

 (v) “Whilst the terms set by Mr Chow Kok Fong allow for him to c all for further sec urity for his fees, it is without doubt implic it in the c ontrac tual arrangement and under the Arbitration Ac t... that work must be done with due diligence and without neglect. ” 

 (vi) “The third proc edural order is highly questionable” 

 (vii) “The time frame for payment set by the Honourable Mr Chow Kok Fong is also unreasonable partic ularly in light of the unfinished tasks expec ted of him and the pressing sc hedule for the parties to prepare for the fast approac hing arbitration. This is muc h akin to the unfair and unjustifiable requirements for submissions on the ‘c orrupted doc uments’ submitted by John Ting Kang Chung’s solic itors...” 

 (viii) “With all due respec t to the Honourable Arbitrator, Mr Chow Kok Fong, this demand for $40,000 without doing the work may be c onstrued as an ac t of oppression and, indeed obstruc tion of the c ourse of justic e” 

 (ix) “We ought to make it abundantly c lear that Claimants’ intention to take this c ourse of ac tion arises only bec ause of the neglec t by the Honourable Tribunal to attend to outstanding work whic h omission c ould result in the entire arbitration to be dec lared null and void...” 

 (x) “It would appear that the Honourable Arbitrator, Mr Chow Kok Fong, is either hesitant or reluc tant to settle the issue of the c ontentious doc uments (“the c orruptive doc uments”)” 

 (xi) “A c lear statement on this ought to be issued by the Honourable Mr Chow Kok Fong. This would be not only a better but more honourable way out than the generation of obstac les with the imposition of an oppressive ac t by way of demand of huge sums of money.” 

 (xii) “Whilst the tasks at hand c all for substantial c ourage and maturity of the quasijudic ial authority, we trust that the Honourable Mr Chow Kok Fong will rise to the oc c asion and do what is just and right” 

(x) On 23 September 2011, the Plaintiffs made numerous remarks as follows: 

 (i) The letter is entitled “SECOND REMINDER TO COMPLETE OUTSTANDING MATTERS BEFORE FINAL HEARING AND BEFORE FURTHER PAYMENT OF ADDITIONAL DEPOSIT OF $40,000 – PURPORTEDLY TO COVER ARBITRATOR’S FEES” 

 (ii) “We rush this response to reiterate our position set out in our letter of 20th September 2011 AND to highlight that we will be forc ed to make an applic ation to the Courts if we do not rec eive a positive response from Mr Chow Kok Fong on or before 12 noon Monday 26th September 2011” 

 (iii) “We say this as it is bec oming inc reasingly evident that with eac h passing day the Tribunal appears to be entering further into the arena and bec oming embroiled in the fray whilst the Respondents remain totally silent doing absolutely nothing.” 


 (iv) “No rule of Natural Justic e allows for the Claimants in suc h a situation to be plac ed in so disadvantages a position” (sic ) 

 (v) “the Claimants reserve their rights to raise the matter of what they have disc overed as improper or unlawful to the Courts at the opportune time” 

 (vi) “any attempt to limit the results of the inspec tion to only the Arbitration proc eedings even in the fac e of wrongful and/or unlawful ac tion will be deemed as interferenc e in the administration of justic e” 

 (vii) “The rules of natural justic e apply to both the Respondents and the Claimants. By protec ting one side the Tribunal c annot c ause injury to the other side. To c onstrain one side under the delusion of the rules of Natural Justic e is injustic e in itself.” 

 (viii) “Fourthly, on the ‘Alloc ation of Time of the Hearing” we are still missing a reasonable estimate of how muc h time the Tribunal intends to take and for how long he intends to retain the witnesses.” 

 (ix) “At $500/per hour c harged by Mr Chow Kok Fong it is only reasonable to expec t an exc eptionally high level of produc tivity and exc ellent c apac ity to grasp the signific ant and c ritic al points” 

 (x) “... whilst the Tribunal has repeated raised the matter of the Rules of Natural Justic e, the Tribunal ought to take c ognizanc e of the fac t and deal appropriately with it... failing to do so will render the entire Arbitration proc eedings null and void” 

 (xi) “The c hoic e is left to the Honourable Mr Chow Kok Fong” 

 (xii) “We do not expec t the Tribunal to add to our sorrows but rather to resolve the disputes with the sense of justic e and fairness” 

7\. As stated above, on 23 September 2011, in view of the loss of c onfidenc e in the tribunal by the Plaintiffs and the remarks made, I therefore wrote to the parties to seek their c onsent to the disc harge. The Plaintiffs c onsented in their letter of 27 September 2011, “save as to c osts”. 

8\. In addition to my applic ation for leave to be disc harged as arbitrator, I also apply for a direc tion for all doc uments that were previously forwarded to me by Stamford Law Corporation on 26 April 2011 to be returned to them.

 [emphasis in bold in original] 

10     On the 27 September 2011, the Plaintiffs sent a letter to the Court, attac hing Mr Chow’s letter of 23 September 2011 with their c omments thereon and stated: 

 10 In view of Mr Chow Kok Fong’s statement of intention and partic ularly the basis being the purported “remarks direc ted at (him)”, Claimants in the Arbitration (Plaintiffs in the OS1200/2010/T) hereby set out their position: 

 ( a ) The Claimants have no objection whatsoever to the Honourable Mr Chow Kok Fong 


 1 st Plaintiff: As from what he has said about us and gone through here, ’'s going to be very diffic ult, your Honour. 

 Court: All right. So you don’t want him? 

 1 st Plaintiff: He wants---he wants out, let him go. 

 Court: No. 

 1 st Plaintiff: Yah. Court: I’m trying to persuade him to stay so you c an stay in the c ourse and finish it. 

 1 st Plaintiff: But how is he going to be when he---he said suc h nasty things about us whic h are not true? 

 ... 

 Court: All right. So what do I do when I disc harge him? What are you going to do? 

 ... “Court: Mr Chow has applied to disc harge himself, you have no objec tions? 

 applying to the High Court to discharge himself as Arbitrator save as to costs; 

 ( b ) By copy of this letter to the Honourable Arbitrator which will be delivered by hand today the Claimants request the Honourable Arbitrator to do so as soon as possible as “time is of the essence”; 

 ( c ) The Plaintiffs in OS1200/2010/T withdraw their urgent request for an immediate Hearing under “liberty to apply” to resolve critical outstanding matters, which application we e-filed vide our letter of 26 th September 2011 (referred to at paragraph 1 above); and 

 ( d ) We reserve all our rights and interests in this matter including but not limited to our right to rebut the unfounded allegations set out in the Honourable Mr Chow Kok Fong’s letter dated 23 September 2011. 

 [emphasis in bold and underlined in original] 

 (a) This letter was c opied to Mr Chow and it inc luded the following note to Mr Chow at the end of their letter: 

 Whilst we maintain that we have not direc ted any improper remarks at you we will respec t your dec ision to opt out. For the avoidance of any doubt whatsoever we have no objection to your intended application to the Court to discharge yourself as Arbitrator save as to costs. As time is of the essenc e, and as you have rec ognized that Arbitrations should be c onduc ted expeditiously we humbly request that your applic ation be made on an urgent basis. Meanwhile, in view of your intention we propose to... 

 [Emphasis in the original] 

11     I heard the parties on 27 Oc tober 2011. The transc ript will show that the Plaintiffs had no objec tion to Mr Chow’s applic ation to be disc harged. I asked them twic e and the Plaintiffs affirmed both times that they were agreeable to his withdrawal: 


 1 st Plaintiff: No. 

 Court: All right, so I’m going to rec ord this here.” 

 ... 

 “Court: Mr Chow, your applic ation to disc harge yourself is granted. 

 Chow: I’m obliged, your Honour. Court: You will be entitled to c harge reasonable c osts to date. Suc h c osts will be submitted to the Court meaning to me for review and dec ision as to reasonableness. All right... 

 ... “Court: [To the Plaintiffs] I’ve asked you, “Will you rec onsider?” You say, “No”. So my order stands that Mr Chow c an withdraw. 

 1 st Plaintiff: Thank you.” 

 ... 

 “Court: Thank you. So do you need any more orders from me? 

 1 st Plaintiff: No, not on Mr Chow. Basic ally we will take--we’ll take up this ac tion against Mr Chow. We’ll take up separate ac tion. ... 

 Court: Mr Chow, you are allowed to disc harge yourself, withdraw as arbitrator and you all c an do as you are advised and the way you think best suits your interest. All right? 

12     I ac c ordingly, I made the following orders for OS 1200/2010 on 27 Oc tober 2011: 

 Mr Chow – applic ation to disc harge yourself is granted. 

 You will be entitled to c harge reasonable c osts to date. 

 Suc h c osts will be submitted to Court, for review as dec ision as to reasonableness and quantum. 

 Doc uments will be returned to Stamford Law by Arbitrator. 

13     On 8 November 2011, the Plaintiffs sent a letter requesting further argument with respec t to OS 1179; this letter was headed: 

 ORIGINATING SUMMONS 1179/2010/P 

 AND SUMMONS (OTHERS) 1333/2011/B 

 REQUEST FOR FURTHER ARGUMENTS ... 

Summons No. 1333/2011/B was an applic ation under OS 1179 for Mr John Ting to submit to c rossexamination by the Plaintiffs. In this letter, after the 7-paragraph introduc tory remarks, (whic h noted that Mr Chow, a “non-party” to OS 1179, was allowed to remain in Chambers and that the Hearing for 


Direc tions was a joint hearing with OS 1200 where the “...learned Judge made c ertain ‘final’ dec isions on some of the matters in both OSs”), the Plaintiffs went on to make observations and points on and against my c osts orders in OS 1179, asked to be given a fair and reasonable opportunity to respond and rebut the OS 1179 Defendant’s affidavits and to present their c ase in OS 1200, set out their views on Mr Chow’s handling of the arbitration and what transpired, ac c used Mr Chow of sending “... outrageously blatant” letters that were “...designed to generate a paper trail so as to opt out of the Arbitration” and wanted to be allowed to file “...a c omplete set of c orrespondenc e with Mr Chow Kok Fong” as it would be grossly unfair on them to allow Mr Chow’s disc harge without plac ing on rec ord all the evidenc e whic h “...negates the allegations made by Mr Chow Kok Fong against the [Plaintiffs]”. 

14     The above took up most of the 12-page 68 paragraph letter. There was, within those 12 pages, two paragraphs whic h stated that further arguments were required to “regularize” the “joint hearing of OS1179/2010/P and OS 1200/2010/P” and further explained that: 

 (a) the c ourt should make a spec ific ruling that it was c onsidering the request of Mr Chow to disc harge himself on the basis of the “liberty to apply” granted to the parties in OS 1200; and 

 (b) suc h a spec ific ruling is “essential to avoid any doubts or c omplic ations in the future partic ularly any intended ac tion against John Ting Kang Chung for having messed up not one, but two arbitrations.” 

In this letter, the Plaintiffs did not say they disagreed with the disc harge of Mr Chow as arbitrator. Their c onc ern was to seek a spec ific ruling that the basis of the request by Mr Chow to be disc harged was the liberty to apply order in OS 1200. Their main c onc ern were the matters in relation to OS 1179 and their wish to put all the c orrespondenc e between them and Mr Chow “on rec ord” whic h they alleged would prove Mr Chow’s unfairness to them and a reimbursement of the deposit paid to him. 

15     Pursuant to a Registry Notic e for OS 1179, dated 2 Marc h 2012, the parties, _viz_ , the Plaintiffs and Mr John Ting’s Counsel, Mr Daniel Chia, c ame before me on 20 Marc h 2012: 

 (a) Mr Chia raised the preliminary objec tion that the Plaintiffs were out of time as I would have been deemed to have c ertified no further argument on 22 November 2011 (14 days after the Plaintiffs’ 8 November 2011 letter). However Mr Chia very kindly indic ated he was willing to deal with the Plaintiffs’ arguments nonetheless sinc e they were litigants in person. 

 (b) The Plaintiffs went through the history of the matter and argued that the c osts I awarded against Mr John Ting was inadequate and why I should allow them to c ross-examine Mr John Ting. At the end of the hearing, I said I would think about the c osts awarded to the Plaintiffs for OS 1179, in the meanwhile the parties were to try and agree the disbursements, failing whic h I would tax them and I refused the Plaintiffs’ applic ation to c ross-examine Mr John Ting. 

 (c ) Although what was before me was OS 1179, the Plaintiffs did say at the beginning of the hearing that: 

 (i) the “joint hearing” of OS 1200 and OS 1179 should be “regularised”; 

 (ii) they had believed that the 27 Oc tober 2011 hearing was a direc tions hearing only; 

 (iii) they should be given a fair and reasonable opportunity to present their c ase in OS 1200; 


 (iv) they would like the hearing of OS 1200 be on another day with notic e being given to the Defendant in OS 1200 and that Mr Chow be asked to attend as well; and 

 (v) they did not “botc h” up the sec ond arbitration. 

 (d) The Plaintiffs then went on with their arguments set out at [15(b)] above. 

As time had run out, I direc ted that another half day be fixed for hearing OS 1200. In doing so, it should be noted that I did not rule that I was going to hear further arguments, but to fix another time for the Plaintiffs to explain what they wanted “regularised”. It would not have been right after suc h a lapse of time, to do so without hearing the other party. Given the Plaintiffs’ views in their letter of 8 November 2011, I had formed the view that making all the c orrespondenc e between the Plaintiffs and Mr Chow “part of the rec ord” was totally unnec essary. What had been written by the parties was existing evidenc e if it was ever nec essary to produc e them, whether they formed part of the rec ord or not. What the Plaintiffs said to me at [15(c )] above was, almost a by-the-way c omment, before they went on with their arguments on OS 1179 

16     The parties c ame before me on 9 July 2012. As the Registry Notic e inc luded both OS 1200 and OS 1179 in its heading, Mr Edwin Lee (“Mr Lee”), c ounsel for Mr Chow turned up. The Plaintiffs again said rather vaguely that Mr Chow should not apply for disc harge under OS 1200 and they needed to “regularise” that. Bec ause Mr Chow was not served a c opy of the Plaintiffs’ 8 November 2011 letter and Mr Lee asked that a c opy be served on him so that he c ould take instruc tions, I direc ted that the Plaintiffs serve a c opy of the 8 November 2011 letter on Mr Lee. Mr Lee made the point that the Plaintiffs had not filed any appeal against my dec ision given on 27 Oc tober 2011 and Mr Lee asked for, and I gave, my c onfirmation that this was not to hear further arguments on that order, as the time to do so had long passed, but to understand what the Plaintiffs was saying had to be done to “regularise” Mr Chow’s disc harge. 

17     The next hearing was on 27 July 2012 where the Plaintiffs and Mr Chow’s c ounsel, Ms Looi Ming Ming (“Ms Looi”), appeared before me. The Defendants, as usual, did not appear. At this hearing I took quite some time to get exac tly what the Plaintiffs were saying should have been done and what in their view, needed “regularising”. They argued that Mr Chow’s applic ation on 3 Oc tober 2011 was merely an applic ation for leave to apply for leave to be disc harged. The order of 27 Oc tober 2011 was made “in breac h of natural justic e”. Besides other arguments, Ms Looi emphasised that the c ourt had not granted leave for further arguments with respec t to the 27 Oc tober 2011. As the Plaintiffs had made referenc es to the numerous hearings and what they said apparently happened, I told the parties that I had to trawl through c onsiderable history, affidavits, submissions and hearings (with transc ripts where available) arising from this long drawn-out matter to c hec k whether what the Plaintiffs alleged was c orrec t and that I would need some time to do so. I adjourned the matter for that purpose. 

**The Plaintiffs’ submissions** 

18     The Plaintiffs’ submissions, if I understand them c orrec tly, may be briefly summarised as follows: 

 (a) With Mr Chow’s ac c eptanc e of his appointment as arbitrator, OS 1200 had been c onc luded and the Originating Summons c annot be arbitrarily revived. 

 (b) In any c ase, Mr Chow being a non-party had no locus standi to intervene in the OS 1200 proc eedings. 


 (c ) Mr Chow c ould not apply for his disc harge as arbitrator through the “liberty to apply” order made on 1 February 2011 

 (d) The joint hearing of OS 1200 and OS 1179 together on 27 Oc tober 2011 had taken the Plaintiffs by surprise and resulted in proc eedings bec oming exc essively c omplic ated and c onvoluted in breac h of natural justic e. 

19     In order to “regularize” the proc eedings, the Plaintiffs sought a dec laratory judgment that Mr Chow ought to file a fresh summons to be heard on his own applic ation to be disc harged as arbitrator. 

**My decision** 

20     A preliminary point I must make is that what took plac e on 27 July 2012 was _not_ to hear further arguments but to understand what the Plaintiffs were c omplaining about or what they were asking the c ourt to “regularize”. This is evident from the transc ripts of the hearing on 9 July 2012 whic h 

prec eded the 27 July 2012 hearing. [note: 1] Ac c ordingly, I c onfirmed that Mr Chow was validly disc harged on 27 Oc tober 2011 and stated: 

 The Arbitrator appointed in OS 1200/2010 was validly disc harged on 27 Oc tober 2011. It is inc orrec t and there is no merit in [the Plaintiffs’] c ontention that Mr Chow has to intervene first and then file a fresh applic ation for leave to be disc harged or be disc harged. 

 It was c lear to me, on 27 Oc tober 2011 that the Plaintiff’s relationship with Mr Chow Kok Fong had deteriorated and had bec ome very [ac rimonious]; the Plaintiffs made c lear they had lost trust in Mr Chow and this is also c aptured in c ontemporaneous c orrespondenc e. 

 I asked the Plaintiffs not onc e but twic e about their not wanting Mr Chow to c ontinue as Arbitrator and on both oc c asions they made c lear they were agreeable to his withdrawal. I note that this was in addition to their agreement to his disc harge in writing in their response to Mr Chow’s letter of 3 Oc tober 2011. 

 The argument on breac h of natural justic e in hearing OS1200/2011 and OS1179/2010 together is also without merit. The Plaintiffs were c learly put on notic e that Mr Chow was applying to disc harge himself as Arbitrator in his letter of 3 Oc tober 2011 and it is c lear that the Plaintiffs addressed the c ourt on both matters at the beginning of the hearing on 27 Oc tober 2011. 

 It would have been an unnec essary waste of time and money in the c irc umstanc es for Mr Chow to, eg, intervene as a party and then take out an applic ation for leave to disc harge himself. In any c ase, any non-c omplianc e with the Rules of Court, is an irregularity under Order 2. Most importantly, the Plaintiffs have not suffered any prejudic e thereby. Indeed Mr Chow’s disc harge was what they c learly wanted. 

 For the avoidanc e of doubt, what took plac e on 27 July 2012 was not to hear further arguments but to understand what the Plaintiffs were c omplaining about or what they were asking the Court to do; that is also evident from the transc ript taken for that day. 

 I have now made my positions c lear and that is the end of OS1200/2010. 

 Mr Lee, if you wish to leave, you c an do so. 

 EL: Thank you. 


I now set out the reasons for my dec ision in more detail. 

**_Hearing of Further Arguments_** 

21     First, having trawled through the earlier hearings, submissions and affidavits, it was evident that the Plaintiffs had no objec tions to Mr Chow’s applic ation for leave to withdraw (see above at [10] and [12]). It was also c lear that I gave Mr Chow leave to withdraw and disc harged his appointment as arbitrator and made c onsequential orders on his c osts and the doc uments in his possession. In light of what transpired, the Plaintiffs c annot ask for “further arguments” on Mr Chow’s disc harge or manner of his disc harge bec ause they took the stand that they had no objec tions to it or presented any arguments against it. They c learly had lost c onfidenc e in him and no longer wished to c ontinue the arbitration with Mr Chow as the arbitrator. Having presented no arguments against Mr Chow’s disc harge or the manner of his disc harge, they c ould have no _further_ arguments to make on that sc ore. In truth, the Plaintiffs have had a c hange of mind, for reasons best known to them, and they now wanted to re-open a matter to whic h they had no objec tions. 

22     Moreover, it is c lear from their letter of 8 November 2011 that the Plaintiffs wanted to make further arguments on the matters c anvassed in OS 1179 and the orders I had made there on 27 Oc tober 2011. The Plaintiffs did inc lude in their letter of 8 November 2011 a request that the c ourt “regularize the proc edure” in OS 1200, but that was c ertainly not a request for further arguments. If for whatever reason they subsequently disagreed with my dec ision, they c ould have appealed against my order disc harging Mr Chow. Their time to do so ran out on 28 November 2011. 

23     Even if I assume for the purpose of argument, that the Plaintiff’s letter of 8 November 2011 was also a request for further arguments in relation to OS 1200, they have the diffic ulty of overc oming O 56 r 2(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”) whic h provides: 

 Unless the Registrar informs the party making the applic ation within 14 days of the rec eipt of the applic ation that the Judge requires further arguments, the Judge shall be deemed to have c ertified that he requires no further arguments. 

The 14 day period elapsed with no response from this c ourt. On a plain reading of the provision, I would be deemed to have c ertified that I required no further arguments in respec t of the 27 Oc tober order in relation to OS 1200 on 22 November 2011 (14 days after 8 November 2011). 

24     Had the Plaintiffs been dissatisfied with the 27 Oc tober order, the appropriate rec ourse would have been to file a notic e of appeal. Time to file the same would run from the date the Judge is deemed to have c ertified that he requires no further arguments: see s 28B (b)(ii) Supreme Court of Judic ature Ac t (Cap 322, 2007 Revised Edition). The time, therefore, for the Plaintiffs to file an appeal against my 27 Oc tober 2011 order with respec t to Mr Chow has long passed as they should have filed their appeal within one month after 22 November 2011. 

25     In any c ase, I was of the view that Mr Chow was validly disc harged on 27 Oc tober 2011 and that there was no merit in the Plaintiffs’ c ontention that Mr Chow, being a non-party to OS 1200, should have first sought to intervene before filing a fresh applic ation for leave to be disc harged. 

**_Right of an arbitrator to resign_** 

26     A preliminary issue arises in this instanc e did Mr Chow have the right to resign his appointment in the first plac e? The arbitrator’s rights and obligations are derived from a c onjunc tion of c ontrac t and status, his ac c eptanc e of appointment gives rise to a trilateral c ontrac t, in whic h the arbitrator 


bec omes a party to the previously bilateral arbitration agreement between the parties: see BrowneWilkinson VC in _K/S Norjarl A/S v Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd_ [1992] 1 QB 863, at 884. In Robert M Merkin’s _Arbitration Law_ (Lloyd’s of London, Looseleaf ed., 1991 ) at [10.86], it was stated: 

 Whether an arbitrator has the right to resign is a matter of c ontrac t between the parties and the arbitrator. He will have the right to resign lawfully in any c irc umstanc es spec ified in the c ontrac t, and also where the parties are in repudiatory breac h of their agreement with him. 

27     Several texts disc uss the right of an arbitrator to resign from his appointment, see _eg_ , Gary Born, _International Commercial Arbitration Vol.1_ (Kluwer Law International, 2009) (“Gary Born”) at Chapter 12, pp 1634–1638 where the learned author states at p 1634: 

 An arbitrator is also c ontrac tually obliged to c omplete the mandate whic h he or she ac c epts, and therefore not to resign during the c ourse of the arbitration without good cause. [emphasis added] 

A footnote to that proposition refers to the AAA/ABA Code of Ethic s Canon I (H) whic h refers to unantic ipated c irc umstanc es that would render it impossible or imprac tic able to c ontinue as giving rise to right to withdraw. The learned author goes on in a footnote at p 1635 to referenc e various national laws that allow an arbitrator to resign for good c ause, just c ause, justifiable reasons or reasonable c ause. The labels may differ but the princ iple is c lear. 

28     I have no doubt that in the c irc umstanc es that have arisen here, Mr Chow had good and justifiable c ause to resign. It was c lear to me by 27 Oc tober 2011 that the Plaintiffs’ relationship with Mr Chow had deteriorated and bec ome very ac rimonious (again I emphasize that this was not in any way c aused by Mr Chow). This was c aptured in c ontemporaneous c orrespondenc e between the Plaintiffs and Mr Chow leading up to his asking for leave to disc harge himself as the arbitrator. 

29     In the Plaintiffs’ Letter of 20 September 2011, the Plaintiffs ac c used Mr Chow of having “ignored and/or neglec ted and/or refused to respond” to letters that were previously sent to him (at para 1). The Plaintiffs alleged that Mr Chow had “selec ted to ignore the matters and/or neglec ted to ac t fairly, impartially, expeditiously and ec onomic ally for the resolution of the disputes at hand” (at para 7). 

30     At para 6 of the same letter, the Plaintiffs listed several steps whic h they demanded Mr Chow take before the final hearing. The list inc luded a demand for a written assuranc e to the parties that he would not have any sight of the “c orruptive” doc uments improperly and unlawfully handed over by the previous arbitrator, Mr John Ting, and that Mr Chow sealed the “c orruptive” doc uments in the presenc e of the parties. 

31     The Plaintiffs further implied at paras 8 to 9 that Mr Chow had not c arried out his duties as the arbitrator with due diligenc e in the light of his refusal to respond to the c laimants’ letters and submissions on the issue of “c orruptive” doc uments from the previous arbitration: 

 8 The Claimants have given adequate time sinc e rec eipt of this questionable demand letter for the Honourable Mr Chow Kok Fong to respond to the letters and submissions listed at para 1 above. Up to the time of writing and hand deliver/rec eipt of this letter by the Arbitrator, the Claimants have still not received any response. This is most telling. [emphasis in bold in original] 

 9 Whilst the terms set by Mr Chow Kok Fong allow for him to c all for further sec urity for his fees, it is without doubt implic it in the c ontrac tual arrangement and under the Arbitration Ac t (Cap.10 1985 Revised Edition) and the Singapore Institute of Arc hitec ts’ Arbitration Rules that 


 work must be done with due diligence and without neglect. [emphasis in bold in original] 

32     The Plaintiffs proc eeded to request that Mr Chow give his reasons for requesting a further deposit of $40,000 and alluded to the possibility of taking out an applic ation to tax Mr Chow’s fees if they were not satisfied with his response: at paras10, 11 and 17. The Plaintiffs averred at para 14 that Mr Chow’s demand for further deposits of $40,000 “may be c onstrued as an ac t of oppression, and, indeed, obstruc tion to the c ourse of justic e.” 

33     The Plaintiffs c onc luded their letter as follows: 

 19 The Arbitrator’s fees are always protec ted under the law. In fac t the Arbitrator may hold a lien on the Award until his fees are paid. But an equally important provision under the law is that the proc eedings move forward impartially and lawfully (a just, expeditious and ec onomic al resolution of the disputes). 

 20 Finally, we are obliged to remind the Honourable Mr Chow Kok Fong that he will not only be dis[a]ppointing the parties in the Arbitration but also the Honourable Court (the appointing authority) that had pac ed its trust and c onfidenc e of in Mr Chow Kok Fong. Whilst the tasks at hand call for substantial courage and maturity of the quasi-judicial authority, we trust that the Honourable Mr Chow Kok Fong will rise to the occasion and do what is just and right. [emphasis added] 

34     The Plaintiffs wrote another letter dated 23 September 2011 in response to Mr Chow’s letter dated 16 September 2011. In this letter, the Plaintiffs c ast doubt on the arbitrator’s impartiality and ac c used the tribunal of “entering further into the arena and bec oming embroiled in the fray” as well as “taking sides”, whic h have plac ed them in a “disadvantageous position” c ontrary to natural justic e (at paras 4 and 5). In this regard, the Plaintiffs stated their position at para 10 of their letter: 

 (a) the Claimants reserve their rights to raise the matter of what they have disc overed as improper or unlawful to the Courts at the opportune time; 

 (b) any attempt to limit the results of the inspec tion to only the Arbitration proc eedings even in the fac e of wrongful and/or unlawful ac tion will be deemed as interferenc e in the administration of justic e; and 

 (c ) The rules of natural justic e apply to both the Respondents and the Claimants. By protec ting one side the Tribunal c annot c ause injury to the other side. To c onstrain one side under the delusion of the rules of Natural Justic e is injustic e in itself. 

35     The Plaintiffs further averred that Mr Chow’s refusal to deal with the issue of “c orruptive” doc uments would render the c urrent proc eedings “null and void” and stated in this regard at para 15: 

 At S$500/per hour c harged by Mr Chow Kok Fong it is only reasonable to expec t an exc eptionally high level of produc tivity and exc ellent c apac ity to grasp the signific ant and c ritic al points. 

36     The Plaintiffs c onc luded, “[w]e do not expec t the Tribunal to add to our sorrows but rather to resolve the disputes with the sense of justic e and fairness”. 

37     From the above c orrespondenc e, it was apparent that the Plaintiffs had lost their trust, quite unjustifiably I must add, in Mr Chow’s ability to c onduc t the arbitration in a fair and effic ac ious 


manner. The Respondent had taken no part in the arbitration proc eedings. It was in this c ontext that Mr Chow wrote to the Plaintiffs on 23 September 2011 giving notic e of his intention to apply for leave from the c ourt to disc harge himself as the arbitrator unless the Plaintiffs gave reasons otherwise. Moreover, as noted above, it should be emphasised that the Plaintiffs never objec ted to Mr Chow disc harging himself as the arbitrator despite having been given several opportunities to do so. 

38     I further observe that the Plaintiffs c ontinued to repeat their ac c usations against Mr Chow long after my order allowing Mr Chow to disc harge himself as the arbitrator: 

 (a) in their letter dated 08 November 2011 seeking further arguments before myself: 

 ... 

 34 ... Given his extensive qualific ations he ought to have known that his additional c ondition imposed by him would be an interferenc e in the administration of justic e. Moreover, by so doing the learned Mr Chow Kok Fong was unwittingly getting involved into the disputes by entering into the arena. 

 ... 

 43 It is puzzling why despite repeated referenc e to this letter the Honourable Mr Chow Kok Fong has selec ted to ignore it again purportedly on the grounds that it was not filed within time. ... It is c lear that the hurried reac tion by the Arbitrator was an unfortunate overreac tion by whic h he unwittingly entered into the arena. 

 ... 

 53 The quic k denial by Mr Chow Kok Fong raises the question of integrity on his part. 

 54 In fac t, we had on several oc c asions noted that he had been inc onsistent in his direc tions and ac tions resulting in him distorting and misrepresenting matters. ... 

 (b) in their joint written submissions tendered for a hearing on 9 July 2012 (“ASNK 1200/JWS2”): 

 29 We also humbly submit that Chow Kok Fong will also have to bear some proportion of the responsibility and blame for not ac ting properly or appropriately when fac ed with suc h an awkward situation. However, this will be the substanc e of a separate ac tion against Chow Kok Fong and others. [emphasis in bold in original] 

 ... 

 36 Surely, Chow Kok Fong, with his long list of qualific ations and purported experienc e and expertise, ought to have known better how to properly handle suc h a situation in the light of the gross misrepresentation by John Ting Kang Chung and his solic itors. It is indeed most puzzling that Chow Kok Fong reac ted in the way he did. 

 (c ) in their supplementary written submissions dated 25 July 2012 for a hearing on 27 July 2012 (“ASNK 1200/JWS 2A”): 

 ... 


 47 Mr Chow Kok Fong has legal training and has been touted as being among the best in Singapore in Arbitration. He ought to have known better than to interfere into proc eedings for whic h he was a non-party. Worse still, he ought to have known better than to attempt a “bac k door” entry by a non-party under the guise of “liberty to apply” granted only to parties. 

 48 Mr Chow Kok Fong ac c epted the appointment as Arbitrator mainly on his own terms whic h related primarily to his fees. ... He ought to have known better that very high fees only mean an equivalent high standard of performanc e. 

 49 A failure to live up to the reasonable expec tation of the parties must have its c onsequenc es. The parties in the Arbitration must, in ac c ordanc e with the Rules of Natural Justic e, be ac c orded their rights to present their c ase in full on how the Arbitration has been derailed and now suspended. ... 

39     From the evidenc e before me, none of the Plaintiffs’ ac c usations against Mr Chow are valid. I c annot ac c ept that someone with Mr Chow’s experienc e and knowledge c an bec ome “c orrupted” by reading doc uments that are not relevant nor admissible. Importantly, the Plaintiffs c annot dic tate to the arbitrator how he should run the arbitration. On the c ontrary, the proc edural orders made and how Mr Chow c onduc ted the arbitration thus far, as set out in Mr Chow’s letter of 3 Oc tober 2011, c annot be c ritic ised on any sc ore. 

40     I have had oc c asion to c omment in other judgments on the misc onc eptions of the Plaintiffs, see _Anwar Siraj and another v Attorney General_ <span class="citation">[2010] SGHC 36</span> (OS 1213 of 2009) and in _Ting Kang Chung John v Teo Hee Lai Building Constructions Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">[2010] 2 SLR 625</span> where I said at [63] and would repeat: 

 ... Siraj is a very strong-minded individual who has his own ideas of what should be and what should not be. The Sirajs were therefore often diffic ult and obstruc tive. Having heard some of his applic ations, I must say that he also sees shadows, whic h appear to him to mask something very diabolic al when there are none. When someone, be it the Arbitrator or registrar or judge, does not agree with him or rules against him, he c an be forgiven if he thinks to himself that that person is wrong or does not know what he is doing or is biased or favours the other party or is stupid or even harbours some sec ret agenda. When a sec ond person in that c ategory rules against him, and being c haritable, one c an still understand him having suc h feelings. By the time it c omes to the fifth, sixth or seventh person ruling against him, then it is time for Siraj to take a step bac k and objec tively ask himself, is it possible that he is the one who holds a mistaken view or has the wrong end of the stic k? This is exac tly what Tay J meant when he said in his judgment: “The fac t that an arbitrator seems to be c onstantly ruling in favour of one party is equally c onsistent with the merits being on that party’s side.” (see Anwar Siraj v Ting Kang Chung [<span class="citation">[2003] SGHC 64</span>] at [43]). 

41     I have no doubt in the c irc umstanc es that Mr Chow had the right to resign. He was the subjec t of numerous unfounded ac c usations and allegations, many of whic h were not only unwarranted but also sc urrilous. They were c ouc hed in very strong and aggressive terms whic h were quite unc alled for. I turn now to c onsider the proper proc edure for him to resign as arbitrator. 

**_Proper procedure for discharge or resignation of arbitrator_** 

42     Was the proc edure adopted by Mr Chow wrong? The SIA Arbitration Rules (2nd ed, Reprint August 2013) do not presc ribe any partic ular mode for an arbitrator to resign from his appointment. 


Our Arbitration Ac t (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) is also silent on the proc edure for an arbitrator to resign. I have no doubt that in the absenc e of any set proc edure in the institutional rules, national laws or the c ontrac t setting out the terms of appointment, a letter to the parties c learly stating that the arbitrator wishes to resign or resigns is suffic ient. This was held to be the c ase in _Hong Kiat Construction Pte Ltd v Ngiam Benjamin_ <span class="citation">[2009] SGHC 158</span> where a c ommunic ation by the arbitrator stating that he intended to resign if he did not hear from either of the parties within 7 days from the date of his letter to the parties was held to have taken effec t ac c ording to its terms. 

43     As there has been no argument made before me, I offer no opinion on whether there should be a notic e period or a meeting to deal with c onsequential matters before the resignation takes plac e. I would imagine that muc h would depend on the c irc umstanc es of eac h c ase. Here, Mr Chow wrote to both parties on 23 September 2011 seeking their c onsent to his disc harge as arbitrator in light of the Plaintiffs’ remarks in their letters to him, and asked for their reply by 27 September 2011. The Respondent as usual did not respond but the Plaintiffs responded by their letter of 27 September 2011 stating that they had “no objec tion whatsoever ... save as to c osts”, see [9] and [10] above. Gary Born notes that there is generally no requirement for an arbitrator to state his reasons for resigning and drafters of the UNCITRAL Rules rejec ted proposals that required a resigning arbitrator to provide a statement of his reasons: see Gary Born p 1637. The learned author however notes that most c onsc ientious prac titioners will often c hoose to do so. Here, Mr Chow set out his reasons in full and as I found earlier, he had very good reasons and proper c ause for wanting to resign. 

44     I therefore find that Mr Chow did not need to ask the c ourt for leave to withdraw. He c ould have effec tively done so by a simple letter. However, he c hose to do so out of respec t for the c ourt whic h had appointed him. Nevertheless, assuming that he did have to ask for leave from c ourt, I turn now to c onsider the Plaintiffs’ c ontention that leave had been irregularly obtained. 

45     With respec t to non-parties, O 45 r 9(1) of the Rules Of Court provides: 

 Any person, not being a party to a c ause or matter, who obtains any order or in whose favour any order is made, shall be entitled to enforc e obedienc e to the order by the same proc ess as if he were a party. 

The question that follows from this is whether the order in question (“ORC 592/2011”) appointing Mr Chow as the arbitrator in respec t of the disputes arising between the parties was an order obtained by or made in his favour. 

46     The terms of the order are set out at [3] above. I further indic ated that there would be liberty 

to apply “if Chow Kok Fong says he c annot for some reason or other be the Arbitrator”. [note: 2] 

47     I agree with the Plaintiffs that the “liberty to apply” order is only intended to supplement the main orders in form and c onvenienc e so that the main orders may be c arried out and may not be used to vary the order of the c ourt: see _Tan Yeow Khoon and another v Tan Yeow Tat and another_ <span class="citation">[1999] 3 SLR(R) 717</span>, _Koh Ewe Chee v Koh Hua Leong and another_ <span class="citation">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 943</span> and _Kamla Lal Hiranand v Lal Hiranand_ <span class="citation">[2003] 3 SLR(R) 198</span>. Therefore, taken together with the first order appointing Mr Chow as the arbitrator, the “liberty to apply” order appeared to be one granted to the parties to seek a fresh appointee should Mr Chow dec line his appointment by the c ourt under OS 1200; its sc ope probably did not extend to a situation where matters arising after his appointment led to the arbitrator applying for leave from c ourt to disc harge himself. 

48     Nevertheless, O 2 r 1 of the Rules of Court provides that any failure to c omply with the requirements of the Rules of Court is to be treated as an irregularity and will not nullify the 


proc eedings, any step taken in the proc eeding, or any doc ument, judgment or order therein. The c ourt may make any order it deems fit to c orrec t the irregularities and generally the c ourts have taken a liberal approac h in exerc ising this disc retion: see _Sinwa SS (HK) Co Ltd v Morten Innhaug_ <span class="citation">[2010] 4 SLR 1</span>. However, the c ourts would refuse to grant suc h a remedy where: (a) the c urative approac h would result in prejudic e; (b) where the nature of the error is so serious or fundamental that it c annot, in princ iple, be validated; (c ) where the mandatory nature of the rule breac hed may be c onstrued as exc luding c ure; (d) where the rule is suffic iently c omprehensive to govern nonc omplianc e; and (e) where the substantive applic ation, if made, would have failed: see Jeffery Pinsler, _Principles of Civil Procedure_ (Ac ademy Publishing, 2013) at para 01.040. None of these apply here. In the c irc umstanc es, it was c lear to me that the irregularity was one whic h c ould be c ured. 

49     It would not only have been an unnec essary waste of time and money but also oppressive for the Plaintiffs to require Mr Chow to intervene as a party and then take out a fresh applic ation for leave to disc harge himself in light of the unusual c irc umstanc es and sinc e Mr Chow’s disc harge was what they c learly wanted. Most importantly, the Plaintiffs did not suffer any prejudic e thereby. 

**_No breach of natural justice_** 

50     The Plaintiffs’ allegation that there has been a breac h of natural justic e in hearing OS 1200 and OS 1179 together on 27 Oc tober 2011 was also groundless. First, the Plaintiffs had been c learly put on notic e that Mr Chow was applying to disc harge himself as the arbitrator from his letter dated 3 Oc tober 2011, on whic h they were c opied. Sec ondly, the Plaintiffs’ position and stand in the matter had been fully set out in the c orrespondenc e between the parties, most if not all of whic h were c opied to the Court or indeed in submissions or affidavits. Thirdly, the Plaintiffs had also been put on notic e that both OS 1200 and OS 1179 were being heard together on 27 Oc tober 2011. The Supreme Court Registry had sent the parties letters dated 12 September 2011 and 19 Oc tober 2011 in relation to the hearing of OS 1179 and a letter dated 24 Oc tober 2011 in relation to the hearing of OS 1200. Finally, it was c lear that the Plaintiffs knew that the two matters were being heard together at the 

beginning of the hearing on 27 Oc tober 2011. [note: 3] I have already set out above what transpired at the 27 Oc tober 2011 hearing. The Plaintiffs were given ample opportunity to be heard on Mr Chow’s applic ation for disc harge; they not only had no objec tion to his resignation, they c learly said they did not wish to have him as the arbitrator. 

51     For the above reasons, I c larified at the 12 August 2013 c hamber hearing, that there was nothing to be done to “regularise” the proc edure and my earlier order that Mr Chow Kok Fong be allowed to disc harge himself as the arbitrator stands. I note again that the Plaintiffs are hopelessly out of time to appeal against the order made by me on 27 Oc tober 2011.
