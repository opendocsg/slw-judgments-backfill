Tan Lee Meng J: 

1       The appellant, Hao Wei (S) Pte Ltd (“Hao Wei”), a building c ontrac tor, appealed against the dec ision of the Distric t Judge Wong Choon Ning (“DJ Wong”), who found it liable to its employee, the respondent, Mr Rasan Selvan (“Rasan”), for an injury suffered in the c ourse of his employment. I dismissed the appeal and now give the reasons for my dec ision. 

**Background** 

2       Rasan, an Indian national with a work permit, first c ame to Singapore in September 1998 to work for Hao Wei as a c onstruc tion worker. He was deployed to work at various loc ations. 

3       On 21 June 2001, Hao Wei deployed Rasan to work in a fac tory at 15 Sungei Kadut Street 2 (the “fac tory”). At the material time, Hao Wei was the sub-c ontrac tor of the first defendant (in the suit below), TSS Construc tion Pte Ltd (“TSSC”), whose task was to c arry out reinforc ement works to pre-c ast elements at the fac tory (the “projec t”). 

4       On the morning of 21 June 2001, Ms Sufiah Ng (“Sufiah”), a direc tor of Hao Wei, ac c ompanied Rasan to the plac e within the fac tory where bars required for the projec t were bent by a bar bending mac hine. Rasan was introduc ed to a foreman, one Mr Pang. He was ordered to follow Mr Pang’s instruc tions and the work sc hedule in the fac tory. 

5       Mr Pang, who did not explain to Rasan how the mac hine was to be operated, told Rasan to obey the instruc tions of a Bangladeshi worker named “Sidik”. 

6       Sidik told Rasan to hold the bars that had been plac ed in the mac hine and to insert a stopper or pin into the bar bending mac hine before the bars were bent in order to prevent the mac hine from 


going beyond a spec ified point, whic h indic ated how far the bars were to be bent. Onc e the stopper was inserted, Sidik ac tivated the mac hine by stepping on a foot pedal. On the basis of these simple instruc tions, Rasan started work immediately. 

7       Rasan’s work was not easy. A stac k of bars had to be plac ed, one on top of the other in the mac hine. Their lengths had to be adjusted to be in line with one another so that all of them would be bent equally to the requisite shape or angle. During the bending proc ess, Rasan had to hold the bars in position until the bending proc ess had been finished to ensure that the bars at the top of the stac k did not slip down. 

8       On 26 June 2001, at around 9.45 am, Rasan removed a stac k of bent bars from the mac hine. When he returned to the mac hine, he notic ed that Sidik had already plac ed a new stac k of bars into the mac hine and that these bars were being bent by the mac hine without the stopper having been put in plac e. Furthermore, no one was holding the bars in position. Rasan quic kly grabbed the stopper to insert it into the mac hine but before he c ould do so, the bars that were then being bent hit him on his right hip and groin. He lost his balanc e and fell onto the mac hine, after whic h a part of the mac hine that was returning to its original position, after having bent the bars, hit him on the head, fac e and nec k. He was severely injured and bec ame unc onsc ious. Subsequently, he was diagnosed as suffering from post c onc ussion syndrome. 

9       Rasan applied for c ompensation under the Workmen’s Compensation Ac t (Cap 354, 1998 Rev Ed) (now known as the Work Injury Compensation Ac t). However, he withdrew the applic ation. On 28 Oc tober 2003, he c ommenc ed the present proc eedings against the main c ontrac tor, TSSC, whic h denied that it had any direc t c ontrol or supervision over the manner in whic h the bending of bars was c arried out at the fac tory site. Subsequently, on 4 June 2004, Rasan added Hao Wei as the sec ond defendant in his suit. 

10     TSSC did not appear at the trial on 10 January 2007 and interloc utory judgment was entered against it with damages to be assessed. The trial thus foc ussed solely on Hao Wei’s liability to Rasan for the injuries suffered as a result of the industrial ac c ident. 

11     DJ Wong held that Hao Wei was liable to Rasan bec ause it had not provided him with a safe system of work and had not ensured that there was proper supervision of his work. Interloc utory judgment was entered against Hao Wei, with damages to be assessed by the Deputy Registrar. 

12     Hao Wei then appealed against the dec ision of DJ Wong. 

**The appeal** 

13     The c ourt was informed that a dec ision on this appeal would be useful as it will shed light on the duties of employers who deploy their workers at various work sites to undertake a variety of tasks. 

14     Whether an employee is hired for a partic ular job at a spec ified plac e or to handle a variety of tasks at different plac es, the employer’s c ommon law duty of c are towards the employee c annot be overlooked. Suc h a duty, as laid down by the House of Lords in _Wilsons and Clyde Coal Co Ltd v English_ [1938] AC 57 (“ _Wilsons and Clyde_ ”), involves taking reasonable c are to provide c ompetent staff, adequate material, a proper system of work and effec tive supervision. 

15     In _Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1999] 4 SLR 579</span> (“ _Parno_ ”), Chao Hic k Tin JA (“Chao JA”), who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, endorsed the position adopted in _Wilsons and Clyde_ 


and added as follows at [46]: 

 [T]he employer must devise a suitable system and instruc t his men in what they must do: See Pape v Cumbria County Council [1992] 3 All ER 211. In devising a safe system, the employer should be aware that workmen are often c areless for their own safety, and his system must, as far as possible, reduc e the effec ts of an employee’s own c arelessness: see General Cleaning Contractors Ltd v Christmas [1953] AC 180 ... per Lord Reid. The employer must also take reasonable c are to ensure that his system is c omplied with, but he is not obliged ‘to stand over workmen of age and experienc e at every moment they are working ... to see that they do what they are supposed to do’: see Woods v Durable Suites Ltd ... [1953] 1 WLR 857 ... per Singleton LJ. 

16     Hao Wei asserted that DJ Wong had erred in holding that it had failed to provide a safe system of work and effec tive supervision. It c laimed that it had no c ontrol over the worksite at the fac tory and that the system of work was set up by TSSC. Evidently, Hao Wei sought to exonerate itself by shifting the blame for the ac c ident to TSSC but what c annot be overlooked was that Hao Wei was required under its c ontrac t with TSSC to provide the nec essary supervision for the proper exec ution and c ompletion of the tasks entrusted to it. More importantly, an employer’s obligation to take reasonable c are to provide a safe system of work is non-delegable in a spec ial sense. In _McDermid v Nash Dredging & Reclamation Co Ltd_ [1987] AC 906 (“ _McDermid_ ”), Lord Hailsham explained at p 910 that this “spec ial sense does not involve the proposition that the duty c annot be delegated ... but only that the employer c annot esc ape liability if the duty has been delegated and then not properly performed”. _McDermid_ was followed by the Court of Appeal in _The “Lotus M (No 2)”_ <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 145</span>. Karthigesu JA, who delivered the judgment of the Court, stated at [30] and [32] as follows: 

30     We c annot emphasise too strongly that the duty to take reasonable c are to provide a safe system of work rests on the employer and that it is non-delegable. This was made c lear by the two Law Lords who delivered the only speec hes in _McDermid...._ 

32     This law is free from all doubt. 

17     It should also be noted that an employer who deploys his employee to c arry out assorted tasks at various plac es should be espec ially c areful when the task at hand is not one whic h has previously been undertaken by the employee. In _Parno_ ( _supra_ [15]), Chao JA reiterated at [48] that an employer is responsible for the instruc tion of apprentic es and inexperienc ed workers. Before he was sent to the fac tory to work, Rasan had only been asked to do gardening and c onstruc tion work. As suc h, Hao Wei should have ensured that Rasan was properly instruc ted as to what was expec ted of him at the fac tory and that he was adequately supervised. It was rather startling that when c ross-examined, Hao Wei’s direc tor, Sufiah, admitted that she was aware of the dangers at the fac tory and that she had not warned her c ompany’s employees, inc luding Rasan, about these dangers. 

17     As there was thus no doubt that Hao Wei did not have a safe system of work and did not properly supervise its employees, its appeal was dismissed with c osts.
