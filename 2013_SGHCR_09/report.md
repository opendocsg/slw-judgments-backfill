**Introduction** 

1       The Applic ants, Sarawak Timber Industry Development Corporation and State Financ ial Sec retary Inc orporated, took out an applic ation _vide_ Originating Summons 1075/2012 (“OS 1075”) to register an order of c ourt dated 31 May 2007 obtained in the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak under the Rec iproc al Enforc ement of Commonwealth Judgments Ac t (Cap 264, 1985 Rev Ed) (“RECJA”). The _ex parte_ applic ation was granted on 15 November 2012 (“the Registration Order”). 

2       The Respondent, Asia Pulp & Paper Company Limited (“APP”), subsequently took out Summons No 6372/2012 (“SUM 6372”) to set aside the Registration Order and the c osts order made pursuant to it on two grounds: (a) the relevant order of c ourt was not a “judgment” within the definition of s 2(1) of the RECJA; and (b) the Applic ants had taken out the registration applic ation after the expiry of the 12 month time limit presc ribed in s 3(1) of the RECJA, and there was no good reason for any longer time to be allowed by the Court. 

**_Background facts_** 

_Relationship between the Applicants and APP_ 

3       The Applic ants, APP and Borneo Pulp Plantation Sdn Bhd were shareholders of Borneo Pulp & Paper Sdn Bhd (“BPP”), a Malaysian c ompany inc orporated in 1996. 

4       A dispute arose between parties when new shares at the pric e of RM 1 per share were allotted and issued by BPP to its shareholders sometime in May 2000. The dispute pertained to 117 million shares issued to APP whic h remain unpaid to date. 

_The proceedings in Malaysia_ 

5       By way of an order made in Companies (Winding Up) No 28-27-2002 III(I) (“CWU 28-27”) in 


 (a) 

 (b) 

 (c ) 

 (d) 

2002, BPP was ordered to be wound up and one Mr Yew Fooi was appointed as liquidator thereof (“the Liquidator”). 

(1) The SIC 2003 

6       On 5 Dec ember 2003, the Liquidator filed a Summons in Chambers applic ation in CWU 28(“SIC 2003”). The SIC 2003 sought leave to make a c all on APP for the sum of RM 117m, and in the event of APP’s failure to settle the said amount, the Liquidator be at liberty to c harge interest at the rate of 4% per annum from the date of judgment to the date of payment. 

(2) The Liquidator’s Final Report 

7       On 25 August 2005, the Liquidator issued his final report in respec t of the liquidation of BPP (“the Final Report”). The Final Report inc luded the following pertinent information: 

 BPP had repaid its c reditors in full; 

 There was a surplus of RM 41,821,029 whic h would be returned to BPP’s c ontributories, with APP’s share in respec t of the surplus being RM 25,092,617; 

 BPP owed APP a sum of RM 75,083,515; and 

 APP was entitled to a c redit sum of RM 100,176,132 from BPP ( ie , the sum total of items (b) and (c ) above). 

8       In his Final Report, the Liquidator opined that a setting-off exerc ise may be c onduc ted between BPP and APP, _viz_ , the RM 117m owing from APP to BPP for the unpaid shares may be set off against the sum of RM 100,176,132 whic h was due from BPP to APP. He was also of the view that the remainder of RM 16,823,868 may then be pursued by the Applic ants in their c apac ities as c ontributories against APP, in proportion to their respec tive interests in BPP. The Liquidator took the view that the liquidation proc ess would be shortened through this exerc ise. 

(3) The NOM 2005 

9       The Liquidator took out a Notic e of Motion in CWU 28-27 on 30 August 2005 (“NOM 2005”) for leave to make a c all on APP in the sum of RM 117m, with c onsequential direc tions that the said sum be subjec t to a notional set off of RM 100,176,132 and for the Liquidator’s right of enforc ement of the balanc e RM 16,823,868 be wholly and absolutely assigned to the Applic ants. 

10     The NOM 2005 also sought the c onsequential orders for the Liquidator’s release and for books and rec ords of BPP to be destroyed. 

(4) The SIC and NOM orders 

11     On 31 May 2007, both the SIC 2003 and NOM 2005 c ame up for hearing before Justic e Datuk Clement Skinner who granted the applic ations. It should be noted that c ounsel for the Liquidator, APP 


## (1) 

 (a) 

 (b) 

## (2) 

## (3) 

## (4) 

 Contributory Amount (RM) 

 STIDC 12,641, 

 SFS 4,182, 

and the Applic ants were all present at the hearing before Skinner J. 

12     The order made in respec t of the SIC 2003 (“the SIC order”) read: 

## ORDER 

 ... IT IS ORDERED that leave be granted to [the Liquidator] to make a c all on [APP]...for the total amount of RM 117,000,000.00 and that in the event of failure by [APP] to settle the amount of RM 117,000,000.00 within 30 days of the c all issued by [the Liquidator], the said Liquidator be at liberty to c harge [APP] interest at the rate of 4% per annum from the date of judgment to the date of full payment... 

13     The order made pursuant to the NOM 2005 (“the NOM order”) was as follows: 

## ORDER 

 ... IT IS ORDERED that the prayers in the [NOM 2005] are hereby granted in consequence of this Honourable Court granting leave for the [L]iquidator to make a call on [APP] for the sum of RM 117,000,000 under the [SIC 2003] in this matter as follows: 

 that leave be and is hereby granted for the [L]iquidator to make a c all on the unpaid c apital of [BPP] for the sum of RM 117,000,000.00 with c onsequential direc tions and/or orders that: 

- 

 for the purposes of adjusting BPP’s c ontributories rights, the sum of RM 117,000,000 be set off against a notional sum of RM 100,176,132; 

 that the rights of enforc ement of the balanc e of RM 16,823,868 be wholly and absolutely assigned to [BPP’s] other c ontributories, Sarawak Timber Industry Development Corporation (“STIDC”) and State Financ ial Sec retary Inc orporated (“SFS”) [ ie , the Applic ants] respec tively in the following proportions:

 the liquidation c osts and expenses as well as the Liquidator’s remuneration...be approved; 

 that c onsequent to the direc tions given on prayers (1) and (2) above, the said Liquidator be released and disc harged and/or [BPP] be dissolved; and 

 that subsequent to the order for release and/or dissolution, the books and rec ords of [BPP] be destroyed within three (3) months from the date of suc h release and/or dissolution. 

 ... 


 [emphasis added] 

14     Notably, OS 1075 sought to register only paragraph 1 of the NOM order. 

**The issues raised in SUM 6372** 

**_Issue I: Whether paragraph 1 of the NOM order is a “judgment”_** 

_The approach in ascertaining the nature of a foreign judgment_ 

15     Sec tion 2(1) of the RECJA defines “judgment” as: 

 ... any judgment or order given or made by a c ourt in any c ivil proc eedings, whether before or after the passing of this Ac t, whereby any sum of money is made payable , and inc ludes an award in proc eedings on an arbitration if the award has, in pursuanc e of the law in forc e in the plac e where it was made, bec ome enforc eable in the same manner as a judgment given by a c ourt in that plac e... [emphasis added] 

Simply put, the judgment of the original c ourt ( _ie_ , the c ourt by whic h the judgment was given) has to be in the nature of a “money judgment” for it to qualify for registration under the RECJA. 

16     In c onstruing whether paragraph 1 of the NOM order falls under the definition in s 2(1) of the RECJA, Ms Wendy Lin (“Ms Lin”), c ounsel for the Applic ants, referred to the dec ision of _Poh Soon Kiat v Desert Palace Inc (trading as Caesars Palace)_ <span class="citation">[2010] 1 SLR 1129</span> (“ _Poh Soon Kiat_ ”) where the Court of Appeal sc rutinised the c ause papers filed in the foreign proc eedings in order to asc ertain the true nature of the foreign judgment (at [27]–[28] of _Poh Soon Kiat_ ). Based on this dec ision, Ms Lin submitted that the Court is entitled to look beyond paragraph 1 of the NOM order and peruse the relevant materials in CWU 28-27 (inc luding the SIC order and the written judgment by Skinner J) to determine its nature. 

17     Counsel for APP, Mr Adrian Tan (“Mr Tan”), initially advoc ated a restric tive approac h in reading paragraph 1 of the NOM order and went so far as to urge the Court to “read [the NOM order] in isolation as it is the only judgment that is registered”. However, given the dec ision of _Poh Soon Kiat_ , Mr Tan revised his position and submitted that while the Court is entitled to look into the c ause papers filed under CWU 28-27 and the SIC order, the Court should do so with some measure of c aution. 

18     Although _Poh Soon Kiat_ pertained to a c ommon law ac tion for the enforc ement of a foreign judgment, I am of the view that the same approac h may be employed with regard to registration applic ations made under the RECJA given that the RECJA was enac ted as a fac ilitative instrument to allow judgments and awards of Commonwealth jurisdic tions to be enforc ed in Singapore. Thus, referenc e may be made to the relevant materials under CWU 28-27 to asc ertain whether paragraph 1 of the NOM order is a “judgment” within the definition of s 2(1) of the RECJA. 

_Parties’ interpretations of the NOM order_ 

19     Parties advanc ed opposite views in their interpretations of the NOM order. In this regard, APP raised the following arguments: 

 (a) Paragraph 1 of the NOM order only granted leave to the Liquidator to make a call on APP and for c ertain enforc ement rights of the Liquidator to be assigned to the Applic ants; 


 (b) The NOM order did not inc lude a payment order against APP (see [24] below); 

 (c ) Until a c all was made by the Liquidator, there was no debt payable from APP to the Liquidator or any other party; and 

 (d) If the c all was properly made on APP, it was open to the Applic ants to bring an ac tion against APP in Malaysia and to then seek to register in Singapore any suc h judgment obtained by them. 

20     The Applic ants’ main planks of submissions in resisting the setting aside applic ation were as below: 

 (a) The SIC order inc luded a payment order against APP in favour of the Applic ants, by operation of the SIC and NOM orders (“alleged payment order”) (see [24] below); 

 (b) A holistic reading of the c ause papers filed under CWU 28-27, the SIC order, the written judgment of Skinner J, and the NOM order would show the true intention of Skinner J, viz , Skinner J did not envisage the need for further steps to be taken by the Applic ants after the assignment of the Liquidator’s enforc ement rights to them; and 

 (c ) Similarly, an analysis of the postNOM order events, ( eg , the release of the Liquidator and the destruc tion of BPP’s book and rec ords), would show that Skinner J did not intend the Applic ants to c ommenc e a separate suit for rec overy against APP. Otherwise, parties would run into diffic ulties in bringing or defending suc h an ac tion as the main sourc e, ie , BPP’s books and rec ords, would have been destroyed. 

**_Decision on Issue I_** 

_Determination of the nature of the judgment – date of judgment or date of registration_ 

21     It is c lear that a c ontributory’s liability to pay for unpaid c apital does not bec ome due and 

payable until a c all is made: see Andrew Keay, _McPherson’s Law of Company Liquidation_ , 2nd Ed at para 10.019. This position is also enc apsulated in s 215 of the Companies Ac t 1965 (Ac t 125) (Malaysia) whic h stipulates that “[t]he liability of a c ontributory shall c reate a debt ac c ruing from him at the time when his liability c ommenc ed but payable at the times when c alls are made for enforc ing the liability”. 

22     In the present c ase, the deponent of the affidavit filed in support of OS 1075 highlighted the fac t that subsequent to the NOM order, the Liquidator _did_ make a c all on APP: 

 19 I am advised and do believe that under Malaysian law, [paragraph 1] of the [NOM order] would be c onsidered to be an order/judgment whereby the sums of RM 12,641,765 and RM 4,182,103 are payable by APP to STIDC and SFS respectively, upon the Liquidator making the call on APP for the said sum of RM 117,000,000. Such a call was made by the Liquidator on 13 August 2007 and was duly served on APP on 16 August 2007. 

 ... 

 21 Despite the Liquidator having made the c all on 13 August 2007 and having served the same on APP on 16 August 2007, and despite APP’s failure to set aside the [NOM order] on appeal, APP has to-date, not made any payment to [the Applic ants]. 


 22 In the c irc umstanc es, I am advised and do believe that paragraph 1 of the [NOM order] c an be enforc ed under the RECJA, as it is an order made by a superior c ourt of Malaysia in c ivil proc eedings, whereby a sum of money is made payable – in this case, RM 12,641,765 to STDIC and RM 4,182,103 to SFS. 

 [emphasis added] 

23     It is c orrec t that APP’s liability to pay c rystallised at the time the c all was made. However, it should be noted that the NOM order _preceded_ the c all. In this c onnec tion, I would state that the nature of the judgment _(ie_ , whether it is a money judgment or otherwise) should be asc ertained as at the date the judgment was made by the original c ourt. I do not think that the intervening event ( _ie_ , the c all) between the making of the NOM order and the filing of OS 1075, transformed the NOM order into a “money judgment”. As APP’s liability to pay the Applic ants did not arise with the making of the NOM order but rather, with the making of the c all by the Liquidator, it would appear that the NOM order itself is not a “judgment” for the purposes of registration under the RECJA. 

_Whether a payment order was built into the SIC order_ 

24     It is therefore unsurprising that Ms Lin sought to persuade the Court that the SIC order c ontained, in substanc e, an alleged payment order albeit with some variation from the wordings in Form 48 of the Companies (Winding Up) Rules 1972 (Malaysia) (“Form 48”). Mr Tan c onc eded that the relevant wordings in Form 48 would have given rise to APP’s liability to pay to the Applic ants, had it been inc orporated in the SIC order and/or the NOM order. 

25     The relevant wordings in Form 48 are as below: 

 It is ordered that leave be given to the (Offic ial Assignee) and liquidator to make a c all of $...per share on all the c ontributories of the said c ompany... 

 And it is ordered that each such contributory do, on or before the...day...of...,19..., pay to the (Official Assignee and) liquidator of the...company, the amount which will be due from him or her in respect of such call. 

 [emphasis added] 

26     The alleged payment order in the SIC order reads: 

 It is ordered that leave be granted to [the Liquidator] to make c all on [APP] for the amount of RM 117m and that in the event of failure by [APP] to settle the amount of RM 117m within 30 days of the call issued by [the Liquidator], the said Liquidator is at liberty to charge [APP] interest at the rate of 4% per annum from the date of judgment to the date of payment ... 

 [emphasis added] 

27     A c omparison between Form 48 and the alleged payment order would show that they are in fac t dissimilar, both in form and in substanc e. The payment order in Form 48 speaks expressly of the c ontributory’s obligation to pay a c ertain amount to the liquidator of the c ompany within a spec ified time frame. In stark c ontrast, the alleged payment order in the SIC order refers to the Liquidator’s right to c harge interest in the event of non-payment by APP upon a c all being made from the date of judgment to the date of payment. Read in this light, the latter would appear to be more akin to an award of interest on judgment than to a payment order. 


28     Even taking Ms Lin’s argument at its highest, that the SIC order gave rise to APP’s liability to pay by virtue of the alleged payment order, the Applic ants would still run into diffic ulties in demonstrating that the liability is owed to them_._ Notably, the Liquidator’s right to c harge interest was not assigned to the Applic ants as the NOM order is limited to the assignment of the Liquidator’s rights to the Applic ants to enforc e the balanc e of RM 16,823,868 (in proportion to their respec tive interests) and nothing more (see [13] above). 

29     I therefore disagree with Ms Lin’s submissions that the SIC order inc luded a payment order whic h gave rise to APP’s liability to pay the Applic ants. 

_The alleged “true intention” of the original court_ 

30     As for the Applic ants’ argument that Skinner J’s “true intention” was to negate the need for the Applic ants to c ommenc e a suit against APP for rec overy (see [20] above), I find it untenable as: 

 (a) The written judgment by Skinner J was c onfined to addressing the objec tions raised by APP in respec t of the SIC 2003, viz , defec tive servic e, an alleged bad faith on the part of the Liquidator, and APP’s alleged entitlement to a c omplete set off in respec t of the unpaid c apital; and 

 (b) The wordings of the SIC and NOM orders speak for themselves and do not bear out what the Applic ants seek to c ontend. Further, any potential diffic ulty whic h might arise from the operation of these two orders ( eg , the destruc tion of BPP’s books and rec ords) c ould have been brought to Skinner J’s attention as parties were represented at the hearing (at [11] above). 

31     As the role of the registering c ourt is largely administrative in nature, I am of the view that it is unsatisfac tory to rely on post-judgment events to justify or even rationalise the “intended effec t” of the judgment made by the original c ourt. In suc h situation, the registering c ourt should be slow (or even dec line) to engage in suc h an exerc ise. I would reiterate that the main func tion of the registering c ourt is to determine (by applying the _Poh Soon Kiat_ approac h) whether the judgment in question is one whic h fulfils the requirements under the relevant provisions of the RECJA and the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). 

32     It is undisputed that the Applic ants c an enforc e the NOM order in Malaysia, see para 9 of the affidavit filed by the Applic ants’ expert, Mr Leong Wai Hong. Although Ms Lin raised the potential time bar issue fac ed by the Applic ants in Malaysia, this argument is irrelevant to the Court’s determination on whether paragraph 1 of the NOM order c ould be registered under the RECJA. 

33     As the Applic ants have failed to demonstrate that paragraph 1 of the NOM order (read together with the relevant materials in CWU 28-27) gave rise to APP’s liability to pay the Applic ants, I find that it is not a “judgment” within the definition of s 2(1) of the RECJA. Therefore, I will set aside my earlier Registration Order and the c osts order made pursuant to it. 

**_Issue II: Whether the Applicants should have taken out a formal application for extension of time for OS 1075_** 

34     Given my dec ision that paragraph 1 of the NOM order is not a “judgment” for the purposes of RECJA, it is not stric tly nec essary for me to deal with APP’s arguments regarding the Applic ants’ “delay” in applying for registration. However, as Mr Tan argued that s 3(1) of the RECJA presc ribed (presumably, implic itly) the need to take out an applic ation for extension of time in the event the time limit of 12 months is exc eeded, I will deal with this argument briefly. 


**_Decision on Issue II_** 

35     Sec tion 3(1) of the RECJA states: 

 Registration in Singapore of judgments obtained in superior courts in the United Kingdom 

 3—(1) Where a judgment has been obtained in a superior c ourt of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland the judgment c reditor may apply to the High Court at any time within 12 months after the date of the judgment, or such longer period as may be allowed by the Court , to have the judgment registered in the Court, and on any suc h applic ation the High Court may, if in all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase it thinks it is just and c onvenient that the judgment should be enforc ed in Singapore, and subjec t to this sec tion, order the judgment to be registered ac c ordingly. 

 [emphasis added] 

36     Order 67 of the ROC whic h sets out the proc edure for rec iproc al enforc ement of foreign or Commonwealth judgments is also silent on whether or when an applic ation for an extension of time should be taken out after the expiry of the 12 month period. 

37     In my view, the timeline presc ribed for a registration applic ation is, in a way, an open-ended one as it may be for “suc h longer period as may be allowed by the Court”. The lac k of stipulated “deadline” in the RECJA and/or the ROC, however, should not be taken as a _carte blanche_ for nonc halant applic ants to only apply for registration as and when they please. 

38     As a matter of good prac tic e, where a registration applic ation is taken out more than 12 months from the date of judgment, the deponent should in the affidavit in support provide reasonable explanation to ac c ount for the delay. It is then for the c ourt to dec ide whether, in the interests of justic e, the applic ation should be granted despite the late registration. As noted by the Court of Appeal i _n Westacre Investments Inc v The State-Owned Company Yugoimport SDPR (also known as Jugoimport-SDPR)_ <span class="citation">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 166</span> at [24]: 

 [W]hen fac ed with a late RECJA applic ation involving a delay whic h is not substantial..., it is plainly inc umbent on the c ourt to c onsider all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase – as mandated by s 3(1) of the RECJA – in determining whether it would be just and c onvenient to enforc e the Commonwealth judgment in Singapore. 

39     I observe that in OS 1075, the supporting affidavit did provide reasons to explain why the registration applic ation was only taken out almost five years after the NOM order was obtained. 

40     Given my views above, I disagree with Mr Tan’s submission that under the framework of the RECJA, a formal applic ation to extend time is needed whenever an applic ant seeks to register a judgment 12 months after it was made. 

**Conclusion** 

41     For the reasons set out above, I allow APP’s applic ation and set aside the Registration Order and c osts order made in OS 1075. 

42     I will now hear parties on c osts.
