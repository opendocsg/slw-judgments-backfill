**Introduction** 

1       The plaintiff, who was the direc tor of Realm Capital Limited (“Realm Capital”), had applied in Originating Summons (Bankruptc y) No 15 of 2015 (“OSB 15”) to set aside a statutory demand dated 14 Oc tober 2014 for a sum of $2,209,863.01 (“the SD”) whic h was served on him through his solic itors on 15 Oc tober 2014. Prior to OSB 15, the defendant had c ommenc ed bankruptc y proc eedings against the plaintiff in Originating Summons (Bankruptc y) No 2552 of 2014 (OSB 2552). 

2       In OSB 15, the plaintiff applied for (a) an extension of time to make the applic ation to set aside the SD issued against him; (b) the SD to be set aside; and (c ) alternatively, that the SD be dec lared manifestly irregular, invalid, null and void and of no effec t. The assistant registrar dismissed the plaintiff’s applic ation in OSB 15. The plaintiff appealed and the matter c ame before me. After hearing the parties, I dismissed the appeal. As the plaintiff has filed an appeal against my dec ision, I now give my reasons. 

**Extension of time to set aside the SD** 

3       Under r 97(1)( _a_ ) of the Bankruptc y Rules (Cap 20, s 166, 2006 Rev Ed), the plaintiff had 14 days from the date on whic h the SD was served to apply to c ourt to set aside the SD. The SD was served on 15 Oc tober 2015 (the plaintiff disputed that this was valid servic e but this was irrelevant to the immediate issue at hand) whic h meant that an applic ation to set aside the SD had to be made by end Oc tober 2014. The plaintiff filed OSB 15 on 24 February 2015. This was almost 4 months out of time. However, under r 97(3), the c ourt was empowered to grant an extension of time to a debtor to make his applic ation to set aside a statutory demand. 

4       In _Rafat Ali Rizvi v Ing Bank NV Hong Kong Branch_ <span class="citation">[2011] SGHC 114</span>, Kan Ting Chiu J provided t he following four fac tors that the c ourt would have to take into c onsideration when an applic ation for an extension of time was made by a debtor: (a) the period of the delay; (b) the reasons for the delay; the grounds for setting aside the statutory demand; and (d) the prejudic e that might result from an extension of time (at [32]). The weightage of eac h fac tor was not c ast in stone but was fac t 


dependent. In that c ase, Kan J noted that a delay of eight days was quite long and the reasons provided for the delay were not strong. Nevertheless, the extension was granted sinc e the plaintiff had presented a good c ase that the statutory demand should be set aside for non-c omplianc e with s 61(1)( _d_ ) of the Bankruptc y Ac t (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) and the extension would not have prejudic ed the defendant. 

5       In _Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd v Ravichandran s/o Suppiah_ <span class="citation">[2015] SGHC 1</span>, Aedit Abdullah JC held that a delay of about a year did not disqualify the defendant from making an attempt at setting aside the statutory demand. In that c ase, the defendant had been ac ting in person for a substantial period of that delay. 

6       In _Thu Aung Zaw v Norb Creative Studio_ <span class="citation">[2014] SGHC 67</span>, the plaintiff’s applic ation was made more than four months out time and no separate applic ation for an extension of time was made. Despite this, Lee Seiu Kin J waived the proc edural irregularity of the plaintiff and permitted the applic ation to set aside the statutory demand. The c ourt was of the opinion that there was no substantial injustic e or prejudic e suffered by the defendant as a c onsequenc e of the irregularity. The c ourt then dispensed with the applic ation for an extension of time and proc eeded to hear the applic ation. It thus seemed to me that the threshold to grant an applic ation for an extension of time to a debtor to make his applic ation to set aside a statutory demand was not a partic ularly high one. 

7       In this c ase, there was a substantial delay of about four months. The plaintiff was represented during this time but c laimed that he was not satisfied with the servic es provided by his solic itors at t ha t time. The plaintiff then disc harged his solic itors and ac ted in person after that. He further c laimed that he only rec eived the doc uments pertaining to his bankruptc y proc eedings on 17 February 

2015\. I did not find this to be a suffic ient reason to ac c ount for the delay. Counsel for the defendant pointed out that the plaintiff’s solic itors had appeared at the first hearing of OSB 2552 on 22 January 

2015\. At that hearing, the plaintiff was granted an adjournment as he, through his solic itors, had expressed an intention to make a settlement offer to the defendant. The defendant did not ac c ept the offer. This showed that the plaintiff was well aware of the ongoing bankruptc y proc eedings against him following the servic e of the SD. 

8       However, the defendant did not point to any prejudic e suffered by him as a result of the delay. Moreover, one ground relied on the plaintiff to set aside the SD was that servic e of the SD was irregular. This c ould have had an impac t on the applic ation for extension of time sinc e it was potentially arguable that r 97(1) of the Bankruptc y Rules proc eeded on the assumption that servic e of the SD was valid. I therefore proc eeded to hear the substantive merits of the plaintiff applic ation to set aside the SD. In any event, I found that the plaintiff’s applic ation to set aside the SD was without any merit. Therefore, the granting of the extension was not material to my dec ision. 

**The plaintiff’s arguments to set aside the SD** 

**_First argument: service of the SD was not valid_** 

9       The plaintiff c laimed that the defendant had failed to effec t personal servic e of the SD as required by r 96(2) of the Bankruptc y Rules. The defendant did not deny that no personal servic e was effec ted on the plaintiff. The SD was served on the plaintiff’s solic itors (at that time). In a letter dated 3 Oc tober 2014, the defendant’s solic itors wrote to the plaintiff’s solic itors asking whether they h a d instruc tions to ac c ept servic e of proc ess (inc luding servic e of statutory demands) on the plaintiff’s behalf. The plaintiff’s solic itors replied that they had instruc tions to ac c ept servic e on behalf of the plaintiff. 


10     In _Re Rasmachayana Sulistyo (alias Chang Whe Ming), ex parte The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd and other appeals_ <span class="citation">[2005] 1 SLR(R) 483</span> (“ _Re Rasmachayana_ ”), V K Rajah J (as he then was) said: 

 10 The requirements for servic e of the statutory demand are c irc umsc ribed by pragmatism and not by an overtly [ sic ] rigid and tec hnic al approac h. The emphasis is c learly on the reasonableness of the steps being taken to bring to the debtor's attention the existenc e of the relevant statutory demand. ... 

 ... 

 20 ... There is nothing in the [Bankruptc y Rules] or [Bankruptc y Ac t] pointing to the existenc e of a legislative sc heme for an exc lusive c ode of proc edure for personal servic e. More importantly, there is nothing in the [Bankruptc y Rules] that prec ludes or militates against c onsensual arrangements for servic e of proc esses. In my view, the freedom to c ontrac t should not be fettered unless there is a c lear c ontrary indic ation from the language used or from the purport of the relevant legislative provisions and/or underpinning public interest c onsiderations. ... 

 21 ... [T]here are no apparent underpinning or overriding polic y reasons why a debtor c annot agree to have the various bankruptc y proc esses effec ted on him in a partic ular or pec uliar manner that is agreeable and/or c onvenient to both him and the c reditor. Financ ial institutions frequently deal with foreign debtors and it is sometimes wholly imprac tic al and extremely c ostly for attempts to be made for servic e through a foreign judic ial proc ess. However, imprac tic ality or diffic ulties per se c annot be a lic ense to obviate a mandatory statutory sc heme or polic y. The c rux of the matter really is whether parties c an c ontrac tually agree on alternative modalities of servic e. 

 [emphasis in original] 

11     In _Wong Kwei Cheong v ABN-AMRO Bank NV_ <span class="citation">[2002] 2 SLR(R) 31</span> (“ _Wong Kwei Cheong_ ”), S Rajendran J ac c epted a suggestion by c ounsel that the bank c ould have c omplied with r 96(1) of the Bankruptc y Rules by notifying the debtor’s solic itors of the statutory demand and inquiring whether they would ac c ept servic e on behalf of the debtor (at [14]). Both _Re Rasmachayana_ and _Wong Kwei Cheong_ showed that servic e through the debtor’s solic itors was suffic ient to c omply with r 96 of the Bankruptc y Rules if there was a prior arrangement that suc h a manner of servic e was agreeable to t he debtor. This was exac tly the situation in the present c ase where the plaintiff’s solic itors had c onfirmed that they had instruc tions to ac c ept servic e of proc ess on behalf of the plaintiff. Furthermore, the plaintiff did not make any allegation that his solic itors had falsely represented this information when the defendant’s solic itors spec ific ally asked the plaintiff’s solic itors whether they had instruc tions to ac c ept servic e of proc ess, inc luding but not limited to the servic e of statutory demands on behalf of their c lients. I therefore found that there was valid servic e of the SD under r 96 of the Bankruptc y Rules. 

**_Second argument: there was a genuine triable issue_** 

12     The plaintiff also c laimed that there was a dispute as to the debt whic h gave rise to a genuine triable issue. It was on this basis that the plaintiff c laimed that the SD should be set aside. 

13     Rule 98(2)( _b_ ) of the Bankruptc y Rules provided that the c ourt had to set aside a statutory demand if the debt was disputed on grounds whic h appeared to the c ourt to be substantial. Paragraph 144(3) of the Supreme Court Prac tic e Direc tions provided additional guidanc e on the matter 


by stating that the “Court [would] normally set aside the statutory demand if, in its opinion, on the evidenc e there was a _genuine triable issue_ ” (emphasis added). 

14     The Court of Appeal in _Mohd Zain bin Abdullah v Chimbusco International Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2014] 2 SLR 446</span> explained that the c ourt was not obliged to set aside a statutory demand where there was a genuine triable issue but it would only normally do so, and that “the c riterion of ‘grounds whic h appear to the c ourt to be substantial’ under r 98(2)( _b_ ) c onstitute[d] a higher threshold” (at [29]). The Court of Appeal further explained at [30]: 

 ... [I]t will not suffic e for a debtor to raise spurious allegations in order to fend off bankruptc y proc eedings. The c ourt must examine all the facts to asc ertain whether the “genuine triable issue” test in para 144 of the [Supreme Court] Prac tic e Direc tions is satisfied. The upshot of this is that the c ourt will only set aside a statutory demand (and thereby require a c reditor to initiate a c ivil suit if he wishes to pursue the c laimed debt further) where the debtor is able to adduc e evidenc e on affidavit that raises a genuine triable issue. [emphasis in original] 

15     The fac ts of the present c ase were not c omplex. The parties entered into a Deed of Settlement dated 4 September 2012 (“the Deed of Settlement”) whereby the defendant and Ever Tyc oon Limited (“Ever Tyc oon”) agreed to forbear (up till 1 Marc h 2013) from c ommenc ing legal proc eedings against, _inter alia_ , the plaintiff for an unpaid loan, whic h total sum was $4,000,000, in exc hange for the plaintiff paying $1,500,000 by 4 September 2012 and a further sum of $500,000 by 9 September 2012 (“the Settlement Payments”). The forbearanc e period was extended to May 2014 through three Supplemental Deeds. It was also not disputed that the plaintiff had made the Settlement Payments. 

16     Clause 1.1(ii) of the Deed of Settlement also provided that the aggregate liabilities and obligations of, _inter alia_ , the plaintiff towards the defendant and Ever Tyc oon after the Settlement Payments would not exc eed $2,000,000. This was referred to in the Deed of Settlement as the “Balanc e Princ ipal”. Under c l 1.3 of the Deed of Settlement, the plaintiff and defendant agreed to, “in good faith, seek to disc uss the reinvestment or settlement of the Balanc e Princ ipal [and] suc h disc ussions [were] to be c onc luded no later than 1 Marc h 2013”. The Supplemental Deeds extended this period of disc ussion up till 1 May 2014. Clause 2.4 of the third Supplemental Deed provided as follows: 

 For the avoidanc e of doubt and without prejudic e to Clauses 1.3 and 1.4 of the Deed of Settlement (as amended by the Supplemental Deed, 2 nd Supplemental Deed and this 3 rd Supplemental Deed), the Parties agree that in the event [the defendant] and [the plaintiff ] fail to c onc lude any reinvestment or settlement of the Balanc e Princ ipal by 1 May 2014 (or suc h later date as [the defendant] and Ever Tyc oon may agree in writing), [the plaintiff ] and Realm Capital shall jointly and/or severally forthwith pay to [the defendant] the Balanc e Princ ipal of S$2,000,000, in addition to all ac c rued interest thereof at the rate of 5% per annum on a simple, daily rest basis under Clause 1.4 of the Deed of Settlement (as amended by the Supplemental Deed, 2nd Supplemental Deed and this 3 rd Supplemental Deed) from 9 September 2012 until the date of full payment. In this regard, [the defendant] shall be at liberty to c laim against [the plaintiff ] and Realm Capital jointly and/or severally for payment of the Balanc e Princ ipal of S$2,000,000 (and ac c rued interest thereof ) in any manner and in his absolute disc retion under this c lause. 

17     The SD in this c ase was for the Balanc e Princ ipal of $2,000,000. The plaintiff argued that there was double c laiming by the defendant of the sum of $1,500,000 whic h was previously paid by the plaintiff. This ac c ording to the plaintiff raised a genuine triable issue. I did not agree. From the above, it was manifestly apparent that the SD was for a separate sum, whic h was the Balanc e Princ ipal. The 


$1,500,000 previously paid by the plaintiff was for the Settlement Payments. There was c learly no double c laiming. It was a spurious allegation raised by the plaintiff in a desperate attempt to fend off the bankruptc y proc eedings against him. There was no merit in this submission and I found that there was no dispute relating to the debt whic h was substantial under r 98(2)( _b_ ) of the Bankruptc y Rules. 

**_Third argument: details of the debt provided were insufficient_** 

18     It was a requirement under r 94(4)( _b_ ), that a statutory demand stated the c onsideration for the debt or if there was no c onsideration, the way in whic h the debt arose. If the debt was founded on grounds other than a judgment or an order of c ourt, the SD had to give suc h details as would enable to debtor to identify the debt. 

19     The plaintiff c laimed that insuffic ient details were provided bec ause the defendant failed to annex the doc uments relating to the debt to the SD. It was argued that in order to c onstitute suffic ient details, the Deed of Settlement under whic h the debt arose and other Supplemental Deeds relating to the debt and other personal guarantees had to be annexed to the SD. 

20     This argument was misc onc eived. Rule 94(4)( _b_ ) did not require that doc uments relating to the debt be attac hed. All it required was for details of the debt to be provided so that the debtor c ould identify the debt. The rationale behind this requirement was c lear. Failure to c omply with or set aside a statutory demand after 21 days of servic e of the statutory demand triggered a presumption under s 62 of the Bankruptc y Ac t that the debtor was unable to pay any debt within the meaning of s 61(1) ( _c_ ). In order to c omply with a statutory demand so that the presumption would not be triggered, a debtor had to be able to identify the debt. If not, he c ould not possibly be expec ted to c omply with a statutory demand. For this purpose to be ac hieved, the doc uments relating to the debt did not have to be attac hed if suffic ient details were provided in order for the debtor to identify the debt. 

21     In the present c ase, the SD stated that the debt arose from a loan granted by the defendant and Ever Tyc oon to the plaintiff and Realm Capital. The SD further provided the date of the Deed of Settlement entered into by the parties (4 September 2012) and the names of the parties to the Deed of Settlement (under whic h the c urrent debt arose). It even provided the dates of the Supplemental Deeds entered into and the date of the letter of demand made by the plaintiff and Ever Tyc oon Limited. It also provided the amount owing and the interest ac c rued on the princ ipal. It also explained how the ac c rued interest was c alc ulated based on the interest rate stipulated in c lause 1.4 of the Deed of Settlement. 

22     As the plaintiff had appended his signature as a party to the Deed of Settlement and all the three Supplemental Deeds, I expec ted the plaintiff to retain a c opy of these important doc uments after due exec ution by all the parties c onc erned. At the hearing before me, I asked the plaintiff, who was in person, whether he had a c opy of these doc uments. He c andidly admitted that he did have them. Ac c ordingly, there would be no question that he would have fully understood what the outstanding sum referred to in the SD was all about and how it arose, sinc e he would have been able to read the SD in c onjunc tion with the Deed of Settlement and the three Supplement Deeds that were in his possession at all times. In light of this, suffic ient details were c learly given to enable the plaintiff to identify the debt. I therefore found that the SD was in c omplianc e with r 94(4)( _b_ ) of the Bankruptc y Rules. 

**Conclusion** 

23     In c onc lusion, I found that (a) there was valid servic e of the SD under r 96 of the Bankruptc y Rules; (b) there was no genuine triable issue; and (c ) suffic ient details of the debt were provided in 


the SD to enable the plaintiff to identify the debt under r 94(4)( _b_ ) of the Bankruptc y Rules. As none of the plaintiff’s arguments had any substantive merits, I dismissed his appeal against the dec ision of the assistant registrar. 

24     After hearing the parties on c osts, I ordered that the plaintiff pay the defendant c osts (inc lusive of disbursements) fixed at $2,500.
