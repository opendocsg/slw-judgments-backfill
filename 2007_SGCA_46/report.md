**V K Rajah JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the court):** 

**Introduction** 

1       This was an applic ation for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against a dec ision of the High Court setting aside a domestic arbitration award. At the c onc lusion of the hearing, we dismissed the applic ation. These are our reasons for so ruling. In these grounds of dec ision, we examine the proc edural pre-requisites for appeals on questions of law to the c ourt in relation to domestic arbitration awards and, in partic ular, we c larify the very limited c irc umstanc es in whic h appeals pursuant to s 49 of the Arbitration Ac t (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”) may be pursued further to the Court of Appeal. 

**Background and procedural history** 

2       The applic ant/defendant, Dr How Kim Chuan (“Dr How”), and the respondents/plaintiffs were partners (in different c ombinations) in a number of dental prac tic es and a business that ran a dental laboratory. A dispute arose between the parties whic h led to Dr How issuing a notic e of retirement from the various partnerships. Subsequently, further differenc es and disputes arose and the parties agreed to refer these matters to an arbitrator. 

3       The arbitrator issued his written award in the arbitration proc eedings on 15 Marc h 2006 (“the Award”). Dissatisfied with the dec ision in relation to one of the partnerships, the Hougang partnership, the plaintiffs filed an originating summons on 11 April 2006, seeking leave to appeal on two questions of law whic h they c onsidered had arisen out of the Award. The judge granted them leave to appeal on only one of the questions they had raised. 


4       The same judge later allowed the appeal after having dec ided the question raised in favour of the plaintiffs. She varied the Award and ordered that the plaintiffs pay the defendant only the sum of $54,017.47 for the Hougang partnership, in substitution of the sum of $213,333.74 that the arbitrator had originally assessed as being due. The judge then remitted the question of c osts to the arbitrator for re-determination. For ease of referenc e, this dec ision of the judge will be referred to hereinafter as “the Dec ision”. 

5       The defendant subsequently filed Summons No 4825 of 2006 on 18 Oc tober 2006 seeking leave to appeal against the Dec ision to the Court of Appeal. Having regard to s 49(11) of the Ac t (whic h provides that the c ourt may give leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against a dec ision on an appeal from an arbitration award only if the question of law before it is one of general importanc e, or one whic h for some other spec ial reason should be c onsidered by the Court of Appeal) the summons set out a list of questions of law whic h c ounsel for the defendant c onsidered met the nec essary requirements. The summons was again heard by the same judge on 2 November 2006. 

6       In her judgment dated 6 Marc h 2007 (“the 6 Marc h dec ision”), the judge c onc luded that there was “no question of law of general importanc e to be brought before the Court of Appeal nor any spec ial reason to allow the questions framed on behalf of [Dr How] to go forward on appeal” (see _Ng Chin Siau v How Kim Chuan_ <span class="citation">[2007] 2 SLR 789</span> (“ _Ng Chin Siau_ ”) at [52]). Ac c ordingly, the applic ation was dismissed. Dissatisfied, the defendant then filed this applic ation and requested that it be heard by the Court of Appeal. 

7       Just prior to the hearing we invited c ounsel to make submissions on the following preliminary issues: 

 (a) whether an applic ation may be made direc tly to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal against a dec ision of the High Court on an appeal (against an arbitration award) under s 49(11) of the Ac t; and 

 (b) in any event, whether the present applic ation c ould have been brought despite the fac t that the High Court had already refused suc h leave to appeal. 

8       It appeared to us that there was some c onfusion amongst c ounsel as to the proper basis for this applic ation and the appropriate forum before whic h this applic ation ought to be heard. We noted that the plaintiffs’ solic itors, M/s Straits Law Prac tic e LLC (“SLP”) had written to the defendant’s solic itors, M/s Rodyk & Davidson LLP (“Rodyk”), on 27 Marc h 2007 expressing, _inter alia_ , their view that the applic able sec tions for an appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal would be ss 49(10) and 49(11) instead of s 49(7) of the Ac t as earlier indic ated by Rodyk. SLP suggested that sinc e leave to appeal had already been refused by the learned judge, the present summons ought to be fixed before the Court of Appeal (and not another High Court judge). Rodyk then wrote to the Registry on 5 April 2007 requesting that the summons be fixed for hearing before the Court of Appeal, stating that they had “no objec tions if the matter is refixed for hearing before the Court of Appeal”. 

9       Thus, it appears to us that c ounsel themselves had initially _agreed_ between themselves that the Court of Appeal had jurisdic tion to hear suc h an applic ation. We shall return to the implic ations of this “understanding” when we address the issue of c osts. For now, we turn to c onsider the respec tive positions of the parties, as re-defined by their final submissions on the jurisdic tional c onundrum we had identified for c ounsel: see [7] above. 

**The defendant’s position** 


1       0 Mr Lok Vi Ming SC (“Mr Lok”), who appeared for the defendant, c onfirmed that the defendant’s initial applic ation to the judge was made pursuant to s 49(11) of the Ac t. He c larified before us that, for the purposes of this applic ation, he was relying solely on s 49(7) of the Ac t as the basis for the applic ation to this c ourt. This was bec ause leave to appeal had been refused by the judge in the first instanc e. Mr Lok c ontended that s 49(7) of the Ac t provided a “further avenue of appeal to the defendant”. Sec tion 49(7) of the Ac t reads as follows: 

 The leave of the Court shall be required for any appeal from a dec ision of the Court under this sec tion to grant or refuse leave to appeal. 

Mr Lok dec lared that this was his position from the outset, _viz_ , that the applic ation c ould be made under s 49(7) of the Ac t (to the High Court) for leave to appeal against the 6 Marc h dec ision denying him leave to appeal. It was only after the plaintiffs’ solic itors had expressed their misgivings about this and suggested that the applic ation should instead be made pursuant to ss 49(10) and 49(11) of the Ac t, to the Court of Appeal, that they “reac hed a c onsensus” to have the matter fixed before us. 

11     Mr Lok further submitted that a “dec ision of the Court under this sec tion to grant or refuse leave” would inc lude the 6 Marc h dec ision wherein the learned judge refused to grant the defendant leave to appeal against the Dec ision. Ac c ording to Mr Lok, what it all boiled down to was this – that s 49(7) of the Ac t applied equally to two types of applic ations: 

 (a) the first was an applic ation for leave to appeal against the dec ision of the c ourt granting or refusing leave to appeal against an arbitration award – what he labelled as a “first-tier applic ation”; and 

 (b) the sec ond was an applic ation for leave to appeal against the dec ision of the c ourt granting or refusing leave to appeal against the decision of the Court on an appeal from an arbitration – a “sec ond-tier applic ation”. 

Purely for the sake of c onvenienc e, we shall also adopt this terminology. The applic ation made to this c ourt was therefore a sec ond-tier applic ation. 

12     At the heart of the defendant’s argument is an arid literal reading of s 49(7) of the Ac t. In this regard, Mr Lok invited the c ourt to ac c ept that it was a fundamental prec ept of statutory interpretation that the intended meaning of a statutory provision must be taken to punc tiliously c orrespond with the literal meaning. Ac c ordingly, Mr Lok argued that the literal meaning of the words “dec ision of the Court under this sec tion” would mean _any_ dec ision made pursuant to _any_ subsec tion of s 49 of the Ac t, thereby enc ompassing the 6 Marc h dec ision. 

13     In the c ourse of the hearing, Mr Lok developed this argument further. This was c learly bec ause he had by then realised that there remained one further major obstac le he had to surmount (even assuming that his literal interpretation of s 49(7) of the Ac t was ac c epted by the c ourt) in order to bring this applic ation before the Court of Appeal. Mr Lok rec ognised and fully ac c epted that the “Court” referred to in s 49(7) of the Ac t, and indeed wherever else employed in the Ac t, was defined in s 2(1) of the Ac t to mean the _High Court_ only. Therefore, even on the literal interpretation urged upon us, Mr Lok’s applic ation should be made before the High Court and not the Court of Appeal. 

14     In order to overc ome this seemingly insurmountable diffic ulty, Mr Lok then boldly turned to s 52 of the Ac t as a c rutc h. So far as it is material, s 52 of the Ac t reads: 


 Application for leave of Court, etc. 

**52.** —(1) An applic ation for the leave of the Court to appeal or an applic ation referred to in sec tion 21(10), 36(6) or 49(3)( _b_ ) or (7) shall be made in suc h manner as may be presc ribed in the Rules of Court. 

 ... 

 (3) For the purposes of this sec tion — 

 ( a ) an applic ation for leave of the Court may be heard and determined by a Judge in Chambers; and 

 ( b ) the Court of Appeal shall have the like powers and jurisdic tion on the hearing of suc h applic ations as the High Court or any Judge in Chambers has on the hearing of suc h applic ations. 

Mr Lok submitted that pursuant to s 52(3) of the Ac t, the Court of Appeal had the like powers and jurisdic tion as the High Court. This meant that onc e an applic ation was made to the High Court under s 49(7) of the Ac t, the Court of Appeal c ould thereafter hear that applic ation; this was the c ase here, ac c ording to Mr Lok, bec ause his initial applic ation was made pursuant to s 49(7) of the Ac t, and had been made to the High Court (albeit before an assistant registrar) on 15 Marc h 2007. 

**The plaintiffs’ position** 

15     The plaintiffs’ position was straightforward. After rec eiving our invitation to make further submissions on the jurisdic tional issue, SLP made a _volte-face_. It c ontended that no applic ation for leave c ould be made to the Court of Appeal and, in any event, the dec ision of the High Court refusing leave to appeal was final. 

16     Counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr N Sreenivasan (“Mr Sreenivasan”), relied on an English Court of Appeal dec ision that he submitted was on all fours in relation to the jurisdic tional issue we had to determine. In _Henry Boot Construction (UK) Ltd v Malmaison Hotel (Manchester) Ltd_ [2001] QB 388 (“ _Henry Boot_ ”), the English Court of Appeal, after c onstruing s 69(8) of the English Arbitration Ac t 1996 (c 23) (“the English Ac t”), c onc luded that it c ould not entertain an appeal unless the High Court gave leave, and furthermore c ould not review or otherwise rec onsider the High Court’s refusal to give leave. Mr Sreenivasan also drew the c ourt’s attention to the immediate predec essor of the c urrent s 49(11) of the Ac t, _ie_ , s 28(7) of the sinc e repealed Arbitration Ac t (Cap 10, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the repealed Ac t”), whic h provided as follows: 

 No appeal shall lie to the Court of Appeal from a dec ision of the c ourt on an appeal under this sec tion unless the c ourt or the Court of Appeal — 

 ( a ) gives leave; and 

 ( b ) c onsiders the question of law to whic h the dec ision relates either as one of general public importanc e or as one whic h for some other spec ial reason should be c onsidered by the Court of Appeal. 

 [emphasis added] 


Mr Sreenivasan submitted that the repealed provision made express referenc e to the Court of Appeal having the power to grant leave. This has, however, been deliberately omitted in the c urrent s 49 of the Ac t, thereby leading to the irresistible inferenc e that the restric tive English position on appeals had been c onsc iously adopted. He also helpfully pointed out that in the Law Reform and Revision Division, AttorneyGeneral’s Chambers, _The Review of Arbitration Laws – Final Report_ (LRRD No 3/2001, Marc h 2001) (“LRRD 3/2001”), a c omparative table (Table of Derivations) at Annex B (pp 91–95) showed c l 49 of the Arbitration Bill 2001 (now enac ted as s 49 of the Ac t) to be a modified derivative of s 69 of the English Ac t. 

17     At the hearing, after being apprised of Mr Lok’s relianc e on s 49(7) of the Ac t read with s 52 of the Ac t as the basis of his applic ation, Mr Sreenivasan submitted that a literal interpretation of s 49(7) of the Ac t was not plausible. This was bec ause it c ould potentially result in an endless string of leave applic ations under s 49(7) of the Ac t. Moreover, a literal interpretation would run c ounter to the general sc heme of s 49 of the Ac t, whic h he pointed out is c aptioned “Appeal against award”. By this, Mr Sreenivasan was alluding to the numerous referenc es to the term “appeal under this sec tion” whic h are to be found throughout s 49 of the Ac t. He argued that suc h a referenc e, whic h oc c urred for example in subss 49(3), 49(4) and 49(6) of the Ac t amongst others, was made spec ific ally in relation to an appeal against an arbitration award. This was c learly different from an appeal against a dec ision of the High Court. In short, s 49(7) of the Ac t did not apply to the present situation; it only applied to first-tier applic ations, _ie_ , dec isions in relation to leave to appeal against an arbitration award. 

18     Turning to s 52 of the Ac t, Mr Sreenivasan’s position was that s 52(3)( _b_ ) of the Ac t only applied to situations where there had been no determination by the c ourt on the merits of any partic ular c ase. What was c ontemplated in suc h situations was that first, an applic ation for leave to appeal against an arbitration award (under s 49(3)( _b_ ) of the Ac t) was turned down; this was followed by an applic ation for leave to appeal against suc h refusal under s 49(7) of the Ac t whic h was also unsuc c essful. In suc h a sc enario, Mr Sreenivasan submitted that s 52(3)( _b_ ) of the Ac t would apply, giving the Court of Appeal jurisdic tion to hear an applic ation for leave to appeal. The fundamental rationale underpinning suc h an interpretation was that there would have been, as it were, “no bite of the c herry” as yet. Ultimately, onc e the c ourt had heard the merits of an appeal against an arbitration award, s 49(7) of the Ac t was irrelevant; s 52 of the Ac t also did not offer any assistanc e in this regard. 

**Our decision** 

19     We begin by c onsidering briefly why an applic ation under s 49(11) of the Ac t for leave to appeal against a dec ision of the High Court in relation to an appeal on a question of law against an arbitration award c annot be brought to the Court of Appeal. That this was an applic ation under s 49(11) of the Ac t (as opposed to s 49(7) of the Ac t) was the position posited by both parties prior to our request for further submissions on this issue. Although this was ultimately abandoned by both the parties, we nevertheless think it is nec essary to restate why an applic ation under that provision does not lie to the Court of Appeal. We will then address the respec tive positions adopted by the parties in relation to an applic ation under s 49(7) of the Ac t. 

**_Application under section 49(11) of the Act_** 

20     The starting point of our analysis is the plain meaning of s 49(11) of the Ac t. When read with s 2(1) of the Ac t, whic h expressly states that the term “Court” when employed in the Ac t means the High Court, this plainly stipulates that leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against a dec ision on an appeal from an arbitration award, after satisfying either of the two requirements set out in s 49(11) of 


the Ac t ( _viz_ , that the question of law before it is one of general importanc e, or one whic h for some other spec ial reason should be c onsidered by the Court of Appeal) must be obtained from the _High Court_. 

21     A c omparison with the provisions of the Supreme Court of Judic ature Ac t (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) governing appeals to the Court of Appeal in, _inter alia_ , interloc utory matters is apposite. Sec tion 34(2) of the SCJA reads: 

 Matters that are non-appealable or appealable only with leave 

**34.** ―(1) ... 

 (2) Exc ept with the leave of the Court of Appeal or a Judge , no appeal shall be brought to the Court of Appeal in any of the following c ases: 

 ... 

 [emphasis added] 

The c orresponding provision in the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) is O 56 r 3(1) whic h reads: 

 Leave to appeal against order or judgment of Judge (O. 56, r. 3) 

**3.** ―(1) A party applying for leave under sec tion 34 of the Supreme Court of Judic ature Ac t (Chapter 322) to appeal against an order made, or a judgment given, by a Judge must file his applic ation — 

 ( a ) to the Judge within 7 days of the order or judgment; and 

 ( b ) in the event leave is refused by the Judge, to the Court of Appeal within 7 days of the refusal. 

 [emphasis added] 

It is c lear beyond peradventure that leave to appeal under the SCJA operates under a wholly different sc heme from that under the Ac t. First, the statutory arc hitec ture of the two sc hemes was drawn up differently. Whereas s 34(2) of the SCJA expressly provides that leave to appeal may be obtained from the _Court of Appeal or a Judge_ , s 49(11) of the Ac t merely stipulates that “[t]he Court may give leave to appeal” and it is c ommon ground that the “Court” here refers only to the High Court. 

22     The Rules also reflec t this differenc e in that O 56 r 3(1) of the Rules spec ific ally rec ognises and provides for the situation where leave to appeal is refused by the High Court whereupon an applic ation for leave to appeal may be filed to the Court of Appeal. The c orresponding provision in the Rules, in relation to arbitration proc eedings under the Ac t, _ie_ , O 69 r 8 of the Rules, only states that “[a]n applic ation under the Ac t for leave to appeal against a dec ision of the Court to the Court of Appeal must be made to the Court within 7 days of the dec ision of the Court”. Yet again, “Court” here is defined to mean the High Court: see O 1 r 4(2) of the Rules. These differenc es are plainly material and are not statutory slips between the c up and the lip as we shall now see. 

23     In 2002, the Law Reform and Revision Division (“LRRD”) of the Attorney General’s Chambers undertook a study of the existing Rules of Court to asc ertain if there were any amendments that were 


required to align the Rules of Court with the Ac t: see _Report on Review of Rules of Court Relating to Arbitration_ (LRRD No 2/2002, 23 January 2002) (“LRRD 2/2002”). LRRD 2/2002 was c onsidered by the Working Party on Rules of Court c haired by L P Thean JA. The LRRD’s _Review on Rules of Court Relating to Arbitration_ ( _Supplementary Report_ ) (LRRD No 6/2002, 7 May 2002) (“LRRD 6/2002”) sets out reasons for the main differenc es between the Rules that were approved and the draft rules drawn up (‘the draft Rules”). It is helpful to refer to LRRD 6/2002 for assistanc e in identifying and explaining the material c hanges from the draft Rules to the approved rules in relation to applic ations for leave to appeal under the Ac t. We set out the relevant portions in full, at paras 2.11–2.12: 

 Leave to appeal to Court of Appeal (Original Report para 3.18) 

 2.11 The draft Rules provided that an applic ation for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against a dec ision of the High Court must be made within 7 days of the dec ision of the High Court. In the event that leave is refused by the High Court, the applic ation for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal must be made to the Court of Appeal within 7 days of the refusal. 

 2. 1 2 To ensure that the Rules are not ultra vires the Act , the Working Party rec ommended that the relevant provision in the draft Rules be redrafted. As the relevant sections in the Act provide that leave of the High Court, and not the Court of Appeal, must be obtained in respect of applications to appeal against the decision of the High Court , [it was] rec ommended that the Rules provide that an applic ation for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against a dec ision of the High c ourt must be made to the High Court within 7 days of the dec ision of the High Court. 

 [emphasis added] 

It also bears mention that O 69 r 8 of the draft Rules was in fac t modelled upon O 56 r 3 of the Rules. 

24     It is c lear from the above report that the Working Party had also c onsidered the appeal sc heme in the Ac t: leave of the High Court, and not the Court of Appeal had to be obtained in suc h situations. More signific antly, the amendments expressly removed the provision that allowed for an applic ation for leave to appeal to be made to the Court of Appeal upon refusal of leave by the High Court. This was plainly a deliberate dec ision to ensure that the Rules were not _ultra vires_ the Ac t. This bac kground reinforc ed our view that the differenc e in wording between O 69 r 8 and O 56 r 3 of the Rules was deliberate and not merely stylistic or inadvertent. 

_The English position_ 

25     If any doubts on the appeal sc heme linger, a brief survey of the position in England will surely put these to rest. The c orresponding provision in the English Ac t ([16] _supra_ ) is to be found at s 69(8): 

 The dec ision of the c ourt on an appeal under this sec tion shall be treated as a judgment of the c ourt for the purposes of a further appeal. 

 But no suc h appeal lies without the leave of the c ourt whic h shall not be given unless the c ourt c onsiders that the question is one of general importanc e or is one whic h for some other spec ial reason should be c onsidered by the Court of Appeal. 

Sec tion 105(1) of the English Ac t similarly defines “the c ourt” to be the High Court or a c ounty c ourt (subjec t to c ertain other provisions whic h are not relevant for present purposes). _Halsbury’s Laws of_ 


_England_ vol 2(3) (Butterworths LexisNexis, 4th Ed Reissue, 2003) at para 75, fn 20, observes: 

 The effec t of the Arbitration Ac t 1996 s 69(8) is that an appeal from a dec ision of a c ounty c ourt or the High Court made under s 69 will only lie to the Court of Appeal with the permission of those lower courts, and it is not open to the Court of Appeal to conduct a review of the lower court’s refusal to grant permission : Henry Boot Construction (UK) Ltd v Malmaison Hotel (Manchester) Ltd [[2001] QB 388] ... [emphasis added in bold italic s] 

The passage states unequivoc ally that the Court of Appeal is not permitted to c onduc t a review of the lower c ourt’s refusal to grant leave to appeal. Similarly, the learned authors of _Russell on Arbitration_ (Sweet & Maxwell 22nd Ed, 2003) state, at para 8-073; 

 If the c ourt that dec ides the appeal does not c onsider that the matter should be referred to the Court of Appeal for the reasons stated in the Ac t permission will not be given. There can be no appeal to the Court of Appeal, either on the substantive issues or on the court’s decision to refuse to give permission to appeal. [emphasis added] 

In _Henry Boot_ ([16] _supra_ ), Waller LJ, delivering the unanimous dec ision of the c ourt, unequivoc ally dec lared, at 392: 

 In my view it would be diffic ult to find words c learer than the words of this partic ular subsec tion for the proposition that leave of the High Court (or the c ounty c ourt) was needed before any appeal c ould be brought in the Court of Appeal. Furthermore, if one has regard to its statutory predec essor, the position bec omes c learer still. ... 

 It would furthermore seem to me absurd to c ontemplate a review proc ess in the Court of Appeal in relation to the giving of that leave, otherwise the objec tive sought to be attained is defeated. 

26     We have similarly appraised the statutory predec essor of s 49(11) of the Ac t – s 28(7) of the repealed Ac t: see [16] above. Mr Sreenivasan has c orrec tly submitted that the deliberate omission in s 49(11) of the Ac t of any referenc e to the Court of Appeal having the power to grant leave (whic h was present in s 28(7) of the repealed Ac t), inexorably points to the fac t that the English position has been c onsc iously adopted in Singapore. 

27     In our view, an applic ation under s 49(11) of the Ac t for leave to appeal against a dec ision of the High Court on an appeal against an arbitration award c annot and should not be brought before the Court of Appeal. This c onc lusion is not reac hed by any strained interpretation of the statutory provisions; rather, the answer is the same in our view, whether the issue is approac hed on the basis of a plain reading of s 49(11) of the Ac t, a c omparison with s 34 of the SCJA and the c orresponding Rules or a c onsideration of the immediate statutory predec essor of s 49(11) of the Ac t. That is the position in relation to an applic ation under s 49(11) of the Ac t. Is the result any different if an applic ation purports to be brought under s 49(7) of the Ac t? 

**_Application under section 49(7) of the Act_** 

28     The defendant c onfirmed in the c ourse of the hearing that the basis of his present applic ation was founded solely on s 49(7) of the Ac t. We now turn to c onsider this. As we earlier noted, the defendant had already unsuc c essfully sought leave from the High Court to appeal to the Court of Appeal under s 49(11) of the Ac t. Can the defendant now seek leave to appeal against that dec ision under s 49(7) of the Ac t? That is the c rux of the matter. 


_Scheme of section 49 of the Act_ 

29     We begin our analysis by c onsidering the taxonomy of s 49 of the Ac t, and examining the presc ribed modalities. In partic ular, we need to differentiate the two tiers of applic ations identified by Mr Lok. In the general sc heme of appeals against arbitration awards brought before the c ourts pursuant to s 49 of the Ac t, the High Court is first asked to dec ide whether or not to grant leave to permit suc h an appeal. If the High Court so dec ides that leave should be granted, it will then proc eed to hear the merits of the appeal. The High Court when hearing suc h an appeal has a limited role and c arefully-defined powers – these are found in ss 49(8) and 49(9) of the Ac t. Any dec ision on the merits is deemed pursuant to s 49(10) of the Ac t to be a judgment of the High Court. A party dissatisfied with suc h a dec ision has a further right to seek leave to appeal against that dec ision – but suc h leave will only be granted in the very restric tive c irc umstanc es presc ribed in s 49(11) of the Ac t. 

30     We have broadly desc ribed the general sc heme presc ribed by s 49 of the Ac t. It is c ruc ial that any c ounsel who seeks to rely on s 49 of the Ac t c arefully appraise the ambit of the provision. A failure to properly apprec iate its ambit c ould result in adverse c ost c onsequenc es (and not just for their c lients). 

31     Returning to our analysis of s 49 of the Ac t, we note that every subsec tion in s 49 of the Ac t leading up to sub-s (10), save for sub-s (2) (whic h is not relevant for present purposes), adverts to an “appeal”. This term “appeal” first appears in s 49(1) of the Ac t – it is used in the c ontext of an appeal to the High Court on a question of law arising out of an arbitration award. The subsec tions that follow, for example, sub-ss (3), (4), (5) and (6) of s 49 of the Ac t, also make referenc e to an “appeal”. It is c lear that these subsec tions are referring to the same appeal, _ie_ , an appeal to the High Court from an arbitration award. These sec tions plainly c annot refer to a different appeal – an appeal to the Court of Appeal from a dec ision of the High Court. In fairness, neither c ounsel suggested this to be the c ase. Leaving aside sub-s (7) of s 49 of the Ac t for the moment, we further note that subss (8) and (9) of s 49 of the Ac t are also relevant only in the c ontext of an appeal against an arbitration award, setting out the powers of the High Court when hearing suc h an appeal. 

32     Only when we c onsider sub-s (10) of s 49 of the Ac t are we introduc ed to another term, “[t]he dec ision of the Court”; however, it must be noted that this dec ision referred to in sub-s (10) is also in respec t of an appeal from an arbitration award. Only at the c onc lusion of s 49 of the Ac t is there a referenc e to a _different_ kind of appeal. In sub-s (11) of s 49 of the Ac t, an appeal to the Court of Appeal from a dec ision of the High Court is spelt out for the very first time in s 49 of the Ac t. It is pertinent to also note that the Court of Appeal is _only_ referred to in this subsec tion alone _qua_ appellate c ourt. 

_Scope of section 49(7) of the Act_ 

33     Returning to sub-s (7) of s 49 of the Ac t, we have first to c onsider the words “dec ision ... to grant or refuse leave to appeal”. This is bec ause Mr Lok argues that the dec ision of the judge refusing the defendant leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal ( _ie_ , the 6 Marc h dec ision) is embrac ed by these words. The question to be answered is this, what dec ision does s 49(7) of the Ac t c ontemplate? Is it leave to appeal against an arbitration award? Or is it leave to appeal against a dec ision of the High Court? 

34     As highlighted above (at [12]), Mr Lok c ontends that the c ourt should adopt a literal reading of sub-s (7) of s 49 of the Ac t. A literal reading of sub-s (7) would enc ompass a dec ision refusing leave to appeal _against a decision of the High Court_ within its ambit. This is bec ause sub-s (7) merely 


ends with the words “leave to appeal” but does not define prec isely what dec ision from whic h leave to appeal is being sought. 

35     In our judgment, this argument c annot stand up to serious sc rutiny. If Mr Lok is right, by parity of reasoning, applying a literal interpretation to the word “appeal” wherever it appears in s 49 of the Ac t, the c onditions governing suc h “appeal”, for example in sub-ss (4), (5) and (6) of s 49 of the Ac t, will likewise have to apply to an appeal against a dec ision of the High Court. This will be the unintended but unavoidable c onsequenc e of a wholly literal interpretation of s 49 of the Ac t. This c annot be right. It is trite that even a literal approac h to statutory interpretation suc h as the “plain meaning rule” (as laid down by Lord Tindal CJ in _The Sussex Peerage_ (1844) 11 Cl & Fin 85; 8 ER 1034) mandates that the c ourts give the words of the statute their ordinary meaning _in the context in which they appear_. As rightly pointed out in _Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes_ (P St J Langan ed) (N M Tripathi Private Ltd, 12th Ed, 1969) (“ _Maxwell_ ”) at p 58, “[i]ndividual words are not c onsidered in isolation, but may have their meaning determined by other words in the sec tion in whic h they oc c ur”. Our c ourts have also similarly stated that the rule “presc ribes that the statutory provision [is to] be interpreted in its entirety, without undue foc us on an isolated word or phrase”: see _PP v Low Kok Heng_ <span class="citation">[2007] SGHC 123</span> (“ _Low Kok Heng_ ”) at [30]. Likewise, in F A R Bennion, _Statutory Interpretation_ (Butterworths, 4th Ed, 2002), the learned author observes at p 471: 

 The plain meaning rule was expressed by Lord Reid [in Pinner v Everett [1969] 1 WLR 1266 at 1273] as follows – 

 In determining the meaning of any word or phrase in a statute the first question to ask always is what is the natural or ordinary meaning of that word or phrase in its context in the statute. It is only when that meaning leads to some result whic h c annot reasonably be supposed to have been the intention of the legislature that it is proper to look for some other possible meaning of the word or phrase. 

 [emphasis added] 

Therefore, even if Mr Lok is right that a literal approac h should be adopted when interpreting s 49 of the Ac t, in our judgment, Mr Lok has not c orrec tly _applied_ suc h a prec ept. He has failed to take into ac c ount the c ontext of the statute when expounding the word “appeal” in its natural and ordinary sense. Onc e the c ontext of s 49 of the Ac t is taken into ac c ount, the term “appeal” must refer only to an appeal against an arbitration award. 

36     Furthermore, any disc ourse on the c onstruc tion of statutes in Singapore must take plac e against the bac kdrop of s 9A of the Interpretation Ac t (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“Interpretation Ac t”). We note that an extensive and c omprehensive disc ussion of this provision has rec ently been undertaken in _Low Kok Heng_ at [39] to [57]. There is no nec essity for us to add to that disc ussion; we merely wish to highlight a few salient points that are relevant to the present c ase. Sec tion 9A of the Interpretation Ac t provides: 

 9A. —(1) In the interpretation of a provision of a written law, an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or objec t is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object. 

 (2) Subjec t to subsec tion (4), in the interpretation of a provision of a written law, if any material not forming part of the written law is c apable of assisting in the asc ertainment of the 


 meaning of the provision, c onsideration may be given to that material — 

 (a) to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning c onveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the written law and the purpose or object underlying the written law ; or 

 ( b ) to asc ertain the meaning of the provision when ― 

 (i) the provision is ambiguous or obsc ure; or 

 (ii) the ordinary meaning c onveyed by the text of the provision taking into ac c ount its c ontext in the written law and the purpose or objec t underlying the written law leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. 

 ... 

 [emphasis added] 

37     As the c ourt in _Low Kok Heng_ summarised, at [57]: 

 [Sec tion] 9A of the Interpretation Ac t mandates that a purposive approac h be adopted in the c onstruc tion of all statutory provisions, and allows extrinsic material to be referred to, even where, on a plain reading, the words of a statute are c lear and unambiguous. The purposive approac h takes prec edenc e over all other c ommon law princ iples of interpretation. 

It is plain that a purposive approac h is to be adopted in the c onstruc tion of s 49 of the Ac t; and the purposive approac h will take prec edenc e over a literal interpretation. Sec tion 9A(2) of the Interpretation Ac t also allows us to make referenc e to, and draw assistanc e from, the reports of the LRRD (see [23] above and [49] and [52] below), as well as various other extrinsic material “c apable of assisting in the asc ertainment of the meaning of the provision”. 

38     It is c ommon ground that the Ac t inc orporates various provisions from the English Ac t and both Ac ts are largely based on the UNICTRAL Model Law on International Commerc ial Arbitration (“the Model Law”), whic h forms the basis of the International Arbitration Ac t (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”): see the sec ond reading of the Arbitration Bill (Bill 37 of 2001) on 5 Oc tober 2001 ( _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (5 Oc tober 2001) vol 73 at c ol 2214. The legislative bac kground to the English Ac t is therefore of some relevanc e in our understanding of the taxonomy of the Ac t. In this regard, we note also the observations made by the House of Lords in _Lesotho Highlands Development Authority v Impregilo SpA_ [2006] 1 AC 221, where Lord Steyn expounded on the “ethos” of the English Ac t, at [18]: 

 Lord Wilberforc e played a large role in sec uring the enac tment of the Arbitration Bill. During the sec ond reading of the Bill in the House of Lords he explained the essence of the new philosophy enshrined in it: Hansard (HL Debates), 18 January 1996, c ol 778. He said: 

 “I would like to dwell for a moment on one point to whic h I personally attac h some importanc e. That is the relation between arbitration and the c ourts. I have never taken the view that arbitration is a kind of annex, appendix or poor relation to court proceedings. I have always wished to see arbitration, as far as possible , and subject to statutory guidelines no doubt, regarded as a freestanding system, free to settle its own procedure and free to develop its own substantive law – yes, its substantive law. ... 


## ... 

 ... [The Bill] has given to the c ourt only those essential powers whic h I believe the c ourt should have; that is, rendering assistanc e when the arbitrators c annot ac t in the way of enforc ement or proc edural steps, or, alternatively, in the direction of correcting very fundamental errors .” (My emphasis.) 

 Charac teristic ally, Lord Wilberforc e did not express his understanding of the new Arbitration Bill in absolute terms. But the general tendenc y of his observations, and what Parliament was being asked to sanc tion, is c lear. It reflec ts the ethos of the 1996 Ac t. 

 [emphasis added in bold italic s] 

Law-makers in Singapore have artic ulated similar sentiments emphasising the _limited_ role of the c ourts in relation to arbitration proc eedings: see LRRD 3/2001 ([16] _supra_ ) at para 2.38 quoted at [52] below. 

39     As pointed out by a leading English c ommentator, D Rhidian Thomas in _The Law and Practice Relating to Appeals from Arbitration Awards_ (Lloyd’s of London Press Ltd, 1994), in relation to the English Arbitration Ac t 1979 (c 42) (“the 1979 Ac t”) at para 10.3.2.1: 

 The polic y of the legislation is unambiguous. Whereas appeals from arbitration to the High Court under the 1979 Ac t will be rare, on-appeals from the High Court to the Court of Appeal will be still rarer. Kerr L.J. [in The Derby [1985] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 325 at 327] has summarised the polic y of the legislation in the following terms: 

 Sinc e the 1979 Ac t has c ome into forc e and its effec t has been laid down in a number of dec isions, in partic ular [ The Nema ], only a few dec isions by arbitrators have reac hed the Court of Appeal. This is in accordance with the policy of the Act to discourage appeals from arbitrators on issues of law and only to allow them to proceed beyond the court of first instance in exceptional circumstances. 

 [emphasis added] 

In a similar vein, in _The Antaios_ [1981] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 284, Robert Goff J (as he then was) said, at 300: 

 It seems to me that the whole sc heme of the Ac t is basic ally that on the questions of law whic h fall within the Ac t the intention is that primarily there should be one appeal, and one appeal only, and that is to [the High] Court. 

Although the latter observations were made in the c ontext of the 1979 Ac t, in our view, they apply with equal if not greater forc e to the (c urrent) English Ac t. It is therefore plain from the foregoing that the general ethos or philosophy underpinning the English Ac t is that the c ourts will adopt a noninterventionist stanc e in relation to arbitration matters; it is only in the c ase of the “very fundamental errors” that have been statutorily identified that the c ourt will be willing to intervene. We are of the view that the polic y objec tives artic ulated in respec t of the English Ac t are equally applic able to our domestic arbitration legislation. One need not look any further than the provisions of the Ac t itself to find support for this view. For instanc e, s 47 of the Ac t expressly provides that the c ourt does not have jurisdic tion to “c onfirm, vary, set aside or remit an [arbitration] award ... _except where so provided in_ [ _the_ ] _Act_ ” [emphasis added]. Further, it is plain that an applic ation or appeal under s 49 of the Ac t may not be brought unless the applic ant or appellant (as the c ase may be) has first 


exhausted any available alternative remedies provided for in the arbitral proc ess and under s 43 of the Ac t: see s 50(2) of the Ac t. All these provisions unerringly point to the same c onc lusion: it is only in very limited c irc umstanc es that the c ourt will be willing and able to intervene. 

40     In applying a purposive approac h in interpreting the Ac t, the objec tive should be to promote the desirability of finality and limited c urial intervention in arbitration proc eedings. The availability of an onward appeal has been severely attenuated. In this regard, we must firmly rejec t Mr Lok’s submission that it is appropriate to apply a wholly arid literal interpretation to s 49(7) of the Ac t. Other c ommon law princ iples of interpretation c ome into play _only_ when their applic ation c oinc ides with the purpose underlying the written law in question. It must be noted, nevertheless, that it is more often than not that a literal reading of a statutory provision is in fac t likely to c oinc ide with a purposive reading of that provision. To be sure, a suc c essfully drafted piec e of legislation is one whic h c learly brings out the purpose underlying the provision by its express literal words: see D C Pearc e & R S Geddes, _Statutory Interpretation in Australia_ (Butterworths, 4th Ed, 1996) at para 2.5, p 31. Indeed, the present c ase is one good example whic h c onduc es towards suc h a finding: on both a (c orrec tly applied) literal reading of s 49 of the Ac t and a purposive approac h to that sec tion, we c ome to the same c onc lusion – the term “appeal” used in s 49 of the Ac t c an _only_ refer to an appeal from an arbitration award. 

41     To be fair, Mr Lok did not attempt to argue that the whole of s 49 of the Ac t should be read “literally”. He must have rec ognised the absurdity of adopting suc h an interpretative tec hnique given the c onsequenc es. He trained his fire on persuading the c ourt that s 49(7) of the Ac t should be read in isolation in this manner. He c ontended that if the legislative intent was to prevent any further applic ation for leave under s 49(7) of the Ac t onc e the c ourt had already refused leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, this would have been expressly stated in the Ac t. Sinc e s 49(7) was silent on this, it did not forec lose suc h an applic ation being made. 

42     This argument may be easily disposed of. It is a rule of statutory interpretation that it is presumed that a statute does not c reate new jurisdic tions or enlarge existing ones, and express language is required if an Ac t is to be interpreted as having this effec t: see _Maxwell_ ([35] _supra_ ) at p 159. In _Gelberg v Miller_ [1961] 1 WLR 459, the House of Lords c onsidered s 1(4) of the English Administration of Justic e Ac t 1960 (c 65) whic h provided that “[f ]or the purpose of disposing of an appeal under this sec tion the House of Lords may exerc ise any powers of the c ourt below”. The House of Lords c onc luded that that sec tion did not authorise it to exerc ise the power of the Divisional Court or the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) to c ertify that a point of law of general public importanc e was involved in its dec ision in a c riminal c ause or matter. This c ase was noted in _Henry Boot_ ([16] _supra_ ) along with other House of Lords authorities, and persuaded the English Court of Appeal in _Henry Boot_ to find that when a c ourt was c onstruing a statutory provision relating to appeals it was _illegitimate to start_ from the point of view that litigants had suc h rights. In partic ular, the Court of Appeal in arriving at its c onc lusion in _Henry Boot_ derived c onsiderable guidanc e from the judgment of Lord Halsbury LC in _Lane v Esdaile_ [1891] AC 210. This was a c ase where the House of Lords had to c onsider whether an appeal lay to the House of Lords after a refusal by the Court of Appeal to grant “spec ial leave” under a rule of the c ourt (Rules of the Supreme Court 1881, O 58 r 15, c ited in _Henry Boot_ at 392) that stipulated: 

 No appeal to the Court of Appeal from any interloc utory order ... shall, exc ept by spec ial leave of the Court of Appeal, be brought after the expiration of 21 days ... 

A substantial portion of Lord Halsbury LC’s judgment in _Lane v Esdaile_ (at 211–212) was quoted in _Henry Boot_ and we now set out the relevant portions as we too find them instruc tive: 


 An appeal is not to be presumed but must be given. I do not mean to say that it must be given by express words, but it must be given in some form or other in whic h it c an be said that it is affirmatively given and not presumed. In the partic ular c ase now before your Lordships the appeal is c ertainly not given in express words. The words used are “leave of the Court”... 

 [W]hen I look not only at the language used, but at the substanc e and meaning of the provision, it seems to me that to give an appeal in this c ase would defeat the whole objec t and purview of the order or rule itself, bec ause it is obvious that what was there intended by the Legislature was that there should be in some form or other a power to stop an appeal – that there should not be an appeal unless some partic ular body pointed out by the statute ... should permit that an appeal should be given. Now just let us c onsider what that means, that an appeal shall not be given unless some partic ular body c onsents to its being given. Surely if that is intended as a c hec k to unnec essary or frivolous appeals it bec omes absolutely illusory if you c an appeal from that dec ision or leave, or whatever it is to be c alled itself. How c ould any Court of Review determine whether leave ought to be given or not without hearing and determining upon the hearing whether it was a fit c ase for an appeal? And if the intermediate Court c ould enter and must enter into that question, then the Court whic h is the ultimate Court of Appeal must do so also. The result of that would be that in c onstruing this order, whic h as I have said is obviously intended to prevent frivolous and unnec essary appeals, you might in truth have two appeals in every c ase in whic h, following the ordinary c ourse of things, there would be only one; bec ause if there is a power to appeal when the order has been refused, it would seem to follow as a nec essary c onsequenc e that you must have a right to appeal when leave has been granted, the result of whic h is that the person against whom the leave has been granted might appeal from that, and inasmuc h as this is no stay of proc eeding the Court of Appeal might be entertaining an appeal upon the very same question when this House was entertaining the question whether the Court of Appeal ought ever to have granted the appeal. My Lords, it seems to me that that would reduc e the provision to suc h an absurdity that even if the language were more c lear than is c ontended on the other side one really ought to give it a reasonable c onstruc tion. 

 [emphasis added] 

In short, there is simply no presumption of law that litigants have a right of appeal. The express provision granting a dissatisfied litigant in the High Court (in relation to an appeal from an arbitration award) a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal is s 49(11) of the Ac t. Even then it is available only in extremely limited statutorily-presc ribed c irc umstanc es. Any alternative or further right of appeal c annot be implied into the Ac t; express language is required to allow s 49(7) to be interpreted as having this effec t. 

43     Taking the argument further and taking Mr Lok’s c ase at its highest by foc using solely on s 49(7) of the Ac t, and assuming _arguendo_ that Mr Lok is right in his interpretation of s 49(7), we still arrive at the inevitable c onc lusion that the outc ome is untenable. A simple hypothetic al based on the same fac ts but in the _converse_ , employing Mr Lok’s analysis, will illustrate the point. An astute reader will find that this will bear some resemblanc e to the reasoning of Lord Halsbury LC in the latter portions of the passage quoted at [42] above. 

44     Assume that the judge had granted the defendant leave to appeal bec ause there was, in her view, a question of law of general importanc e. This would result in a substantive appeal wending its way to the Court of Appeal. In the meantime, the plaintiffs being dissatisfied with the judge’s dec ision (“the s 49(11) dec ision”), c an and do apply under s 49(7) of the Ac t (ac c ording to Mr Lok’s reasoning) to another High Court judge (“Justic e X”) for leave to appeal against the s 49(11) dec ision. If we assume that Justic e X also grants leave to appeal, this would result in a sec ond appeal being 


plac ed before the Court of Appeal – but this time for the Court of Appeal to dec ide whether the s 49(11) dec ision was c orrec t, _ie_ , whether leave to appeal should have been given in the first plac e. Thus, the Court of Appeal would be pressed to first dec ide the latter appeal, _ie_ , whether leave to appeal should be granted, before it c an dec ide, and only if the answer to this is affirmative, the merits of suc h an appeal. 

45     In our view, this c ould not have been what Parliament had even faintly c ontemplated. It would entail a situation whereby although the Court of Appeal is already seised of jurisdic tion to hear the former appeal ( _ie_ , substantive appeal), it would have to, as it were, “stay” the proc eedings for it to dec ide the question of whether it ac tually had the jurisdic tion or not. Further, the effec t of Mr Lok’s analysis is that the Court of Appeal will have to ac tually dec ide whether leave to appeal from a dec ision of the High Court should be granted. However, Mr Lok paradoxic ally states in his written submissions (at para 48) that “no applic ation for leave to appeal [from a dec ision of the High Court] c ould be made to the Court of Appeal under the new Ac t” and, again, at para 54 that: 

 At the very most, the purpose of the amendments [to the repealed Ac t] appeared to be to c hannel all applic ations for leave to appeal before the High Court. This means that a 2nd tier applic ation would be heard by another High Court Judge instead of the Court of Appeal. 

It appears to us that Mr Lok has failed to c onsider the next step in his suggested sc heme: eventually, the Court of Appeal might have to hear an applic ation for leave to appeal under s 49(11) of the Ac t, as demonstrated by the result in the sc enario posited above. This would be c ontrary to the intention of s 49(11) of the Ac t, and we hasten to add that it would also be inc ongruous with our c onc lusion reac hed in [27] above. 

46     We find some tangential support for our c onc lusions in the view whic h was taken by the English Court of Appeal in the c ase of _Kay v Briggs_ (1889) 22 QBD 343 in relation to s 45 of the English Supreme Court of Judic ature Ac t 1873 (c 66). That sec tion governed appeals to a divisional c ourt from an inferior c ourt, and provided that: 

 ... The determination of suc h Appeals respec tively by suc h Divisional Courts shall be final unless spec ial leave to appeal from the same to the Court of Appeal shall be given by the Divisional Court by whic h any suc h appeal from an inferior Court shall have been heard. 

In that c ase, the divisional c ourt had refused leave to appeal and the aggrieved party thereupon attempted in the Court of Appeal to review the determination of the divisional c ourt in that respec t. The Court of Appeal took the view that it was unable to entertain the question and c ould not review the dec ision of the divisional c ourt. Lord Esher MR said, at 344: 

 If this Court [meaning the Court of Appeal] c ould overrule the disc retion given by that sec tion to Divisional Courts the prac tic al effec t would be to allow an appeal here in every c ase, bec ause the fac ts of eac h c ase would be brought before us in order to enable us to dec ide whether or not we ought to overrule that disc retion. I think that the real meaning of s. 45 is to c onfine the power to give leave to appeal absolutely to the Divisional Courts. 

Similarly, in the present c ase, if the Court of Appeal c an routinely overrule the disc retion given to the High Court pursuant to s 49(11) of the Ac t, the prac tic al effec t would be to allow an appeal to the Court of Appeal in every c ase bec ause the fac ts of eac h c ase would be brought before us in order to enable us to dec ide whether or not we ought to overrule the disc retion exerc ised by the High Court. As Lord Hersc hell astutely noted in _Lane v Esdaile_ ([42] _supra_ ) at 214, “the matter was intrusted, and intended to be intrusted, to their disc retion”. In our judgment, the disc retion whether to grant leave 


to appeal to the Court of Appeal must be, and c an only be, exerc ised by the High Court; see however [68] below. This arrangement ensures that speed and finality in the arbitral proc ess c ontinue to prevail while preserving a limited sc ope for c urial intervention. 

**_Section 52 of the Act_** 

47     How does s 52 of the Ac t c larify this, if at all? In view of the c onc lusion we have reac hed above, _viz_ that s 49(7) of the Ac t does not apply to a dec ision of the High Court made pursuant to s 49(11) of the Ac t, the defendant c annot seek to rely on s 49(7). Ac c ordingly, s 52 of the Ac t is also irrelevant. Nevertheless, sinc e both c ounsel spent some time addressing the point, we will also examine the intent and purport of s 52 of the Ac t. 

48     In our view, the legislative purpose of s 52 is merely to spell out the jurisdic tion and the powers that the Court of Appeal possesses when the High Court grants leave to appeal pursuant to s 49(7) of the Ac t. As we have explained above, this is only in relation to first-tier applic ations. In suc h a situation, the Court of Appeal will c onsider whether the High Court’s dec ision to grant or refuse leave to appeal against an arbitration award is c orrec t. The result is that the Court of Appeal will have to dec ide whether to grant or refuse leave to appeal _against an arbitration award_. In doing so, s 52(3)( _b_ ) of the Ac t c onfirms that the Court of Appeal has the same jurisdic tion and all the powers as the High Court if and when the High Court dec ides suc h a matter. 

49     It is also helpful to examine the legislative bac kground to s 52 of the Ac t. In LRRD 3/ ([16] _supra_ ) at para 2.41, c l 52 of the Arbitration Bill 2001 whic h (with minor amendments) is substantially similar to the present s 52 of the Ac t, is stated to be enac ted “[t]o ensure a c onsistent proc edure and prac tic e in relation to applic ations for leave to appeal”. It thus appears that this provision was introduc ed into the Ac t more for the purposes of streamlining the proc edural requirements in relation to applic ations for leave to appeal than as a provision intended to c onfer jurisdic tion upon the c ourts. Interestingly, s 52(1) of the Ac t stipulates that the applic ations for leave to appeal _shall_ be made in suc h manner as may be presc ribed in the Rules. As a further observation, we also note that this provision has not been modelled on any other c omparative legislation. 

50     In our view, s 52(3)( _b_ ) of the Ac t merely c onfirms that the Court of Appeal has a c omplementary jurisdic tion to that of the High Court if and when it is properly seised of a matter. Ultimately, the High Court is meant to fulfil the role of an exc lusive gate-keeper for arbitration matters in relation to the appeals proc edure presc ribed by the Ac t. Therefore, it is _only_ when the High Court dec ides that leave under s 49(7) of the Ac t is to be granted, that the Court of Appeal thereafter has the jurisdic tion to hear the matter. Before elaborating on this point, we note in passing the previous state of the law under the repealed Ac t. Under that Ac t, leave of Court was not required for an appeal to the Court of Appeal against the High Court’s dec ision on an applic ation for leave to appeal from an arbitration award: see _Hong Huat Development Co (Pte) Ltd v Hiap Hong & Co Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2000] 2 SLR 609</span> at [16]; and _Northern Elevator Manufacturing Sdn Bhd v United Engineers (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2003] 4 SLR 492</span> (“ _Northern Elevator_ ”) at [12]. However, the Court of Appeal in _Northern Elevator_ went on to observe that this proc edural point was of “limited effec t due to the c hanges effec ted to arbitration law by [the Ac t]” bec ause “[s]ec tion 49(7) [of the Ac t] ... is a new provision that spec ifies that the leave of the c ourt shall be required for any appeal from a dec ision of the c ourt under this sec tion [s 49] to grant or refuse leave to appeal” (at [11]). 

51     Returning to our disc ussion on the c urrent state of the law, we find ourselves unable to fully agree with Mr Sreenivasan’s argument that s 52(3)( _b_ ) of the Ac t only applied to situations where there had been no determination by the High Court on the merits of any partic ular c ase. While Mr Sreenivasan is c orrec t to say that where there _has_ been a determination by the c ourt on the 


merits of a c ase, s 52(3)( _b_ ) does not apply (as is the c ase with s 49(7) of the Ac t), we are of the view that the c onverse does not nec essarily follow. In our judgment, Mr Sreenivasan’s c onc ession is too generous: it is not in _all_ c ases where there is no determination on the merits that s 52(3)( _b_ ) must apply. In a situation where the High Court refuses to grant leave to appeal pursuant to s 49(7) of the Ac t against an initial dec ision refusing leave to appeal against an arbitration award, even if there has been no determination on the merits in this type of situation, we are of the view that s 52(3)( _b_ ) will have no role to play. The Court of Appeal simply does not have the jurisdic tion to hear suc h an applic ation. Our views on s 52(3)( _b_ ) are reinforc ed when we c onsider later the position in England (see [58] below). 

52     In our judgment, this interpretation is c onsistent with the general polic y that underpins the spine of the Ac t that is the desirability of finality, and limited c urial intervention, in the arbitral proc ess. The judge c orrec tly observed in _Ng Chin Siau_ ([6] _supra_ ) at [34]: 

 The polic y behind the enac tment of s 49 of the Ac t is that c urial intervention in the arbitral proc ess is to be minimised. That is why there is no appeal as of right against the arbitrator’s dec ision or against the dec ision of the High Court on suc h an appeal. That is also why the first pre-c ondition spec ified in s 49(11) is that the legal point at issue should be of general importanc e rather than something that is only relevant to the parties or a very limited situation. 

We agree entirely with these observations. There is no gainsaying the rationale behind suc h a polic y: parties having c hosen to arbitrate should usually be bound by the finding of the tribunal and not that of the c ourt; so whether the c ourt would reac h a similar c onc lusion would not be relevant and if the c ourt were to c ome to a different view, the substitution of the c ourt’s view for that of the tribunal might ac tually subvert the agreement of the parties. Indeed, this was rec ognised and artic ulated by the Review of Arbitration Ac t Committee formed by the AttorneyGeneral in 1997 to review the arbitration legislation in Singapore (see also the c ommentary in _Singapore Arbitration Handbook_ (LexisNexis, 2003) at p 68). It is instruc tive to refer to the c ommittee’s report, LRRD 3/2001 ([16] _supra_ ), at para 2.38: 

 2.38 Appeal against awards (Clause 49) 

 2.38.1 We c onsidered the desirability of abolishing the right of appeal to the Court on substantial issues in the arbitration. ... This proposition was ac c epted by the Law Reform SubCommittee on Review of Arbitration Law when they rec ommended the adoption of [the] Model Law and the enac tment of the International Arbitration Ac t. In relation to domestic arbitration, the SubCommittee suggested that ‘ the courts should be more closely involved ... (both in order to protect weaker parties and for the purpose of being involved in the evolution of decisions that concern domestic law and practice)’. We find muc h wisdom in this view and ac c ept that an absolute abolition of the right of appeal may not be desirable in arbitrations under the domestic regime. Retaining a limited degree of review by the c ourt is c onsistent with the parties’ desire to have the matter dec ided in ac c ordanc e with the law as properly understood and as applied in Singapore. The right of appeal against awards on questions of law is thus retained in this Bill. 

 [emphasis in original] 

53     Clearly, the objec tive of retaining a _limited_ degree of review by the c ourt in so far as domestic arbitrations are c onc erned was c onsc iously and deliberately adopted. This is to be c ontrasted with the position under the IAA: Exc ept where the High Court has found grounds under s 34 of the IAA or Art 24 of the Model Law to set aside an award, there is _no right of appeal_. To be sure, Mr Lok ac c epted the general polic y objec tives behind the Ac t. However, he c ontended that 


these polic y objec tives only applied in relation to arbitration matters c oming before the c ourts _for the first time_ ; onc e an arbitration matter was properly before the c ourt, these polic y c onsiderations did not apply to any further appeal thereon. We find ourselves unable to agree with Mr Lok’s submission. In our view, the polic y c onc erns permeate the entire proc ess of c urial intervention apropos arbitration proc eedings; and c ontinue to remain relevant in every pending applic ation before the c ourt. 

54     The c ase of _Henry Boot_ ([16] _supra_ ) is again instruc tive: Waller LJ, in c onsidering s 69(8) of the English Ac t, noted at 396: 

 I also rejec t [c ounsel for the plaintiff’s] submissions that onc e matters are in c ourt the philosophy applic able to arbitrations somehow has no further applic ation. Parties who have agreed to have their disputes arbitrated should have finality as speedily as possible and with as little expense as possible ... Limitation on the rights of appeal is c onsistent with that philosophy: see the observations of Sir John Donaldson MR in [ Aden Refinery Co Ltd v Ugland Management Co Ltd ] [1987] QB 650, 655. As Lord Nic holls of Birkenhead emphasised in Inco Europe Ltd v First Choice Distribution [2001] 1 WLR 586, 590C, many sec tions of the 1996 Ac t provide for applic ations to the c ourt and some of them restric t appeals from dec isions of the c ourt. The Ac t thus adopts the same philosophy and the c onstruc tion I have plac ed on sec tion 69 is c onsistent with its c ontext. 

_The English position_ 

55     We have already briefly c onsidered the English position at [25]–[26] above. Mr Lok had ac c epted that the English position is c lear that an applic ation for leave to appeal against the dec ision of the c ourt on an appeal from an arbitration award must be heard by the High Court judge who heard the appeal against the award. In other words, Mr Lok ac c epts that whenever leave is required, it is to be made to the c ourt whic h gave the dec ision. On the present fac ts, this was indeed what was done by Mr Lok – he had taken out suc h an applic ation for leave whic h was turned down. Thus, it is stric tly speaking unnec essary to c onduc t a further review of the English position in relation to s 69(8) of the English Ac t, save to note that _Henry Boot_ has also been applied in rec ent c ases suc h as _CGU International Insurance Plc v AstraZeneca Insurance Co Ltd_ [2007] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 142 (“ _CGU_ ”); and _Cantrell v Wright & Fuller Ltd_ (2003) 91 Con LR 97. 

56     We would however like to make some observations on another English c ase, _North Range Shipping Ltd v Seatrans Shipping Corpn_ [2002] 1 WLR 2397 (“ _North Range_ ”), and the more rec ent c ase of _CGU_. _North Range_ involved an applic ation to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal against a High Court judge’s (David Steel J’s) refusal to grant leave for an appeal from the dec ision of the arbitrators to the High Court, _ie_ , a first-tier applic ation. Prior to this, the applic ant had applied to Steel J for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s 69(6) of the English Ac t (whic h is _in pari materia_ with s 49(7) of the Ac t) from the judge’s refusal to grant leave. Steel J refused to grant permission without giving any reasons. It is to be noted, however, that he gave reasons for his initial refusal to grant leave to appeal to the High Court. The signific anc e of this point will bec ome c learer shortly. The Court of Appeal granted the applic ation for permission to appeal but dismissed the appeal. 

57     It is noted from the outset that this c ase involves a different situation from the present. In _North Range_ , there was no dec ision on the merits at any stage of the c ourt proc eedings. This alone is suffic ient to distinguish the c ase and it is therefore of no assistanc e to the defendant. However, it will also be apparent that the c ase does have some bearing in relation to another issue, an issue that we have expressed our opinion on at [51] above. To reiterate, this c onc erns the situation where the High Court refuses leave to appeal from an arbitration award and further refuses leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal from suc h dec ision. We have already expressed our view that in suc h a situation, 


the aggrieved party’s odyssey c omes to an end – he c annot bring any further applic ation before the Court of Appeal. The dec ision in _North Range_ allowing permission to appeal therefore seems, at first blush, to be at odds with our view. It is in this c ontext that we c onsider it helpful to deal with that c ase. Having said that, it bears mention that this c ase is also helpful for a number of other reasons whic h we now explain. 

58     First, we note the observations made in _North Range_ in relation to the relief that was being sought in that c ase. At [10] of the judgment, Tuc key LJ said: 

 The applic ant’s notic e of appeal asks this c ourt to give leave to appeal from the arbitrators’ aw ard. This court has no jurisdiction to make such an order as their c ounsel Mr Plender c onc eded. However, his primary submission to us was that we should allow the appeal from the judge’s refusal to give leave and remit the applic ation for rehearing by a different c ommerc ial judge bec ause David Steel J’s reasons were inadequate. [emphasis added] 

We raise this point bec ause it reinforc es our view of the role and purpose of s 52(3)( _b_ ) of the Ac t. There is no c omparable provision in the English Ac t. When Tuc key LJ says that “[t]his c ourt has no jurisdic tion to make ... an order [granting leave to appeal from an arbitration award]” in relation to the English position, this in our view c learly illustrates a signific ant differenc e between that statutory regime and ours. When this Court is invited to dec ide whether to grant or refuse leave to appeal against an arbitration award (pursuant to the granting of leave by the High Court under s 49(7) of the Ac t), s 52(3)( _b_ ) of the Ac t c onfirms that this Court of Appeal has the same jurisdic tion and powers as the High Court when it determines suc h a matter. It therefore has the jurisdic tion to make an order granting leave to appeal from an arbitration award. That is one suc h situation s 52(3)( _b_ ) is intended to embrac e. In England, it would appear from the portion of Tuc key LJ’s judgment quoted above that the English Court of Appeal has no suc h powers; instead, it would have to allow the appeal from the judge’s refusal to give leave and _remit the application_ for rehearing by a different High Court judge. 

59     The sec ond reason why _North Range_ is helpful is that it c ategoric ally reaffirms the position on appeals (as dec lared in _Henry Boot_ ([16] _supra_ )) at [11]: 

 The first question therefore is whether we have jurisdic tion to deal with the c ase on this basis. What is clear is that there is no appeal from the judge’s refusal to give leave on the merits. This follows from the language of the statute and was confirmed by this court in Henry Boot Construction (UK) Ltd v Malmaison Hotel (Manchester) Ltd. ... [2001] QB 388. [emphasis added] 

By following the position in _Henry Boot_ , the c ourt in _North Range_ c onfirmed that where the High Court had heard an appeal from an arbitration award _and had ruled on the merits_ , any refusal to grant leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against that dec ision was final – no appeal would lie against suc h refusal. 

**_Residual jurisdiction_** 

60     Interestingly, _North Range_ also adds another jurisprudential woof to the jurisprudenc e disc ussed thus far – the relianc e by the applic ant in that c ase on the provisions of the Human Rights Ac t 1998 (c 42) (“HRA”) and the European Convention for the Protec tion of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“ECHR”), and the c ourt’s disc ussion of a “residual jurisdic tion” whic h the Court of Appeal possessed. In _North Range_ , the applic ant’s c ounsel sought to rely on s 6 of the HRA, whic h makes it unlawful for a c ourt to ac t inc ompatibly with a Convention right, and argued that the c ourt was required to give the applic ant a right of appeal to enable it to c omplain that the proc ess by whic h the judge reac hed his dec ision was unfair and c ontrary to Art 6 of the ECHR. It must be noted 


that this submission did not involve a direc t c hallenge to the c orrec tness of the judge’s dec ision on the merits of the applic ation for leave to appeal. 

61     The position prior to _North Range_ had been that if the High Court judge refused permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal under s 69(6) of the English Ac t, the Court of Appeal had no jurisdic tion to hear an appeal against suc h a refusal. This was so determined by the Court of Appeal in _Aden Refinery Co Ltd v Ugland Management Co Ltd_ [1987] QB 650 (“ _Aden Refinery_ ”), a dec ision that predated the HRA. The basis of this dec ision was that the disc retion c onferred upon the judge under s 69(6) of the English Ac t was for him alone. However, the Court of Appeal in _Aden Refinery_ also reserved the right to intervene in c ases where the judge had failed to ac t judic ially and “in truth never reac hed ‘a dec ision’ at all on the grant or refusal of leave, but had reac hed his c onc lusion, not by any intellec tual proc ess, but through bias, c hanc e, whimsy, or personal interest” ( _per_ Mustill LJ (as he then was) at 666). These _dicta_ were applied by the Court of Appeal in _North Range_ on the basis that “unfairness and misc onduc t both relate to proc ess” (at [12]), thereby providing a means for the Court of Appeal to c onsider the question whether reasons had to be given by a judge who refused permission to appeal against his refusal to hear an arbitration c laim. The Court of Appeal in _North Range_ ac c epted that it had no power to grant permission to appeal against the judge’s dec ision to refuse to hear an appeal against an arbitration award, but held that there was a _residual jurisdiction_ vested in the Court of Appeal to hear an appeal against a refusal to permit an appeal in c irc umstanc es in whic h the judge’s dec ision had allegedly been unfair. Sec tion 69(6) of the English Ac t was not a bar to an appeal _where the complaint was one of procedural unfairness_ by the judge in the lower c ourt. 

62     The Court of Appeal in _North Range_ held that it had the jurisdic tion to c onsider whether a judge’s reasons to refuse permission to appeal were adequate and to set aside his dec ision if they were not, but it would refuse permission to appeal against the adequac y of a judge’s reasons in anything other than the very plainest c ase. The reasoning of the c ourt at [14] is instruc tive: 

 We ac c ept Mr Plender’s submissions on the question of jurisdic tion. If, as is ac c epted, there is a residual jurisdic tion in this c ourt to set aside a judge’s dec ision for misc onduc t then there c an be no reason in princ iple why the same relief should not be available in a c ase of unfairness. Each is directed at the integrity of the decision-making process or the decision maker , whic h the c ourts must be vigilant to protec t, and does not directly involve an attack on the decision itself. [emphasis added] 

The result was that the applic ant was granted permission to appeal but sinc e the judge had given entirely adequate reasons for his dec ision, the appeal would be dismissed. As the c ourt observed (at [32]), there are “dangers inherent in an attac k on the adequac y of reasons. Only their adequac y is in issue; not whether or not they are c orrec t”. 

63     We note further that the “exc eptional jurisdic tion” exerc ised by the Court of Appeal in _North Range_ was again exerc ised in _BLCT Ltd v J Sainsbury plc_ [2004] 2 P & CR 3. The bulk of the arguments in the latter c ase foc used on s 69(5) of the English Ac t (no requirement of oral hearing for leave to appeal applic ations) and whether a denial of an oral hearing on the fac ts of that c ase c ontravened Art 6 of the ECHR. The applic ant further argued that the restric tion c ontained in s 69(6) of the English Ac t was itself inc ompatible with Art 6 of the ECHR. In c onsidering these arguments, the Court of Appeal relied on _North Range_ and ac c epted that it had a residual jurisdic tion to grant relief in a c ase of unfairness, but held that there was none in the c irc umstanc es. It is instruc tive to refer to the relevant passage in Arden LJ’s judgment where the learned judge asked herself (at [45]) whether the restric tion c ontained in s 69(6) of the English Ac t: 


 ... would apply to the refusal of a judge to rec use himself on the grounds of bias. It would c ertainly be very odd if the refusal of the judge to give leave against that dec ision meant that the appellant had no avenue of appeal to the Court of Appeal. In my judgment, the answer lies not in any incompatibility with the Convention but in the residual jurisdiction articulated in the North Range case. [emphasis added] 

As noted by Robert Merkin in _Arbitration Law_ (Lloyd’s of London Press Ltd, 1991), at para 21.63: 

 The outc ome of North Range Shipping and Sainsbury is, therefore that the Court of Appeal has a residual jurisdic tion to give permission for an appeal to it in c ases where unfairness would otherwise result from the manner in whic h the trial judge determined the applic ation for permission to appeal against the award. 

64     The most rec ent pronounc ement in England (as far as we are aware) on the issue of a residual jurisdic tion in this area is the c ase of _CGU_ ([55] _supra_ ), where the English Court of Appeal c onfirmed the c orrec tness of the dec ision in _North Range_ : see _CGU_ at [66]. _CGU_ c onc erned an applic ation to a judge for permission to appeal against his substantive dec ision on an appeal from an arbitration award (under s 69(8) of the English Ac t) whic h was refused. This was different from _North Range_ whic h c onc erned a refusal by a judge to grant permission to appeal against an arbitration award (under s 69(6) of the English Ac t), although the relevant princ iples governing a c hallenge to the judge’s refusal were regarded as identic al: see _CGU_ at [65]. In that sense, _CGU_ is even more relevant to the present c ase than _North Range_. What was in issue in _CGU_ was whether _North Range_ was dec ided _per incuriam_ inasmuc h as it held that a residual jurisdic tion did exist to remedy a breac h of the Art 6 (of the ECHR) requirement of fair proc ess. Rix LJ, in giving the leading judgment of the c ourt, held at [59] that: 

 ... North Range was not dec ided per incuriam , is binding on this c ourt, and is c orrec t in holding that a residual jurisdic tion exists for reviewing on appeal the misc onduc t or unfairness of a first instanc e judge’s determination c onc erning the grant or refusal of leave to appeal. 

65     Rix LJ, however, went on to analyse the dec ision in _North Range_ , and it was possible in his view to do so “in more than one way” (at [67]). Briefly, the first possible explanation of _North Range_ the learned judge suggested was that s 69 of the English Ac t “c ould be c onstrued all by itself as dealing only with dec isions on the merits, and not with a proc ess undermined by misc onduc t or unfairness” (at [68]). On that basis, the learned judge was of the view that the _Lane v Esdaile_ ([42] _supra_ ) princ iple, whic h was a princ iple of c onstruc tion, c ould be distinguished. The sec ond explanation was that the residual jurisdic tion was c onferred by virtue of the HRA, _ie_ , the sourc e of the jurisdic tion c ould be found in the HRA itself. The third and last possibility, and the one whic h Rix LJ preferred, was an approac h based on a c onstruc tion of s 69 of the English Ac t. He held that the proper interpretation of the judgment in _North Range_ was that the c onstruc tion of s 69 of the English Ac t was modified, in ac c ordanc e with the obligation on judges imposed by the HRA to c onstrue legislation c onsistently with the ECHR, “so as to exc lude from its possible ambit any c hallenge whic h went to misc onduc t or unfairness in the proc ess, as distinc t from the merits of the dec ision” (at [70]) (also s e e _Arbitration Law_ ([63] _supra_ ) at para 21.63). The learned judge’s reasoning is instruc tive and merits a c areful appraisal, at [71]–[72]: 

 In my judgment, it is at least a possible c onstruc tion that sec tion 69(8) is not purporting to deal with appeals from the first instanc e judge on the basis of his own misc onduc t or the unfairness of the proc ess. The whole c ontext of sec tion 69 is an appeal on the merits. ... While it is understandable that a c hallenge to the award based on serious irregularity (affec ting the tribunal, the proc eedings or the award) should be dealt with expressly by the statute, it is equally 


 understandable that the statute does not expressly deal with, indeed it may be said does not c ontemplate, misc onduc t or unfairness (and all misc onduc t is a form of unfairness) by the c ourt. The statute may not c ontemplate suc h failure in the judic ial proc ess, and indeed it is likely to be quite exc eptional and rare, but in theory it may oc c ur. If it should oc c ur, what reason is there for thinking that Parliament intended that it should be swept under the c arpet by the judge’s own power to refuse leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal? The same question arises if the unfairness oc c urs not in the c onduc t of the judic ial appeal at first instanc e, but in the proc ess of c onsidering an applic ation for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. 

 The truth of the matter is: there are all sorts of c ontexts in whic h, for good reason, Parliament has provided that there should be restric tions on the appeal proc ess, and a limit to appellate jurisdic tion. In suc h situations, for the reasons given in Lane v Esdaile , it is natural to c onc lude that, even in the absenc e of express language, the statute intended the lower c ourt’s disc retion as to whether or not to give permission to appeal to a higher c ourt to be exc lusive and final. However, there is no similar rationality, it may be said no good reason at all, for thinking that a court’s unfairness is to be left incapable of appellate review. 

 [emphasis added] 

Ac c ordingly, Rix LJ was of the view that a c hallenge to the refusal of the judge to grant permission to appeal under s 69(6) (or, as the c ase might be, s 69(8)) of the English Ac t c ould not be brought before the English Court of Appeal on the merits of his ruling but it c ould be made where the judge’s dec ision was on proc edural grounds in truth not a dec ision at all: in suc h a c ase, Rix LJ was of the view that the applic ation to the English Court of Appeal was not under s 69 of the English Ac t but rather under s 16(1) of the Supreme Court Ac t 1981 (c 54), whic h provides for the English Court of Appeal to have jurisdic tion “to hear and determine appeals from any judgment or order of the High Court”. 

66     It must also be noted, however, that Rix LJ in _CGU_ was quic k to underline that this residual jurisdic tion would only be exerc ised when there was “not merely an error of law, but suc h a substantial defec t in the fairness of the proc ess as to invalidate the dec ision” (at [79]). In the c ourt’s view, perversity in itself – a dec ision that no reasonable dec ision-maker c ould make – was not enough. It had to be something whic h amounted to unfairness in the proc ess, suc h as dec iding on the basis of a litigant’s skin c olour (at [85]). 

67     We have c overed the position in England in some detail. It must be noted that the statutory requirements of the ECHR and the HRA do not feature at all in our jurisdic tion in the sense that we do not have similar legislation in Singapore. Therefore, this line of c ases and the jurisprudenc e whic h it explic ates must be c arefully read in its proper c ontext. Having said that, however, Rix LJ in _CGU_ astutely pointed out that he was not c onc erned in that c ase “with the width of judic ial review, but with the distinc tion between a dec ision on the merits, right or wrong, and the proc ess by whic h the dec ision is supposedly taken, adequate or flawed by unfairness” (at [46]). In the learned judge’s opinion, the _dictum_ of Mustill LJ in _Aden Refinery_ ([61] _supra_ ) demonstrated, _even before the HRA_ , the limits of the _Lane v Esdaile_ ([42] _supra_ ) princ iple, and “the need for a residual jurisdic tion to deal with misc onduc t or unfairness (or even misc hanc e) in the dec ision making proc ess, if it c an be found c onsistently with the dic tates of the relevant statutes” (at [47]). 

68     In our judgment, when c onsidering s 49 of the Ac t, it is plain that Parliament c ould not have intended any unfair proc ess of the High Court to be absolutely immune from appellate review. In a sc enario where an appeal proc ess has been allowed, this c ourt c annot take the view that even the most egregious situation involving a lower c ourt has been shielded from appellate review. While suc h 


situations will be infrequent, they may nevertheless oc c ur. Do we then throw up our hands and avert our gazes from the injustic e that may have been oc c asioned? We do not think that Parliament would c ondone suc h a paroc hial judic ial attitude (see also _CGU_ at [71]). If there was no “dec ision”, surely this c ourt has the residual disc retion to direc t another judge to hear the applic ation. As c harac terised by Mustill LJ in _Aden Refinery_ at 662: 

 [T]here was no way in whic h Parliament c ould have ac hieved its objec t [of eliminating delays whic h might frustrate the primary purpose of the arbitration statute], for however hard the legislature tried to prevent an appeal, there was no form of words whic h c ould exc lude an overriding disc retion to intervene when the c irc umstanc es are suc h that the judge either failed in any true sense to exerc ise a disc retion, or based his exerc ise on flawed foundations. 

Therefore, in our view, the Court of Appeal has a residual jurisdic tion to enquire into unfairness in the proc ess of a refusal of leave under s 49(11) of the Ac t read together with ss 29A(3) and 29A(4) of the SCJA. We agree that there is a distinc tion to be drawn between a dec ision on the merits and the proc ess by whic h that dec ision is reac hed. Where the Court of Appeal exerc ises this residual jurisdic tion, it does so _only_ to c orrec t the _process_ of dec ision-making of the High Court; it does not purport – indeed, it does not have the jurisdic tion – to interfere with the _merits_ of a dec ision of the High Court. However, and this is a point we c annot over-emphasise, sinc e there is not even the slightest hint of any allegation of proc edural unfairness by the defendant, the issue of an exerc ise of the residual jurisdic tion does not arise in the present c ase. The question of what exac tly will c onstitute proc edural unfairness suc h as to be able to invoke the assistanc e of the c ourt in the exerc ise of its residual jurisdic tion will have to be determined in an appropriate c ase in the future, if and when it so arises. 

69     All that is left for us to do at present is to emphasise the importanc e of what was also said in _North Range_ ([56] _supra_ ) and _CGU_ about the dangers of this residual jurisdic tion being misused. Any inc lination by c ounsel in future c ases, even an unc onsc ious one, to masquerade an unfavourable dec ision as one whic h is not only wrong but arrived at unfairly, should be resolutely resisted unless plainly and amply supported by the fac ts. A failure to rein in an unwarranted inc lination may result in adverse c osts c onsequenc es. We stress that in the nature of things it is likely to be an exc eptionally unusual c ase where the submission of proc essoral unfairness is justifiably advanc ed. The existenc e of this residual jurisdic tion, whic h is nec essary to prevent injustic e, c annot itself be turned on its head to bec ome a forensic tool for undermining the proc ess of arbitration and the legislative intent. 

**Costs** 

70     In view of our finding that this c ourt does not have the jurisdic tion to hear this applic ation, the entire applic ation was flawed _in limine_. In the usual c ourse of events, this should naturally result in c osts being awarded to the plaintiffs. 

71     However, in desc ribing the proc edural history of this applic ation, we have made referenc e to the fac t that the parties had initially _agreed_ that this c ourt had the jurisdic tion to hear suc h an applic ation. Indeed, at the end of the hearing of this applic ation when we had to dec ide the question of c osts, Mr Sreenivasan forthrightly ac knowledged the role he had played in this befuddled applic ation. When asked what would be a fair c osts order, Mr Sreenivasan replied that he was only seeking to rec eive half of the c osts of the entire applic ation. Mr Lok submitted in reply that sinc e the c ourt had only substantively dealt with the jurisdic tion point, he urged the c ourt not to award the entire amount of his opponent’s c osts. He suggested that an order for a quarter of the c osts be granted. 


72     We agreed with Mr Sreenivasan that an order for the defendant to pay half of the c osts of the entire applic ation was appropriate in the c irc umstanc es. Both c ounsel had spent c onsiderable time and effort in preparing for their respec tive c ases on the merits of the applic ation for leave to appeal. This work was c ompleted before we invited c ounsel to make submissions on the preliminary jurisdic tional issues. Even though we did not hear any arguments on the merits of the applic ation proper, we are of the view that sinc e substantial work was done, the defendant having been unsuc c essful with this applic ation should be made to bear half of the c osts of the entire applic ation with the usual c onsequential orders to apply. 

**Conclusion** 

73     We now summarise our views: 

 (a) An applic ation under s 49(11) of the Ac t for leave to appeal against a dec ision of the High Court on the merits of an appeal against an arbitration award c annot be brought to the Court of Appeal. 

 (b) Where the High Court has made its dec ision either to allow or to refuse leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal under s 49(11) of the Ac t, that dec ision is final. Sec tion 49(7) of the Ac t does not have any applic ation in suc h a sc enario. 

 (c ) Sec tion 52(3)( b ) of the Ac t c onfirms that the Court of Appeal has the same jurisdic tion and powers as the High Court when hearing an applic ation for leave to appeal from an arbitration award. However, this provision only applies if the High Court has granted prior leave to appeal pursuant to s 49(7) of the Ac t in relation to its initial dec ision either granting or refusing leave to appeal from an arbitration award. 

 (d) The Court of Appeal has a residual jurisdic tion to deal with any unfairness in the dec ision-making proc ess in the High Court in relation to an appeal from an arbitration award. However, the situations in whic h this may oc c ur will have to be exc eptional. 

 (e) For the avoidanc e of doubt, nothing in this dec ision affec ts the right of a party to make an applic ation to the High Court under s 48 of the Ac t to set aside an arbitration award and thereafter the unfettered right of appeal to the Court of Appeal. 

74     For these reasons, we dismissed the applic ation.
