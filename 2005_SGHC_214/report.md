**Tan Lee Meng J:** 

1       The petitioning c reditors, Mr Lek Benedic t (“Lek”) and Mr Lim Wee Chuan (“Lim”), appealed against the dec ision of the assistant registrar, Mr Vinc ent Leow, to stay their bankruptc y proc eedings against Mdm Tang Yoke Kheng (“Mdm Tang”) on c ondition that the money owed by Mdm Tang to Lek and Lim is paid into c ourt. 

**Background** 

2       Mdm Tang and her husband, Mr Chan Chon Tuc k, were ordered to pay c osts when Suit No 864 of 2003, whic h they instituted against Lek and Lim for c onduc ting a business with intent to defraud c reditors, was dismissed in September 2004 by Andrew Ang JC (as he then was), whose dec ision (see _Tang Yoke Kheng v Lek Benedict (No 2)_ [2004] 4 SLR 788) was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The bankruptc y proc eedings initiated by Lek and Lim against Mdm Tang relate to the nonpayment of the c osts of the dismissed ac tion. 

3       For a better understanding of the assistant registrar’s dec ision to stay the bankruptc y proc eedings on terms, the bac kground of the dismissed ac tion and of an earlier suit, Suit No 21 of 2002, must be c onsidered. Mdm Tang traded in Bohemian c rystal goods under the name of her c ompany, “Niklex Supply Company”. She was the princ ipal supplier of suc h goods to Amrae Benc huan Trading Pte Ltd (“Amrae”), of whic h Lek and Lim are shareholders and direc tors. 

4       Amrae, whic h paid Mdm Tang more than $5m for Bohemian c rystal goods, made its last purc hase from Mdm Tang in Dec ember 1999. The goods that were ordered were delivered in February and April 2000. From about that time, Amrae, whic h still owed Mdm Tang a substantial amount of money for unpaid goods, obtained its supplies from other sourc es. Lek said that he and Lim feared that Mdm Tang would wind up Amrae. As suc h, in June 2001, they bought a shelf c ompany, c alled Axum. Lim said that a new c ompany was required to obtain goods from new suppliers at c heaper pric es so as to earn better profits to pay off Amrae’s debts. 

5       Between July 2001 and June 2002, Amrae sold to Axum $1,268,983.02 worth of Bohemian c rystal goods. Although Axum paid Amrae $713,831.38 for the goods, not a single c ent was paid to Mdm Tang. Instead, the money was utiltised by Lek and Lim to pay themselves, _inter alia_ , bac kdated 


direc tors’ fees under c irc umstanc es where a question as to unfair preferenc e by an insolvent c ompany arose. 

6       Mdm Tang instituted Suit No 21 of 2002 to rec over around $1.5m from Amrae. On 21 August 2002, she obtained judgment for $245,226.02 for part of her c laim and on 5 September 2002, a c onsent judgment was entered against Amrae for the sum of $821,000.00. The total sum awarded to Mdm Tang in Suit No 21 of 2002 was thus $1,066,226.02. 

7       Mdm Tang only managed to rec over $59,710.46 from Amrae by way of a Sheriff’s sale. This left more than $1m of the judgment debt unsatisfied. On 19 September 2003, Mdm Tang obtained a winding-up order against Amrae. 

8       Mdm Tang’s next move to rec over the money still owed to her by Amrae proved to be a c ostly mistake. On 25 September 2003, she c ommenc ed Suit No 864 of 2003 against Amrae’s direc tors, Lek and Lim. Numerous allegations of fraud were made, inc luding a c laim that Lek and Lim c aused Amrae to c ontinue trading with her even though they knew that their c ompany was insolvent and that they c aused the dissipation of Amrae’s assets by, _inter alia_ , paying salaries and bonuses to themselves in 2000 and 2001 when the c ompany was already insolvent. 

9       As far as the allegation of undue preferenc e is c onc erned, the trial judge, Andrew Ang JC, who noted that Amrae did not use any part of the $713,831.38 it rec eived from Axum to pay Mdm Tang, observed in [23] of his judgment as follows: 

 [Amrae] c ould have used the money to keep up instalment payments to the plaintiff but did not. I am not persuaded by the first and sec ond defendants’ reasons for stopping the instalment payments. In my view, at the time these repayments of loans were made, [Amrae] was already insolvent, the plaintiff’s demand of 31 January 2001 not having been met. ... A case could well be made out for saying that in making these and other payments (such as the payment of directors’ fees accrued from previous years) [Amrae] was unfairly preferring the defendants over the plaintiff. [emphasis added] 

10     Ang JC also noted that in many instanc es, money paid by Amrae to Lek and Lim was c hannelled by way of loan or otherwise to Axum, whic h then paid bac k the money to Amrae on the very same day or shortly thereafter to reduc e the outstanding amount owed by Axum to Amrae. In other words, the money “simply went one full c irc le”. All the same, the trail judge held that however “strongly suggestive of unfair preferenc e they may be”, the fac ts were insuffic ient to warrant a finding that Lek and Lim were liable for fraudulent trading under s 340(1) of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed). Mdm Tang’s appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed: see _Tang Yoke Kheng v Lek Benedict_ [2005] 3 SLR 263. 

11     The taxed c osts for Mdm Tang’s failed ac tion against Lek and Lim were adjusted to $181,698.98 on 3 February 2005. M/s Lim Ang John & Tan LLC, solic itors for Lek and Lim, served a statutory demand on Mdm Tang on 7 February 2005. A Bankruptc y Petition was filed on 10 Marc h 2005 and served on 16 Marc h 2005. At a bankruptc y hearing on 27 May 2005, Mdm Tang paid $26,000 and sought an adjournment. The balanc e due to Lek and Lim remains unpaid. 

12     It is pertinent to note at this junc ture that on 9 June 2005, Amrae’s liquidator c ommenc ed Suit No 424 of 2005 against Lek, Lim and Axum for the rec overy of preferential payments to them. As Mdm Tang is Amrae’s main c reditor, she stands to gain if the liquidator suc c eeds in his ac tion against Lek, Lim and Axum. 


**The assistant registrar’s decision** 

13     Before the assistant registrar, Mdm Tang, who applied for a stay of the bankruptc y proc eedings, with or without terms, c ontended that in dec iding whether to allow the bankruptc y proc eedings to c ontinue, the unusual c irc umstanc es of her c ase ought to be taken into ac c ount. In paras 30 and 31 of her affidavit filed on 8 June 2005, she stated: 

 I understand from the Liquidator [of Amrae] that in his preliminary findings, ... there is c learly a sum of $419,435.93 and $280,229.00 whic h was paid up to the Direc tors when the c ompany was c learly insolvent, evidenc ing preferential payments. There is also a sum of $400,000 whic h is due from Axum to [Amrae] ... 

 I verily believe that when the Liquidator finishes his investigations, the amount to be [c ollec ted] bac k from [Lek and Lim] will be muc h higher. 

14     Mdm Tang pointed out that she is Amrae’s main c reditor and that the only two other c reditors of that c ompany are Lek and Lim, whose c laims have to be studied very c losely by the c ompany’s liquidator. As suc h, she was effec tively the main benefic iary of any amount that Amrae’s liquidator rec overs from Lek, Lim and Axum. She also pointed out that she is the person financ ing the liquidator’s ac tion against Lek, Lim and Axum and if she is made a bankrupt, Lek and Lim, who c laim to be Amrae’s c reditors, are not going to financ e an ac tion by the liquidator against themselves. She ac c used Lek and Lim of trying to bankrupt her so as to ensure that Amrae’s liquidator is left with no funds to c ontinue his suit against them. 

15     The assistant registrar stayed the bankruptc y proc eedings pending the outc ome of the liquidator’s c laim against Lek and Lim but on c ondition that the money owed by Mdm Tang to Lek and Lim be paid into c ourt. In his notes, he explained the basis for his dec ision as follows: 

 The position is that the petitioning c reditor here may potentially owe substantial sums to [Amrae] and that the debtors here are substantial c reditors of [Amrae] ... [Mdm Tang and Chan] plead that if they are made bankrupt, then the liquidator of Amrae will not be able to proc eed against the petitioning c reditors bec ause they being the main c reditors of [Amrae] are the ones funding the liquidator. Henc e, they c ontend that this is an abuse of proc ess ... 

16     It was agreed by the parties that $200,000.00 was due to Lek and Lim and this sum has sinc e been paid into c ourt. Dissatisfied with the outc ome of the hearing, Lek and Lim appealed against the assistant registrar’s dec ision. 

**The appeal** 

17     Lek and Lim asserted that there is no reason why Mdm Tang should be allowed to avoid paying taxed c osts at this junc ture. They referred to the following passage from MPH Rubin J’s judgment in _Sia Leng Yuen v Ko Chun Shun Johnson (No 2)_ [2003] 4 SLR 128 at [18]: 

 Costs, as defined in Black’s Law Dictionary (6th Ed), refer to “pec uniary allowanc e, made to the suc c essful party (and rec overable from the losing party), for his expenses in prosec uting or defending an ac tion or a distinc t proc eeding within an ac tion”. It was no more than just a reimbursement of expenses inc urred and resourc es laid out. In my view, exc eptional c irc umstanc es should be shown to the c ourt to delay or postpone suc h an element of reimbursement. 


18     Sec tion 64(1) of the Bankruptc y Ac t (Cap 20, 2000 Rev Ed), whic h gives the c ourt the power to stay or dismiss proc eedings in bankruptc y proc eedings, provides as follows: 

 The c ourt may at any time, for suffic ient reason, make an order staying the proc eedings on a bankruptc y petition, either altogether or for a limited time, on suc h terms and c onditions as the c ourt may think just. 

19     The question before the c ourt is whether or not there is suffic ient reason for the bankruptc y proc eedings to be stayed on the terms imposed by the assistant registrar. In _Re E E Manasseh_ [1938] MLJ 225, the Straits Settlements Court of Appeal stayed bankruptc y proc eedings on terms. In this c ase, the judgment c reditor, who suc c essfully defended himself in an ac tion by the plaintiff, instituted bankruptc y proc eedings against the latter when he was not paid the c osts of the ac tion, whic h amounted to $6,724.95. In the meantime, the plaintiff lodged an appeal against the dismissal of his ac tion. Mc Elwaine CJ, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, ordered a stay of the bankruptc y proc eedings on c ondition that the plaintiff deposited in c ourt sec urity for the c osts of the appeal, whic h were estimated at $3,500. 

20     Admittedly, in the present c ase, the c osts that are due to Lek and Lim relate to an ac tion that has already had the c onsideration of the Court of Appeal and Mdm Tang is not a party to the ac tion instituted by Amrae’s liquidator against Lek and Lim. All the same, in the rather unusual c irc umstanc es of this c ase, Amrae’s liquidator’s ac tion ought not to be ignored. Mdm Tang rightly pointed out that the reality of the situation is that if the liquidator of Amrae suc c eeds in his ac tion against Lek and Lim, the two of them will have to pay to her a very muc h larger sum than the $200,000 that she owes them for the c osts of her failed ac tion against them. She reiterated that she is, as Amrae’s main c reditor, financ ing the liquidator’s c laim against Lek and Lim and that Lek and Lim were using the present bankruptc y proc eedings to bankrupt her so that Amrae’s liquidator would be without funds to c ontinue the ac tion against them to rec over the amount they paid themselves at a time when the c ompany was already insolvent. 

21     In Suit No 864 of 2003, Ang JC rightly pointed out that Lek and Lim c ould have ensured that money paid to Amrae by Axum be paid to Mdm Tang but they did not do so as muc h of it went into their own poc kets. In seeking to persuade the c ourt to lift the stay on the bankruptc y proc eedings, Lek and Lim asserted that Amrae’s liquidator’s c laim against them has no realistic prospec t of suc c ess. This c ontention is a self-serving one. Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal c ommented on the propriety of many of the payments by Amrae to Lek and Lim. Indeed, at [27] of his judgment, Ang JC, who made it c lear that he was dismissing Mdm Tang’s c laim against Lim and Lek “with some regret”, went so far as to add: 

 It is still open to the plaintiff to request the Offic ial Rec eiver (or any other liquidator appointed in his stead) to c onsider instituting proc eedings against any c reditors who may have been unfairly preferred for the rec overy of moneys paid by the Company. I am unable to say more as the question whether or not there had been unfair preferenc e was not before me. [emphasis added] 

22     It is also worth noting that when c ommenting on the dec ision of Ang JC, Choo Han Tec k J, who delivered the judgement of the Court of Appeal, said at [5] as follows: 

 The trial judge ac c epted that the money rec eived by [Amrae] was used to pay direc tors’ fees ac c rued over the years rather than to pay the appellant. On these fac ts, the trial judge c ould infer that the Company indulged in fraudulent trading, or that it had merely exerc ised undue preferenc e to one c reditor over another. The trial judge inferred that it was the latter. 


23     In the present c ase, there are exc eptional c irc umstanc es to warrant a stay of the bankruptc y petition against Mdm Tang even though this may result in a delay in her payment of c osts to Lek and Lim. Pending the dec ision of the High Court on the c laim against Lek and Lim by Amrae’s liquidator, their position is safeguarded as Mdm Tang has already paid $200,000 into c ourt. The appeal against the assistant registrar’s dec ision was thus dismissed with c osts.
