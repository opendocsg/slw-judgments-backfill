### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

**_Introduction_** 

The appellant was tried and c onvic ted in the distric t c ourt on the following two c harges: 

 DAC 55982/2001 – 

 You, AMIR HAMZAH BIN BERANG KUTTY, M/28 yrs, NRIC 

 No.: S7320354F, are c harged that you, in the month of April 2001, in Singapore, did engage with one Saravanan A/L Kaliannan, in a c onspirac y to c ommit c riminal breac h of trust as a servant, and in pursuanc e of that c onspirac y and in order to c ommit c riminal breac h of trust as a servant, an ac t took plac e between April and September 2001, at M/s Seagate Tec hnology International loc ated at No. 16 Woodlands Loop, Singapore, to wit, Saravanan A/L Kaliannan, employed as a servant with Seagate Tec hnology International, entrusted in that c apac ity with 48 piec es of used ‘Heraeus’ platinum targets with a total value of about US$469,800, c ommitted breac h of trust by dishonestly 


 misappropriating the said property, whic h ac t was c ommitted in pursuanc e of your abetment, and you have thereby c ommitted an offenc e punishable under sec tion 408 read with sec tion 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. 

 DAC 57462/2001 – 

 You, AMIR HAMZAH BIN BERANG KUTTY, M/28 yrs, NRIC No. : S7320354F, are c harged that you, in the month of Marc h 2001, in Singapore, at Woodlands Central Mac Donald’s, Singapore, did dishonestly retain stolen property, to wit, two piec es of ‘Tosoh’ platinum targets valued at a total of US$7,000, belonging to M/s Seagate Tec hnology International, having reason to believe the same to be stolen property, and that you thereby c ommitted an offenc e punishable under Sec tion 411 of the Penal Code. 

2       Six other c harges against the appellant were initially stood down but the DPP applied for them to be taken into c onsideration later in the trial. For the first c harge, the trial judge sentenc ed him to five years’ imprisonment and for the sec ond c harge, he was sentenc ed to 18 months’ imprisonment. The trial judge ordered the sentenc es to run c onsec utively, bringing the total imprisonment period to six and a half years. The other six c harges were taken into c onsideration for the purposes of sentenc ing. 

3       The appellant appealed against both c onvic tion and sentenc e. After hearing c ounsels’ arguments, I dismissed both the appeal against c onvic tion and sentenc e. I now give my reasons. 

**_The case for the prosecution_** 

4       At the trial below, the prosec ution led evidenc e from six witnesses through c onditioned statements as well as by oral testimony. The most c ruc ial evidenc e against the appellant c ame from PW1 Saravanan A/L Kaliannan ("Saravanan") and PW3 Kumar s/o Srinivasan ("Kumar"). 

_Saravanan’s statements_ 

5       At the material time, Saravanan was working in Seagate Tec hnology International ("Seagate") as an assistant tec hnic ian. His job sc ope inc luded the operation of a sputter mac hine (used to sputter media disc s used in the produc tion of hard disks). As part of his job, he was in c harge of sending the used targets to the vendor to be rec laimed. The vendor to Seagate at the material time was Heraeus Prec ision Engineering Pte Ltd ("Heraeus"). 

6       Saravanan testified that, sometime in Marc h 2001, the appellant had c ontac ted him and asked him to steal used platinum targets from Seagate, whic h would then be shipped to Japan. The appellant promised to pay Saravanan $250 for eac h target. At this point, Saravanan refused to take part in the sc heme. 

7       Two days later, the appellant approac hed Saravanan with the same suggestion. Instead, Saravanan c ame up with a c ounter proposal and offered to sell to the appellant two used platinum targets from another manufac turer, Tosoh ("‘Tosoh’ targets") whic h he had misappropriated sometime in November 2000. The appellant agreed to buy the ‘Tosoh’ targets for $200 eac h and the two 


arranged to meet up in two days’ time at the Woodlands Central Mc Donald’s restaurant. 

8       At the meeting, the appellant ac c epted the two ‘Tosoh’ targets and paid Saravanan $400. (It was agreed at trial that the value of eac h of these ‘Tosoh’ targets referred to in DAC 57462/2001 was US$3,500 eac h.) On this oc c asion, the appellant onc e again brought up the idea of stealing used Heraeus targets. Saravanan stated that the appellant managed to c onvinc e him that he (Saravanan) would not get c aught, so Saravanan agreed to the plan. 

9       A week later, the appellant c alled Saravanan at work and asked if there were extra targets for him. Saravanan c onfirmed that there were and the appellant went to Seagate. Two used targets were passed over to him. Saravanan stated that subsequently he would pass the used Heraeus targets to Kumar, Heraeus’s driver. On these oc c asions, he would get a white envelope from Kumar, whic h c ontained money that the appellant had asked Kumar to pass to him. 

10     Sometime in November 2001, when it bec ame evident to Seagate that targets had been stolen, Saravanan met the appellant at one Farmart Seafood Restaurant where Saravanan was paid a final $1,000 and was assured by the appellant that all the targets had been shipped to Japan. 

11     Saravanan pleaded guilty to the c harge of c ommitting c riminal breac h of trust as a servant by dishonestly misappropriating 48 used platinum targets. He was c onvic ted on 4 Marc h 2002 and sentenc ed to four years’ imprisonment. Another c harge of c riminal misappropriation of two ‘Tosoh’ used platinum targets was taken into c onsideration. Saravanan was serving sentenc e when he gave evidenc e for the prosec ution against the appellant. 

_Kumar’s statements_ 

12     At the material time, Kumar was a driver for Heraeus. His job sc ope at that time inc luded sending new targets to, and c ollec ting used targets from, Seagate. He gave evidenc e that from around Marc h 2001, Saravanan would give him a few used targets that were not registered or rec orded in the returned targets invoic e. He also gave evidenc e that on some of these oc c asions, the appellant would inform him just before the c ollec tion that there would be targets for experiments and that he was to c ollec t them from Saravanan. 

13     He stated that he made about ten suc h trips where he c ollec ted used targets that were not registered or rec orded in the returned target invoic e. On eac h oc c asion, there would be between two to four suc h extra targets. 

14     More importantly, he stated that on a few oc c asions, before he left for Seagate, the appellant would pass him a white envelope bearing the c ompany’s letterhead and that the appellant instruc ted him on these oc c asions to hand over the envelope to the appellant. He stated that he delivered them to Saravanan as he was told. 

15     Kumar stated that, upon returning to the offic e from suc h trips, he would deliver the used targets either to the storeman, one Thanabal, or to the appellant personally. He also stated that on two suc h oc c asions, upon returning to the offic e with the used targets, the appellant taught him how to weigh the used targets. The appellant then asked him to switc h them with heavier used targets (sc heduled to be returned to the United States) whic h had been properly rec orded in the invoic e. However, he c ould not remember exac tly how many of suc h targets he had switc hed on the appellant’s instruc tions. 

16     Sometime in Oc tober 2001, Kumar rec eived a phone c all from the appellant while he was in 


the offic e. He stated that the appellant told him to take six piec es of the used targets whic h the appellant was keeping under the table and to put them on the false c eiling in his offic e. When asked why he needed to do this, the appellant told Kumar that he did not want the representatives from Seagate to find out that the six targets were in the c ompany. 

_Statements from other witnesses_ 

17     Apart from Saravanan and Kumar, three other prosec ution witnesses gave evidenc e whic h implic ated the appellant. PW6 Tan Wee Kiat ("Tan"), a Seagate investigator, gave evidenc e that he lodged a polic e report on 30 November 2001 when he notic ed that there were 48 used targets missing from Seagate’s inventory. PW7 Senior Investigating Offic e Javier Neo ("Neo") was assigned to the c ase. On 3 Dec ember 2001, Neo was informed by Kumar that the appellant had instruc ted him to hide the six platinum targets in the false c eiling. Neo ac ted on the information and raided the Heraeus offic e where the six targets were rec overed. Tan c onfirmed that the serial numbers of these six targets matc hed those of the platinum targets missing from Seagate. 

18     PW2 Perabu A/L Natarajan ("Perabu") gave evidenc e that the appellant had asked him to photoc opy c ertific ates of analysis for the used targets whic h had been c ollec ted. It was also Perabu’s evidenc e that this was not the usual prac tic e. The prosec ution also adduc ed evidenc e from PW Krishnamoorthy Ramesh ("Ramesh") who gave evidenc e that sometime in Oc tober 2001, when the Seagate investigators had asked for doc uments pertaining to the lost platinum targets, the appellant asked him to c over all the pen markings on the used target logsheets before photoc opying them. He also c onfirmed that the used platinum targets were handed direc tly to the appellant on a number of oc c asions. Tan stated that, had he seen the handwritten markings on the used target logsheets whic h Ramesh was asked to c over up, he would have immediately c onc luded that someone in Heraeus was involved in the theft. 

**_The defence_** 

19     The appellant’s defenc e on both c harges in the c ourt below was that he was not the mastermind of the c onspirac y. Rather, he was merely c arrying out the instruc tions of his superior, one Ramac handran Viswanathan ("Ram"). Ram was a direc tor of Heraeus at the material time. In his examination-in-c hief, he alleged that he met with Saravanan at the Mc Donald’s restaurant on instruc tion from Ram. However, he did not c all on Ram to give evidenc e to support his c ase. 

20     He also denied that he had c alled Saravanan at the latter’s offic e to c hec k on the quantity of used targets for c ollec tion. He insisted that the standard proc edure was for Seagate to send an email to Heraeus regarding the number of targets to be c ollec ted. Henc e, there was no need for him to c all Saravanan. However, he admitted that he was aware of used targets being taken out by Saravanan and being passed to Heraeus but he alleged onc e again that this was done on the instruc tion of Ram. 

21     As for his c onduc t vis--vis Kumar, he admitted that he did ask Kumar to weigh the used targets and to switc h the heavier ones meant to be shipped to the US and replac e them with lighter ones passed over by Saravanan. Yet again, he alleged that he did this on the instruc tions of Ram, who was not c alled to substantiate his allegations. 

22     As for explaining why he had asked Kumar to move the six targets to the false c eiling, he c laimed that that was done on the instruc tions of his new boss, one Dan Holland. As was the c ase with Ram, the appellant did not c all Dan Holland as a witness. More importantly, he failed to mention the Dan Holland’s involvement in this episode in his statement to the polic e. When asked to explain his 


inc onsistenc y during c ross-examination, he said that he had lied to the polic e in his earlier statement bec ause he was under a Non-Disc losure Agreement with the c ompany and he did not want to reveal anything whic h might be in c ontravention of that agreement. 

23     The appellant c alled on DW2 Veeravalli Raghavan ("Raghavan"), a direc tor of Nishtha Engineering Pte Ltd, a c ompany dealing with elec tric al and elec tronic c omponents. He gave evidenc e that he had rec eived 42 used targets from Ram and that Ram had given him instruc tions to c ut those targets into smaller parts. However, he gave evidenc e to the effec t that he did not c hec k the serial numbers of the targets that Ram had handed over to him. The appellant’s c ontention was that these 42 targets were the ones whic h had been stolen from Seagate. 

24     However, during c ross-examination of Raghavan, the DPP sought to admit a list (obtained from Heraeus’ rec ords) c ontaining the serial numbers of the 42 targets that had been handed over to Raghavan. This list was admitted without objec tion from defenc e c ounsel. It was the DPP’s submission that none of those serial numbers matc hed those that were missing from Seagate. As suc h, the 48 targets handed over to Raghavan c ould not have been part of the 48 stolen targets. 

**_The decision of the trial judge below_** 

25     In examining Saravanan’s statements, the trial judge was mindful of the fac t that Saravanan was an ac c omplic e and thus sc rutinised his statement with c aution. He c onc eded that there were some inc onsistenc ies in Saravanan’s statements but found these inc onsistenc ies to be minor and that they did not disc redit his entire evidenc e. He noted that Saravanan had already been dealt with for the offenc es that he had c ommitted. He also observed that the defenc e did not advanc e reasons as to why Saravanan should implic ate the appellant if what Saravanan had stated was not the truth. On those two c ounts, he ac c epted the evidenc e of Saravanan. 

26     He also c hose not to ac c ept the appellant’s defenc e. He found diffic ulty in ac c epting various parts of his evidenc e in c ross-examination where he merely gave a series of ‘I do not know’ answers to pertinent questions. For example, he was asked whether it would be very suspic ious for an assistant tec hnic ian like Saravanan to sell two used Tosoh targets to him without any proper doc umentation. His reply was, "I do not know." He noted that the appellant was not a nave person but was an experienc ed person in this line of business. Thus, the trial judge found his ambivalent answers to be a mere pretenc e in an attempt to avoid answering those questions. More importantly, he found that although the appellant had c laimed that he was ac ting on the instruc tions of Ram and Dan Holland, he did not c all them to substantiate his bare allegations. 

27     Consequently, he c onvic ted the appellant on both c harges and sentenc ed him to a total of six and a half years imprisonment after taking into ac c ount the appellant’s mitigation plea. The notes of evidenc e showed that the trial judge took into ac c ount the following fac tors in sentenc ing the appellant: 

 (a) The seriousness of the offenc es c ommitted by the appellant and the penalty presc ribed by law for suc h offenc es; 

 (b) The fac ts of the c ase as revealed by the evidenc e, inc luding the nature and the value of the property involved and the period over whic h the offenc es were c ommitted; 

 (c ) The six c harges taken into c onsideration for the 


 purposes of sentenc e; 

 (d) The sentenc e meted out to his ac c omplic e, Saravanan; 

 (e) The mitigation plea made by c ounsel, in partic ular that the appellant had no antec edents; 

 (f) That the appellant appeared to be the mastermind of the c onspirac y and that he did not appear to be remorseful for what he had done during the c onduc t of his defenc e. Moreover, he noted that the appellant blamed his c ompany’s management for his various ac tivities. 

**_The appeal against conviction_** 

28     Counsel for the appellant raised the following issues on appeal against c onvic tion: 

 (a) Whether the prosec ution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that Saravanan dishonestly appropriated 48 piec es of used Heraeus targets as stated in the c harge; 

 (b) Whether the trial judge had erred both in law and in fac t in his finding that the appellant had engaged in a c onspirac y with Saravanan to c ommit c riminal breac h of trust; and 

 (c ) Whether the prosec ution failed to prove that the 48 targets whic h were stolen were entrusted to Saravanan. 

 (d) As for the sec ond c harge, whether the trial judge had erred in law by failing to give the appellant the benefit of doubt sinc e it was Ram who gave instruc tions for the c ollec tion of the stolen targets from Seagate. 

**_Whether the prosecution had proven the exact number of targets in the charge beyond reasonable doubt_** 

29     Counsel argued that the prosec ution did not manage to prove all 48 targets had been misappropriated. He painstakingly tried to show that, from the statements of the witnesses, nobody c ould be sure that there were exac tly 48 targets involved in the whole transac tion. For example, he pointed out that Kumar, in his oral evidenc e, said that the total number of targets c ould have been about 35. 

30     I was of the view that the disc repanc y involved here was immaterial. This was partic ularly so bec ause Saravanan, the princ ipal offender, in his c autioned statement, stated: 

 In total I have stolen at least 40 used platinum targets from the c ompany and I had sold all of them to Amir [the ac c used]. (emphasis added) 

31     I was also mindful of the fac t that Saravanan, the princ ipal offender, had pleaded guilty to a c harge under s 408 of the Penal Code involving exac tly 48 targets. This was very strong evidenc e 


that the number of targets in the c harge had been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Further, the defenc e did not raise any evidenc e both here and in the trial below to show that some of those 48 targets had been passed to a person other than the appellant. Therefore, I rejec ted this argument from the appellant’s c ounsel and found that the prosec ution had proven the number of targets in the c harge beyond reasonable doubt. 

**_Whether the appellant had engaged in a conspiracy with Saravanan to commit criminal breach of trust_** 

32     Next, c ounsel argued that the trial judge erred in law and in fac t in finding that the appellant had engaged in a c onspirac y with Saravanan to c ommit c riminal breac h of trust. For this argument, he relied on a number of c ontentions. 

_Whether the appellant had to be the mastermind of the conspiracy_ 

33     First, he tried to show that the appellant was not the mastermind of the c onspirac y but merely c arrying out the instruc tions of Ram. He relied on the evidenc e from Kumar where he stated that on one of the oc c asions, he had passed the targets to Ram instead of the appellant. 

34     I found this c ontention to be unmeritorious. For the c harge of abetting Saravanan in c ommitting c riminal breac h of trust by c onspirac y, the prosec ution had to establish the following elements under s 107(b) of the Penal Code: 

 (a) the person abetting must engage with one or more other persons in a c onspirac y; 

 (b) the c onspirac y must be for the doing of the thing abetted; and 

 (c ) an ac t or illegal omission must take plac e in pursuanc e of the c onspirac y. 

Sec tion 107(b) of the Penal Code not require the ac c used person to be the mastermind before a c harge for abetment by c onspirac y c an be proved. The fac t that the appellant may not have been the mastermind was therefore irrelevant. 

35     In any c ase, I found that the allegations that Ram was the mastermind to be c ompletely unsubstantiated. The appellant did not c all Ram as a witness to support his allegation and the trial judge was c orrec t in disbelieving the appellant’s allegations in the absenc e of c orroboration from Ram. I saw no reason to disturb that finding. 

_Accomplice evidence_ 

36     Counsel proc eeded to argue that Saravanan’s testimony was highly unbelievable and should not form the basis of the appellant’s c onvic tion. I found that there was little merit in this argument as well. An issue arose here bec ause Saravanan was the appellant’s ac c omplic e. However, I found that the trial judge’s approac h to Saravanan’s testimony was beyond reproac h. 

37     The law on the treatment of evidenc e of ac c omplic es in Singapore is very well settled. In _Tan Hung Yeoh v PP_ <span class="citation">[1999] 3 SLR 93</span>, I held that the c ourt may c onvic t an ac c used person based on the unc orroborated evidenc e of an ac c omplic e: see, for example, **_Chua Poh Kiat Anthony v PP_** **<span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 713</span> and** **_Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP_** **<span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 592</span>**. The c orroboration warning against 


an ac c omplic e's evidenc e is no longer mandatory in law: s 135 Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97). All that the c ourt is required to do is to treat the evidenc e of an ac c omplic e with c aution as the ac c omplic e may, not must, be presumed to be unworthy of c redit: see s 116 illustration (b) Evidenc e Ac t and **_Chua Poh Kiat Anthony v PP_** , **_Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP_**. 

38     Here, it was evident that the trial judge had c autioned himself that Saravanan was an ac c omplic e and he had metic ulously perused the evidenc e before him before c oming to the c onc lusion to believe Saravanan’s testimony. It is trite law that an appellate c ourt will not disturb a trial judge’s findings of fac t, partic ularly when they are based on the assessment of c redibility of witnesses. This is so bec ause the appellate c ourt does not have the opportunity of examining the witnesses: see _Arts Niche Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">[1999] 4 SLR 111</span>. Further, I c ould see no reason or inc entive for Saravanan to implic ate the appellant in a bid to reduc e his own c omplic ity in the affair. Before the appellant’s trial, Saravanan had pleaded guilty to a c harge under s 408 of the Penal Code and was sentenc ed to four years’ imprisonment. At the time of the appellant’s trial, Saravanan gave evidenc e while he was serving his sentenc e. Like the trial judge, I c ould see no reason to disbelieve his testimony and I rejec ted c ounsel’s argument on this ground. 

_Whether the targets sold to Raghavan by Ram could have been part of the 48 misappropriated targets_ 

39     Next, c ounsel sought to distanc e the appellant from the c rime by asking the c ourt to draw an inferenc e that the 42 targets whic h Ram sold to Raghavan for c utting formed part of the 48 targets that had been misappropriated from Seagate. I saw no merit in this argument. This argument was highly spec ulative and c ounsel adduc ed no evidenc e to substantiate the verac ity of his allegation. 

40     On the c ontrary, the prosec ution adduc ed a list of serial numbers of targets that had been sold to Raghavan from Heraeus’ rec ords (Exhibit P24). Raghavan testified that P24 was indeed a list of serial numbers of the targets that had been sold to his c ompany but he stated that he did not c hec k to see if the serial numbers of the targets matc hed those that were given in the list. The prosec ution then pointed out that none of the serial numbers in P24 matc hed those of the targets that were missing from Seagate. I found the evidenc e adduc ed by the prosec ution in P24 to be suffic iently c onvinc ing to rebut the inferenc e that c ounsel sought to draw. 

41     Further, c ounsel tried to argue that the list in P24 c ontained a list of fic titious numbers c ooked up by Ram in order to c over up the whole sc heme. I found this argument to be extremely unmeritorious. It has to be noted that in the trial below, P24 was admitted with the c ounsel’s c onsent after a c opy of the exhibit had been served on him. Therefore, under s 60(1) of the Evidenc e Ac t, P24 was deemed to be admitted without the need of proof. Sec tion 60(1) of the Evidenc e Ac t states: 

 No fac t need be proved in any proc eeding whic h the parties thereto or their agents agree to admit at the hearing or whic h before the hearing they agree to admit by any writing under their hands, or whic h by any rule of pleading in forc e at the time they are deemed to have admitted by their pleadings. 

42     Having c onsented to the admission of the doc ument, I found that c ounsel was prec luded from c hallenging the verac ity of that doc ument on appeal. Consequently, I found his allegation that P c ontained a list of fic titious numbers to be a display of c ounsel’s lac k of adequate preparation of the c ase prior to the appeal. 

_Failure to call Thanabal the storeman as a witness_ 


43     Counsel proc eeded to argue that the failure to c all on Thanabal the storeman prejudic ed the c ase for the appellant. He sought to argue that Thanabal would have been material in demonstrating that Ram was also involved in the c onspirac y bec ause Ram had given Thanabal c ertain instruc tions to keep the stolen targets. It appeared to me that c ounsel was trying to argue that an adverse inferenc e should have been drawn against the prosec ution’s failure to c all on Thanabal under s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidenc e Ac t. 

44     It appeared to me that this was but another one of c ounsel’s many valiant attempts at raising issues in the hope that he would end up with a meritorious ground. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. I failed to see how the prosec ution’s failure to c all on Thanabal as a witness c ould have possibly prejudic ed the appellant’s c ase. It is trite law that the prosec ution is entitled to dec ide whic h witnesses it wishes to c all. If the prosec ution does not c all on a partic ular material witness, the prosec ution bears the risk that the c ase against the appellant is not proven beyond reasonable doubt. 

45     After a perusal of the evidenc e and the c irc umstanc es under whic h this c ase arose, I was of the view that Thanabal’s testimony would have added little to the c ase. As I have observed above, in a c harge of abetment by c onspirac y, it is not nec essary for the prosec ution to prove that the appellant was the mastermind in the c onspirac y. Consequently, so long as there was suffic ient evidenc e (from Saravanan) to show that there had been an abetment by c onspirac y between the appellant and Saravanan, the c harge would have been proven. 

46     In any c ase, I was of the opinion that an adverse inferenc e should not be drawn against the prosec ution for the failure to c all on Thanabal as a witness. As the Court of Appeal held in _Yeo Choon Huat v PP_ <span class="citation">[1998] 1 SLR 217</span>, an adverse inferenc e should only be drawn if it is shown that the prosec ution had withheld c ertain evidenc e whic h it possesses. Here, it was a simple c ase of Thanabal having left the jurisdic tion prior to the investigations and therefore the polic e were unable to obtain statements from him. It was an issue of unavailability rather than deliberate withholding of evidenc e. 

47     Moreover, I was also of the view that if the appellant c onsidered Thanabal to be a material witness, then the burden lay on him, and not the prosec ution, to c all him as a witness. I noted that Thanabal and the appellant were onc e c olleagues at Heraeus. Surely, if the appellant felt strongly about c alling on Thanabal, it would not have been unreasonable for him to c all Thanabal as his witness. Consequently, I found that the failure of the prosec ution to c all on Thanabal did not c ause did not materially prejudic e the appellant’s c ase. 

**_Whether the prosecution had proven that the targets had been entrusted to Saravanan_** 

48     Counsel then proc eeded to argue that the prosec ution had failed to prove that there was entrustment of the targets to Saravanan. For this proposition, c ounsel argued that Saravanan was only one of the assistant tec hnic ians who worked on the mac hine and that there were other assistant tec hnic ians who c ame into c ontac t with the targets during the c ourse of their work. Further, he tried to show, somewhat c onvolutedly, that after the targets were used in the bomb room, they were supposed to be kept in the drawers there. Therefore, nobody was spec ific ally entrusted with the task of c ollec ting the used targets from the bomb room and returning them to the storeroom, whic h was where Saravanan had misappropriated the targets. Counsel further tried to rely on the following 

passage in Gour’s _Penal Law of India_ (11th ed), Volume IV at p 3957: 

 Being entrusted with the doing of a job is not the same thing as being entrusted with any property within the meaning of s 405 and other c ognate sec tions of the Indian Penal Code, even though some money or other property may c ome into the hand of the person in the c ourse of his doing 


 suc h job. 

Counsel tried to show that, even though Saravanan may have been entrusted with the job, he c ould not be said to have been entrusted with the targets. 

49     I found this argument to be c ompletely without merit. It was c onvoluted, c onfusing and wholly unnec essary. The short answer to c ounsel’s argument was that Saravanan had already pleaded guilty to a c harge under s 408 of the Penal Code and had been suffic iently dealt with by the law. As the prosec ution rightly pointed out, that was the best evidenc e to show that Saravanan had indeed been entrusted with the targets whic h he had misappropriated. Counsel’s allegation that other assistant tec hnic ians were also entrusted with the property, and therefore the targets c ould have been misappropriated by them, was yet another baseless allegation for whic h he provided no evidenc e in support. Finally, the distinc tion between the movement of the targets between the bomb room and the storeroom at Seagate was extremely superfluous and was not of any assistanc e to the appellant. 

50     In any c ase, I wish to take this opportunity to c larify c ounsel’s attempt at drawing a distinc tion between entrustment with the doing of a job and entrustment with property. In _Gopalakrishnan Vanitha v PP_ <span class="citation">[1999] 4 SLR 307</span>, I rec ognised and upheld the distinc tion between entrustment with the doing of a job and entrustment with property. There, the appellant was a c onfidential sec retary c um offic e administrator who was c harged with c riminal breac h of trust by using blank c heques signed by her boss to make payments to overpay her own salary. I found her letter of appointment entrusted her with being responsible for petty c ash and other relevant payments but I found that these did not extend to the appellant there bec oming entrusted with the funds of the c ompany. On the fac ts of that c ase, I found that the entrustment of the property c ame with her boss’s c areless ac t of handing over signed blank c heques to the appellant and not by virtue of her job as a sec retary. 

51     I was of the opinion that the fac ts of _Gopalakrishnan Vanitha v PP_ c ould be distinguished from the fac ts of the present c ase. Here, Saravanan’s job spec ific ally required him to be entrusted with the targets whic h he misappropriated. Therefore the distinc tion between entrustment of a job and the entrustment of property did not have any sc ope for operation on the fac ts of this c ase, bec ause here the entrustment of the former nec essarily led to the entrustment of the latter. Consequently, I rejec ted c ounsel’s arguments on this point. 

**_Whether the second charge had been proven beyond reasonable doubt_** 

52     The appellant’s defenc e on the sec ond c harge was similar to his defenc e on the first c harge, viz. that he had merely rec eived the two stolen ‘Tosoh’ targets from Saravanan on the instruc tions of Ram. For the reasons similar to those c ited above on the first c harge, I did not think that there was muc h merit in the appellant’s defenc e vis--vis the sec ond c harge. For a c harge under s 411 of the Penal Code, the prosec ution has to prove that the appellant had dishonestly retained the said ‘Tosoh’ targets and that the appellant had reason to believe that they were stolen. In order to asc ertain what is the meaning of ‘reason to believe’, one may refer to s 26 of the Penal Code whic h states: 

 A person is said to have "reason to believe" a thing, if he has suffic ient c ause to believe that thing, but not otherwise. 

53     Here, there was ample evidenc e from Saravanan’s statements whic h implic ated the appellant with regard to the two ‘Tosoh’ targets. Moreover, the trial judge found that the appellant was not a nave person but rather a person who was experienc ed in this line of business. I saw no reason to disagree with the trial judge on this point. Further, like a c harge under s 109 read with s 408 of the 


Penal Code, a c harge under s 411 does not require the prosec ution to prove that the ac c used person was the mastermind behind the c onspirac y. The fac t that the appellant may or may not have been the mastermind was therefore irrelevant. It is trite law that an appellate c ourt will not disturb the findings of a trial judge unless the findings were against the weight of the evidenc e: see _Lim Poh Eng v PP_ <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 713</span>. On the fac ts, I saw no reason to disturb the findings of the trial judge in c onvic ting the appellant on the sec ond c harge and therefore, I dismissed his appeal against c onvic tion on the sec ond c harge as well. 

**_The appeal against sentence_** 

54     On the appeal against sentenc e, c ounsel submitted that the sentenc e was manifestly exc essive on the following grounds: 

 (a) The prosec ution failed to prove that the value of the property involved was US$469,800; 

 (b) Saravanan, as the princ ipal offender, was merely sentenc ed to four years’ imprisonment and there was no reason why the appellant should be given a substantially heavier sentenc e than Saravanan; and 

 (c ) The sentenc e was manifestly exc essive in light of similar c ases where the ac c used persons were given lighter sentenc es even though the amounts involved were higher. 

_Value of the property involved_ 

55     First, c ounsel argued that the sentenc e should not have been as harsh bec ause the prosec ution had not managed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that 48 targets were involved. Sinc e I found that the c harge had been proven beyond reasonable doubt and had dismissed the appeal against c onvic tion, I saw no ground for entertaining this c ontention. 

_Sentence meted out to accomplice_ 

56     Sec ondly, c ounsel pointed out that Saravanan, the princ ipal offender, was only sentenc ed to four years’ imprisonment and the appellant, being only a sec ondary offender, should not be given a substantially heavier sentenc e than Saravanan. 

57     This argument was too nave and simplistic. Admittedly, c onsistenc y in sentenc ing is a desirable goal. However, the fac t remains that eac h c ase must be looked at on its own spec ial fac ts. The sentenc e meted out to an ac c omplic e is but one of the myriad of fac tors that a sentenc ing c ourt c an take into ac c ount for the purposes of sentenc ing. In _PP v Ng Tai Tee Janet & Anor_ <span class="citation">[2001] 1 SLR 343</span> , I was not fettered by the sentenc e meted out to the ac c omplic e when I was dec iding on the appropriate sentenc e for the ac c used persons. There, even though the ac c omplic e was merely given a fine, I nevertheless sentenc ed the ac c used persons to a c ustodial sentenc e. I found that to be appropriate bec ause the ac c used persons played a more ac tive role in the syndic ate than the ac c omplic e. 

58     Similarly, on the fac ts of the present c ase, I saw no reason why the trial judge’s sentenc ing disc retion should have been fettered by the sentenc e meted out to Saravanan. Here, in the absenc e of any evidenc e to support the appellant’s allegation that Ram was indeed the mastermind, it 


appeared to me that it was the appellant himself who was the mastermind of the c onspirac y. In that light, the fac t that a harsher sentenc e was meted out to the appellant was appropriate. It was also c lear from the notes of evidenc e that the trial judge had taken into ac c ount a whole host of fac tors, inc luding the other six c harges taken into c onsideration against the appellant. I found this approac h of the trial judge to be c orrec t and ac c ordingly I saw no reason for me to disturb the sentenc e on this ground. 

_Sentence meted out in other criminal breach of trust cases_ 

59     Thirdly, c ounsel diligently brought up a number of c ases whic h involved c riminal breac h of trust to show that lighter sentenc es were imposed in those c ases, even though the amounts involved were higher. While I c ongratulated c ounsel for his diligenc e in bringing up those c ases, the short answer to this argument of his c ould be found in my judgment in _Soong Hee Sin v PP_ <span class="citation">[2001] 2 SLR 253</span>. There, I observed: 

 With respec t, I found c ounsel’s attempt to reduc e the law of sentenc ing into a rigid and inflexible mathematic al formula in whic h all sentenc es are deemed c apable of being tabulated with absolute sc ientific prec ision to be highly unrealistic. If the appropriate sentenc e in eac h c ase was indeed nothing more than a c omputation of numbers and figures, then judges are better off delegating the task of sentenc ing to their sec retaries and c lerks who I venture to think are possibly more adept at these things than judges. In my view, the regime of sentenc ing is a matter of law whic h involves a hotc hpotc h of suc h varied and manifold fac tors that no two c ases c an ever be c ompletely identic al in this regard. While past c ases are no doubt helpful and sometimes serve as c ritic al guidelines for the sentenc ing c ourt, that is also all that they are, i.e. mere guidelines only. This is espec ially so with regard to the unreported c ases, in whic h the detailed fac ts and c irc umstanc es are hardly, if ever, disc losed with suffic ient c larity to enable any intelligent c omparison to be made. At the end of the day, every c ase whic h c omes before the c ourts must be looked at on its own fac ts, eac h partic ular ac c used in his own c irc umstanc es, and c ounsel be kept c onstantly and keenly apprised of the fac t that it is just not possible to c ategorise c ases based simply on mere numerals and dec imal points. 

60     I found c ounsel’s attempt in drawing from other similar c ases to be a similar attempt in reduc ing the law of sentenc ing into a rigid and inflexible mathematic al formula. I take this opportunity to reiterate that in sentenc ing ac c used persons on c harges of c riminal breac h of trust, the c ourt’s disc retion is never restric ted by the amount involved. Eac h c ase must be looked at on its own fac ts. While guidelines and benc hmark sentenc es do give some aid to ensure c onsistenc y in sentenc ing, the value of the property c annot, and will never, be the sole fac tor in determining the sentenc e. To do so would c onstrain the judges’ ability to give effec t to the four general princ iples of retribution, deterrenc e, prevention and rehabilitation when passing out a sentenc e: see _Chua Tiong Tiong v PP_ <span class="citation">[2001] 3 SLR 425</span>, _PP v Tan Fook Sum_ <span class="citation">[1999] 2 SLR 425</span> and _R v Sargeant_ (1974) 60 Cr App R 74. 

**_Conclusion_** 

61     For the above reasons, I dismissed the appeal against c onvic tion and affirmed the sentenc e meted out by the trial judge. 

_Appeal dismissed._
