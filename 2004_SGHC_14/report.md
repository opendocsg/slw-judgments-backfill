**The charge** 

2       The c harge against the appellant read as follows: 

 You, Tay Aik Long Andrew, Male/28 years, NRIC no S7507780G, are c harged that you, on 28th November 2002 at about 12.00 noon, at Central Provident Fund Board (CPF Tampines), loc ated at Tampines Central, Singapore, being entrusted with c ash of S$50.00 belonging to one Leong Yew Cheong, whic h was meant to top up the CPF ac c ount of the said Leong Yew Cheong’s wife to be eligible for the Ec onomic Restruc turing Shares (ERS), did dishonestly misappropriate the said c ash of S$50.00 and you have thereby c ommitted c riminal breac h of trust, an offenc e punishable under sec tion 406 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. 

**Background facts** 

3       The Ec onomic Restruc turing Shares (“ERS”) sc heme was implemented by the Singapore government to offset inc reases to the goods and servic es tax. The first of three lots of ERS was distributed to eligible Singapore c itizens in early 2003. Under the terms of the ERS sc heme, only Singapore c itizens who had c ontributed at least $50 to their CPF ac c ounts between 1 January and 31 Dec ember 2002 qualified for the first lot of ERS. 

4       The appellant was employed on a temporary and part-time basis, through an employment agenc y, at the Tampines Central branc h of the Central Provident Fund Board (“CPF Tampines”). He c ommenc ed work at CPF Tampines in Oc tober 2002 and was stationed at a temporary c ounter (“the ERS c ounter”) whic h had been set up to handle the ERS alloc ation exerc ise. The appellant’s sc ope of work involved assisting CPF members with ERS-related enquiries. Spec ific ally, he was tasked with assisting CPF members who wished to make a voluntary c ontribution to their CPF ac c ounts with the c ompletion of Voluntary Contribution Forms. 

5       The c omplainant was one Leong Yew Cheong (“Mr Leong”). Mr Leong’s wife (“Mrs Leong”) was unemployed and would therefore only be eligible for the first lot of ERS if a voluntary c ontribution of $50 was made to her ac c ount on or before 31 Dec ember 2002. 


**Prosecution’s version of the facts** 

6       The main prosec ution witness was Mr Leong. He testified that he had gone to CPF Tampines on 28 November 2002 to make a voluntary c ontribution to Mrs Leong’s CPF ac c ount. 

7       Mr Leong went to the ERS c ounter where he was attended to by the appellant. Mr Leong handed the appellant a letter whic h the CPF Board had sent to Mrs Leong to remind her to make a voluntary c ontribution. The appellant asked Mr Leong whether he would be making the payment by c ash. Mr Leong plac ed Mrs Leong’s identity c ard and a $50 note on the c ounter. The appellant plac ed the identity c ard on top of a pile of pink forms and plac ed the $50 note on top of another pile of forms on the c ounter. The appellant then referred to Mrs Leong’s identity c ard and filled in a pink Voluntary Contribution Form (“the pink form”) with Mrs Leong’s personal partic ulars. The appellant signed his initials, “AT”, on the form and returned the pink form and the identity c ard, but not the $ note, to Mr Leong. 

8       Mr Leong was under the impression that the pink form was an ac knowledgement rec eipt for the payment and asked the appellant, “Is that all?”. The appellant replied, “That’s it. You may go”. Mr Leong then left the CPF Tampines premises. 

9       In Dec ember 2002, Mrs Leong disc overed that no ERS had been c redited into her CPF ac c ount. Mr Leong then made an inquiry _via_ the CPF PALPhone system. He found that Mrs Leong’s CPF ac c ount had been inac tive for the past six months and that the $50 c ontribution had not been c redited to her ac c ount. 

10     On 31 Dec ember 2002, Mr and Mrs Leong went to CPF Tampines and learnt from a CPF Board employee, one Lee Kah Leong (“Lee”), that the $50 had not been c redited into Mrs Leong’s CPF ac c ount. Lee explained that the pink form was not a rec eipt and that the proper proc edure for payment into CPF ac c ounts was to make payment at the c ashier c ounter, where a printed rec eipt would be issued to the person making the payment. 

11     The c ashier c ounter whic h Lee was referring to was ac tually an interview room a short distanc e behind the ERS c ounter whic h had been set up to proc ess voluntary c ontributions for ERS. An A3-size “c ashier” sign was pasted on the door of the interview room. 

12     Lee advised Mr and Mrs Leong that they had until the end of the day to make the voluntary c ontribution. Mr Leong immediately made a c ontribution of $50 into Mrs Leong’s ac c ount and she was eventually allotted the ERS. 

13     On the same day, Mr Leong made a polic e report. A week later, in an identific ation parade, Mr Leong pic ked out the appellant as the person who had attended to him on 28 November 2002. 

**The Defence** 

14     The appellant did not deny attending to Mr Leong on 28 November 2002. The appellant ac knowledged that he had c ompleted the pink form on behalf of Mr Leong and c onfirmed that he had written his initials on the form. 

15     The appellant also admitted that, as a temporary employee, he had had no authority to ac c ept payments from CPF members, and that the proper proc edure was for payments to be proc essed at the c ashier’s c ounter. 


16     The c rux of the appellant’s defenc e was that Mr Leong had not given him any money and that Mr Leong had probably gone to the ERS c ounter to make enquiries only. The appellant’s position was that Mr Leong had given false evidenc e in c ourt to avoid paying the $50. The appellant further suggested that Mr Leong did not even have $50 on him when he went to CPF Tampines on 28 November 2002. 

**The decision below** 

17     The distric t judge rejec ted the appellant’s defenc e and ac c epted Mr Leong’s evidenc e. She found that Mr Leong had entrusted the appellant with $50 to pay into Mrs Leong’s CPF ac c ount and that the appellant had not returned this sum to Mr Leong. The distric t judge further held that by telling Mr Leong that he c ould leave, the appellant had c aused Mr Leong to believe that the $ would be c redited into Mrs Leong’s ac c ount and that the pink form was an offic ial rec eipt. 

18     The distric t judge therefore c onvic ted the appellant and sentenc ed him to a fine of $2,000. 

**The appeal** 

19     At the hearing before me, the appellant maintained that he was innoc ent and that he had not taken the money from Mr Leong. The c rux of the appellant’s appeal was that the Prosec ution’s version of the fac ts should not be believed bec ause Mr Leong’s evidenc e was not c redible or plausible. In support of this c ontention, the appellant submitted that Mr Leong’s evidenc e should not be believed as it was unlikely that Mr Leong had assumed that the pink form was an offic ial rec eipt. The appellant also argued that Mr Leong should have notic ed the c ashier c ounter and ought to have realised that payment had to be made at that c ounter, instead of the ERS c ounter. 

20     I shall now deal with the appellant’s arguments, turning first to those relating to the plausibility of Mr Leong’s version of the fac ts. 

**_Whether Mr Leong had believed that the pink form was an official receipt for the payment of the sum of $_** 

21     The appellant submitted that it was highly unlikely that Mr Leong genuinely believed that the pink form c onstituted an offic ial rec eipt sinc e no reasonable person would have taken this view. The appellant drew the c ourt’s attention to the fac t that Mr Leong had referred to the pink form as a “form” in his evidenc e. The appellant argued that it was inc onc eivable that Mr Leong, a literate man, c ould have mistaken the pink form for a rec eipt. 

22     I was of the view that it was entirely possible that Mr Leong might have believed that the pink form was an offic ial rec eipt. The fac t that Mr Leong referred to the pink form as a “form” in his evidenc e is irrelevant and not nec essarily inc onsistent with the Prosec ution’s version of the fac ts. This is bec ause Mr Leong may have been under the impression that the CPF Board intended to issue the pink form as a rec eipt. Indeed, Mr Leong may have referred to the pink form as a “form” sinc e it was labelled “Form VC7”. 

23     In any event, Mr Leong’s assertion that he had believed the pink form was a rec eipt is believable as it would have been reasonable for him to believe that he c ould trust an employee at CPF Tampines to advise him on the proper proc edure for payment. I was of the view that any doubts whic h Mr Leong may have been entertaining in his mind at the time would have been put to rest by the appellant’s representation, “That’s it, you may go”. Based on this representation, Mr Leong would reasonably have assumed that the pink form was a rec eipt. 


24     I also took into ac c ount the fac t that Mr Leong had had no experienc e with transac tions of this nature, as this was the first time he had made a voluntary c ontribution under the ERS sc heme. I was of the view that it would have been unreasonable to expec t Mr Leong to have known that he should have demanded a proper printed rec eipt. I was thus unpersuaded that there was any basis for disturbing the distric t judge’s findings that Mr Leong had believed that the pink form c onstituted a rec eipt and that the $50 would be properly c redited into Mrs Leong’s ac c ount. 

**_Whether Mr Leong had noticed the cashier counter_** 

25     The appellant argued that there was c lear and unambiguous signage at CPF Tampines whic h indic ated that payment was to be made at the c ashier c ounter. The appellant also submitted that it would have been impossible for Mr Leong to have missed the c ashier c ounter as the queue at the ERS c ounter led to the c ashier c ounter. It was the appellant’s c ase that Mr Leong c ould not possibly have believed that the pink form was an offic ial rec eipt as he would have notic ed the c ashier c ounter at whic h payment was to be made. 

26     I was unc onvinc ed by the appellant’s submissions. The appellant himself gave evidenc e at trial that approximately 20% of the CPF members whom he had attended to at the ERS c ounter had mistakenly given him money for voluntary c ontributions. I also noted that the c ashier c ounter was makeshift in nature and c onsisted of a room with a table pushed in front of it. The sign was not very large and it is possible that Mr Leong may not have seen it. I therefore dec lined to disturb the distric t judge’s finding that Mr Leong did not see or know that there was a separate c ashier c ounter for payment. 

**_Whether the district judge erred in accepting the Prosecution’s evidence over the Defence’s evidence_** 

27     In addition to the appellant’s attac ks on the plausibility of Mr Leong’s version of the fac ts, the appellant also submitted that the distric t judge had erred in finding that Mr Leong was a reliable witness and in ac c epting his evidenc e over that of the defenc e. Spec ific ally, the appellant sought to c hallenge the distric t judge’s findings that Mr Leong had entrusted the appellant with $50 to pay into Mrs Leong’s CPF ac c ount and that the appellant had not returned the $50 to Mr Leong. 

28     It is well-settled law that an appellate c ourt will generally not interfere with a trial judge’s findings of fac t unless they are c learly reac hed against the weight of the evidenc e. In examining the evidenc e, an appellate c ourt has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges’ findings and their reasons for these findings: _Lim Ah Poh v PP_ <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 713</span> at 719. 

29     In _Syed Jafaralsadeg bin Abdul Kadir v PP_ <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 788</span> at [56]–[57], I held that: 

 It is settled law that, where there is an appeal based on fac t, the c ourt should be slow to overturn the trial judge’s finding of fac t espec ially when the trial judge has made an assessment of the c redibility and verac ity of the witness, unless it c an be shown that his assessment was plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidenc e before him. ... [T]here is an extremely heavy burden c ast onto the appellant to displac e the trial judge’s findings of fac t. The trial judge’s findings will not be overturned unless it c an be shown that the trial judge was horribly wrong in drawing his c onc lusions. 

30     In this regard, I noted that the distric t judge had made spec ific observations relating to Mr Leong’s demeanour in her grounds of dec ision. The distric t judge noted that Mr Leong had been 


“fair and forthc oming” and that he did not embellish his evidenc e to bolster the Prosec ution’s c ase. 

31     In marked c ontrast, the distric t judge was of the view that the appellant was “unreliable and untruthful, not forthright with a tendenc y to ramble, and avoided answering questions in c rossexamination”. 

32     I was of the opinion that there was nothing in the evidenc e before the c ourt to suggest that the distric t judge’s assessment of Mr Leong’s c redibility was plainly wrong. In fac t, Mr Leong’s version of the events of 31 Dec ember 2002 was c orroborated by Lee, who testified that Mr Leong had told him that he had gone to CPF Tampines on 28 November 2002 to make a voluntary c ontribution of $ to Mrs Leong’s CPF ac c ount. Lee’s rec ollec tion of what Mr Leong had told him on 31 Dec ember 2002 matc hed Mr Leong’s evidenc e in c ourt, and there is no substantial disc repanc y between the two witnesses’ ac c ounts. 

33     I also agreed with the distric t judge’s assessment that Mr Leong had had no motive to lie sinc e he did not know the appellant. In the words of the distric t judge, Mr Leong truly had “nothing to gain, but muc h to lose” by making a false polic e report and by giving false evidenc e in c ourt against the appellant. 

34     In preferring Mr Leong’s version of the fac ts over that of the appellant, the distric t judge relied on Mr Leong’s demeanour and the internal c onsistenc y in the c ontent of his evidenc e. I was of the view that the distric t judge’s finding that Mr Leong was a reliable witness, made after she had c arefully sc rutinised Mr Leong’s testimony and demeanour in c ourt, was not against the weight of the evidenc e and should not be disturbed. It c ould not be said that the distric t judge’s findings were plainly wrong or horribly wrong. Mr Leong’s evidenc e was entirely believable and the appellant’s attempts to disc redit Mr Leong’s version of the fac ts as inc redible and implausible left me thoroughly unpersuaded. In the result, I dismissed the appellant’s appeal against his c onvic tion. 

_Appeal dismissed._
