**Introduction** 

1       This c ase c onc erns an interim injunc tion restraining the 2nd defendant from paying out on a banker’s guarantee issued in favour of the 1st defendant and to prevent the 1st defendant from rec eiving payment of the same. The banker’s guarantee was proc ured by the plaintiff pursuant to its obligation under the subc ontrac t with the 1st defendant. Following alleged breac hes of the subc ontrac t between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant, the latter c alled on the guarantee on 28 August 2017. Subsequently, on 29 August 2017, the plaintiff sought and obtained an interim injunc tion against the demand and payment on an _ex parte_ basis. The present applic ation was brought by the 1st defendant to lift the injunc tion, among other things. I lifted the injunc tion following an _inter partes_ hearing. The plaintiff has appealed against my dec ision. Leave to appeal has sinc e been granted by the Court of Appeal. I now set out the grounds of my dec ision. 

**Background** 

2       As the matter is presently at the interim stage and given the existenc e of multiple c ontrac tual doc uments, I would refer to the general c ontrac tual arrangement between the plaintiff and 1st defendant as the “subc ontrac t” and leave spec ific referenc es to doc uments where nec essary. 

3       The genesis of the present applic ation stems from a subc ontrac t entered into by the 1st defendant and the plaintiff for the supply and installation of mec hanic al, elec tric al and plumbing works in Dec ember 2012; the plaintiff being the subc ontrac tor. A banker’s guarantee of about $4.3m, issued by the 2nd defendant-bank, was granted in favour of the 1st defendant pursuant to the subc ontrac t. After c ertain delays and alleged c ontrac tual breac hes, the 1st defendant imposed liquidated damages and sought to c all on the guarantee. The c irc umstanc es leading up to that demand are as follows. 


4       The c ompletion dates for the various phases of the works to be done spanned Marc h 2013 to April 2014. The plaintiff, however, only ac hieved ac tual c ompletion of the last phase in February 2015. Thereafter, various letters were exc hanged from the period of May 2015 to January 2016, where the 1st defendant sought to pin responsibility for the delay on the plaintiff and notified the plaintiff of potential liquidated damages to be paid. 

5       Payment c laims filed by the plaintiff, and responses from the 1st defendant detailing reasons for withholding payments and indic ating liquidated damages payable by the plaintiff were then exc hanged between February 2017 and July 2017. Notably, the 1st defendant addressed the plaintiff’s request for the release of the first half of retention monies, variation order c laims and bac k c harges in the responses. 

6       On 7 July 2017, the plaintiff lodged an adjudic ation applic ation against the 1st defendant in relation to the first half of the retention monies. An adjudic ator was appointed on 11 July 2017. Further payment c laims and responses c ontinued to be filed after the appointment of the adjudic ator. The adjudic ation determination was granted on 15 August 2017 in favour of the plaintiff; no determination was made on the variation order c laims and bac k c harges. Shortly after, the plaintiff requested for payment of the amount due under the adjudic ation determination. The 1st defendant replied with a payment response on 24 August 2017 explaining why payments were withheld. 

7       On 28 August 2017, the 1st defendant made a demand on the banker’s guarantee on the basis that the plaintiff owed it liquidated damages. Due to the urgenc y of the matter, the plaintiff applied for, and obtained, an interim injunc tion restraining the 1st defendant’s c all on the guarantee on 29 August 2017. This interim injunc tion was then disc harged following an _inter partes_ hearing before me; that disc harge is now the subjec t of the appeal. 

8       At issue between the parties were the c irc umstanc es of the _ex parte_ hearing and the basis for the c all on the guarantee; whether full disc losure had been given then; whether the c ontrac t between the parties exc luded unc onsc ionability as a basis to bar the c all on the guarantee; and whether fraud was made out. 

9       For c ompleteness, the 1st defendant eventually filed an applic ation to set aside the adjudic ation determination. The matter was heard on 14 November 2017 by Foo Chee Hoc k JC. The judge found that the adjudic ation determination was made in breac h of natural justic e as it failed to take into ac c ount other essential issues of bac k c harges for sc affolding and re-assessed variation works, and c onsequently set aside the adjudic ation determination. The matter was thereafter appealed by the plaintiff. The appeal was dismissed in _Bintai Kindenko Pte Ltd v Samsung C&T Corp_ <span class="citation">[2018] SGCA 39</span>. 

**The 1st defendant’s case** 

10     The plaintiff’s interim injunc tion applic ation was on the basis that it would be unc onsc ionable, in the c irc umstanc es, for the 1st defendant to have c alled on the guarantee. The 1st defendant argued that the plaintiff’s applic ation was fundamentally flawed as the ground of unc onsc ionability was not available to the plaintiff in the first plac e. The subc ontrac t inc orporates a c lause whic h expressly stipulates that exc ept in the c ase of fraud, the plaintiff shall not for any reason whatsoever be entitled to enjoin or restrain the 1st defendant on making any c all or demand on the guarantee (“Exc lusion Clause”). Suc h a c lause was upheld in _CKR Contract Services Pte Ltd v Asplenium Land Pte Ltd and another and another appeal and another matter_ <span class="citation">[2015] 3 SLR 1041</span> (“ _CKR_ ”); parties are entitled to c ontrac t out of the ground of unc onsc ionability. The burden lay on the plaintiff to make out non-inc orporation of suc h a c lause on a c lear c ase. 


11     In any event, the subc ontrac t c ontained an arbitration c lause. The parties expressly agreed to refer disputes relating to a demand on the guarantee to arbitration. 

12     There were also material fac ts not disc losed to the c ourt. An applic ant in an _ex parte_ applic ation is under a duty to make full and frank disc losure of all material fac ts even if these fac ts are prejudic ial to him. Apart from the non-disc losure of the existenc e of the Exc lusion Clause and arbitration c lause, the plaintiff also did not disc lose material fac ts suc h as the adjudic ator’s dec ision that the Exc lusion Clause was applic able and the plaintiff’s own submissions in the adjudic ation applic ation referenc ing the provision in the subc ontrac t whic h inc orporated the Exc lusion Clause. Instead, the plaintiff’s c onduc t was partic ularly egregious as it made c ertain ac tive misrepresentations as to the validity of its applic ation for an injunc tion on the ground of unc onsc ionability. 

13     Additionally, the _ex parte_ applic ation was brought without notic e to the 1st defendant’s solic itors. This was c ontrary to para 41(2) of the Supreme Court Prac tic e Direc tions whic h provides that even in c ases of extreme urgenc y, notic e must be given to the other party. Further, it would have been c lear to the plaintiff’s solic itors that any notific ation ought to have been sent to the 1st defendant’s solic itors sinc e the latter were already on the rec ord for the adjudic ation applic ation. Yet when the plaintiff’s solic itors sought the interim injunc tion, they did not inform the 1st defendant’s solic itors of the applic ation and simply sent a letter to the 1st defendant itself. 

14     If there was to be any c hallenge to the c all on the guarantee, the only ground available was fraud. There was not even a shred of an allegation of fraud in the supporting affidavits, nor was this raised to the c ourt in argument. In any event, fraud c annot be made out: 

 (a) Aside from liquidated damages of $26m, there were other outstanding c laims by the 1st defendant. There were c laims for re-evaluation, further bac k c harges, omissions on the plaintiff’s part and liability for water ingress, among others. The plaintiff remained generally liable for these sums even after the adjudic ation determination. The total sum c laimed by the 1st defendant, exc luding liquidated c harges, exc eeded the sum guaranteed and this justified the c all on the banker’s guarantee for $4.3m. 

 (b) The plaintiff has no basis to say that the c all on the guarantee was made with rec kless indifferenc e to the truth. As opposed to the sort of c onduc t c onsidered by the c ourt in BS Mount Sophia Pte Ltd v Join-Aim Pte Ltd <span class="citation">[2012] 3 SLR 352</span> (“ BS Mount Sophia ”), where there was c all on the guarantee despite there being a c omplete absenc e of allegations of delay, the liquidated damages c laim whic h formed the basis of the 1st defendant’s c all arose out of the plaintiff’s ac tual delay. The c all was not a retaliation against the plaintiff’s adjudic ation applic ation. Further, at the point the c all was made, there were already damages and bac k c harges as well. There was no fraudulent behaviour. Any allegation of fraud was not even made out on a prima facie level. 

 (c ) The 1st defendant’s c all on the bond c ontained sums whic h were not dealt with in the adjudic ation. This was the very reason for the 1st defendant’s position that the adjudic ation determination was a breac h of natural justic e. Sinc e these sums were not part of the adjudic ation, it c an hardly be said that the c laims forming the basis of the c all on the guarantee were c ontrived. 

 (d) All the c ategories of c laims invoked by the 1st defendant were in existenc e at the time of the c all, and not fabric ated. 

 (e) It was ac knowledged that there were disc repanc ies in some of the figures relating to c ertain c laims. However, the 1st defendant’s c all on the guarantee was nonetheless justified. 


 These disc repanc ies were c orrec ted upon revision and a reduc tion of the amounts c laimed had been made. Even taking the plaintiff’s c ase at its highest, the reduc tion on the amount c laimed should not affec t the c all on the guarantee. 

15     In the present applic ation, the plaintiff has sought to c hange their position from unc onsc ionability to fraud. The 1st defendant is surprised by the fraud arguments. 

**The plaintiff’s case** 

16     The plaintiff began by stating that its primary c ase was that the c all on the banker’s guarantee was fraudulent. This was borne out in the relevant supporting affidavit and the notes of evidenc e in relation to the interim injunc tion. In any event, there was a signific ant overlap between unc onsc ionability and fraud; the fac tual elements relied on for one ground apply with equal forc e to the other. 

17     The ac tions of the 1st defendant showed that the liquidated damages c laim was c ontrived and there was no honest belief in c alling on the guarantee: 

 (a) The projec t under the subc ontrac t was substantially c ompleted by 10 February 2015. The Arc hitec t had issued the c ompletion c ertific ate, and the c ontrac t c ompletion date had passed. The 1st defendant should have issued the subc ontrac t c ompletion c ertific ate and released the first half of retention monies to the plaintiff. At that time, there was still no issuanc e of a delay c ertific ate or imposition of liquidated damages, even though any genuine c laim for liquidated damages would have c learly ac c rued and be quantifiable then. The 1st defendant unreasonably withheld the first half of the retention monies and gave exc uses to deny payment to the plaintiff despite the substantial c ompletion of the projec t. This c ompelled the plaintiff to c ommenc e the adjudic ation determination for the first half of the retention monies. 

 (b) Curiously, the 1st defendant initially ac c epted that the plaintiff did not owe it any money. Subsequently, however, in April 2017 the 1st defendant reduc ed the value of variation works and imposed bac k c harges without any basis. 

 (c ) Muc h of suc h works had in fac t been agreed on and paid by the 1st defendant’s employer in 2016, and the bac k c harges were ac tually withdrawn by the 1st defendant in 2014. Despite these baseless allegations, the 1st defendant maintained its position that it was entitled to make a c all on the guarantee. 

 (d) The liquidated damages c laim, whic h forms the basis of the 1st defendant’s c all on the guarantee, was a retaliation. When the 1st defendant realised that it would have to release the retention monies, it inc luded its c laim in payment responses as set off against the plaintiff’s ac c ount. Taking into ac c ount the fac t that the adjudic ation determination would need to be issued by the latest in 15 August 2017, the 1st defendant issued a delay c ertific ate for the first time on 22 July 2017 to inform that plaintiff that it was imposing liquidated damages of $26.4m in retaliation against the plaintiff’s adjudic ation applic ation. The 1st defendant therefore deduc ted that amount from the monies owed to the plaintiff. The 1st defendant then awaited the adjudic ation determination; onc e the determination was released, the 1st defendant added bac k c harges and other damages to its liquidated damages c laim. Subsequently, on 28 August 2017, the same day that the plaintiff filed its applic ation for enforc ement of the adjudic ation determination, the 1st defendant c alled on the maximum sum under the guarantee. 

 (e) The question of liquidated damages was also not raised throughout the projec t. Instead, it 


 was the plaintiff who was pursuing ac c eleration c osts against the 1st defendant. Further, no delay c ertific ate was issued prior to 22 July 2017. This was c ruc ial as a delay c ertific ate would have been the basis of liquidated damages. In any event, there were obvious errors in the c alc ulation on the fac e of the delay c ertific ate issued by the 1st defendant. 

 (f ) The bac k c harges, and reduc tion of variation works were all c ontrived as well, and had been rejec ted by the adjudic ator. 

 (g) Furthermore, the 1st defendant introduc ed additional c laims only after the plaintiff sought to resist the demand on the guarantee. The timing of the 1st defendant’s additional c laims is signific ant as it is the 1st defendant’s position that these c laims were inc urred early on in the projec t. The 1st defendant belatedly inc luded the additional c laims to justify its demand on the banker’s guarantee ex post facto. For instanc e, damages for water ingress and damages to other works were not c harged until muc h later until in 2017. 

 (h) There was also an offer from the 1st defendant at one point for payment of $500,000 to c lose the ac c ount. If there was truly a c laim for $26m in liquidated damages, there was no reason for this offer to have been made. 

18     As regards the operation of the Exc lusion Clause, the plaintiff argued that it was premature to determine its inc orporation at this stage. 

19     As regards the allegation of material non-disc losure, the Court nonetheless had the power under s 18 of the Supreme Court of Judic ature Ac t (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) to make orders to preserve the injunc tion. In dealing with the c ontention that the Exc lusion Clause was not raised at an earlier junc ture, the plaintiff argued that the Exc lusion Clause is set out in the main c ontrac t between the ultimate employer and the 1st defendant. The plaintiff has never had sight of this c lause despite the 1st defendant c laiming that it was inc orporated into the subc ontrac t. In any event, even if the 1st defendant were able to establish material non-disc losure, the plaintiff has established fraud on the 1st defendant’s part in c alling on the banker’s guarantee, suc h that the interim injunc tion should be c ontinued. 

20     As regards the c irc umstanc es of the _ex parte_ hearing, the plaintiff argued that urgenc y existed at the time of the interim injunc tion applic ation as the bank had indic ated that the funds would be released. The 1st defendant was informed, by email and by hand, of the injunc tion applic ation. As the plaintiff’s solic itors had not ac ted for the plaintiff previously, they did not know that the present solic itors for the 1st defendant were on rec ord. Further, the 1st defendant had indic ated a c ertain person in its management to c ontac t onc e payment under the banker’s guarantee is released. 

**The court’s decision in summary** 

21     I was satisfied that unc onsc ionability was prec luded by the subc ontrac t between the parties; fraud was the only basis by whic h the plaintiff c ould prevent the c all. Fraud was, however, not established on the fac ts. 

22     There was no real argument as to how the Exc lusion Clause c ould be c onstrued in any other manner apart from it being an express exc lusion of unc onsc ionability as a ground for resisting a c all on the guarantee. Any suc h argument would have fac ed an uphill battle given the plain words used. Rather, the outc ome turned on whether the c lause was inc orporated, or applied to the c ontrac t or relationship between the plaintiff and 1st defendant. 


23     At the interloc utory stage, there is a question of the appropriate level of sc rutiny to be applied in approac hing the issue of inc orporation: whether the test was one of a c lear c ase, as argued by the 1st defendant; or a _prima facie_ c ase, as argued by the plaintiff. I was of the view that it was at least plausible that that the appropriate test is ac tually whether there is a serious issue to be tried. On this note, I do not regard _Bocotra Construction Pte Ltd and others v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">[1995] 2 SLR(R) 262</span> (“ _Bocotra_ ”) as laying down a definitive ruling on the applic able threshold in dec iding issues unrelated to fraud and unc onsc ionability. At [46] of _Bocotra_ , the Court of Appeal simply exc luded the use of the test espoused in _American Cyanamid Co Ltd v Ethicon Ltd_ [1975] AC 396 in determining whether a c all was unc onsc ionable or fraudulent. The Court of Appeal did not exc lude the use of the normal interloc utory standard where the issue in c ontention is one not of fraud or unc onsc ionability. Regardless of the standard, the plaintiff has not shown that the relevant c ontrac tual c lause is inapplic able. I shall say no more on the standard to be applied. 

24     Onc e it was found that the Exc lusion Clause prec luded allegations of unc onsc ionability, the plaintiff was only left with fraud as a ground for resisting the 1st Defendant’s c all on the guarantee. It c ould not, however, be said that fraud was established: it was not shown that the 1st defendant’s c all on the guarantee amounted to dec eit. Whether unc onsc ionability would have been made out on the fac ts is another matter whic h lies outside the present c ase. 

**Analysis** 

25     In _JBE Properties Pte Ltd v Gammon Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2011] 2 SLR 47</span> (“ _JBE_ ”) the Court of Appeal rec ognised both fraud and unc onsc ionability as separate bases for restraining a c all on a performanc e bond (at [6]). Fraud c an be established by c onduc t that shows that the c all was invalid, and the party knowing the c all to be suc h represented the c all to the paying bank as being valid: _GKN Contractors v Lloyds Bank plc_ (1985) 30 BLR 48 (“ _GKN_ ”) at 63. In c omparison, unc onsc ionability is broader. It takes into ac c ount unfair or reprehensible c onduc t, or that whic h lac ks good faith: _Raymond Construction Pte Ltd v Low Yang Tong and another_ <span class="citation">[1996] SGHC 136</span> at [5] and [35]. As the inc orporation of the Exc lusion Clause is a prec ursor to the question of fraud (or any of the grounds for resisting a c all on a guarantee for that matter), the former would be examined first. 

**_Unconscionability_** 

_Incorporation of Exclusion Clause_ 

26     I was satisfied that the Exc lusion Clause was inc orporated into the subc ontrac t between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant. The plaintiff essentially argued that it would be premature for a determination on the question of inc orporation at this stage sinc e the suit proper has not progressed far. The point should be taken up only at the trial. This point is misc onc eived. 

27     Inc orporation is both a fac tual as well as a legal issue. In the applic ation for an interim injunc tion, the c ourt must nec essarily c onsider the material fac ts of a dispute. The c onc ern is not so muc h that the c ourt c annot c onsider the question of inc orporation at all but that the c ourt should not c ome to a c onc lusive ruling at the interim stage. The c ourt is therefore entitled to c onsider the issue of inc orporation at present. 

28     In any event, given that the effec t of the Exc lusion Clause was to prec lude unc onsc ionability from being a ground for an injunc tion against payment, it would have to be c onstrued at the interim stage if it were to be given any prac tic al effec t. Leaving the determination of its validity and effec t to the trial would be to rob the c lause of its purpose. That said, there is some unc ertainty as to the question of whose burden it is to show either inc orporation or non-inc orporation in the present c ase. 


In the normal run of matters, the party seeking to resist a c laim bears the burden of proving its c ase. This is typic ally by way of a defenc e. However, given that what was sought was an interim injunc tion to prevent payment out, the legal burden should lie on the plaintiff to establish that it was not disentitled to make suc h an applic ation. 

29     Turning to address the threshold needed to establish non-inc orporation, the plaintiff argued that it was suffic ient to make out a _prima facie_ c ase of non-inc orporation, whereas the 1st defendant argued that the plaintiff had to show a c lear c ase. I would have thought it suffic ient to raise a serious issue to be tried as regards the proposition that the c lause was not inc orporated. But even then, I did not c onsider it at all arguable that the Exc lusion Clause was not inc orporated. I would have reac hed the same c onc lusion even if the burden to address the issue of inc orporation had been on the 1st defendant rather than the plaintiff. 

30     In a nutshell, if the question of the inc orporation of the terms c an be answered at this stage, then it should be so answered. This goes to the heart of the basis for the plaintiff’s entitlement to an injunc tion. It should be answered by the plaintiff, even though the standard may not be that of a final determination. 

31     I ac c epted the arguments of the 1st defendant that the Exc lusion Clause was inc orporated into the subc ontrac t. This is plain on the language of the c ontrac tual provisions in question. There is no dispute that the subc ontrac t between the parties c omprise the Letter of Ac c eptanc e dated 3 Dec 2012 (“LOA”) and doc uments referred in that LOA. Indeed, the plaintiff relied on the LOA as being the basis of the c ontrac tual relationship between the parties. Para 3 of the LOA states that the SubContrac t is to be in the form of the Singapore Institute of Arc hitec ts (“SIA”) Conditions of Sub

Contrac t 4th Edition 2010, and referenc es Partic ular Conditions set out the in the Main Contrac t. Notably, the subc ontrac t is to be exec uted on a bac k-to-bac k basis in ac c ordanc e with the relevant 

c lauses within the Main Contrac t: [note: 1] 

 3. Form of Sub-Contract 

 The Form of our Main Contrac t with the Employer is the Singapore Institute of Arc hitec ts (“SIA”) Lump Sum Contrac t (9th Edition) and the SubContrac t shall be SIA Conditions of SubContrac t 4 th Edition, 2010, inc luding all Partic ular Conditions set out in the Main Contrac t. 

 This SubContrac t shall be exec uted on a “bac k-to-bac k” basis in ac c ordanc e with the relevant c lauses within the Main Contrac t. 

32     A separate doc ument titled Partic ular Conditions of SubContrac t opens with the stipulation that the Partic ular Conditions of Subc ontrac t is to be regarded as part of the SIA Conditions of SubContrac t. The Exc lusion Clause, namely, c lause 14A(5) of the Partic ular Conditions of SubContrac t 

provides: [note: 2] 

 (5) Pursuant to the intent set out in SubClause (1) above that the performanc e bond is to stand in lieu of a c ash deposit, the Contrac tor agrees that exc ept in the c ase of fraud, the SubContrac tor shall not for any reason whatsoever be entitled to enjoin or restrain: 

 (a) the Contrac tor from making any c all or demand on the performanc e bond or rec eiving any c ash proc eeds under the performanc e bond; and/or 

 (b) the obligor under the performanc e bond form paying any c ash proc eeds under the 


 performanc e bond, 

 on any other ground inc luding the ground of unc onsc ionability... 

Clause 14A(5) then refers to c lause 15.1 whic h c onc erns the parties’ c hosen mode of dispute resolution. 

33     Given the express referenc e in the LOA to the Partic ular Conditions, there was little room, partic ularly at this stage in the proc eedings, for any argument that the term exc luding unc onsc ionability was not inc orporated. I thus find that the c lause exc luding the ground of unc onsc ionability was inc orporated into the subc ontrac t. 

_Is the Exclusion Clause valid_ 

34     Parties are generally free to order their affairs to exc lude spec ific remedies or c laims, espec ially in c ommerc ial c ontrac ts. In _CKR_ it was held that save for limited c irc umstanc es ( _eg_ , where the c lause in question is c ontrary to public polic y), the c ourt would generally uphold the bargain of the parties: at [17]. The Court of Appeal found that the c lause at issue in the c ase was not c ontrary to public polic y as it did not oust the jurisdic tion of the c ourt. The c lause simply limited the right to an equitable remedy. Indeed, c lauses that merely plac e limitations on the rights and remedies available to the parties would generally not be found to be an ouster of the c ourt’s jurisdic tion: at [24]. Here, the Exc lusion Clause is not one that ousts the c ourt’s jurisdic tion. 

35     Apart from public polic y, it was c ertainly open to the plaintiff to argue against the enforc eability of the Exc lusion Clause. I understood the plaintiff to be alluding to this in its arguments on prematurity above. In this relation, the Court of Appeal in _CKR_ noted the applic ability of the Unfair Contrac t Terms Ac t (Cap 396, 1994 Rev Ed) as well as other c ommon law restric tions on c lauses in the same nature as the one at hand: at [23]. The Court of Appeal, however, dec lined to make a dec ision as regards the c lause in _CKR_ as no arguments on this point were made in the c ourt below. The Court of Appeal nonetheless expressed the view that given the polic y reasons underlying performanc e bonds, it is perhaps more probable than not that suc h c lauses would be found reasonable. I was not persuaded that the c irc umstanc es surrounding the Exc lusion Clause in this c ase were so unreasonable as to render it unenforc eable. 

36     Ultimately, the effec t of the Exc lusion Clause is that the plaintiff c ould not raise unc onsc ionability as a ground for resisting a c all on the guarantee. I do note that given the loc al c ase law on unc onsc ionability, this exc lusion deprived the plaintiff of a substantive and probably easier basis for obtaining and maintaining the injunc tion. Be that as it may, that is the parties’ bargain. The c lause in question is c lear in its effec t and should be given effec t to. 

**_Fraud_** 

_Standard of proof_ 

37     Apart from the issue of inc orporation, there is a question regarding the applic able standard of proof to be applied in assessing fraud. On this note, there is forc e in the argument that the appropriate standard of proof to be applied is one of a strong _prima facie_ c ase of fraudulent or unc onsc ionable c onduc t; as c an be derived from _BS Mount Sophia_ at [20]–[21]; _JBE_ at [9]. The entire c ontext of the c ase has to be c onsidered thoroughly and an injunc tion granted only if the entire c ontext was partic ularly malodorous: _BS Mount Sophia_ at [21]. 


38     Having said that, there is to my mind not a signific ant differenc e, if any, between the phrases “c lear c ase” of fraud and a “strong prima fac ie c ase”. While the Court of Appeal in _JBE_ noted some doubts as to the use of the language “c lear c ase of fraud”, suc h c onc ern was direc ted at explaining the distinc tion between fraud and unc onsc ionability that is now the law in Singapore: at [10]–[13]. In the final analysis, the c ourt has to be satisfied that the evidenc e shows the possible existenc e of fraud; though fraud need not be probable, c onc lusive or determinative. I thus used the term “c lear c ase’” in my oral remarks ac c ompanying my dec ision, but for the avoidanc e of doubt, I was satisfied that there was no strong _prima facie_ c ase (or even a _prima facie_ c ase) of fraud on the present fac ts. 

_Whether fraud was established_ 

39     To put matters in perspec tive, the present c ase is one where both sides assert that they are owed a c ertain sum by the other. Henc e, the c rux of the dispute is whether, having taken into ac c ount the sums due to eac h side, there remains a foundation for the 1st defendant to c all on the guarantee. As a result, muc h of the c ontentions foc used on showing that the c onduc t of the respec tive parties in either c laiming payment, or reduc ing or withholding payment, was justified. Ac c ording to the plaintiff’s primary position, the 1st defendant c ould not have justifiably c alled on the guarantee as its c laims against the plaintiff were c ontrived. The c onduc t of the 1st defendant was therefore fraudulent as the 1st defendant was effec tively representing to the 2nd defendant, the bank, that its c all on the guarantee was valid when it knew that there was no foundation to the c all. 

40     The c irc umstanc es and threshold to be met before fraud is invoked is exemplified and elaborated in a number of c ases and c ommentaries: 

 (a) The c learest c ase of fraud would be where an invalid c all is made by a benefic iary with the knowledge that the c all was invalid, and ac c ompanied by a representation to the bank that the c all is valid: GKN at 63. 

 (b) The presentation of obviously non-c onforming doc uments to support a c laim, without any explanation being proffered, may be suffic ient to give rise to a finding of fraud: Arab Banking Corp (B.S.C.) v Boustead Singapore Ltd <span class="citation">[2016] 3 SLR 557</span> (“ Arab Banking Corp ”) at [86]–[87]. 

 (c ) A mere assertion of fraud is not suffic ient; c orroborative evidenc e would be required: Geraldine Andrews & Ric hard Millett, Law of Guarantees (Sweet & Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2015) at para 16-028. 

 (d) A key c onsideration is the state of the alleged wrongdoer’s mind. There has to be a hint of dishonesty in the c alling on the guarantee or a rec klessness of indifferenc e to the truth: Arab Banking Corp at [60]–[67]. 

41     Here, there was insuffic ient evidenc e showing fraud in relation to the c all on the guarantee. The c irc umstanc es invoked by the plaintiff fell short of showing that there was a misrepresentation made by the 1st defendant to the bank that the c all was valid, when the 1st defendant knew that it was not. While the 1st defendant had not been entirely c onsistent or c onc lusive about its c laims against the plaintiff ( _ie_ , adjusting the quantum of c ertain c laims, among others), the more pertinent point is that it did nonetheless maintain c laims against the plaintiff before the c all. The upshot of this c onc lusion meant that it c ould not be inferred that the basis of the 1st defendant’s c all on the guarantee was entirely c ontrived at the material time. 

42     There are several c ategory of c laims the 1st defendant asserts that it has against the plaintiff, 


some of whic h are for alleged breac hes by the plaintiff whereas others are in the nature of revising the payment c laims submitted by the plaintiff: liquidated damages for the plaintiff’s delay, reevaluation works, bac k c harges and damages for water ingress to name a few. It is unnec essary to go into the details of eac h c laim at this stage. For the purposes of present disc ussion, I shall c ategorise the c laims into two broad c ategories: the first being the “liquidated damages c laim” and the sec ond being the “other c laims”. 

43     The plaintiff sought to show that a number of the c laims the 1st defendant relied on for the c all on the guarantee were c ontrived. The plaintiff also hinted at a lac k of good faith on the c all. The detailed positions of the parties are rec orded above at [14]–[17] and I will not repeat them here. The starting point of the plaintiff’s position is that the retention sum (or a least the first half of it) was indisputably owed to the plaintiff as the nec essary works had substantially been c ompleted. The 1st defendant had made adjustments to its c laims or added further c laims against the plaintiff to reduc e the amount eventually owed. The c all on the guarantee was also a retaliation against the plaintiff’s applic ation for adjudic ation over the first half of the retention sum held by the 1st defendant. 

44     I start with the liquidated damages c laim. The point made by the plaintiff is that the delay c ertific ate was issued belatedly midway through the adjudic ation proc ess. While that may be the c ase, the signific anc e of the belated issuanc e of the delay c ertific ate should not be overstated. There had been an ac tual delay in the c ompletion of the projec t bac k in 2015. Indeed, there were disc ussions over the c osts inc urred by other follow-on subc ontrac tors due to the plaintiff’s delays as evidenc ed in a letter from the 1st defendant dated 26 May 2015. What followed was a spate of exc hanges between the parties c onc erning responsibility for that delay. The 1st defendant gave the plaintiff adequate notic e that liquidated damages were being c alc ulated and would be imposed in due c ourse. This oc c urred in the early part of 2017, before the adjudic ation applic ation. Thus, while there 1st defendant might have been better advised to issue a delay c ertific ate earlier, the liquidated damages c laim c ould not be said to have been fabric ated in antic ipation of the adjudic ation applic ation. 

45     Moving to c onsider the other c laims, a number of these c laims arose prior to the adjudic ation applic ation. Although the 1st defendant c ould be c ritic ised for being inc onsistent as to the quantum or existenc e of the sum of these c laims, muc h of it c an be explained on the basis that the parties were negotiating the liability for the sums. This is evident in the exc hanges that parties had during the period leading up to the adjudic ation applic ation. 

46     The fac t that the 1st defendant reduc ed one set of c laims did not indic ate that the c all as a whole was without foundation. The 1st defendant had maintained that there were monies owing from the plaintiff. Against this c ontext, the reduc tion would appear to indic ate, at least, a good faith attempt on the part of the 1st defendant to ensure fairness and ac c urac y of its c laim against the plaintiff. Further, the reassessment of those c laims were taken at the plaintiff’s request. 

47     I am mindful that the c ourt is not c alled upon to make a definitive ruling at this stage. On this note, I was not satisfied that the 1st defendant’s c laims against the plaintiff were c ontrived. On the whole, the 1st defendant’s c laims against the plaintiff would have risen above $4.3m, the maximum sum under the guarantee, and would have been in the region of about $22.7m in total as of the hearing. It therefore stands to reason that the c all on the guarantee had a genuine foundation. There was nothing trumped up or fabric ated in the c laims made by the 1st defendant whic h would have been a c lear indic ation of fraud. There was suffic ient explanation before me for the pursuit of the c laims by the 1st defendant. The fac t that the 1st defendant had modified and amended its c laim did not establish, even on a _prima facie_ level, that the initial c laim was wholly without foundation and thus c ontrived. That said, even a baseless c laim may be made in honest belief. What is needed, but 


was lac king here, is something to show that there was either knowledge of falsity or rec kless indifferenc e to the truth on the part of the 1st defendant. It c ould not be said that the 1st defendant’s c onduc t amounted to sharp prac tic e or even pressure. Ac c ordingly, I was not persuaded that the ground of fraud was made out – whether on the basis of dishonesty, or rec klessness or indifferenc e to the truth. It may be that the c onduc t c omplained of would have justified an injunc tion on the basis of unc onsc ionability, but that is a separate matter. The plaintiff was prec luded by the Exc lusion Clause from making any suc h c laim. 

**Full disclosure** 

48     Issues were taken by the 1st defendant as to the plaintiff’s lac k of full disc losure at the time of t he _ex parte_ applic ation for the injunc tion. While there were some matters that should have been disc losed earlier, I ac c epted that the plaintiff did not fail to do so bec ause of any _mala fides_ or ulterior motive. Innoc ent omissions are generally not fatal to the grant of an injunc tion: _Tay Long Kee Impex Pte Ltd v Tan Beng Huwah (trading as Sin Kwang Wah)_ <span class="citation">[2000] 1 SLR(R) 786</span> at [35]. I therefore did not find that the injunc tion should be disc harged on this basis alone. 

**Orders in respect of arbitration** 

49     The 1st defendant inc luded a prayer in its applic ation in respec t of the arbitration but this was not ac tively pursued in the end. 

**Stay and Erinford order** 

50     Following my dec ision disc harging the injunc tion, the plaintiff sought a stay pending appeal and an Erinford order, both of whic h I dec lined to grant. I allowed, however, a stay pending leave to appeal being c onsidered by the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal has sinc e granted leave to appeal.
