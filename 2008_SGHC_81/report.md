Lai Siu Chiu J: 

1       This was a c laim by Bob Teo Seng Kee (“the plaintiff”) against Arianec orp Limited (“the defendant”) for spec ific performanc e of an agreement made in November 2006, wherein the defendant allegedly agreed to transfer 300,000 shares in a c ompany c alled abKey Pte Ltd (“the Company”) to the plaintiff for a c onsideration of $300,000 on c ertain terms. 

2       The plaintiff is the managing-direc tor as well as the major shareholder of the Company holding 1,650,000 shares. The defendant is a public c ompany that was listed on the Stoc k Exc hange of Singapore in September 1993 under its former name Vikay Industrial Ltd (“Vikay”). At the material time, the c hief exec utive offic er (“the CEO”) of the defendant was one Kea Kah Kim (“Kea”) while its c hief operating offic er was Ong Tec k Guan (“OTG”). 

3       The Company whic h business is the manufac ture of c omputer peripheral equipment, was inc orporated on 29 Marc h 2004 with the plaintiff and one Quek Seow Chim (“Quek”) as the only direc tors and shareholders eac h holding one share of $1.00 par value. The plaintiff and Quek are related by marriage as their respec tive wives are sisters. 

4       The plaintiff was the inventor and registered proprietor of the patents to a keyboard whic h he named the abKey keyboard (“the keyboard”). The keyboard was an improvement on the existing and c onventional typewriter keyboard c alled the Qwerty keyboard (“the Qwerty”). Unlike the Qwerty, the layout of the keys of the keyboard were alphabetic ally arranged so that users would not have to memorise the layout of the Qwerty in order to learn to type. The keyboard enabled a user espec ially a novic e typist, to type faster. 

5       The plaintiff needed to raise c apital for the Company from investors. Through an ac quaintanc e Ron Lee Yee Mun (“Lee”), he was introduc ed to the defendant while on his own, the plaintiff approac hed an old c lassmate Ong Eng Kee (“Ong”). Eventually, on 21 May 2004, the plaintiff, the 


defendant, Quek and Ong signed a shareholders’ agreement (“the Shareholders’ Agreement”). The defendant was issued 300,000 shares of par value $1.00 (“the defendant’s shares”) for its investment of $300,000 in the Company. Ong’s investment of $150,000 (for whic h he was issued 150,000 shares) was held in the name of his c ompany Ekong Investment Holdings Pte Ltd (“Ekong”). Quek’s 150, shares were bought from the plaintiff’s shareholding. The defendant and Ekong were entitled to have board representation for their investments. The defendant’s original nominee to the Company’s board was Then Chee Tat, its c hief financ ial offic er, whose suc c essor OTG replac ed him on the board. OTG was not/is not a direc tor of the defendant. Ong was Ekong’s nominee on the board. Although Lee was also a signatory to the Shareholders’ Agreement, he was not issued any shares eventually as he had failed to proc ure The Ec onomic Development Board to bec ome a 20% shareholder. 

6       On the same day that the Shareholders’ Agreement was signed, the plaintiff lic ensed his rights under the patents to the Company under a lic enc e agreement (the Lic enc e Agreement”) in c onsideration of whic h he was allotted 1,650,000 fully paid shares in the Company. Under the terms of the Lic enc e Agreement, the rights to the patents reverted to the plaintiff in the event the Company was wound up. 

7       Under c l 15.12.1 of the Shareholders’ Agreement, the defendant was given the first right of refusal to manufac ture the keyboard, whic h was the only produc t marketed by the Company. The Company did outsourc e the manufac ture of the keyboard to the defendant on the basis that the defendant’s pric es were reasonable and c ompetitive and it would be able to meet deadlines for quotations and deliverables. 

8       The defendant and the Company signed an agreement on 1 July 2004 c alled a Management Servic e and Fac ilities Rental Agreement under whic h the defendant rented work-stations and offic e equipment at its premises to the Company at $1,000 per month and c harged the Company a further $3,000 a month for the provision of professional (suc h as ac c ounting) and administrative servic es. 

9       The defendant in turn subc ontrac ted the manufac ture of the keyboard to a c ompany c alled Rac er Tec hnology Pte Ltd (“Rac er”) whic h produc ed the first shipment of 2,000 sets of the keyboard in June 2005, instead of the original deadline of midDec ember 2004. Customers who had plac ed orders c omplained of the delay and worse, there were quality problems with the keyboard they rec eived, resulting in c omplaints from users. The defendant eventually terminated its c ontrac tmanufac turing arrangement with the Company in September 2005. 

10     In an attempt to resolve the manufac turing deadloc k, the plaintiff held an informal meeting of the Company’s direc tors in Marc h 2006. It was there agreed that Rac er would be paid its outstanding invoic es and Rac er would then release the plastic moulds for the keyboard to the defendant. However, between the Company and the defendant there was another impasse. The Company c ould not/would not pay the defendant for the inventory (whic h the plaintiff c laimed was overpric ed and whic h purc hase had not been approved by the Company) while the defendant would not release the inventory unless it rec eived payment. The only way the Company c ould pay for the inventory was by way of letters of c redit from its c ustomers, whic h the defendant refused. 

11     It had previously been agreed between the parties that the Company would pay the defendant 60% of tooling c osts amounting to US$76,096.44 by 10 November 2004 followed by the remaining 40% amounting to US$48,315.20 within one year of 12 Oc tober 2004, by the Company purc hasing 100,000 sets of the keyboard from the defendant, pric ed at US$0.483. If the Company was unable to purc hase 100,000 sets of the keyboard within the stipulated deadline, it would have to pay the defendant in c ash the balanc e amount owing. The Company only paid the defendant (on 28 Oc tober 2004) US$38,048.22 amounting to 30% instead of 60%, of the tooling c osts. 


12     In an attempt to break the impasse regarding the inventory withheld by the defendant, the plaintiff sent an email to Kea on 26 September 2006 c opied to all the Company’s direc tors, c alling for a meeting of the board of direc tors on 5 Oc tober 2006 to disc uss the Company’s status and to resolve its problems. Kea responded stating he was not a direc tor of the Company. (In another email sent on 27 September 2006 to OTG and Kea, the plaintiff had indic ated that unless there was a c hange in c irc umstanc es, he would have no c hoic e but to wind up the Company). As OTG did not turn up for the board meeting on 5 Oc tober 2006, the other direc tors _viz_ the plaintiff, Ong and Quek dec ided to postpone the meeting for a week to 12 Oc tober 2006. 

13     On 12 Oc tober 2006, the entire board met at the Pan Pac ific Hotel (“the meeting”). Cindy Chang (‘Cindy”), a staff member from the Company’ auditors, was also present to rec ord the minutes of the meeting whic h she did (see AB129-131). Cindy’s minutes were c onsistent with the defendant’s version (as given by OTG and Ong) of what transpired at the meeting, whic h was c haired by OTG. 

14     The first part of the meeting related to OTG’s request to the plaintiff for an update on the developments on the Company partic ularly on the plaintiff’s efforts to raise new c apital from fund managers. The disc ussion then turned to produc tion problems, the quality of the keyboard and the diffic ulty of obtaining fresh funding if the Company did not have a produc t or stoc ks. The plaintiff handed out a list whic h detailed the Company’s dispute with the defendant and his proposal to resolve the problems. OTG’s reply to the list and proposal was that he c ould not respond as he was not wearing the defendant’s hat but rather that of the Company’s direc tor. The direc tors then dec ided not to deliberate on the issues but to let the plaintiff raise them to the defendant direc tly. OTG c ommented that the plaintiff should negotiate with the defendant and Rac er to agree on terms for the release of the inventory. 

15     It was c ommon ground that at some point of the disc ussion, the plaintiff offered to buy the defendant’s shares as well as Ekong’s shares. It was also not in dispute that the plaintiff produc ed blank offer letters (“the offer letter”) he had earlier prepared and whic h he handed to OTG and Ong meant for the defendant and Ekong respec tively. The offer letter reads: 

 Agreement 

 I_____________(nric no. ) ac ting on behalf of ______________do hereby agree to sell all my/our stakeholding in abKey Pte Ltd c omprising of _______shares or __% to __________________This will take effec t immediately upon my rec eipt from _________________of a total of S$_________, being the full payment thereof. I also hereby undertake to resign from my abKey board of direc tor’s appointment, relinquishing all the attendant benefits and privileges thereof, with immediate effec t. 

 Signed this ____day of Oc tober 2006 

 Witness_____________

16     The plaintiff then offered to buy the defendant’s shares for $300,000 (“the purc hase pric e”) and similarly offered to buy Ekong’s 150,000 shares from Ong for $150,000. Although both were surprised by the plaintiff’s move, OTG and Ong indic ated they would ac c ept the plaintiff’s offers. Ong there and then signed the offer letter (“Ekong’s offer letter”) filling in the blanks by naming Ekong as the seller of 150,000 shares at the pric e of $150,000 and naming the plaintiff as the buyer (see AB132). Ong’s signature was witnessed by the plaintiff and Cindy. 


17     The minutes rec orded by Cindy c ontained the following last paragraph: 

 It was then rec orded that Mr Ong Eng Kee and Ariane Corporation had agreed to sell their entire stake in the Company to Mr Bob Teo &/or his nominees at par value for the shares held by these shareholders. 

On 26 Oc tober 2006, Cindy had emailed to OTG, the plaintiff, Ong and Quek the minutes and had c alled for c omments thereon. The plaintiff did not c hallenge the ac c urac y of the minutes. In fac t, he replied to Cindy’s email (at DB 1) the same night to thank her for “the very ac c urate and professional minutes”. 

18     OTG did not sign the offer letter meant for the defendant (“the defendant’s offer letter”) as he thought it required the signature of the defendant’s CEO. Henc e, he took the doc ument bac k to the defendant’s offic e. On the same day he notified Kea of the plaintiff’s offer and that he (OTG) had ac c epted the plaintiff’s offer to buy the defendant’s shares at the purc hase pric e. Kea informed OTG that it was not nec essary for the defendant’s board to approve the disposal of its shares in the Company and that OTG c ould sign the defendant’s offer letter. 

19     Consequently, OTG signed the defendant’s offer letter on or about 25 Oc tober 2006 after whic h he telephoned the plaintiff to say the doc ument c ould be c ollec ted from the defendant’s offic e. The plaintiff indic ated he would c ollec t the same the following day. 

20     On 26 Oc tober 2006, while OTG was away from the defendant’s offic e, the plaintiff turned up at the defendant’s offic e. However, he failed to c ollec t the defendant’s offer letter whic h OTG had left with Joyc e Foo (“Joyc e”) of the defendant’s ac c ounts’ department. Upon his return to the defendant’s offic e that evening, OTG was told by Joyc e that the plaintiff refused to c ollec t the defendant’s offer letter on the ground that the plaintiff wanted to disc uss several issues with the defendant. 

21     Surprised at the turn of events, OTG sent an email to the plaintiff that same evening (at AB 135) stating as follows: 

 As I understood very c learly with the presenc e of the rest of the direc tors, you had agreed and offered to buy bac k the shares from Mr Ong and ArianeCorp at the same value that they invested in. 

 As I understood from my staff, I also realized that you had now resc inded and retrac ted on your words and ac tions and you had refused to honour and take the offer letter bac k after we had signed it. Please ac knowledge this asap. I hope that you understand this will c onstitute an appropriate ac tion from us. 

22     OTG rec eived a reply from the plaintiff the same night at 7.40pm (c opied to Ong and Quek) as follows: 

 You were not in when I c ame over to AC and Joyc e gave me our signed offer letter. I told her to hold on to it as there are several issues that need to be resolved between us. 

 Rest assured that I have not retrac ted nor resc inded on my words or ac tions, something I c onsider most reprehensible in business. 

23     What transpired thereafter was the bone of c ontention between the parties. Unfortunately, the 


defendant’s offer letter was not produc ed in c ourt as the defendant was unable to loc ate it thereafter. Joyc e left the defendant’s employment in April 2007 and she c ould not rec all where she had kept the doc ument. Although it would have been preferable for the c ourt to have had sight of the doc ument, the defendant’s omission to produc e the doc ument was not fatal to its c ase for the reason that: (a) the plaintiff never denied the existenc e of the defendant’s offer letter and (b) Ekong’s offer letter, whic h was a mirror image of the defendant’s offer letter, was produc ed (see AB 132) to the c ourt by Ong who was a witness. 

**The plaintiff’s version of events** 

24     Ac c ording to the plaintiff’s written testimony, there was only an agreement reac hed “in princ iple” with OTG at the meeting, for him to buy the defendant’s shares. The plaintiff asserted he did not have an opportunity then and it was also too premature for him, to state his c onditions for the purc hase of the defendant’s shares. He preferred to raise the subjec t after OTG had spoken to Kea on the matter. 

25     The plaintiff did not deny rec eiving OTG’s email dated 26 Oc tober 2006 nor his reply thereto as set out in [21] and [22] above. However, the plaintiff alleged that in a telephone c onversation he had with OTG on 1 November 2006, he had told OTG that he would be prepared to buy all the defendant’s shares at par value only on c ondition that the defendant wrote off the Company’s outstanding debts and released to the Company the inventory the defendant withheld (inc luding keyboard materials for whic h the Company had made partial payment and stoc ks and materials) save for membranes. He c laimed that OTG ac c epted his offer and agreed to write off the Company’s debts, exc ept that OTG did not agree to release the inventory. 

26     On 2 November 2006, the plaintiff sent an email to OTG reiterating his telephone offer of the previous day. As the email is the gravamen of the plaintiff’s c laim, I shall set out its text in full (see AB 136): 

 As we disc ussed on the phone, Wednesday, wherein you reiterated that you are prepared to write off all outstanding debts in return for my buying all of AC shares for par value of S$300K. 

 As generous as it is, I am afraid even if I am to raise $300K, we’ll not be able to survive starting from sc ratc h given the long delay – in terms of time and funds needed. As you know, my main aim is to prevent c losing down the Company so that the shareholders/c reditors do not lose all their money. 

 I am prepared to bear the risk and buy bac k your shares at par if, in addition to debt writeoff, AC also releases for our use, your inventory of stoc k and materials, exc ept for the membranes and inc luding the mold (sic ), for whic h we had made partial payment. 

27     OTG responded to the plaintiff the same morning (at AB 136) as follows: 

 The release of inventory inc lusive of the mould must be upon full settlement of $300,000 to ArianeCorp. I will speak to Mr Kea for his final approval. 

OTG rec eived an immediate response from the plaintiff that said: 

 Let me know when you’ve heard from Mr Kea. 

28     On 10 November 2006, OTG reverted to the plaintiff by email (c opied to Kea) as follows: 


 I’ve disc ussed with Mr Kea. All items inc lusive of mould will be released to you immediately onc e the $300,000 is deposited into our bank ac c ount. 

29     It was the plaintiff’s c ase (as pleaded in his statement of c laim) but whic h the defendant denied, that there was a c onc luded agreement on 2 November 2006 or latest on 10 November 2006 whereby he would buy the defendant’s shares in the Company at the purc hase pric e, the defendant would release the inventory and treat the Company’s debts as extinguished (“the November agreement”). 

**The defendant’s version of events** 

30     OTG not surprisingly denied the plaintiff’s c laim of the November agreement. OTG asserted that the oral c ontrac t c onc luded on 12 Oc tober 2006 was only for the plaintiff to buy the defendant’s shares at the purc hase pric e. There were no terms attac hed to the oral c ontrac t let alone the two c onditions the plaintiff alleged in [29] above. 

31     In his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief (“AEIC”), OTG deposed that the defendant’s offer letter was in the exac t same terms as Ekong’s offer letter that Ong had signed at the meeting, agreeing to sell Ekong’s 150,000 shares to the plaintiff (or the plaintiff’s nominees) at par value without qualific ation. Why should the defendant’s shares be treated differently from Ekong’s? He pointed out that it made no c ommerc ial sense for the defendant to have to suffer losses instead of making a gain on its investment and at the same time to have to c anc el the debts owed by the Company as well as release its inventory. 

32     OTG added that after he had signed the defendant’s offer letter and c ontac ted the plaintiff to c ollec t the same, the plaintiff had made no mention of any c onditions attac hing to his offer to buy the defendant’s shares, either in their telephone c onversation on 25 Oc tober 2006 or, in his email reply to OTG on 26 Oc tober 2006. This was after the plaintiff had had sight of the defendant’s (signed) offer letter albeit he refused to ac c ept it. 

33     OTG ac c used the plaintiff of unilaterally attempting to vary the oral c ontrac t _after_ 12 Oc tober 2006, first on 26 Oc tober 2006 and subsequently on 2 November 2006. OTG pointed out that he had not agreed to the plaintiff’s telephone request of 1 November 2006 in [25] above on the two c onditions the plaintiff had imposed for his purc hase of the defendant’s shares. Consequently, it was absurd of the plaintiff to state in his email of 2 November 2006 at [26] that OTG had agreed. OTG added that in his email response in [27], he had unequivoc ally stated that he would speak to Kea for approval to release the inventory upon full settlement of the purc hase pric e. If indeed there was the November agreement, the plaintiff would not have responded to say “Let me know when you have heard from Mr Kea”. 

34     OTG explained his email of 10 November 2006 in [28] as a gratuitous offer by him to release the inventory on c ondition that the defendant rec eived full payment of the purc hase pric e. He did not however offer to write-off the Company’s debts. 

**Subsequent events** 

35     The events that took plac e after 10 November 2006 are not in dispute between the parties. 

36     On 19 Dec ember 2006, the plaintiff handed at the defendant’s offic e a personal c heque for $250,000. OTG attended to the plaintiff and inquired as to why the plaintiff was only making partpayment instead of the purc hase pric e in full. The plaintiff replied that he did not have the resourc es 


to pay the full amount. OTG informed the plaintiff he would need to speak to Kea on the plaintiff’s request for part-payment. At the same time, he requested the plaintiff to pay $250,000 by a c ashier’s order instead of by c heque. 

37     On the same day, OTG emailed Kea on the plaintiff’s request for part-payment and inquired if Kea was prepared to agree. Kea’s email reply on 20 Dec ember 2006 stated: 

 I thought the agreement was for $300K. 

whic h OTG understood to mean the plaintiff’s request was rejec ted. 

38     On 20 Dec ember 2006, the plaintiff went to the defendant’s offic e to deliver a c ashier’s order for $250,000 whic h OTG ac c epted. OTG also proc ured the plaintiff’s personal undertaking (“the personal undertaking”) whic h stated: 

 This is to c ertify that I, Teo Seng Kee NRIC no. 0005021J of 117 Edgefield Plains #04-328, Singapore 820117, do hereby undertake to pay ArianeCorp Ltd, a sum of S$50,000 in full by 31 Marc h 2007, being the balanc e of full settlement for the transfer of shares of abKey to me, as stipulated in the Share Transfer Form, dated herein 20 Dec ember 2006. 

In exc hange for the c ashier’s order and the personal undertaking, OTG exec uted a share transfer form on the defendant’s behalf and also signed a letter of resignation as direc tor of the Company. Both doc uments were handed over to the plaintiff. The plaintiff sc ribbled on the share transfer form the words “S$250K payable now and 50K by 31.3.07”. I should point out that the share transfer form produc ed in c ourt (at AB 147) was one of two with the other c opy being retained by the defendant, ac c ording to the plaintiff’s evidenc e. The plaintiff explained that the defendant’s share transfer form had stapled to it email c orrespondenc e but he was told by one Yvonne that the doc ument, together with the attac hments, had been lost. It was in the c ourse of OTG’s c ross-examination that c ounsel for the defendant produc ed the defendant’s c opy of the share transfer form (marked as exhibit D-1) and sought to prove that the plaintiff’s testimony was untrue bec ause the doc ument did not show staple marks at the top left hand c orner suc h as to prove it had attac hments previously. 

39     OTG highlighted the omission from the personal undertaking (see AB 145/146) of any referenc e to release of the inventory or the writing-off of the Company’s debts by the defendant. 

40     OTG subsequently informed the plaintiff on 27 Dec ember 2006 that Kea preferred the balanc e of $50,000 to be paid onc e the defendant released all inventory items to the Company instead of waiting until 31 Marc h 2007. The plaintiff agreed to the revised arrangement. 

41     However, despite his many attempts and his email to OTG of 9 January 2006, the plaintiff c laimed that for three weeks thereafter, he was unable to c ontac t either OTG or Kea to obtain the release of the inventory to the Company even though he was prepared to pay the balanc e $50, and had a c ashier’s order for the amount ready for the exc hange. 

42     Consequently, the plaintiff sent a reminder on 19 January 2007 to the defendant as follows: 

 Almost a month has transpired sinc e our share transfer agreement and sinc e you have rec eived and c ashed our c heque for S$250,000. 

 You have yet to fulfil your obligations, as per the agreed terms of the share transfer agreement, namely that, in addition to writing off all abKey debts to ArianeCorp, you would release 


 immediately: 

 All inventory items – inc lusive of the mould, stoc k and materials (exc ept for the membranes). 

 (You have also yet to provide us the doc uments that are needed by our Sec retary, whic h I had asked for time and again). 

 Although you had originally agreed to our paying the balanc e of $50,000 by 31Marc h 07, as per the verbal agreement between Ong Tec k Guan and me, I have c onc eded to pay ArianeCorp the balanc e of S$50,000 immediately upon your release of all inventory items........................ 

 We expec t the transfer to be effec ted, and doc uments and inventory materials to be c ompletely handed over before 5pm 24 January 07. Otherwise, we have no c hoic e but to assume that you have no interest in fulfilling the terms of the agreement. 

43     The plaintiff then rec eived the following response from OTG on 25 January 2007 (at AB 165): 

 I refer to your email of 19 January. If you will review our previous disc ussions on this matter, our agreement was that you would pay us S$300,000 for the release only of the moulds, stoc k and materials (exc ept for the membranes). I did not ac c ept your offer for S$300,000 payment to c over (a) release of the moulds, stoc k and materials (exc ept for the membranes) (b) writeoff of the inventory (c ) transfer to you of the shares. 

 I noted the payment to us of S$250,000. As per the original agreement, I am prepared to release the moulds, stoc k and materials (exc ept for the membranes). However, transfer of shares will only be done after you have either paid the debts that is owed to AC or given satisfac tory sec urity for repayment of the debt. 

 As we have rec eived numerous proposals and c ounter proposals from you that are always short of all outstanding to ArianeCorp; and having reviewed your c ase with management, we are prepared to listen to your new proposal. 

 David will represent ArianeCorp in resolving all outstanding issues. Please get in touc h with him. 

44     In his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief (“AEIC”), OTG ac c used the plaintiff of exploiting the defendant’s indulgenc e by splitting payment of the $300,000 into two tranc hes, hoping thereby to forc e the defendant to release the inventory in exc hange for the balanc e payment of $50,000 and attempting to revive his proposed variation to the defendant’s offer letter. 

45     The plaintiff on his part alleged that OTG did a _volte face_ by the email in [43] above on what had previously been agreed. In the event, the plaintiff did not pay the balanc e $50,000 by 31 Marc h 2007 or at all. Instead, he c ommenc ed this suit on 17 April 2007. I should add that ten days after the c ommenc ement of this suit, the defendant sued the Company in Suit No. 269 of 2007 for sums in exc ess of US$200,00 for _inter alia_ an outstanding short term loan, fees due under the Management Servic e and Fac ilities Rental Agreement in [8] above and the inventory. The c laim for inventory (and c ost of materials) alone was US$188,642.14 approximating $258,439.73 (at US$1.00 to $1.37). 

**The pleadings** 

46     In the statement of c laim, the plaintiff repeated the fac ts set out in [15] to [28] above and alleged that he had, by the November agreement, a binding c ontrac t for him to purc hase the 


defendant’s shares in c onsideration for whic h the defendant had agreed to release the Company’s inventory as well as write-off its debts. The plaintiff asserted he was willing and able as of 24 January 2007 and thereafter, to perform his outstanding obligations under the November agreement and to pay the balanc e of $50,000. The plaintiff c laimed dec laratory relief as well as spec ific performanc e of the November agreement. 

47     In its defenc e and c ounterc laim, the defendant denied the November agreement. The defendant c ontended that the oral c ontrac t had been reac hed muc h earlier (on 12 Oc tober 2006) as evidenc ed in the minutes of the meeting. 

48     The defendant alleged that it was the plaintiff who was in breac h of c ontrac t as he had failed to c omply with the personal undertaking to pay the balanc e sum by 31 Marc h 2007. The defendant c ontended that the plaintiff attempted to c hange the terms of the oral c ontrac t unilaterally. 

49     The defendant c ounterc laimed for the balanc e outstanding of $50,000 and prayed for a dec laration that the parties reac hed agreement on 12 Oc tober 2006 for the plaintiff to purc hase the defendant’s shares in the Company at the purc hase pric e. The defendant also c laimed spec ific performanc e of the oral c ontrac t. 

**The evidence** 

50     Apart from the plaintiff, Quek was the only other witness for the plaintiff’s c ase while Ong testified for the defendant together with OTG and Kea. The two key witnesses were the plaintiff and OTG. I should add that neither the testimony of Quek nor of Kea was partic ularly helpful to the c ourt. In Quek’s c ase, a large portion of his AEIC c omprised of what he was told by the plaintiff as he was generally not involved in the running of the Company’s business. Neither did Quek have sight of either the defendant’s or Ekong’s offer letters (see para 40 of his AEIC) even though he attended the meeting. Similarly, Kea’s testimony was essentially based on what was reported to him by OTG. I shall return to Ong’s testimony later in the judgment. 

51     Not surprisingly, one side c ritic ised the testimony of the other party’s main witness as unreliable. Ac c ordingly, the plaintiff sought to prove that OTG was not a c redible witness and c onversely, the defendant submitted that no relianc e should be plac ed on the plaintiff’s testimony for the same reason. 

**The plaintiff’s case** 

52     I start by reviewing the plaintiff’s evidenc e. It was his c ontention (and pleaded c ase) that his agreement to buy the defendant’s shares in princ iple at the meeting was borne out by OTG’s evidenc e. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that his c lient’s offer letters to the defendant and Ekong only amounted to an invitation to treat at law. 

53     The plaintiff asserted that the oral c ontrac t alleged by the defendant c ould not have been c onc luded on 12 Oc tober 2006 and he only offered to buy out the defendant at the meeting (but not at par value) bec ause of the following evidenc e: 

 (a) the defendant’s offer letter was blank, it was neither filled in nor signed as OTG himself indic ated (albeit mistakenly) that he c ould not/would not sign until he obtained approval from the defendant’s board; 

 (b) the plaintiff had raised at the meeting (and it was the very purpose for his c alling the 


 meeting) the deadloc k between the two c ompanies over the issue of the inventory; 

 (c ) at the meeting, OTG himself said he was wearing the hat of a direc tor of the Company and not the defendant (although he did an about-turn in the witness stand at N/E 162). OTG therefore dec lined to disc uss the list of issues raised by the plaintiff; 

 (d) unless the deadloc k was then resolved, ac c ording to the plaintiff’s testimony (at N/E 79) as well as that of Quek (at N/E 129-130), it made no sense for the plaintiff to buy the defendant’s shares as the Company c ould not move forward but he would end up with a personal liability; 

 (e) no terms were disc ussed (inc luding payment) on the purc hase of the defendant’s shares; and 

 (f ) unless OTG reverted to the plaintiff to c onfirm the defendant’s willingness to sell its shares, it would be premature to disc uss any terms of sale. 

54     The plaintiff pointed to OTG’s subsequent c onduc t/events and the evidenc e adduc ed in c ourt as reinforc ing his c ase that no oral c ontrac t was c onc luded at the meeting: 

 (a) on 25 Oc tober 2006, the defendant’s offer letter duly signed by OTG represented the defendant’s firm offer to sell the defendant’s shares to the plaintiff; 

 (b) unlike Ekong’s offer letter, the plaintiff did not c ountersign the defendant’s offer letter to indic ate his ac c eptanc e of the defendant’s offer; 

 (c ) OTG did not reply to the plaintiff’s email dated 26 Oc tober 2006 at [22] to say that an agreement to buy the defendant’s shares had already been c onc luded at the meeting; 

 (d) if indeed there was a c onc luded c ontrac t as of 12 Oc tober 2006, OTG would not have offered to release (gratuitously he c laimed) in his email at [27] the inventory in exc hange for the purc hase pric e; 

 (e) OTG c onc eded under c ross-examination (at N/E 179) that before 10 November 2006, the defendant did not have an enforc eable agreement with the plaintiff for the transfer of the defendant’s shares, and 

 (f ) Kea agreed (at N/E 245 and 249) that the purc hase pric e was for both the defendant’s shares and release of the inventory. 

55     The plaintiff then submitted that the c ourt should ac c ept his testimony (and pleaded c ase) that the November agreement was the c onc luded c ontrac t based on the following evidenc e: 

 (a) OTG agreed during c ross-examination (at N/E 169) that the defendant was willing to release the inventory whic h value was between $250,000 and $500,000 whereas the Company’s outstanding debts were $100,000 to $150,000 as c laimed in Suit No. 269 of 2007 (see [45] above); 

 (b) there was no reason for the defendant not to agree (in exc hange for the purc hase pric e) to extinguish the Company’s debts whic h were of lesser value, if it was willing to release inventory worth $500,000; 

 (c ) OTG did not deny he had a telephone c onversation with the plaintiff on 1 November 2006 at 


 [25] nor what the plaintiff said to him; 

 (d) therefore OTG must have agreed in that c onversation that the defendant would write off the Company’s debts in exc hange for the plaintiff’s payment of the purc hase pric e. Otherwise OTG’s reply [27] to the plaintiff’s email in [26] would have said there was no agreement for debt write-off; 

 (e) similarly, OTG’s email of 10 November 2006 did not deny the plaintiff’s email of 2 November 

2006\. His message merely reiterated that the defendant would release the inventory upon its rec eipt of $300,000. 

56     Counsel for the defendant desc ribed as “lame” OTG’s explanation (at N/E 169) that the defendant had dec ided to release the inventory to the Company bec ause the inventory was of no value to the defendant. It was also untrue bec ause the defendant had sued the Company for the value of the inventory in Suit No. 269 of 2007 (see [45] above). 

57     Despite the agreement reflec ted in [54(f )] based on the defendant’s own c onc ession, c ounsel for the plaintiff c omplained that the defendant or more spec ific ally OTG, attempted to vary the agreement yet again after the plaintiff had paid the defendant $250,000 by c ashier’s order on 20 Dec ember 2006. Counsel referred in partic ular to OTG’s email to the plaintiff dated 25 January 2007 at [43] where the defendant adopted a “new position” that the $300,000 c onsideration was for release of the inventory and not for transfer of the defendant’s shares or write-off of the Company’s debts. Yet in c ourt under c ross-examination (at N/E 185 and 202) and again in re-examination (N/E 232-233), OTG had repeatedly said that the inventory would be released to the Company onc e the plaintiff paid the balanc e $50,000. OTG’s evidenc e as well as the defendant’s c losing submissions (at para 114) c ontradic ted para 21 of the defenc e whic h pleaded that the defendant’s gratuitous offer to release the inventory was no longer valid as the plaintiff failed to tender full payment of the purc hase pric e. 

58     Other fac tors brought to the c ourt’s attention by c ounsel for the plaintiff were the following: 

 (a) OTG admitted he never told the plaintiff when the latter handed him the c ashier’s order for $250,000 that the same was unac c eptable and that the defendant required full payment of the purc hase pric e; 

 (b) the defendant reneged on its agreement to transfer the defendant’s shares, release the inventory and write off the Company’s debts; 

 (c ) the plaintiff had always been willing, ready and able to pay the balanc e $50,000 sinc e 9 January 2007; 

 (d) the minutes at [17] were inc omplete as it was not stated that the plaintiff had handed offer letters to Ong and OTG nor was there mention that OTG said he needed to get board approval to sign the defendant’s offer letter. Consequently, although the plaintiff agreed the minutes were ac c urate, they were inc omplete and not c onc lusive of an oral c ontrac t having been c onc luded between the parties. 

59     Counsel for the plaintiff drew a c lear distinc tion between Ekong’s offer letter and the defendant’s offer letter. It was submitted that the plaintiff made the same invitation to treat to Ong for Ekong’s shares but Ong reac ted differently from OTG to the doc ument. Ong did not have to c onsult or obtain the approval of, anyone else in order to ac c ept the plaintiff’s invitation to treat. 


Henc e, Ong c ould fill in all the blanks in Ekong’s offer letter, sign it and return it to the plaintiff who ac c epted thereby Ekong’s offer to sell its 150,000 shares for $150,000. Ekong and the defendant were two separate entities and neither Ong nor Ekong had issues with the plaintiff like the defendant over debts or inventory bec ause Ekong and/or Ong had no involvement in the Company’s business. 

60     In the light of OTG’s/the defendant’s c onstantly shifting position whic h was also inc onsistent with the email exc hanges produc ed in c ourt and whic h c ontradic ted the defendant’s pleaded c ase, the plaintiff’s submissions urged the c ourt not to ac c ept the defendant’s c ontention that there was an oral c ontrac t c onc luded on 12 Oc tober 2006. Instead, the plaintiff requested the c ourt to ac c ept that the parties’ rights were governed by the November agreement. 

61     The defendant’s c ounsel not surprisingly was equally c ritic al of the plaintiff’s testimony as his opponent was of the evidenc e of OTG. First, it was pointed out that the plaintiff had c onc eded under c ross-examination (at N/E 23) and when questioned by the c ourt (at N/E 29) that he made the offer to buy out the defendant’s shares as well as Ekong’s shares on 12 Oc tober 2006. The plaintiff’s witness Quek (PW2) had also c onfirmed that it was the plaintiff who made the offer to buy out the other two shareholders. If indeed the offer c ame from the defendant as the plaintiff c ontended, there was no reason for OTG to have been surprised by the plaintiff’s move just as Quek was. Contrary to the plaintiff’s pleaded c ase, the defendant argued that there was nothing on the evidenc e to suggest and/or show that the sale of the defendant’s shares was subjec t to further negotiations between the parties. 

62     The defendant relied on Ong’s testimony to support its interpretation of the events that took plac e on 12 Oc tober 2006. Ong (DW3) had c onfirmed (at N/E 266) that the plaintiff offered to buy the shares of the defendant and Ekong and OTG was agreeable to the offer. Ekong similarly ac c epted the plaintiff’s offer to buy its 150,000 shares. There was no reason to treat the defendant differently. The defendant desc ribed OTG’s need to obtain Kea’s signature or to obtain the defendant board’s approval to the defendant’s offer letter as a mere formality. 

63     The defendant also plac ed relianc e on the minutes of the meeting as well as on the plaintiff’s c onformation of the ac c urac y of the minutes at [17]. Consequently, the defendant argued, there was no evidenc e to support the plaintiff’s c ase that only “in princ iple” agreement had been reac hed on 12 Oc tober 2006 for the purc hase of the defendant’s shares. The fac t that the plaintiff praised Cindy in his email at [17] on rec eipt of the minutes from Cindy (see DB 1) spoke for itself. The plaintiff’s exc use (at N/E 22) that he did not see a need to disc lose his email to Cindy was not due to inadvertenc e. It was a deliberate ac t of c onc ealment and the defendant invited the c ourt to draw an adverse inferenc e against the plaintiff for his non-disc losure. 

64     The defendant pointed to the fac t that the plaintiff’s email of 26 Oc tober in [22] supported its c ase that there was already a c onc luded c ontrac t by that date. The defendant also plac ed relianc e on the c ourt’s exc hange with the plaintiff (at N/E 26-28) to show that it was unnec essary for the plaintiff to have c ountersigned the defendant’s offer letter to indic ate his ac c eptanc e of the defendant’s shares. 

65     The defendant argued that there c ould not have been a c onc lusion of the c ontrac t on 2 or 10 November 2006 bec ause there was no unequivoc al ac c eptanc e by the defendant of the plaintiff’s proposals of adding two c onditions to the transfer of the defendant’s shares in the Company. OTG had also denied he had agreed to the c onditions when he spoke to the plaintiff on 1 November 2006. The plaintiff’s email of 2 November 2006 [26] did not mention that an agreement had been reac hed on 1 November 2006. It merely proposed the plaintiff’s two c onditions for buying the defendant’s shares. 


66     As for OTG’s email of 10 November 2006 at [28], the defendant argued that it c ould not at law be c onstrued as an ac c eptanc e of the plaintiff’s c ounteroffer of 2 November 2006 as there was a material variation from the plaintiff’s offer; nothing in OTG’s email suggested there was a waiver of the Company’s debts owed to the defendant. In any c ase, the plaintiff did not respond to OTG’s email. 

67     The defendant c ritic ised the plaintiff’s explanation that it would not have made c ommerc ial sense for him to buy the defendant’s shares without resolving the two issues (of the inventory and the Company’s debts) as an afterthought and an unsustainable attempt to justify his c ase. It was said that the plaintiff regretted entering into the oral c ontrac t without agreeing with the defendant on the release of the inventory and the debt write-offs. However, it was not the func tion of the c ourts to set aside a bad bargain (c iting _Tai Joon Lan v Yun Ai Chin & Anor_ <span class="citation">[1993] 3 SLR 129</span>). The plaintiff’s c losing submissions pointed out that this and the other c ases c ited by the defendant ( _Bell & Anor v Lever Brothers Limited_ [1932] AC 161; _Trollope & Colls Ltd v North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board_ [1973] 1 WLR 601) were c ases in whic h written c ontrac ts were already in existenc e. Consequently, the c ourts were reluc tant to imply any term into the written agreements that the parties had already c onc luded, just so as to overc ome the hardships suffered by any one party from a bad bargain. 

68     The defendant’s c losing submissions desc ribed the 59 year old plaintiff as no simpleton but as someone who had c alc ulated his moves – first to get the defendant’s shares at par value and when his offer to the defendant was ac c epted (as the defendant would want to rec oup its investment), he then introduc ed the two c onditions for his purc hase of the defendant’s shares. 

69     The defendant’s submission also sought to explain away some of the inc onsistenc ies in OTG’s evidenc e as well as in the defendant’s c ase. Despite the c onc essions made in c ourt by both OTG and Kea, the defendant maintained its position that the release of the inventory was a gratuitous offer made as a gesture of goodwill, provided the plaintiff paid the outstanding balanc e of $50,000. 

70     As for the plaintiff’s argument (put to OTG during c ross-examination) that the defendant had benefited from the use of the $250,000 payment made by the plaintiff and yet he did not rec eive a single share from the defendant in return, the defendant sought to persuade the c ourt (a submission that the plaintiff desc ribed as audac ious and ludic rous) that the fault lay with the plaintiff! He failed to pay the balanc e $50,000. 

71     The defendant further alleged that it had all along relied on the personal undertaking that the plaintiff would pay the balanc e due to the defendant by 31 Marc h 2007. This submission totally ignored the evidenc e that OTG had informed the plaintiff on 27 Dec ember 2006 at [40] that Kea wanted the plaintiff to pay the balanc e as soon as possible and not wait until 31 Marc h 2007 to do so. It further overlooked the plaintiff’s email of 9 January 2006 in [41] above whic h stated he had a c ashier’s order for $50,000 ready to be exc hanged for the defendant’s share transfer form and release of the inventory. 

72     The defendant c laimed the plaintiff had misinterpreted the true intent of OTG’s email dated 25 January 2006 set out in [43] above. Its c ounsel submitted the c ourt should read the email in its entirety together with the last paragraph. The defendant’s submission (para 118) explained that the defendant was extremely frustrated with the plaintiff’s c onstantly c hanging positions _viz_ the inc lusion of additional c onditions, his exc use of not having enough c ash to pay one lump sum of $300,000. Henc e the “new position” (in the defendant’s words) set out in the email was a reac tion on the part of OTG to the plaintiff’s c onstant variation attempts and to his failure to pay the balanc e $50,000. 

73     I should point that the plaintiff rejec ted the defendant’s above explanation in its submissions on 


the basis that there was no ambiguity in the email. I agree with the plaintiff’s submission that it was c rystal c lear from OTG’s email that he denied there was any agreement to transfer the defendant’s shares. 

**The findings** 

74     While the plaintiff’s failure to disc lose his email to Cindy (DB 1) was inexc usable and his explanation for his omission was unc onvinc ing, I had no other reasons to doubt the verac ity of his evidenc e. On the whole, the plaintiff’s testimony was satisfac tory and the email he sent to Cindy c annot be c onsidered to be fatal to his c ase. Counsel for the defendant made muc h of the fac t that the c ourt (at N/E 28) when questioning the plaintiff did not ac c ept or understand some of his answers. I do not put too muc h store on that isolated inc ident either in my overall assessment of the plaintiff’s c ase. 

75     The same observations however c annot apply to OTG, who was c onsiderably more artic ulate than the plaintiff and who was noted by the c ourt to be prevaric ating at one stage (at N/E 218) when he was questioned on the benefit to the defendant of having been paid $250,000 by the plaintiff. OTG’s testimony was at times inc onsistent with the defendant’s pleaded c ase and at other times he c ontradic ted himself. When it served his purpose to do so, he told the plaintiff at the meeting that he did not represent the defendant. In c ourt however (see [53] above) bec ause it served his purpose to say so (in order to support the defendant’s c ase that an oral c ontrac t was c onc luded on 12 Oc tober 2006), he stated the opposite. 

76     What was equally c lear from the emails that he exc hanged with the plaintiff was that OTG c onstantly shifted the goalpost in his negotiations with the plaintiff. That was unfair to the plaintiff whose sole purpose in wanting to buy over the defendant’s shares was to try and make a suc c ess of the Company and his invention as well. 

77     At this junc ture, it would be appropriate to touc h briefly on Ong’s testimony before I go to my findings. Ong c ame ac ross as a truthful and objec tive witness. It spoke well of him as a friend and as a person, that although Ong c ould have insisted on stric t c omplianc e with the terms of Ekong’s offer letter, yet when the plaintiff approac hed him in November 2006 to reduc e the agreed sale pric e of $150,000 (bec ause the plaintiff had diffic ulty raising suffic ient moneys to c omplete his purc hase of Ekong’s shares), Ong agreed and reduc ed the pric e by 50% to $75,000. 

**The issue** 

78     The only issue for the c ourt’s determination is, was an oral c ontrac t c onc luded on 12 Oc tober 2006 for the sale of the defendant’s shares as the defendant c ontended or, was it c onc luded on 2 November 2006 or at the latest 10 November 2006 as the plaintiff maintained? 

**The decision** 

79     I am satisfied on the evidenc e, that the plaintiff’s version of what happened at the meeting is c orrec t, as c orroborated by Ong. There was only an agreement in princ iple reac hed on 12 Oc tober 2006 that the plaintiff would buy the defendant’s shares. It was at best an invitation to treat as the 

plaintiff submitted (see _Chitty on Contracts_ 29 th Ed 2004 Sweet & Maxwell Vol 1 p 25-126). OTG, who was the defendant’s nominee on the Company’s board did not c omplete the defendant’s offer letter, sign and return it to the plaintiff to indic ate ac c eptanc e of the plaintiff’s offer bec ause he thought (rightly or wrongly) that he was not in a position to do so. The defendant’s argument that it should be treated no differently from Ekong was misc onc eived. Ekong had no outstanding issues to be 


resolved and that was why Ong and the plaintiff c onc luded their agreement there and then. 

80     I ac c ept the plaintiff’s explanation that unless and until he was c ertain that the defendant would ac c ept his offer to buy out the defendant’s shares, it served no purpose to disc uss the terms of the sale and purc hase further. I further ac c ept the plaintiff’s rationale (and Quek’s) that unless there was a global settlement with the defendant on the twin issues of the inventory and the Company’s debts, it made no c ommerc ial sense for the plaintiff to buy the defendant’s shares either and inc ur a personal liability thereby. The keyboard was far from being a c ommerc ial suc c ess judging by its quality problems and the plaintiff was hard put to c ome up with the funds (eventually $375,000) to pay for the shares of the defendant and Ekong. It was vital therefore as Quek testified, that the Company was taken bac k by the plaintiff with a c lean slate. 

81     As the terms and c onditions of sale were not even disc ussed, no oral c ontrac t was c onc luded on 12 Oc tober 2006 to sell the defendant’s shares to the plaintiff. This is fundamental c ontrac t princ iples. I c an do no worse than refer to a passage from _Cheshire, Fifoot & Furmston’s Law of Contract_ – _Second Singapore and Malaysian Edition 1998_ at p 76 c ited by the defendant that says: 

 An offer, c apable of being c onverted into an agreement by ac c eptanc e, must c onsist of a definite promise to be bound provided that certain specified terms are accepted ...(emphasis added). 

82     I move next to c onsider the plaintiff’s c ase – was there the November agreement? Here again, one must c onsider the fac tual matrix. I ac c ept the defendant’s submission that the plaintiff’s email of 2 November 2006 in [26] did not c onfirm he had reac hed an agreement with OTG a day earlier. The plaintiff merely reiterated his previous day’s offer. It was the plaintiff’s own evidenc e (at para 105 of his AEIC) that in their telephone c onversation, OTG did not agree to release the inventory but only to forgive the Company’s debts (see [25] above). 

83     OTG’s reply at [27] stated very c learly that in exc hange for payment of $300,000, the inventory would be released. This was repeated in OTG’s follow-up email on 10 November 2006 at [28]. The ambiguity that arose was, did the defendant mean the plaintiff would get the defendant’s shares as well as the inventory if he paid the purc hase pric e? Or did it mean (ac c ording to the plaintiff’s version) that having _already agreed_ with the plaintiff on 1 November 2006 to sell the defendant’s shares and write-off the Company’s debts in exc hange for payment of the purc hase pric e, OTG had agreed to the plaintiff’s sec ond c ondition to release the inventory? 

84     The position was not made any c learer by OTG’s c ontention in c ourt at [34] that his offer of the inventory was made gratuitously on c ondition that the defendant rec eived the full payment of $300,000 from the plaintiff. However, I note in this regard that the plaintiff was never told it was a gratuitous offer let alone that it required him to pay the purc hase pric e in full, not even when he appeared at the defendant’s offic e and handed OTG a c ashier’s order for $250,000 on 20 Dec ember 2006 (see [38]). It would have been reasonable to expec t OTG to have rejec ted the part-payment there and then (as well as the plaintiff’s request to pay the balanc e of $50,000 on 31 Marc h 2007 as evidenc ed in the personal undertaking) but he did not. I had earlier alluded to the fac t at [54] and [57] that in c ourt, OTG and Kea abandoned the issue of the gratuitous offer and c onfirmed that the defendant would deliver the defendant’s shares and release the inventory onc e the plaintiff paid the balanc e $50,000 still outstanding. 

85     The next event that took plac e was OTG’s _volte face_ on 25 January 2007 at [43] when he adopted what he desc ribed in c ourt as the “new position” (at N/E 195) viz that the defendant’s agreement was only to release the inventory in exc hange for the plaintiff’s payment of the purc hase pric e. 


86     The defendant’s c hange of heart was reprehensible to say the least. I agree with the plaintiff’s submission that had he known that OTG would c hange his mind and that the plaintiff’s payment of $300,000 would not (as he thought) sec ure him: (a) the defendant’s shares; (b) the release of the inventory and (c ) the write-off of the Company’s debts, the plaintiff would not have paid $250,000 on 20 Dec ember 2006 and be willing to pay the balanc e of $50,000 on 9 January 2007. 

87     To rec apitulate, the plaintiff thought he had sec ured agreement from OTG on 1 November 2006 to the extinguishment of the Company’s debts and transfer of the defendant’s shares. The plaintiff also wanted release of the inventory whic h OTG did not agree to on 1 November 2006. However, on 2 and 10 November 2006, OTG’s email reply (at [27] and [28]) to the plaintiff’s email of 2 November 2006 (at [26]) suggested the defendant was also agreeable to this sec ond request. In the c ontext of the parties’ negotiations, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff to believe (whic h he did) that his payment of the purc hase pric e had sec ured him all three items he wanted _viz_ ownership of the defendant’s shares, release of the inventory and a write-off of the Company’s debts. Henc e, he was prompted to and did pay $250,000 to the defendant by a c ashier’s order (as requested by OTG) on 20 Dec ember 2006 and he would have paid the balanc e of $50,000 on 9 January 2007 by another c ashier’s order had the defendant/OTG responded to his email message to release the inventory (see [41] above). 

88     The defendant’s pleadings (at para 18 of the defenc e) c ontended that there was no fresh c onsideration in any c ase for the plaintiff’s request to vary the oral c ontrac t by releasing the inventory and the writing off of the debts. As c ounsel for the plaintiff rightly pointed out, that statement represents the old English law that performanc e of an existing c ontrac tual obligation by the promisee is not valid c onsideration for a new promise (see _Stilk v Myrick_ (1809) 2 Camp 317). 

89     However, the modern law on c onsideration has evolved and moved away from that old position. The modern approac h (albeit muc h c ritic ised by ac ademic s) is enc apsulated in the judgment of LJ Glidewell in _Williams v Roffey Bros Ltd_ [1990] 2 WLR 1153 (“ _Williams’_ c ase”) who, after reviewing _Pao On v Lau Yiu Long_ [1980] AC 614) said (at p 1165): 

 ...the present state of the law on this subjec t c an be expressed in the following proposition: (i) if A has entered into a c ontrac t with B to do work for, or to supply goods or servic es to, B in return for payment by B, and (ii) at some stage before A has c ompletely performed his obligations under the c ontrac t B has reason to doubt whether A will, or will be able to, c omplete his side of the bargain; and (iii) B thereupon promises A an additional payment in return for A’s promise to perform his c ontrac tual obligations on time and (iv) as a result of giving his promise, B obtains in prac tic e a benefit, or obviates a disbenefit; and (v) B’s promise is not given as a result of ec onomic duress or fraud on the part of A, then (vi) the benefit to B is c apable of being c onsideration for B’s promise, so that the promise will be legally binding. 

90     Our appellate c ourt in _Sea-Land Service Inc v Cheong Fook Chee Vincent_ <span class="citation">[1994] 3 SLR 631</span> had distinguished _Williams’_ c ase (at 634-635) as a limited exc eption to the English rule (that performanc e of existing obligations does not amount to valid c onsideration). For the exc eption to apply, the promisor must have obtained a fac tual or a prac tic al benefit from the promisee’s performanc e of his existing c ontrac tual obligations. 

91     Did the defendant obtain a benefit for the limited exc eption in _Williams’_ c ase to apply? The answer is yes. The defendant had the use of the plaintiff’s $250,000 payment sinc e 20 Dec ember 

2006\. Indeed, after being pressed by the plaintiff’s c ounsel as well as the c ourt for his answer (at N/E 217) on whether the defendant had had the benefit of the plaintiff’s moneys, OTG finally admitted that the defendant used the plaintiff’s $250,000 as part of its c ash flow. 


92     I should add that the modern approac h in c ontrac t law requires very little to find the existenc e of c onsideration (per V K Rajah JC in _Chwee Kin Keong & Others v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2004] 2 SLR 594</span> at [139]). 

93     I therefore dec lare that on 20 Dec ember 2006, there was a c onc luded c ontrac t wherein the defendant agreed to transfer the defendant’s shares to the plaintiff, release to him the Company’s inventory and extinguish the Company’s debts in exc hange for the plaintiff’s payment of $300,000. 

**Conclusion** 

94     Consequently, there will be an order in terms of paras 20(b) and (d) of the plaintiff’s (amended) statement of c laim. The defendant is required to deliver up to the plaintiff: (a) a duly exec uted share transfer form; (b) the relevant share c ertific ate(s) relating to the defendant’s shares and (c ) a board resolution approving the transfer of its shares to the plaintiff or to the plaintiff’s nominee. In addition, the defendant shall release to the plaintiff the Company’s inventory and write-off the Company’s debts in the books of the defendant. 

95     In exc hange thereof, the plaintiff shall deliver a c ashier’s order for $50,000 to the defendant. The c ounterc laim is dismissed. The plaintiff shall have his c osts on both the c laim and the c ounterc laim.
