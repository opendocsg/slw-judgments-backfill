## JUDGMENT 

## GROUNDS OF DECISION 

1\. In this case, the first plaintiff, Fraser and Neave Limited (hereinafter referred to as "F & N"), the second plaintiff, Mr Michael Fam Yue Onn, the third plaintiff, Mr Tan Yam Pin, and the fourth plaintiff, Mr Ian Alastair Maclean, alleged that they w ere defamed by the defendants, Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Ltd (hereinafter referred to as "Aberdeen") and Mr Hugh Young. As the allegedly defamatory remarks w ere contained in a letter to the _Business Times_ on 24 August 2000, the plaintiffs, relying on O 14 r 12(1) of the Rules of Court, applied for a determination of the meaning of the w ords used in the letter. Aberdeen and Mr Young, w ho w ere dissatisfied w ith the Assistant Registrar’s construction of the w ords in question, appealed to the High Court. I varied the ruling of Assistant Registrar. As Aberdeen and Mr Young have appealed against my decision, I set out below the reasons for my decision. 

 A. THE LETTER TO THE BUSINESS TIMES 

2\. The letter, w hich appeared in the _Business Times_ on 24 August 2000 (hereinafter referred to as "the letter"), w as re-published in the _Business Times_ w ebsite. It is set out below , w ith the allegedly offending w ords in italics. 

**"** **_CMB Asia minorities were kept in the dark_** 

Hot on the heels of Times Publishing, w e have another case of minority shareholders being kept in the dark and not having sufficient time to consider an offer for a company. Again, the company in question, CMB Asia, is part of the restructuring of the Fraser and Neave group. 

## Crown Cork of the US (already 41 per cent shareholder of CMB Asia) made a 

## general offer for CMB Asia on July 22 at S$3.23, to which the other major 

## shareholder, Fraser and Neave, with 34 per cent, readily assented. This price is 

## at a discount to a heavily written-down book value and not much above the 

## company’s holding of cash in the bank. 

## The offer document was posted out on Aug 14 and the offer declared un

## conditional one day later – a fait accompli. 

## The independent advice to shareholders has yet to emerge, but institutional 

## shareholders have been given a deadline of Aug 25 by their custodians to reply 


### to the offer which expires on Sept 5. This gives little time for independent 

### directors of CMB Asia to consider the offer, and to communicate with the 

### minority shareholders, and even less time to have an open debate. 

### Once again, as in the case of Times Publishing (where the independent advice 

### stating the deal to be undervaluing the company came too late), minority 

### shareholders risk falling victim to an "inside job". 

### This is a poor advertisement for transparency, duty of boards to act equally 

### on behalf of all shareholders, and protection of the rights of minority 

### shareholders. 

### Hugh Young" 

#### B. THE ASSISTANT REGISTRAR’S DECISION 

3\. F & N and the other three plaintiffs applied in SIC 1319 of 2000P to have the natural and ordinary meaning of the allegedly defamatory w ords in the letter determined under O 14 r 12(1) of the Rules of Court. They pleaded that the allegedly defamatory w ords, in their natural and ordinary meaning, meant and w ere understood to mean that they had: 

 acted improperly and/or dishonestly by conspiring w ith Crow n Cork & Seal ("CCS") and CMB Asia Ltd in relation to the takeover of CMB Asia Ltd by CCS, to force on the minority shareholders an inadequate price for their shares by: 

(a) suppressing material information in respect of the said takeover; and 

(b) giving the minority shareholders insufficient time to consider the offer. 

4\. At the hearing of the SIC on 12 January 2001, the Assistant Registrar agreed substantially w ith the meaning pleaded by F & N and the other plaintiffs. How ever, she disagreed that the w ords "and/or dishonestly" should be included in her determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of the w ords. Apart from this, she ruled that the offending letter also suggested that the plaintiffs readily assented to the sale of shares to CCS at a heavily w ritten-dow n book value. Her ruling w as thus as follow s: 

### The Words, in their natural and ordinary meaning, meant and were understood to 

### mean that [F & N, Mr Fam, Mr Tan and Mr Maclean] acted improperly by 

### conspiring with Crown Cork & Seal ("CCS") and CMB Asia Ltd in relation to the 

### takeover of CMB Asia Ltd by CCS, to force on the minority shareholders an 

### inadequate price for their shares by: 

### (a) suppressing material information in respect of the said 

### takeover; and/or 

### (b) giving the minority shareholders insufficient time to 

### consider the offer; and/or 

### (c) readily assenting in the sale of its shares to CCS at a 

### heavily written down book value. 


#### C. THE APPEAL 

5\. As has been mentioned, Aberdeen and Mr Young appealed against the ruling of the Assistant Registrar. 

_O 14 r 12(1) of the Rules of Court_ 

6\. The right of a party to apply to the court for a determination of a question of law or the construction of a document is governed by O 14 r 12(1) of the Rules of Court, w hich provides as follow s: 

### (1) The Court may, upon the application of a party or of its 

### own motion, determine any question of law or construction 

### of any document arising in any cause or matter at any 

### stage of the proceedings where it appears to the Court that 

### – 

### (a) such question is suitable for 

### determination without a full trial of the 

### action; and 

### (b) such determination will fully 

### determine (subject only to any possible 

### appeal) the entire cause or matter or 

### any claim or issue therein. 

7\. As for w hether a plaintiff in a defamation case may rely on O 14 r 12(1) to have the ordinary meaning of w ords in an allegedly defamatory document construed, the position is not in doubt. In _Microsoft Corporation & Ors v SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor_ <span class="citation">[1999] 4 SLR 529</span>, 554-555 w hich concerned an allegation of defamation arising from a press statement, LP Thean JA, w ho delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said as follow s: 

 As for the argument that the meaning of the w ords complained of is not ‘suitable for determination’ w ithout a full trial of the action because such determination requires the hearing of evidence, w e find that such an argument is completely misplaced.... There are obvious advantages in determining the issue of the meaning before trial, as the learned judge held at para 27.8 of his grounds of judgment: 

 It w as plain in all the circumstances that a preliminary determination as to the meaning of the w ords complained [of] if made w ould allow the defendants not only to focus on w hether there w as a triable issue as to their defence of justification of the meaning as determined but further that if there w as such a triable issue and leave w as granted to defend the action the defendants w ould also be focused on their particular defence at the subsequent trial. 

In our judgment, in this case, the natural and ordinary meaning of the alleged defamatory w ords is a question w hich is suitable for determination under O 14 r 12(1). 

8\. Mr Imran Khw aja, the counsel for Aberdeen and Mr Young, contended that the present factual matrix 


made the application for a construction of the allegedly defamatory w ords in the letter before the trial inappropriate. He also submitted that if the letter is construed, it w ill be found that it is not defamatory of the plaintiffs. 

9\. At the outset, it ought to be noted that Mr Fam, Mr Tan and Mr Maclean, unlike F & N, w ere not specifically referred to in the letter. I thus ruled that w hether or not there is a sufficient nexus betw een Mr Fam, Mr Tan and Mr Maclean and the allegedly defamatory w ords in the letter is a question w hich should be determined at the trial. This is because extrinsic evidence w ould be required to show w hy they w ere also defamed in the letter and it is clear from the decision of the Court of Appeal in _Microsoft Corporation & Ors v SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor_ <span class="citation">[1999] 4 SLR 529</span>, 555 that such evidence is not admissible in an application under O 14 r 12(1). How ever, in the case of F & N, I saw no reason w hy there could not be a determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of the allegedly defamatory w ords in the letter. 

_Principles for construing allegedly defamatory words_ 

10\. What is meant by the term "natural and ordinary meaning of w ords" w as explained by Lord Reid in _Rubber Improvement Ltd v Daily Telegraph Ltd_ [1964] AC 234, 258 in the follow ing succinct terms: 

 What the ordinary man w ould infer w ithout special know ledge has generally been called the natural and ordinary meaning of the w ords. But that expression is rather misleading in that it conceals the fact that there are tw o elements in it. Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the w ords themselves, as w here the plaintiff has been called a thief or a murderer. But more often the sting is not so much in the w ords themselves as in w hat the ordinary man w ill infer from them, and that is also regarded as part of their natural and ordinary meaning. 

11\. The above passage w as endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _Microsoft Corporation & Ors v SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor_ <span class="citation">[1999] 4 SLR 529</span>, 556. 

12\. The principles for determining the natural and ordinary meaning of w ords are w ell know n. In _Microsoft Corporation & Ors v SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor_ , LP Thean JA summed up the position at p 555 as follow s: 

### The court decides what meaning the words would have conveyed to an ordinary, 

### reasonable person using his general knowledge and common sense: Jeyaretnam 

### Joshua Benjamin v Goh Chok Tong [1984-1985] SLR 516; .... The test is an 

### objective one: it is the natural and ordinary meaning as understood by an 

### ordinary, reasonable person, not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal. The 

### meaning intended by the maker of the defamatory statement is irrelevant. 

### Similarly, the sense in which the words were actually understood by the party 

### alleged to have been defamed is also irrelevant. Nor is extrinsic evidence 

### admissible in construing the words. The meaning must be gathered from the 

### words themselves and in the context of the entire passage in which they are set 

### out. The court is not confined to the literal or strict meaning of the words, but 

### takes into account what the ordinary, reasonable person may reasonably infer 

### from the words. The ordinary, reasonable person reads between the lines. 

_Whether the letter defamed F & N_ 

13\. At the outset, it ought to be reiterated that in an action for defamation, the plaintiff must establish 

that the offending w ords are defamatory of him. In _Gatley on Libel and Slander,_ 9 th ed _,_ the position is stated 


at p 161 as follow s: 

 To succeed in an action for defamation the plaintiff must not only prove that the defendant published the w ords and that they are defamatory: he must also identify himself as the person defamed.... 

 .... The question in all cases is w hether the w ords might be understood by reasonable people to refer to the plaintiff, subject to the qualification that w here the w ords are published to persons w ho have special know ledge the issue w ill be decided by reference to w hat reasonable persons possessing that know ledge w ould understand by them. 

14\. Mr Khw aja submitted that F & N had no cause of action against his clients because the letter did not put them in a bad light. He explained in para 6 of his w ritten submissions as follow s: 

The thrust of the article is in respect of good corporate governance and specifically the duties ow ed by the board of CMB Asia tow ards its minority shareholders. The only reference to the 1st Plaintiffs is of a purely factual nature: that CMB Asia is part of the restructuring of the F & N Group and that the 1st Plaintiffs agreed to sell their shares to CCS at the offered price. W ith regard to the latter, all the readers of the letter w ould know that and that the 1st Plaintiffs ow ed no duty to the shareholders of CMB Asia. Moreover, the 1st Plaintiffs w ere free to sell their shares in CMB Asia to w homsoever, w henever and w hatever price they chose. Consequently there cannot be nor w as there any defamatory imputation against the 1st Plaintiffs. 

15\. A perusal of the opening tw o sentences of the letter w ill show that the scope of the letter is w ider than that suggested by Mr Khw aja. The sentences are as follow s: 

 Hot on the heels 

## of Times Publishing, we have another case of minority shareholders being 

## kept in the dark and not having sufficient time to consider an offer for a 

## company. Again , the company in question, CMB Asia, is part of the 

## restructuring of the Fraser and Neave group. 

16\. Even if the thrust of the letter concerned good governance, there is clearly an insinuation that F & N is involved in keeping minority shareholders in the dark. It must not be overlooked that the CMB is first referred to in the letter as a part of the F & N group. "Kept in the dark" has negative connotations and suggests that minority shareholders have deliberately been denied information to w hich they are entitled w ith respect to the proposed takeover. The term "again" w as obviously a carefully chosen w ord. Coming after the use of the w ords "hot on the heels" and "another case", the reader must think that there is a connection betw een the restructuring of the F & N group and the keeping of minority shareholders in the tw o restructured companies in the dark. 

17\. The insinuation that F & N did something w rong continues in the follow ing paragraph. It states that "Fraser and Neave, w ith 34 per cent, _readily assented_ " to a price w hich w as at a " _heavily written-down book value_ and _not much above the company’s holding of cash in the bank_ ". Read w ith the rest of the letter, the impression given is that F & N w as so keen to have the deal done that it w as w illing to accept an inadequate price for its shares and at the expense of not giving minority shareholders enough time to consider the offer or sufficient information to make an informed choice. 

18\. The follow ing sentence from the letter rings the death knell for the assertion that the letter does not have any reference to F & N: 


### Once again , as in the case of Times Publishing ... minority shareholders risk falling 

### victim to an " inside job ". 

19\. In the above sentence, the reader is reminded once again of the Times Publishing case, w hich also involved F & N. An allegation w as made that in both cases, minority shareholders risked falling "victim" to an "inside job". The terms "victim" and "inside job" have negative connotations. The term "inside job" refers to a crime or w rongdoing against anyone by an affiliated person or someone w orking for or trusted by the victim. As F & N w as involved in both cases and there w as an inside job in the tw o cases, the reader w ould think that F & N is party to the "inside job", and especially so since they "readily" assented to selling their shares at a very low price. The w ord "victim" certainly suggests that the minority shareholders have been w ronged by F & N as w ell. 

20\. In view of the aforesaid, I had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that F & N had reason to feel aggrieved by the letter and that there w as a case for determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the w ords in the letter. 

_My construction of the letter_ 

21\. I accepted that there w as an insinuation in the letter that F & N acted improperly by agreeing w ith CCS and CMB to ensure that minority shareholders had no real alternative but to accept an inadequate price for their shares by ensuring that they w ere not given material information in respect of the takeover and that they w ere not given enough time to consider the offer. In that sense, they w ere "forced" to accept the offer. How ever, I w as not satisfied that an ordinary reader of the _Business Times_ w ould, w ithout more, have assumed that there w as a "conspiracy". I also found it unnecessary to add the w ords "readily assenting in the sale of its shares to CCS at a heavily w ritten dow n book value" to the natural and ordinary meaning of the w ords, as proposed by F & N. Finally, I modified the w ords "suppressing material information w ith respect to the takeover" in the Assistant Registrar’s ruling. In view of the aforesaid, I ruled that the allegedly defamatory w ords in the letter w ere meant and w ere understood to mean that: 

### [F & N] acted improperly by agreeing with Crown Cork & Seal ("CCS") and CMB 

### Asia Ltd in relation to the takeover of CMB Asia Ltd by CCS, to force the minority 

### shareholders to accept an inadequate price for their shares by: 

### (a) ensuring that material information was not provided to 

### the minority shareholders in respect of the said take over; 

### and/or 

### (b) ensuring that there was insufficient time for the minority 

### shareholders to consider the offer.
