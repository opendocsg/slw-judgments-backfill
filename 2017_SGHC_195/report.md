**Introduction** 

1       This is the first c ase in Singapore in whic h an investorState arbitral award on the merits is sought to be set aside. It engages intriguing questions of arbitral and international investment law whic h have yet to be c onsidered by a Singapore c ourt. 

2       The Kingdom of Lesotho (“the Kingdom”) is a member of the Southern Afric an Development Community (“the SADC”), an inter-governmental soc io-ec onomic organisation c omprising 15 Southern Afric an States. The SADC was established by the Treaty of the Southern Afric an Development Community (17 August 1992) 32 ILM 116 (entered into forc e 30 September 1993) (“the SADC Treaty”) on 17 August 1992. The SADC Treaty also established a tribunal (“the SADC Tribunal”) to ensure adherenc e to and to interpret the Treaty, with the jurisdic tion to adjudic ate disputes and issue advisory opinions. One of the SADC’s objec tives is to promote the ec onomic growth of the region, to whic h end the SADC signed a Protoc ol on Financ e and Investment (“the Investment Protoc ol”) on 18 August 2006 (entered into forc e 16 April 2010). Importantly, amongst the various protec tions that the Investment Protoc ol c onferred on investors was the option of referring c ertain investorState disputes to international arbitration, under Annex 1 to the Investment Protoc ol 


 Heading Pincites 

 Bac kground to the dispute [7]–[52] 

(“Annex 1”). Various fora were provided therein, one of whic h was the SADC Tribunal. This c omplemented the existing proc edural protec tion of referring disputes to the SADC Tribunal under the provisions of the SADC Treaty. 

3       The defendants in this applic ation c laimed that their investments, namely leases to mine c ertain territories in the Kingdom, were unlawfully expropriated by the Kingdom between 1991 and 1995. Having unsuc c essfully pursued ac tions in the Kingdom’s domestic c ourts, the defendants c ommenc ed proc eedings in the SADC Tribunal in 2009, alleging that the Kingdom had breac hed its obligations under the SADC Treaty by wrongfully expropriating the mining leases. Unfortunately for the defendants, the SADC Tribunal was dissolved by resolution of the SADC Summit before it had an opportunity to determine the defendants’ c laim. Undeterred, the defendants then c ommenc ed international arbitration proc eedings against the Kingdom in 2012 pursuant to Annex 1, on the basis that the Kingdom, by c ontributing to or fac ilitating the shutting down (or “shuttering”, the term adopted in the arbitration and by the parties) of the SADC Tribunal without providing alternative means by whic h the defendants’ expropriation c laim might be heard, again breac hed its obligations under the SADC Treaty. This arbitration was administered by an _ad hoc_ tribunal c onstituted under the auspic es of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (“the PCA Tribunal” and “the PCA” respec tively), and the PCA Tribunal elec ted Singapore as the seat of arbitration. The PCA Tribunal rendered two awards in the defendants’ favour: a partial final award on jurisdic tion and merits on 18 April 2016 (“the Award”) and a final award on c osts on 20 Oc tober 2016 (“the Costs Award”). The Award determined that the Kingdom had breac hed various obligations under the SADC Treaty and granted relief by direc ting the parties to c onstitute a new tribunal to hear the defendants’ expropriation c laim. It also determined that the Kingdom was liable to pay the defendants’ c osts in the arbitration, for whic h the quantum was subsequently fixed by the Costs Award. 

4       By Originating Summons No 492 of 2016 (“OS 492”), the Kingdom applies for the c ourt to set aside the Award in its entirety, on the basis that the PCA Tribunal lac ked jurisdic tion and/or that the Award exc eeded the terms or sc ope of the submission to arbitration. In the alternative, it applies for that part of the Award c onc erning the Kingdom’s liability to pay the defendants’ c osts of the arbitration to be set aside for breac h of the rules of natural justic e, and/or for the Kingdom having been unable to present its c ase, and/or on the basis that that part of the Award exc eeded the terms or sc ope of the submission to arbitration. 

5       Having c arefully reviewed the Award, the parties’ submissions and other relevant material, I have c ome to the view that the PCA Tribunal did not have jurisdic tion over the parties’ dispute and I set aside the Award in entirety. In the premises, I do not need to address the Kingdom’s alternative argument that the portion of the Award dealing with the Kingdom’s liability to pay the defendants’ c osts of the arbitration should be set aside for, _inter alia_ , breac h of the rules of natural justic e. It follows, as a matter of logic , that the Costs Award must also fall away bec ause it was made pursuant to the determination in the Award that the Kingdom was liable to pay the defendants’ c osts of the arbitration and reasonable legal c osts (Award at [11.1(g)] and Costs Award at [1.2]–[1.4]). The Costs Award is therefore without basis. However, there are two residual but important issues: (a) the c ourt’s jurisdic tion to make an order as to the c osts of the arbitral proc eedings; and (b) the appropriate c osts order I should make as regards those proc eedings. I c onsider these issues towards the end of this judgment. 

6       As this is a judgment of some length, I set out a brief roadmap of its c ontents:

**Background to the dispute** 

**_The defendants_** 

7       The first defendant, Swissbourgh Diamond Mines (Pty) Limited (“Swissbourgh”), is a c ompany registered under the laws of the Kingdom and was inc orporated by the sec ond defendant, Mr Josias Van Zyl (“Mr Van Zyl”), a national of the Republic of South Afric a (“South Afric a”), on 12 November 

1986\. The third and fourth defendants are the representatives of the Burmilla Trust and the Josias Van Zyl Family Trust (“the JVZF Trust”) respec tively. Both trusts were established under the laws of South Afric a. 

8       When Swissbourgh was first inc orporated, 5% of its shares were held by Mr Van Zyl, 85% were held by a nominee of Mr Van Zyl and the remaining 10% were halved between two other persons. In Marc h 1989, all the shareholders other than Mr Van Zyl divested their shareholding to the JVZF Trust, whic h thus ac quired 95% of the shares in Swissbourgh. In June 1997, the JVZF Trust transferred 90% of the shares in Swissbourgh to the Burmilla Trust. The ownership of Swissbourgh has remained unc hanged to date and is divided between Mr Van Zyl (5%), the JVZF Trust (5%) and the Burmilla Trust (90%). 

**_The Mining Leases and the Tributing Agreements_** 

9       By 1987, Swissbourgh had submitted applic ations first for prospec ting leases and then for five mining leases in five regions of the Kingdom, namely the Matsoku, Motete, Rampai, Orange, and Patiseng/Khubelu regions (“the Mining Leases”). 

10     In brief, the review of suc h applic ations involved the following stages. First, negotiations between the applic ant and a c ommittee of senior government offic ials who would advise the Ministry for Water, Energy and Mining. Sec ondly, approval by the Ministry for Water, Energy and Mining. Thirdly, approval by the Kingdom’s Mining Board. Fourthly, rec ommendation by the Kingdom’s Mining Board to the Kingdom’s Military Counc il following c onsultations with the loc al c hiefs responsible for the 


land whic h was the subjec t of the applic ations. Fifthly, approval by the Kingdom’s Military Counc il. Finally, approval by the King of Lesotho. 

11     In June 1988, at the c onc lusion of the above-mentioned proc ess, the King of Lesotho granted Swissbourgh’s applic ations for the Mining Leases. On 26 Oc tober 1988, the Kingdom’s Registrar of Deeds in Maseru registered the Mining Leases. However, the Kingdom subsequently c laimed to disc over, after the Mining Leases had been registered, that there was no evidenc e that the loc al c hiefs in the Rampai area had been c onsulted or had agreed to the grant of a lease. This sparked the issues between the parties. 

12     The fifth to ninth defendants – Matsoku Diamonds (Pty) Limited, Motete Diamonds (Pty) Limited, Orange Diamonds (Pty) Limited, Patiseng Diamonds (Pty) Limited and Rampai Diamonds (Pty) Limited (c ollec tively “the Tributees”) – were inc orporated in 1988 under the laws of the Kingdom, apparently by Swissbourgh and/or Mr Van Zyl, and named after the regions in whic h they were to c arry out diamond mining operations. Between 15 Dec ember 1989 and 10 January 1990, the Tributees sub-leased the Mining Leases from Swissbourgh under agreements whic h I refer to hereinafter as “the Tributing Agreements”. Under the Tributing Agreements, the Tributees would hold and exerc ise the mining rights under the relevant Mining Leases. The Tributing Agreements were registered at the Maseru Deeds Registry during the same period. 

13     In September 1994, ownership of the Tributees was transferred to the Burmilla Trust (whic h ac quired 99% of the shares) and the JVZF Trust (whic h ac quired the remaining 1%). 

14     On 16 September 1994, Swissbourgh and the Tributees signed an “Agreement of Sale and Cession of Claims”, by whic h they agreed to assign to the Burmilla Trust their rights relating to any c laims against the Kingdom due to its purported interferenc e with the Mining Leases. From 1994 to 1997, Swissbourgh and the Tributees assigned their c laims against the Kingdom to the Burmilla Trust. 

**_The alleged expropriation of the Mining Leases and court proceedings_** 

15     The alleged expropriation of the Mining Leases has a c onvoluted history. The five mining areas were of interest not only to the defendants but also to the Kingdom. In 1986, shortly before Swissbourgh applied for the Mining Leases, the Kingdom and South Afric a had entered into a largesc ale c ommerc ial joint venture – the Lesotho Highlands Water Projec t (“LHWP”). The objec tive of the LHWP was to c ontrol the flow of the OrangeSenqu River, whic h rises in the Kingdom and flows through South Afric a and Botswana into Namibia, and to divert water from the river to South Afric a. The Kingdom benefitted from the LHWP by rec eiving a royalty for water transferred under the LHWP, whic h ac c ounted for a c onsiderable part of the Kingdom’s annual budget, and by deriving elec tric ity from its hydropower stations, whic h satisfied a signific ant portion of the Kingdom’s energy needs. 

16     The Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (“LHDA”) was c reated in 1986 to implement, operate and maintain the LHWP. By 1989, the LHDA had c ommenc ed c onstruc tion works in the Rampai area, whic h was the subjec t of one of the Mining Leases. 

17     In April 1991, General Justin Lekhanya, the then Chairman of the Military Counc il, the governing body of the Kingdom at the time, was ousted. Colonel Elias P Ramaema bec ame the c ountry’s new leader. 

18 July 1991 saw the defendants’ dispute with the Kingdom spark into life. On 18 July 1991, Swissbourgh and Rampai Diamonds (Pty) Limited, _ie_ , the first and ninth defendants, obtained an _ex parte_ interim injunc tion from the High Court of Lesotho ordering that the LHDA be “interdic ted ... from 


performing any works and/or from destroying, using up, disturbing, mixing up and/or c overing up any gravel deposits or other minerals” in the Rampai lease area. On 25 July 1991, the LHDA filed a c ounter-applic ation to have the interim injunc tion set aside. On 29 July 1991, the parties agreed that the order be set aside but no settlement agreement was exec uted. 

19     Between end July or early August and end August 1991, the Kingdom’s Commissioner of Mines issued written notic es to Swissbourgh alleging that it had breac hed its obligations under all five Mining Leases. The notic es threatened to c anc el the Mining Leases if the breac hes were not remedied within 60 days. Between 10 Oc tober and 4 November 1991, the Commissioner of Mines purported to c anc el all five Mining Leases, although it subsequently bec ame apparent that he was not entitled to do so bec ause the Mining Leases provided for the resolution of suc h disputes by arbitration. The Commissioner of Mines ordered the defendants to remove their property from the lease areas within 90 days, and instruc ted loc al polic e to prevent the defendants from c ontinuing operations and to oversee the removal of their property from the lease areas. 

20     On 28 Oc tober 1991, Swissbourgh requested that the dispute over the purported c anc ellation of its Mining Leases by the Commissioner of Mines be referred to _ad hoc_ arbitration. 

21     On 18 November 1991, the Kingdom granted the LHDA a lease over parts of the territory subjec t to the Mining Leases for the purposes of water storage and elec tric ity generation. 

22     On 19 November 1991, Swissbourgh and the Tributees instituted judic ial review proc eedings in the High Court of Lesotho against the Commissioner of Mines (“the 1991 JR Proc eedings”) for annulment of the purported c anc ellations of the Mining Leases and interim relief pending the outc ome of the arbitral proc eedings. The High Court granted the applic ation for interim relief the next day and permitted the Tributees to c ontinue mining in the Matsoku and Patiseng lease areas. The parties subsequently agreed to stay the arbitral proc eedings pending the outc ome of the 1991 JR Proc eedings. 

23     On 20 Marc h 1992, the Kingdom’s Military Counc il passed the Revoc ation of Spec ific Mining Leases Order of 1992 (“the 1992 Revoc ation Order”), whic h revoked the Mining Leases as well as the Tributing Agreements, disc harged all the defendants’ pending c laims before domestic c ourts and arbitral tribunals, required the defendants to vac ate the lease areas and exc luded any right to c ompensation as well as any right for the defendants to seek judic ial or arbitral redress. On 7 April 1992, Swissbourgh and the Tributees c ommenc ed proc eedings in the High Court of Lesotho, seeking the annulment of the 1992 Revoc ation Order and an interim injunc tion restraining the LHDA from interfering with the defendants’ rights under the Mining Leases. Pending these proc eedings, the defendants were unable to enter the lease areas or exerc ise their mining rights. On 27 September 1994, the Chief Justic e of the High Court of Lesotho dec lared the 1992 Revoc ation Order null and void. The Court of Appeal of Lesotho affirmed this dec ision in January 1995. 

24     While the legal c hallenge to the 1992 Revoc ation Order was underway, the defendants terminated all of the Mining Leases (save for the Rampai lease) on 11 Marc h 1993 on the basis that the Kingdom had breac hed and repudiated them. 

25     On 2 Marc h 1995, the LHDA filed a c ounter-applic ation in the 1991 JR Proc eedings, seeking a dec laration that the Rampai lease was void _ab initio_ due to the Kingdom’s purported failure to c onsult the relevant c hiefs before approving the Mining Leases (“the Rampai Lease Proc eedings”). On 27 Marc h 1995, Swissbourgh and the Tributees obtained an order from the High Court rec ording their agreement with the Commissioner of Mines to set aside his purported c anc ellation of the Mining Leases in 1991. 


26     On 16 and 17 August 1995, the Kingdom enac ted two piec es of legislation, the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (Amendment) Ac t (No 5 of 1995) and the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (Validation of Ac tivities in respec t of Phase 1A and Phase 1B Sc heme) Ac t (No 6 of 1995) (“the LHDA Ac ts”). The LHDA Ac ts enabled the Kingdom to expropriate any area that fell within the LHWP, subjec t to c ompensating the holders of valid mining leases in the affec ted areas. Pursuant to the LHDA Ac ts, areas in Rampai subjec t to the Rampai lease were expropriated by Oc tober 1995. In July 1996, the defendants filed a c laim for c ompensation in respec t of the Rampai lease but the LHDA refused to c onsider the c laim until the Rampai Lease Proc eedings were c onc luded. The argument of the LHDA was that until the validity of the Rampai Lease was dec ided, it would be premature to c onsider the issue of c ompensation. 

27     In May 1996, Swissbourgh and the Tributees c ommenc ed proc eedings against the Kingdom in the Lesotho High Court to rec over damages in respec t of four of the Mining Leases (“the 1996 Proc eedings”). The proc eedings did not involve the Rampai lease as its validity was the subjec t of the Rampai Lease Proc eedings. Swissbourgh and the Tributees c laimed that the Kingdom had unlawfully and intentionally deprived Swissbourgh of its rights under the four Mining Leases by purporting to c anc el or revoke the leases and by hindering Swissbourgh from exerc ising its mining rights. 

28     In September 1998, Swissbourgh and Rampai Diamonds (Pty) Limited, _ie_ , the first and ninth defendants, c ommenc ed proc eedings against the LHDA in the Lesotho High Court, seeking damages for the expropriation of the Rampai lease (“the 1998 Proc eedings”). 

29     On 28 April 1999, the Lesotho High Court granted the LHDA’s applic ation in the Rampai Lease Proc eedings and dec ided that the Rampai lease was void _ab initio_. The Court of Appeal of Lesotho dismissed the defendants’ appeal on 6 Oc tober 2000. Sinc e the Rampai lease had been found to be void, the defendants were not eligible for c ompensation in respec t of that lease under the LHDA Ac ts. The defendants did not pursue the 1998 Proc eedings further as a result. The defendants also did not pursue the 1996 Proc eedings, bec ause they suspec ted that the other Mining Leases suffered from the same defec t as the Rampai lease and were likewise void. 

30     Between 2000 and 2007, the defendants requested the Government of South Afric a to exerc ise diplomatic protec tion with regard to their investments in the Kingdom. The Government of South Afric a denied their request. Attempts to review the Government’s dec ision were unsuc c essful in the High Court of South Afric a and the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Afric a. The defendants then c ommenc ed proc eedings against the Kingdom before the SADC Tribunal for expropriation of the Mining Leases. 

**_Proceedings in the SADC Tribunal_** 

31     Some bac kground to the SADC and its organs is nec essary: 

 (a) As stated earlier, the SADC Treaty was signed on 17 August 1992 and entered into forc e on 30 September 1993. The SADC’s supreme polic y-making body is the Summit of Heads of State or Government (“the SADC Summit”), c omprising the heads of State of all SADC Member States. Artic le 9(1)(g) of the SADC Treaty established the SADC Tribunal, although no judges were appointed to the SADC Tribunal until 2005. 

 (b) On 7 August 2000, the Protoc ol on Tribunal in the Southern Afric an Development Community (“the Tribunal Protoc ol”) was signed. The Tribunal Protoc ol c larified the operation of the SADC Tribunal, inc luding its c omposition, powers, func tions, jurisdic tions and proc edures. It entered into forc e on 14 August 2001. 


 (c ) As noted earlier, the Investment Protoc ol (see [2] above), along with 11 Annexes, was signed on 18 August 2006 and entered into forc e on 16 April 2010. 

32     On 12 June 2009, having failed to obtain diplomatic protec tion from South Afric a, the defendants c ommenc ed proc eedings in the SADC Tribunal. They sought damages for the Kingdom’s purported violations of Arts 4(c ) and 6 of the SADC Treaty by its measures in respec t of the Mining Leases. It should be noted that this was a c laim brought under the SADC Treaty and the Tribunal Protoc ol, and not under Annex 1 of the Investment Protoc ol, whic h only c ame into forc e on 16 April 

2010\. I shall refer to the defendants’ c laim before the SADC Tribunal as “the SADC c laim”. 

33     However, the SADC Tribunal was eventually unable to determine the SADC c laim. From 2007 to 2009, the SADC Tribunal made a series of dec isions in a separate dispute between the Republic of Zimbabwe and one of its investors (“the _Campbell v Zimbabwe_ c ase”) whic h were not rec eived favourably by Zimbabwe. In 2010, at Zimbabwe’s bidding, the SADC Summit (inc luding the Kingdom) unanimously adopted the resolution that the terms of offic e of five SADC Tribunal judges, whic h were to expire in Oc tober 2010, would not be renewed, pending a review of the SADC Tribunal’s role and responsibilities. The SADC Summit also dec ided that the SADC Tribunal would not hear any new c ases. The failure to extend the five judges’ terms of offic e left the SADC Tribunal inoperable, sinc e Art 3(1) of the Tribunal Protoc ol required that the SADC Tribunal c onsist of at least 10 judges. This meant that the SADC c laim c ould not proc eed. 

34     On 25 January 2011, the defendants filed another applic ation with the SADC Tribunal in response to its purported suspension, requesting that the SADC Tribunal c ontinue its operations in respec t of the SADC c laim. The applic ation was not allowed. 

35     In May 2011, the SADC Counc il of Ministers (c omprising the ministers for foreign affairs, ec onomic planning, or financ e from eac h SADC Member State) dec ided that the suspension of the SADC Tribunal would c ontinue until August 2011 and that no judges would be re-appointed. The SADC Summit endorsed these dec isions at an extraordinary meeting held around the same period. 

36     By a letter dated 22 August 2011, the defendants sought the Kingdom’s agreement to submit the pending SADC c laim to arbitration by the PCA. The Kingdom dec lined on 5 Oc tober 2011. 

37     In a signific ant development, in August 2012, the SADC Summit resolved to dissolve the SADC Tribunal as it then existed entirely, and to negotiate a new protoc ol limiting the SADC Tribunal’s jurisdic tion to interState disputes. This prevented the SADC Tribunal from determining the c ases pending before it, inc luding the SADC c laim. The defendants were therefore left without a forum for the SADC c laim. Ac knowledging this, the SADC Justic e Committee (c omprising the Ministers of Justic e or AttorneysGeneral of the SADC Member States) advised the SADC Counc il of Ministers and the SADC Summit that the dissolution of the SADC Tribunal left a “legal vac uum”. It advised that the parties in existing c ases before the SADC Tribunal “may elec t to pursue them before other regional or international legal forums as they will be left with no prospec t of them being resolved at the SADC regional level”, and rec ommended that the SADC Counc il of Ministers and the SADC Summit “give guidanc e on the way forward”. 

38     On 18 August 2014, the SADC Summit unanimously adopted a new Protoc ol on the SADC Tribunal that restric ted the Tribunal’s jurisdic tion to interState disputes and abolished jurisdic tion over c ases brought by individuals or legal entities other than States. As a result, the SADC Tribunal was unable to determine the SADC c laim. It appears that the new Protoc ol has not entered into forc e. 


39     Ac c ording to the Kingdom, on 17–18 August 2015, the SADC Summit approved the proposal that “eac h Member State may dec ide on an alternative forum for the resolution of a SADC Tribunal pending c ase of whic h that Member State has been named a respondent”. It appears that no steps have been taken by the Kingdom in this regard with respec t to the SADC c laim. 

**_The PCA Arbitration_** 

_Arbitral proceedings_ 

40     On 20 June 2012, the defendants c ommenc ed arbitral proc eedings against the Kingdom by a Notic e of Arbitration, pursuant to Art 28(1) of Annex 1. Artic le 28 is of c ritic al importanc e in OS 492 and states: 

## ARTICLE 28 

## SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES 

1\. Disputes between an investor and a State Party c onc erning an obligation of the latter in relation to an admitted investment of the former, whic h have not been amic ably settled, and after exhausting loc al remedies shall, after a period of six (6) months from written notific ation of a c laim, be submitted to international arbitration if either party to the dispute so wishes. 

2\. Where the dispute is referred to international arbitration, the investor and the State Party c onc erned in the dispute may agree to refer the dispute either to: 

 (a) The SADC Tribunal; 

 (b) The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (having regard to the provisions, where applic able, of the ICSID Convention and the Additional Fac ility for the Administration of Conc iliation, Arbitration and Fac t-Finding Proc eedings); or 

 (c ) An international arbitrator or ad hoc arbitral tribunal to be appointed by a spec ial agreement or established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. 

3\. If after a period of three (3) months from written notific ation of the c laim there is no agreement to one of the above alternative proc edures, the parties to the dispute shall be bound to submit the dispute to arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law as then in forc e. The parties to the dispute may agree in writing to modify these Rules. 

4\. The provisions of this Artic le shall not apply to a dispute, whic h arose before entry into forc e of this Annex. 

41     The third option under Art 28(2) was c hosen, _ie_ , _ad hoc_ arbitration. The PCA Tribunal c omprised three arbitrators: Mr R Doak Bishop, nominated by the defendants (the c laimants in the arbitration); Mr Justic e Petrus Millar Nienaber, nominated by the Kingdom; and Prof David A R Williams QC as Presiding Arbitrator, c hosen by the designated appointing authority. With the benefit of the parties’ submissions, the PCA Tribunal dec ided on Singapore as both the plac e of arbitration and the hearing 


venue. The arbitral proc eedings were bifurc ated into two phases. The first phase was to deal with all issues of jurisdic tion and liability, inc luding all jurisdic tional objec tions. Subjec t to the findings in the first phase, a sec ond phase would be dedic ated to all issues of remedies. The first phase was heard in Singapore from 24 to 27 August 2015. No sec ond phase was ultimately c onvened. 

42     The defendants’ c ase in the arbitration was that by partic ipating in the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal without providing an alternative means for the SADC c laim to be determined, the Kingdom had breac hed its obligations under Arts 14 and/or 15 of the Tribunal Protoc ol; Arts 6(1) and 27 of Annex 1; and Art 6(1) read with Art 4(c ) of the SADC Treaty. The defendants requested the PCA Tribunal to “step into the shoes” of the SADC Tribunal and award the defendants “suc h relief and c ompensation ... as c ould have been granted by the SADC Tribunal” for the expropriation of the Mining Leases, as well as all c osts inc urred in c onnec tion with the arbitration. 

43     The Kingdom disputed the PCA Tribunal’s jurisdic tion on seven main grounds: 

 (a) The Kingdom submitted that the true dispute was the alleged expropriation of the Mining Leases from 1991 to 1995 (“the expropriation dispute”). It said that the PCA Tribunal had no jurisdic tion sinc e Art 28(4) of Annex 1 c onfined its jurisdic tion to disputes arising after the Investment Protoc ol’s entry into forc e on 16 April 2010. The defendants c ounter-argued that the dispute in this c ase was not the expropriation dispute, but rather the termination without rec ourse of the pending SADC c laim as a result of the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal (“the shuttering dispute”), whic h oc c urred after the entry into forc e of the Investment Protoc ol ( ie , the shuttering dispute was within the PCA Tribunal’s jurisdic tion ratione temporis ). 

 (b) Ac c ording to the Kingdom, it followed from the princ iple of non-retroac tivity of international treaties that Annex 1 did not apply to investments pre-dating the entry into forc e of the Investment Protoc ol in April 2010. The Kingdom pointed out that Swissbourgh had ac quired the Mining Leases, and the JVZF Trust and the Burmilla Trust had ac quired their shareholding in Swissbourgh, before that date. The defendants denied that the date of the investment was relevant to jurisdic tion sinc e Annex 1 spec ific ally referred also to “existing investments”. 

 (c ) The Kingdom c ontended that Swissbourgh and the Tributees, being inc orporated under the laws of the Kingdom, c ould not qualify as “investors” for the purpose of Annex 1. The Kingdom submitted that “investors” had to be foreign entities or individuals to qualify for investment treaty protec tion. Moreover, the Burmilla Trust (to whic h their rights had been assigned) and the JVZF Trust lac ked legal c apac ity to bring legal proc eedings under South Afric an law, whic h required that the trustees (rather than the trust itself ) be named as c laimant. The defendants c ounterargued that Annex 1 did not distinguish between domestic and foreign investors, that the definition of “investor” in Annex 1 inc luded trusts, and that it did not matter whether the trusts or their trustees were named in the arbitration. 

 (d) The Kingdom submitted that the right to c laim in an international forum suc h as the SADC Tribunal c ould not c onstitute an “investment” for the purposes of Annex 1, both as a princ iple of general international investment law and in light of the prec ise wording of the Investment Protoc ol. The defendants c ontended that the sec ondary right to remedies before an international tribunal c ould c onstitute an investment, being part of a bundle of rights along with the primary right to have the Mining Leases performed. 

 (e) The Kingdom submitted that the defendants did not have an “admitted” investment for the purposes of Art 28(1) of Annex 1 as neither the Mining Leases nor any litigious c laims emanating from them had been subjec t to a proper admission proc edure. The defendants asserted that the 


 Kingdom had “admitted” their investment by granting the Mining Leases pursuant to its internal proc edure and by endorsing the validity of these leases for several years. 

 (f ) The Kingdom denied that it bore any relevant “obligation ... in relation to” either the Mining Leases or the defendants’ right to c laim in the SADC Tribunal within the meaning of Art 28(1) of Annex 1. The defendants interpreted Art 28(1) of Annex 1 differently, c ontending that it was the dispute rather than the obligation that had to relate to the admitted investment. 

 (g) The Kingdom asserted that loc al remedies ( ie , remedies in Lesotho) had not been exhausted, relying on Art 28(1) of Annex 1 to the Investment Protoc ol and general princ iples of international law. The true dispute was the expropriation dispute, in respec t of whic h loc al remedies remained unexhausted. Alternatively, as regards the shuttering dispute, the defendants c ould have pursued a loc al remedy desc ribed as an “Aquilian ac tion”, ie , seeking c ompensation for ec onomic loss c aused by the Kingdom’s partic ipation in the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal, but did not do so. The defendants denied that any loc al remedy was available. 

44     As to the merits of the defendants’ c laim, the Kingdom denied that it had breac hed any obligations, asserting that the SADC Member States had ac ted within their sovereign powers in suspending the SADC Tribunal. The Kingdom disputed that the defendants had been denied justic e, as both domestic and international legal remedies remained available to them. Generally, the Kingdom denied any responsibility for dec isions made by the SADC Summit, sinc e these c ould only result in the liability of the SADC as an international organisation, and not in the liability of any of its individual Member States. 

_The Award_ 

45     At the c onc lusion of the first phase, the PCA Tribunal (Justic e Nienaber dissenting) found in favour of the defendants and ruled as follows: 

 (a) The PCA Tribunal had jurisdic tion to hear and determine the c laims of the sec ond, third and fourth defendants only. While Art 28 of Annex 1 was broad enough to c over domestic investors, Swissbourgh and the Tributees had assigned their c laims to the Burmilla Trust, whic h was the proper party. Swissbourgh and the Tributees’ c laims were therefore dismissed. 

 (b) The Kingdom’s other jurisdic tional objec tions were dismissed. In partic ular, the PCA Tribunal found that the true dispute was the shuttering dispute, whic h had arisen after the entry into forc e of Annex 1. This dispute c onc erned the obligations of the Kingdom relating to the defendants’ right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal, whic h was an “investment”, being part of a bundle of rights related to the Mining Leases. This investment had been “admitted” via the Kingdom’s ac c eptanc e and c onfirmation of the Mining Leases. There were no loc al remedies for the defendants to exhaust in respec t of the shuttering dispute. 

 (c ) The Kingdom had breac hed Arts 14 and 15 of the Tribunal Protoc ol by unilaterally withdrawing its c onsent to the SADC Tribunal’s jurisdic tion over the SADC c laim. 

 (d) The Kingdom had breac hed Art 6(1) of Annex 1 by failing to ac c ord fair and equitable treatment to the defendants and their investment. 

 (e) The Kingdom had breac hed Art 27 of Annex 1 by failing to protec t the defendants’ right of ac c ess to the SADC Tribunal, whic h was a judic ial tribunal or other authority c ompetent under the laws of the Kingdom. 


 (f ) The Kingdom had breac hed Arts 4(c ) and 6(1) of the SADC Treaty by failing to uphold the rule of law. 

46     By way of relief, the PCA Tribunal found that the parties should establish a new tribunal to hear and determine the SADC c laim. The new tribunal was to be seated in Mauritius (unless the parties agreed on another seat) and c omprise three independent and impartial arbitrators who were nationals of SADC Member States. The new tribunal would have the same jurisdic tion whic h the SADC Tribunal had in 2009 when the defendants first filed the SADC c laim. The arbitration would be administered by the PCA (unless the parties agreed otherwise) under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010, save that the tribunal should take into ac c ount the SADC Tribunal Protoc ol and Rules where prac tic able, inc luding in relation to jurisdic tion. The parties were required to c onfirm in writing to the PCA Tribunal, within 30 days of the issuanc e of the Award, that they agreed to submit, and thereby c onsented, to arbitration before the new tribunal of the expropriation dispute. 

47     Justic e Nienaber authored a strong dissenting opinion (“the Dissenting Opinion”). He disagreed that the PCA Tribunal had jurisdic tion. He thought that the dispute was properly c harac terised as the expropriation dispute, whic h pre-dated the entry into forc e of the Investment Protoc ol, rather than the shuttering dispute. The PCA Tribunal thus lac ked jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_. He also took the view that the defendants had not exhausted loc al remedies (in partic ular, the remedy of an Aquilian ac tion as regards the shuttering dispute) prior to c ommenc ing the arbitration. 

48     The PCA Tribunal issued the Costs Award on 20 Oc tober 2016. It found that the defendants were entitled to be reimbursed by the Kingdom for the c osts of the arbitral proc eedings, whic h it quantified as US$2,137,061.28, €265,703.04, £10,350.49 and ZAR775,517.71, subjec t to the Kingdom’s entitlement to offset the c osts by ZAR1,826,299.07 plus interest for its c osts in the litigation in the Kingdom’s domestic c ourts. The Costs Award was the subjec t of separate proc eedings for enforc ement in Singapore: see _Josias Van Zyl and others v Kingdom of Lesotho_ <span class="citation">[2017] SGHC 104</span>. 

49     I will examine the reasoning of the majority of the PCA Tribunal as well as of Justic e Nienaber in greater detail in my analysis below of eac h of the Kingdom’s jurisdic tional objec tions. 

_Interpretation of the Award_ 

50     On 13 May 2016, the Kingdom sought an interpretation of the Award under Art 37 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010. In light of the PCA Tribunal’s finding that it had jurisdic tion to hear and determine the c laims of the sec ond to fourth defendants only, the Kingdom sought c onfirmation that the obligation to establish the new tribunal applied to the sec ond to fourth defendants only, and that only the sec ond to fourth defendants’ c laims were to be submitted to arbitration by the new tribunal. 

51     On 18 May 2016, a day after filing OS 492, the Kingdom c onfirmed by letter to the PCA Tribunal that it would submit to the jurisdic tion of the new tribunal, subjec t to the outc ome of its request for interpretation. 

52     On 27 June 2016, the PCA Tribunal issued an Interpretation of the Partial Final Award on Jurisdic tion and Merits (“the Interpretation”). It gave the following c larific ations: 

 (a) Only the sec ond to fourth defendants, and the Kingdom, were ordered to establish the new tribunal under the Award (at [7.7] of the Interpretation). The PCA Tribunal only had jurisdic tion to order the sec ond to fourth defendants to partic ipate in the arbitration before the new tribunal (at [7.8]). 


 (b) Nevertheless, the new tribunal, being invested with the jurisdic tion of the SADC Tribunal prior to its being shuttered, had jurisdic tion to ac c ept c laims from all nine defendants (at [7.12]). Ac c ordingly, Swissbourgh and the Tributees c ould voluntarily apply to partic ipate in the new arbitration should they c onsider it nec essary or desirable to do so (at [7.8]). 

 (c ) Unless the sec ond to fourth defendants and the Kingdom agreed otherwise, the proper proc edure for Swissbourgh and the Tributees to be involved in the new arbitration would be for them to apply to the tribunal to be joined under Art 17(5) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 

2010\. It would be for the new tribunal to dec ide whether to permit suc h joinder (at [7.9]–[7.10]). The PCA Tribunal made no finding as to the proper parties to pursue the SADC c laim, and this was a matter for the new tribunal to determine (at [7.12]). 

**Parties’ cases** 

53     In OS 492, the Kingdom seeks the following orders: 

 (a) that the entire Award be set aside or reversed pursuant to: 

 (i) s 10(3) of the International Arbitration Ac t (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the IAA”) – ie , an appeal against the PCA Tribunal’s ruling on jurisdic tion; or, in the alternative, 

 (ii) s 3(1) of the IAA read with Art 34(2)( a )(iii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commerc ial Arbitration (“the Model Law”) – ie , on the basis that the Award exc eeded the terms or sc ope of the submission to arbitration, 

 or, in the further alternative, 

 (b) that that part of the Award finding the Kingdom liable to pay the defendants’ c osts of the arbitration be set aside or reversed pursuant to: 

 (i) s 24( b ) of the IAA – ie , a breac h of the rules of natural justic e; and/or 

 (ii) s 3(1) of the IAA read with Art 34(2)( a )(ii) and/or Art 34(2)( a )(iii) of the Model Law 

- _ie_ , that the Kingdom was unable to present its c ase on c osts and/or that the finding of liability for c osts exc eeded the terms or sc ope of the submission to arbitration; 

 (c ) that the c osts of both OS 492 and the arbitration proc eedings before the PCA Tribunal be awarded in the Kingdom’s favour; and 

 (d) suc h other relief as the c ourt might think fit. 

54     To justify setting aside the Award in entirety, the Kingdom essentially reiterated the jurisdic tional objec tions that it had raised before the PCA Tribunal (see [43] above). As regards its liability to pay c osts, the Kingdom submitted as follows: 

 (a) The Kingdom had not been given an opportunity to make submissions on the question of c osts before the PCA Tribunal rendered its dec ision, thus offending s 24( b ) of the IAA and Art 34(2)( a )(ii) of the Model Law. 

 (b) By ruling on an issue without having given the parties a reasonable opportunity to present their c ases on it, the PCA Tribunal rendered a dec ision beyond the sc ope of the submission to 


 arbitration, thus offending Art 34(2)( a )(iii) of the Model Law. 

55     The defendants raised a preliminary objec tion to OS 492, submitting that this c ourt lac ked jurisdic tion to set aside the Award under either s 10(3) of the IAA or Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) of the Model Law. Sec tion 10(3) of the IAA had no applic ation to arbitral awards c ontaining dec isions on both jurisdic tion and merits, while Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) of the Model Law only addressed situations where the t ribunal _exceeded_ jurisdic tion, rather than situations where it lac ked jurisdic tion to begin with. The defendants strove to justify the PCA Tribunal’s findings on both its jurisdic tion and the merits. 

**Preliminary objection: jurisdiction of this court** 

**_Parties’ submissions_** 

56     The defendants c hallenged the Kingdom’s ability to bring the present ac tion under s 10(3) of the IAA, whic h states: 

 If the arbitral tribunal rules — 

 ( a ) on a plea as a preliminary question that it has jurisdic tion; or 

 ( b ) on a plea at any stage of the arbitral proc eedings that it has no jurisdic tion, 

 any party may, within 30 days after having rec eived notic e of that ruling, apply to the High Court to dec ide the matter. 

57     Ac c ording to the defendants, s 10(3) of the IAA c ould not apply to an arbitral award dealing with _both_ jurisdic tion and the merits of a dispute. This was supported by _AQZ v ARA_ <span class="citation">[2015] 2 SLR 972</span> (“ _AQZ v ARA_ ”), where the plaintiff in that c ase was prec luded from relying on s 10(3) of the IAA (or Art 16(3) of the Model Law) to set aside an award whic h predominantly c onc erned jurisdic tion but also marginally addressed issues of liability. 

58     The Kingdom c ounter-argued that the Award _was_ a ruling “on a plea as a preliminary question” bec ause the true dispute was the expropriation dispute, on whic h the PCA Tribunal did not rule. Moreover, the Award had been issued after the first phase of the bifurc ated proc eedings, whic h dealt with “jurisdic tion and liability”, as opposed to the potential sec ond phase c onc erning remedies. 

59     The defendants also c alled into question the Kingdom’s alternative basis for review, _ie_ , Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) of the Model Law, whic h states that an arbitral award may be set aside on proof that: 

 the award deals with a dispute not c ontemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or c ontains dec isions on matters beyond the sc ope of the submission to arbitration, provided that, if the dec isions on matters submitted to arbitration c an be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the award whic h c ontains dec isions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; 

60     The defendants c ited various authorities to support their c ontention that Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) was unavailable where the applic ant disputed the _existence_ of a tribunal’s jurisdic tion. First, they referred to the Court of Appeal dec ision of _CRW Joint Operation v PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK_ <span class="citation">[2011] 4 SLR 305</span> (“ _CRW Joint Operation_ ”) at [31]: 

 ... Art 34(2)(a)(iii) is not concerned with the situation where an arbitral tribunal did not have jurisdiction to deal with the dispute whic h it purported to determine. Rather, it applies where the 


 arbitral tribunal improperly dec ided matters that had not been submitted to it or failed to dec ide matters that had been submitted to it. In other words, Art 34(2)(a)(iii) addresses the situation where the arbitral tribunal exceeded (or failed to exercise) the authority that the parties granted to it (see Gary B Born, International Commercial Arbitration (Wolters Kluwer, 2009) at vol 2, pp 2606–2607 and 2798–2799). ... 

 [emphasis added] 

61     The defendants also referred to Blac kaby _et al_ , _Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration_ (Oxford University Press, 6th Ed, 2015) (“ _Redfern and Hunter_ ”) at para 10.46, whic h states: 

 ... [Art 34(2)( a )(iii)] c ontemplates a situation in whic h an award has been made by a tribunal that did have jurisdiction to deal with the dispute, but whic h exceeded its powers by dealing with matters that had not been submitted to it. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

62     They also c ited Gary Born, _International Commercial Arbitration_ , vol III (Wolters Kluwer, 2nd Ed, 2014) (“ _International Commercial Arbitration_ ”) at p 3288: 

 ... [Art 34(2)( a )(iii)] is direc ted towards c ases where a valid arbitration agreement existed , but the matters dec ided by the tribunal either exc eeded the sc ope of that agreement or the sc ope of the issues presented to the tribunal by the parties in the arbitration. The exc ess of authority ground also applies where the tribunal failed to dec ide matters presented to it in the arbitration. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

63     The defendants also referred to materials on Art V(1)( _c_ ) of the Convention on the Rec ognition and Enforc ement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (10 June 1958) 330 UNTS 38 (entered into forc e 7 June 1959, ac c ession by Singapore 21 August 1986) (“the New York Convention”) and s 31(2)( _d_ ) of the IAA. Notably, Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) of the Model Law derives from Art V(1)( _c_ ) of the New York Convention (see _Analytical Commentary on Draft Text of a Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration_ , UN Doc A/CN.9/264 (1985) at p 72, para 6), albeit that the former pertains to the setting aside of an award while the latter c onc erns the refusal to rec ognise or enforc e an award. Similarly, s 31(2)( _d_ ) of the IAA, whic h is a ground for refusing the enforc ement of a foreign award, is based on Art V(1)( _c_ ) of the New York Convention. 

64     In this regard, the defendants relied on _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore: Arbitration_ vol 1(2) (LexisNexis, 2014 Reissue) (“ _Halsbury’s_ ”), whic h explains at para 20.145 that s 31(2)( _d_ ) of the IAA “assumes that the tribunal has jurisdic tion over the parties”. Similarly, _International Commercial Arbitration_ states at p 3542 that Art V(1)( _c_ ) “does not apply where there is a dispute as to the existenc e of a valid arbitration agreement (whic h is the subjec t of Artic le V(1)(a))” but “c onc erns only the exc ess of jurisdic tion, or authority, rather than the absenc e of any jurisdic tion at all”. Merc édeh Azeredo da Silveira & Laurent Lévy, “Transgression of the Arbitrators’ Authority: Artic le V(1)(c ) of the New York Convention” in _Enforcement of Arbitration Agreements and International Arbitral Awards: The New York Convention in Practice_ (Emmanuel Gaillard & Domenic o Di Pietro eds) (Cameron May, 2008) at pp 639–640 observe that Art V(1)( _c_ ) “presupposes that the parties have c onc luded a valid arbitration agreement and pertains to situations where the sc ope – not the existenc e – of the arbitrators’ jurisdic tion is at issue”. 


65     The defendants also c ited _Aloe Vera of America, Inc v Asianic Food (S) Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">[2006] 3 SLR(R) 174</span> (“ _Aloe Vera_ ”), in whic h the sec ond defendant sought to resist enforc ement of an arbitral award under s 31(2)( _d_ ) of the IAA. The c ourt found that the sec ond defendant c ould not rely on s 31(2)( _d_ ), whic h “relates to the sc ope of the arbitration agreement rather than to whether a partic ular person was a party to that agreement” (at [69]). _Aloe Vera_ was c ited with approval in _PT First Media TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK) v Astro Nusantara International BV and others and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2014] 1 SLR 372</span> (“ _Astro_ ”) at [153]. 

66     The Kingdom c ounter-argued that _CRW Joint Operation_ did not c onc lusively limit the applic ability of Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) of the Model Law, whic h enc ompassed c hallenges to the tribunal’s jurisdic tion generally (inc luding the objec tion that the dispute before the tribunal was not within the sc ope of the arbitration agreement). It also c ited a helpful passage from an older version of _International Commercial Arbitration_ , whic h I reproduc e at [74(a)] below. 

**_My analysis_** 

67     I agree with the defendants that I do not have jurisdic tion to set aside the Award under s 10(3) of the IAA. However, I find that I have suc h jurisdic tion under Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) of the Model Law read with s 3 of the IAA. 

_Section 10(3) of the IAA_ 

68     In _AQZ v ARA_ (see [57] above), Judith Prakash J (as she then was) c onduc ted a thorough review of the drafting history of the Model Law and c onc luded that Art 16(3), from whic h s 10(3) of the IAA derives, does not apply to an award that deals with the merits of the dispute, _however marginally_ (at [65]–[69]). Prakash J held that the same princ iple applies to s 10(3) of the IAA ( _AQZ v ARA_ at [70]). 

69     The Kingdom did not c ontend that _AQZ v ARA_ was wrongly dec ided. Indeed, it seemed to ac c ept that s 10(3) did not apply where there was a ruling on both jurisdic tion and merits. It therefore sought to persuade me that the PCA Tribunal did not rule on the merits of the dispute in the Award. I agree with Prakash J on the sc ope of s 10(3) of the IAA. 

70     Here, the Award dealt with the merits of the defendants’ c laim. It was desc ribed as a “Partial Final Award on Jurisdic tion and _Merits_ ” [emphasis added], and was c learly neither preliminary nor limited to a ruling on jurisdic tion. The Award disposed of what the PCA Tribunal saw as the substanc e of the defendants’ c laim, _ie_ , the Kingdom’s purported breac h of its treaty obligations as a result of its partic ipation in the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal ( _ie_ , the shuttering dispute), on its merits. The Award also ordered relief in the form of the mandatory c onstitution of a new tribunal to hear the defendants’ SADC c laim. Obviously, the PCA Tribunal only ordered relief bec ause it had determined the merits of the dispute. 

71     In my judgment, the Kingdom’s emphasis on the fac t that the Award was made after the first phase of proc eedings was misplac ed. The arbitration never entered a sec ond phase prec isely bec ause the relief ordered at the end of the first phase brought the proc eedings to a c lose, save for the quantific ation of c osts of the arbitral proc eedings, whic h the Costs Award addressed. The very fac t that a new tribunal was ordered to be c onstituted to hear the SADC c laim shows that the PCA Tribunal had c ompleted its mission. There was nothing left for it to dec ide. In any event, the important distinc tion is not between jurisdic tion/merits and _remedies_ , but between jurisdic tion and _merits_. The Award dealt with both. The Kingdom’s argument to the c ontrary is thus unarguable. 


72     Thus, applying _AQZ v ARA_ , I find that s 10(3) of the IAA does not apply. I therefore have no jurisdic tion to set aside the Award on this basis. I now turn to Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) of the Model Law. 

_Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law_ 

73     I find that I have jurisdic tion to determine the Kingdom’s jurisdic tional c hallenges under Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) of the Model Law for the following reasons. 

74     First, the parties did not dispute that there was a valid agreement to refer their dispute to _ad hoc_ arbitration pursuant to Art 28(2)(c ) of Annex 1. The c rux of the Kingdom’s jurisdic tional objec tions was, rather, that there was no dispute whic h fell within the terms or sc ope of that arbitration agreement. In my judgment, these objec tions fall squarely within the terms of Art 34(2)( _a_ ) (iii). The first limb of Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) c onc erns the situation where “the award deals with a dispute whic h is not c ontemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration”. In my view, a dispute beyond the bounds of the arbitration agreement falls outside “the terms of the submission to arbitration” and therefore engages the first limb of Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii). This view is supported by ac ademic c ommentary: 

 (a) First, Born expresses the following view in International Commercial Arbitration at p 3295: 

 An award will also be subjec t to annulment if an arbitral tribunal purports to dec ide issues that are not within the scope of the parties’ arbitration agreement. Indeed, this is one of the paradigmatic examples of an exc ess of authority under most national arbitration regimes ... It is sometimes suggested that the “excess of authority” basis for annulment under Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law and similarly-worded legislative provisions does not apply to claims that the award decided issues outside the scope of the arbitration agreement (as distinguished from claims outside the scope of the parties’ submissions in the arbitration). This interpretation is contrary to at least some modern legislation and to the better reading of the language and purposes of the Model Law. There is no satisfactory reason to interpret the phrase “submission to arbitration” as limited solely to the submissions made by the parties in particular arbitral proceedings, and as excluding the matters submitted to arbitration by the parties’ arbitration agreement. If an award addresses matters that are c learly not within the sc ope of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate, then it should be subjec t to annulment on exc ess of authority grounds. 

 [emphasis added] 

 (b) Sec ondly, Redfern and Hunter states at para 10.38: 

 ... Artic le V of the New York Convention sets out the grounds on whic h rec ognition and enforc ement of an international award may be refused, while Artic le 34 of the Model Law sets out the same grounds (with only slight differenc es of language) on whic h an award may be set aside. These grounds are: 

 ... 

 the award deals with matters not contemplated by, or falling within, the arbitration clause or submission agreement , or goes beyond the sc ope of what was submitted; 

 ... 


 [emphasis added] 

Furthermore, this view is indirec tly supported by _Aloe Vera_ and _Astro_ , whic h desc ribe s 31(2)( _d_ ) of the IAA and Art V(1)( _c_ ) of the New York Convention respec tively as pertaining to the “sc ope of the _arbitration agreement_ ” [emphasis added] ( _Aloe Vera_ at [69]; _Astro_ at [155]). On the defendants’ interpretation, Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) would permit an award to be set aside only where it dec ides matters exc eeding the sc ope of the dispute whic h the parties submitted for arbitration, but not where the entire submitted dispute _itself_ exc eeds the sc ope of the arbitration agreement. The latter situation surely involves an even more serious infrac tion. In my view, Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) applies to both situations. 

75     I therefore c onc lude that, if a tribunal dec ides on a dispute beyond the terms or sc ope of the arbitration agreement, its dec ision is liable to be set aside under Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) of the Model Law. 

76     Sec ondly, in my view, the passages in _CRW Joint Operation_ , _Aloe Vera_ and _Astro_ whic h the defendants relied on do not prec lude me from reac hing this c onc lusion. The remarks made in those c ases need to be understood in c ontext. I will disc uss these three authorities in turn. 

77     I first address the observations made in _CRW Joint Operation_ at [31] (see [60] above). In that c ase, it was c lear that the dispute submitted to arbitration was within the terms of the arbitration agreement. The applic ant’s c omplaint was that the tribunal had essentially c onverted a previous adjudic ator’s dec ision into a Final Award without assessing the merits of the defenc e and the adjudic ator’s dec ision as a whole. The Court of Appeal held that the tribunal had exc eeded its jurisdic tion in failing to c onsider the merits of the adjudic ator’s dec ision, bec ause the arbitration agreement provided for the arbitration to take plac e as a rehearing so that the entirety of the parties’ disputes c ould finally be “resolved afresh” (at [66] and [82]). The Final Award was therefore set aside under Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) of the Model Law. Plainly, the fac ts in _CRW Joint Operation_ were very different from those here. Thus, to the extent that the Court of Appeal’s remarks (at [31]) suggest that Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) does not apply if the dispute falls outside the arbitration agreement, they were stric tly _obiter_. 

78     In any event, I do not c onsider that the Court of Appeal’s remarks in fac t go that far. Notably, after making the remarks c ited by the defendant (at [31]), the c ourt added at [33] that Art 34(2)( _a_ ) (iii) “applies where an arbitral tribunal exc eeds its authority by _deciding matters beyond its ambit of reference_ ...” [emphasis added]. In view of the authorities referred to at [74] above, I c onsider that the phrase “ambit of referenc e” does not merely refer to what the parties ac tually submit for dec ision. It must first and foremost be determined by referenc e to the arbitration agreement, whic h fixes the bounds of what disputes may be submitted to arbitration in the first plac e. I therefore c onsider that the Court of Appeal did not forec lose my c onc lusion that an award whic h pertains to a dispute falling outside the terms of an arbitration agreement may be set aside under Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii). 

79     Turning then to the c ase of _Aloe Vera_ , the sec ond defendant, who was the president of the first defendant (a c ompany that he had established), denied that he was a party to the arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and the first defendant and argued that the award c ould thus not be enforc ed against him ( _Aloe Vera_ at [58]). He sought to resist enforc ement under s 31(2)( _d_ ) of the IAA. The c ourt ac c epted that “s 31(2)( _d_ ) did not overlap with s 31(2)( _b_ ) whic h was the proper sec tion to invoke when a c hallenge was being made on the basis that a person was not a party to the arbitration agreement” ( _Aloe Vera_ at [67] and [69]). In this light, when the c ourt remarked that s 31(2)( _d_ ) “relates to the sc ope of the arbitration agreement” (see [65] above), it was simply making plain that s 31(2)( _d_ ) does not apply where it is the existenc e of an arbitration agreement between the parties to the proc eedings that is in question. The c ourt was not remarking on a situation where there _was_ an arbitration agreement between the parties but the dispute fell outside its sc ope. 


80     The same princ iple was reiterated by the Court of Appeal in _Astro_ (see [65] above). The inquiry fac ing the c ourt was “whether the existenc e of an arbitration agreement between two parties should fall under the first [ _ie_ , Art 36(1)( _a_ )(i) of the Model Law, whic h c orresponds to Art V(1)( _a_ ) of the New York Convention] or third ground [ _ie_ , Art 36(1)( _a_ )(iii) of the Model Law, whic h c orresponds to Art V(1) ( _c_ ) of the New York Convention]” (at [152]). The Court of Appeal c onsidered _Aloe Vera_ to be support for the first ground and agreed with _Aloe Vera_ (at [153] and [158]). I do not understand the Court of Appeal to have held that Art V(1)( _c_ ) of the New York Convention or Art 36(1)( _a_ )(iii) or Art 34(2)( _a_ ) (iii) of the Model Law would not apply to a dispute falling outside the bounds of the arbitration agreement. 

81     In my judgment, the passages c ited by the defendants sought to c larify the boundary between c hallenges to the _existence and validity of the arbitration agreement_ and c hallenges to the _substantive jurisdiction of the tribunal_ : see Born’s and da Silveira & Lévy’s remarks at [62] and [64] above. Similarly, the passage from _Halsbury’s_ (see [64] above) makes the point that s 31(2)( _d_ ) of the IAA is not intended to ac c ommodate arguments that the tribunal lac ks jurisdic tion over the parties for the reason that there is no valid arbitration agreement. Artic le 34(2)( _a_ )(i) of the Model Law, like Art V(1)( _a_ ) of the New York Convention, provides spec ific ally for situations where there is no valid arbitration agreement and it would be inappropriate to bring a c hallenge in suc h c irc umstanc es under Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) or Art V(1)( _c_ ) instead. The passages relied on by the defendants therefore juxtapose t he _scope_ of jurisdic tion with whether jurisdic tion exists _in the sense of whether a valid arbitration agreement has been concluded between the parties_. _Aloe Vera_ and _Astro_ c an also be understood in this way. 

82     Thirdly, my c onc lusion that an award c onc erning a dispute falling outside the terms of the arbitration agreement c an be set aside under Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) is c onsistent with authority, princ iple and polic y. 

83     As a matter of authority, my c onc lusion is c onsistent with _AQZ v ARA_ , where Prakash J opined at [69] as follows: 

 ... [R]elief under Art 16(3) is not available when a party seeks to set aside a ruling whic h is predominantly on jurisdic tion but also marginally deals with the merits bec ause that is simply not the purpose that the drafters intended Art 16(3) to serve. In such situations, the dissatisfied party can seek to set aside the award pursuant to s 3(1) of the IAA read with the relevant limbs of Art 34(2) of the Model Law. That would be the obvious and more appropriate remedy. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

This c onc lusion is also in line with the Law Reform Committee’s observations: see _Report of the Law Reform Committee on Right to Judicial Review of Negative Jurisdictional Rulings_ (January 2011) (“the Law Reform Committee Report”) at para 27): 

 We do not rec ommend that there be judic ial review of a positive jurisdic tional ruling made in an award on the merits. With suc h ruling, the tribunal would have proc eeded to an award. The ruling should only be open for scrutiny on a setting aside application under Article 34 , or in a c hallenge to enforc ement of the award. 

 [emphasis added] 

Similar remarks are made in Howard M Holtzmann & Joseph E Neuhaus, _A Guide to the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration: Legislative History and Commentary_ (Kluwer Law and 


Taxation, 1989) at p 486 (c ited in _AQZ v ARA_ at [68]). 

84     As a matter of princ iple, the Court of Appeal has affirmed that no State will permit a binding arbitral award to be given within its territory without being able to review the award or, at least, without allowing the parties an opportunity to address the c ourt if there has been a violation of due proc ess or other irregularities in the arbitral proc eedings: _CRW Joint Operation_ at [26]. My interpretation of Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) of the Model Law upholds this princ iple. An award whic h determines a dispute outside the sc ope of an arbitration agreement c annot be set aside under any _other_ limb of Art 34. I do not agree with the defendants that Art 34(2)( _a_ )(i) of the Model Law would apply. Art 34(2)( _a_ )(i) only applies where a party to the arbitration agreement was under some inc apac ity, or where the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to whic h the parties have subjec ted it (or, failing any indic ation thereon, the law of Singapore). It deals with “the existenc e _and_ validity of arbitration agreements”, not their “ _scope_ ” [emphasis in original] ( _Astro_ at [155]). 

85     As a matter of polic y, to hold that Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) does not apply, where no other limb under Art 34(2) would be engaged, would allow an arbitral tribunal to immunise its awards against judic ial sc rutiny by delivering its c onc lusions on both jurisdic tion and merits in a _single award_. That would take the award out of the purview of s 10 of the IAA as well. The interpretation of Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) whic h I have arrived at avoids this unsatisfac tory result. 

86     I therefore find that this c ourt does have jurisdic tion to determine the Kingdom’s jurisdic tional c hallenges under Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) of the Model Law. 

87     It is settled law, and undisputed, that I must apply a _de novo_ standard of review in assessing the Kingdom’s jurisdic tional objec tions, even in relation to an investorState arbitration invoking princ iples of public international law ( _Sanum Investments Ltd v Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic_ <span class="citation">[2016] 5 SLR 536</span> (“ _Sanum_ ”) at [40]–[42]). While the c ourt will of c ourse c onsider what the tribunal has said, whic h may well be persuasive, it is not bound to ac c ept its findings on the matter ( _Sanum_ at [41]). 

**Applicable law and principles of treaty interpretation** 

88     As OS 492 engages novel and c omplex legal questions, I think it is prudent to set out the applic able laws and interpretive approac h before exploring the Kingdom’s jurisdic tional objec tions. An applic ation to set aside an international arbitral award will typic ally involve different substantive laws applying at different strata. The treatise by Campbell Mc Lac hlan, Laurenc e Shore & Matthew Weiniger, _International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles_ (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2017) (“ _McLachlan_ ”) identifies the three following strata in an investor-State treaty arbitration: 

 (a) First, the law applic able to the substanc e of the dispute ( lex causae ). The substantive law applied in a treaty arbitration is the treaty itself and the applic able law for the interpretation of the treaty is international law. The primary obligations ( ie , the substantive rights provided by the treaty) that the investor seeks to enforc e are thus interpreted ac c ording to public international law. However, subsidiary questions – for example, the nationality of a person, the validity of a right asserted to be an investment, or the purported breac h of an investment c ontrac t – may require the interpretation and applic ation of domestic law (see McLachlan at paras 1.63–1.68, 3.99, 3.107 and 3.128). 

 (b) Sec ondly, the law applic able to the arbitration agreement between the investor and the State (see McLachlan at para 3.112). This is usually relevant where the arbitration c lause is found in an investment c ontrac t to whic h the investor and the State are parties, but is not 


 relevant here given that the arbitration agreement arises under Art 28 of Annex 1. 

 (c ) Thirdly, the law applic able to the arbitration proc edure itself ( lex arbitri ). In the c ase of an international arbitration not c onduc ted under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (18 Marc h 1965) 575 UNTS 159 (entered into forc e 14 Oc tober 1966) (“the ICSID Convention”), the law governing the arbitration proc edure would be munic ipal law and it is on this basis that national c ourts have reviewed the ac tions of bilateral investment treaty (“BIT”) tribunals (see McLachlan at para 3.113). 

89     In this c ase, the Award does not expressly state the substantive law ( _lex causae_ ) whic h the PCA Tribunal applied. However, sinc e the dispute c onc erned alleged breac hes of the Kingdom’s obligations under the SADC Treaty and protoc ols, it is c lear that the SADC Treaty, its related protoc ols and the general princ iples of international law applic able to the interpretation of the same c onstitute the _lex causae_. 

90     Unlike awards issued under the ICSID Convention, an _ad hoc_ arbitration award is subjec t to the rules for enforc ement and c hallenge in the same way as any private international arbitral award through the c ourts of the c ountry where the tribunal had its seat (James Crawford, _Brownlie’s Principles of Public International Law_ (Oxford University Press, 8th Ed, 2012) (“ _Brownlie_ ”) at p 743). In setting-aside proc eedings, the jurisdic tion of the national c ourts is determined by the c hoic e of the seat of arbitration, whic h provides the rules applic able to the proc eedings. It was not disputed by the parties that Singapore law is the c urial law of the arbitration for the purposes of OS 492. This followed from the PCA Tribunal’s c hoic e of Singapore as the seat of the arbitration. 

91     Applying Singapore law as the _lex arbitri_ , the arbitration was c learly an “international” one within the meaning of s 5(2) of the IAA as the parties have no c onnec tion at all to Singapore. The applic able statute is therefore the IAA, s 3(1) of whic h gives the Model Law (with the exc eption of Chapter VIII) “the forc e of law in Singapore”. The grounds for setting aside the Award are found in s 24 of the IAA and Art 34 of the Model Law, given my view that s 10 of the IAA is inapplic able. 

92     In determining the jurisdic tional c hallenges brought under these provisions, the c ourt is required first and foremost to interpret the arbitration agreement. In this c ase, that agreement is found in Annex 1. General international law princ iples of treaty interpretation are thus of relevanc e in OS 492. 

93     It is c ommonly ac c epted that many provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (23 May 1969) 1155 UNTS 331 (entered into forc e 27 January 1980) (“the VCLT”) are dec laratory of c ustomary international law, and its provisions are therefore regarded as applic able “irrespec tive of whether the VCLT applies _qua_ treaty in the given c ase” ( _Brownlie_ at pp 367–368; see also _McLachlan_ at para 7.85). In partic ular, the International Court of Justic e (“the ICJ”) has rec ognised that Arts 31 and 32 of the VCLT reflec t c ustomary international law (see, _eg_ , _Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro)_ [2007] ICJ 43 at [160]). In _Sanum_ , the Court of Appeal noted (at [46]) that the rules of treaty interpretation are governed by Art 31 of the VCLT, whic h states: 

 Article 31. GENERAL RULE OF INTERPRETATION 

1\. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in ac c ordanc e with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their c ontext and in the light of its objec t and purpose. 

2\. The c ontext for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall c omprise, in addition to 


 the text, inc luding its preamble and annexes: 

 ( a ) Any agreement relating to the treaty whic h was made between all the parties in c onnexion with the c onc lusion of the treaty; 

 ( b ) Any instrument whic h was made by one or more parties in c onnexion with the c onc lusion of the treaty and ac c epted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty. 

3\. There shall be taken into ac c ount, together with the c ontext: 

 ( a ) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the applic ation of its provisions; 

 ( b ) Any subsequent prac tic e in the applic ation of the treaty whic h establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation; 

 ( c ) Any relevant rules of international law applic able in the relations between the parties. 

4\. A spec ial meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended. 

94     Artic le 31(1) of the VCLT enshrines the princ iple of ordinary meaning. This func tions as a presumption: a person advoc ating a meaning other than the ordinary meaning of words in the treaty bears the burden of establishing the spec ial meaning. It is c omplemented by the princ iple of integration: “the meaning must emerge in the c ontext of the treaty as a whole (inc luding the text, its preamble and annexes, and any agreement or instrument related to the treaty and drawn up in c onnec tion with its c onc lusion) and in the light of its objec t and purpose” ( _Brownlie_ at p 381). 

95     The approac h under Art 31 of the VCLT is a holistic one, embrac ing the three aspec ts of ordinary meaning, c ontext, and objec t and purpose. It has been desc ribed by the tribunal in _Aguas del Tunari, S.A. v Republic of Bolivia_ , ICSID Case No ARB/02/3, Dec ision on Respondent’s Objec tions to Jurisdic tion, 21 Oc tober 2005 at [91] (c ited in _McLachlan_ at para 3.130) as follows: 

 Interpretation under [Art 31 of the VCLT] is a proc ess of progressive enc irc lement where the interpreter starts under the general rule with (1) the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty, (2) in their c ontext and (3) in light of the treaty’s objec t and purpose, and by c yc ling through this three step inquiry iteratively c loses in upon the proper interpretation. ... 

96     The tribunal added: 

 ... [The VCLT] does not privilege any one of these three aspec ts of the interpretation method. The meaning of a word or phrase is not solely a matter of dic tionaries and linguistic s. ... Rather, the interpretation of a word or phrase involves a c omplex task of c onsidering the ordinary meaning of a work or phrase in the c ontext in whic h that word or phrase is found and in light of the objec t and purpose of the doc ument. ... 

In _Sanum_ , the Court of Appeal adopted a similar approac h in c onsidering the ordinary meaning of the relevant words in the bilateral investment treaty entered into between the People’s Republic of China and the Lao People’s Democ ratic Republic (“PRC–Laos BIT”), the c ontext of the PRC–Laos BIT, and its objec t and purpose (see _Sanum_ at [125] _et seq_ ). 

97     Artic le 31(3)( _c_ ) of the VCLT embodies what _McLachlan_ (at para 7.95) terms a “princ iple of 


systemic integration”, whic h rec ognises that treaties are themselves c reatures of international law and not a “self-c ontained c losed legal system” (see also Bruno Simma & Dirk Pulkowski, “Two Worlds, but Not Apart: International Investment Law and General International Law” in _International Investment Law_ (Marc Bungenberg _et al_ , eds) (C H Bec k, Hart & Nomos, 2015) (“ _Bungenberg_ ”) at p 361 and p 363 at para 6). Customary international law may intersec t with investment treaty arbitration by, for example, shedding light on the meaning of the terms used by the treaty, stipulating rules or maxims of interpretation, delimiting the bounds of State responsibility and giving c ontent to the international minimum standard of treatment ( _McLachlan_ at para 7.95; Simma & Pulkowski’s c hapter in _Bungenberg_ at paras 6–16). Customary international law is most often used under Art 31(3)( _c_ ) where the treaty rule is unc lear or open-textured and its meaning is determined by referenc e to a developed body of international law and/or the treaty terms have a rec ognised meaning in c ustomary law, to whic h the parties c an therefore be taken to have intended to refer (Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission, “Fragmentation of International Law: Diffic ulties Arising from Diversific ation and Expansion of International Law”, UN GAOR, 58th Sess, UN Doc A/CN.4/L.682 (13 April 2006) at para 467). 

98     Artic le 32 of the VCLT “c autiously qualifies” the textual approac h enshrined in Art 31 by permitting rec ourse to further means of interpretation in c ertain c irc umstanc es ( _Brownlie_ at p 383). Artic le 32 states: 

 Article 32. SUPPLEMENTARY MEANS OF INTERPRETATION 

 Rec ourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, inc luding the preparatory work of the treaty and the c irc umstanc es of its c onc lusion, in order to c onfirm the meaning resulting from the applic ation of artic le 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation ac c ording to artic le 31: 

 ( a ) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obsc ure; or 

 ( b ) Leads to a result whic h is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. 

99     There was little opportunity to invoke Art 32 in this c ase. I invited the parties to tender the _travaux préparatoires_ of the SADC Treaty and its protoc ols or annexes, but they did not do so. The _travaux préparatoires_ for the Investment Protoc ol, in partic ular, were of interest to me. Counsel for the Kingdom explained that despite his best efforts, and presumably those of the Kingdom, the same c ould not be sec ured. This was unfortunate as the _travaux préparatoires_ would have helped to shed light on some of the c omplex issues I had to grapple with. 

100    Treaties should not be interpreted either liberally or restric tively (August Reinisc h, “The Interpretation of International Investment Agreements” in _Bungenberg_ at p 397, para 53). Indeed, neither of these terms is part of Art 31(1) of the VCLT. The objec t and purpose of investment treaty interpretation c an rarely, if ever, be reduc ed to an unequivoc ally pro-investor or a proState approac h. Usually a BIT, as well as a multilateral investment treaty like the SADC Treaty, strikes a balanc e between investor protec tion and State interests. The tribunal in _Saluka Investments BV v The Czech Republic (Partial Award)_ , PCA Case No 2001-04, 15 ICSID Rep 274, IIC 210 at [300] (c ited in _McLachlan_ at para 1.90) astutely observed: 

 ... The protec tion of foreign investments is not the sole aim of the Treaty, but rather a nec essary element alongside the overall aim of enc ouraging foreign investment and extending and intensifying the parties’ ec onomic relations. That in turn c alls for a balanc ed approac h to the 


 interpretation of the Treaty’s substantive provisions for the protec tion of investments, sinc e an interpretation whic h exaggerates the protec tion to be ac c orded to foreign investments may serve to dissuade host States from admitting foreign investments and so undermine the overall aim of extending and intensifying the parties’ mutual ec onomic relations. 

101    Similarly, the tribunal in _Daimler Financial Services AG v Argentina Republic_ , ICSID Case No ARB/05/1, Award, 22 August 2012, observed at [161] (referred to with approval in _McLachlan_ at para 3.150): 

 ... In c onsidering [the] interpretation [of the relevant BIT], it is essential to rec all that BITs are rec iproc al bilateral treaties negotiated between two sovereign State parties. The general purpose of BITs is of c ourse primarily to protec t and promote foreign investment; but it is to do so within the framework ac c eptable to both of the State parties. These two aspec ts must always be held in tension. They are the yin and yang of bilateral investment treaties and c annot be separated without doing violenc e to the will of the states that c onc lude suc h treaties. It is in this c ontext that the exac t wording of dispute resolution c lauses plays a key role, as suc h c lauses are one of the privileged plac es where the imbalanc es between the interests of both parties are often prec isely defined as a result of the treaty’s negotiation proc ess. 

102    An interpretation of the SADC Treaty and Annex 1 likewise must take into ac c ount the objec t and purpose of those instruments in light of both the potential interests of investors as well as those of the SADC Member States. This is an important c onsideration in this matter. 

103    Another pertinent question is the value to be asc ribed to past dec isions of other international tribunals and c ourts. There is no system of prec edent in international law. Past dec isions have no prec edential value even where the same treaty or State is involved ( _McLachlan_ at para 3.158). That said, “a _de facto_ doc trine of prec edent for investment treaty arbitration definitely exists” and investment tribunals approac h their task “by c arefully c onsidering the work of other tribunals” ( _McLachlan_ at para 3.164). The c onsensus appears to be that this is both c onduc ive to the development of a _jurisprudence constante_ in international investment law, and helpful to individual tribunals in examining how similar issues have been resolved or as illustrating the applic ation of established princ iples (Marc Bungenberg & Catharine Titi, “Prec edents in International Investment Law” in _Bungenberg_ at pp 1508–1510, paras 4–7). It is important, however, to analyse partic ular c ases in c ontext – “both as to their func tional response to the subjec t-matter of the c laim, and as to their c onsistenc y with the overall development of the law in this area” ( _McLachlan_ at para 7.100). 

104    With that, I turn to the Kingdom’s jurisdic tional objec tions. In investment treaty disputes, the arbitrator’s jurisdic tion c an be analysed within the framework of three c ore elements – jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_ , jurisdic tion _ratione materiae_ and jurisdic tion _ratione personae_. First, the tribunal lac ks jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_ if the dispute falls foul of temporal restric tions in the investment treaty. For example, the investment treaty may limit the tribunal’s jurisdic tion to disputes arising after the treaty’s entry into forc e or to investments made after that time. Sec ondly, a dispute is beyond the tribunal’s jurisdic tion _ratione materiae_ if its subjec t matter is not c apable of being submitted to arbitration under the investment treaty. For example, investment treaties may require the dispute to pertain to suc h “investment” as is defined in the treaty. Third, the tribunal lac ks jurisdic tion _ratione personae_ if one of the parties before it lac ks standing in the arbitration proc eedings, say if he or she is not an “investor” within the meaning of the treaty or not a national of a signatory State. I address the Kingdom’s jurisdic tional objec tions in the following sequenc e: 

 (a) First, the PCA Tribunal lac ked jurisdic tion ratione temporis over the dispute, whic h arose before the entry into forc e of Annex 1 and thus fell foul of Art 28(4) of Annex 1 (at [105]–[180]). 


 (b) Sec ondly, the PCA Tribunal lac ked jurisdic tion ratione materiae bec ause the dispute did not have the nec essary c onnec tion to an “investment” within the meaning of Art 28(1) of Annex 1 (at [181]–[228]). 

 (c ) Thirdly, the defendants’ purported investment had not been “admitted” within the meaning of Art 28(1) (at [229]–[252]). 

 (d) Fourthly, the dispute was not one whic h c onc erned an “obligation” of the Kingdom “in relation to” the defendants’ purported investment within the meaning of Art 28(1) (at [253]– [277]). 

 (e) Fifthly, the dispute was not one in relation to whic h the defendants had exhausted loc al remedies, whic h was a requirement under Art 28(1) (at [278]–[319]). 

 (f ) Sixthly, the PCA Tribunal lac ked jurisdic tion ratione personae over Swissbourgh and the Tributees, who were not c apable of qualifying as “investors” for the purposes of Art 28(1) of Annex 1 and thus lac ked standing to c ommenc e the arbitration (at [320]–[339]). 

**First objection: jurisdiction** **_ratione temporis_** 

105    Artic le 28(4) of Annex 1 states that “[t]he provisions of this Artic le shall not apply to a _dispute_ , whic h arose before entry into forc e of this Annex” [emphasis added]. Annex 1 entered into forc e on 16 April 2010 (see [31(c )] above). As I have said, the defendants c harac terised the dispute as one c onc erning the Kingdom’s partic ipation in the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal from 2010 to 2014 (the shuttering dispute), and took pains to emphasise that the arbitration did _not_ c onc ern the Kingdom’s alleged expropriation of the Mining Leases (the expropriation dispute). The Kingdom, on the other hand, submitted that the defendants’ c harac terisation was an “artific e”. The “real dispute” had to be objec tively determined by the PCA Tribunal, and was the expropriation dispute, whic h had arisen well before April 2010. This is a key point bec ause if the Kingdom’s c ontention is c orrec t, the dispute was beyond the PCA Tribunal’s jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_ as it arose before the entry into forc e of Annex 1. 

**_PCA Tribunal’s findings_** 

106    The majority had “some sympathy” for the Kingdom’s argument that the “true” dispute was the expropriation dispute (Award at [7.201]). Nevertheless, it c ited three arbitral dec isions for the proposition that it was “possible for a separate dispute to arise out of the dispute resolution proc ess to determine the initial dispute”: _Chevron Corporation (USA) and Texaco Petroleum Company (USA) v The Republic of Ecuador_ , PCA Case No 2007-02, Interim Award, 1 Dec ember 2008 (“ _Chevron v Ecuador_ ”), _ATA Construction, Industrial and Trading Company v The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan_ , ICSID Case No ARB/08/2, Award, 18 May 2010 (“ _ATA v Jordan_ ”) and _Mondev International Ltd v United States of America_ , ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 Oc tober 2002 (“ _Mondev v USA_ ”) (Award at [7.202]). The majority found that a “separate and disc rete dispute” had arisen in this c ase upon the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal by the SADC Member States, inc luding the Kingdom, “without providing an alternative forum for [the defendants’] c laims to be heard and dec ided” (at [7.203]). The majority identified (at [7.204]–[7.206]) the following differenc es between the expropriation dispute and the shuttering dispute: 

 (a) The expropriation dispute “c onc ern[ed] the substanc e of the investment and its treatment”, whereas the shuttering dispute “foc use[d] on the proc edure ( i.e. , the forum) for dec iding the expropriation c laim” and was limited to “whether an existing international forum for 


 hearing the underlying c laim was improperly denied to [the defendants]”. 

 (b) The expropriation dispute was “governed by both domestic and international law”, whereas the shuttering dispute was “governed wholly by treaty and international law” – in partic ular “c ustomary international law and the Treaty and Protoc ol”. 

 (c ) The proper remedy for the shuttering dispute would be “an international arbitral forum to hear and dec ide the expropriation dispute”, whereas the proper remedy for the expropriation dispute would be monetary c ompensation. 

 (d) If a lis pendens analysis were employed “by analogy”, the two disputes would be c onsidered distinc t bec ause they did not “involve the same c ause of ac tion or the same relief, when properly analysed and limited”. 

107    The majority ac knowledged (at [7.204]) that determining the shuttering dispute would be a “nec essary prerequisite for dec iding the underlying [expropriation] dispute”, but this did not mean that they were “the same dispute”. 

**_The Dissenting Opinion_** 

108    Justic e Nienaber strongly disagreed with the majority’s c onc lusions. He thought that the “true dispute” was the expropriation dispute, whic h was beyond the Tribunal’s jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_. 

109    Justic e Nienaber seemed to ac c ept that there was a c onc eptual differenc e between the two disputes – in his words, the shuttering dispute did not deal “with any partic ular aspec t of the merits of the real dispute between the parties about the expropriation of the mining leases” but c onc erned “an entirely c ollateral proc edural matter relating to the judic ial means of resolving the merits of the real dispute” (Dissenting Opinion at [2.28]). Unlike the expropriation dispute, it had nothing to do with “the substantive dispute between the parties about the fall-out following the expropriation of the mining leases”, but had “everything to do with the interferenc e with the judic ial proc ess of determining that dispute” (at [2.29]). 

110    However, he took the view that this c onc eptual differenc e did not suffic e. In order to qualify as a distinc t dispute, the shuttering dispute must be a “disc rete”, “c omplete” and “self-c ontained” dispute “severable from, and whic h superseded” the expropriation dispute in order to be within the Tribunal’s jurisdic tion (at [2.21]). The two must be “wholly detac hed” (at [2.30]). In Justic e Nienaber’s view, the c orrec t test was “whether, judged on its own and without referenc e to the c laim for c ompensation for loss of the mining rights, [the shuttering dispute] would c onstitute a viable c ause of ac tion” (at [2.21]). In his judgment, the shuttering dispute failed this test. It was “inc hoate” and c ould not itself “give rise to a viable c ause of ac tion”, bec ause it c ould not be c onc eptualised without referenc e to the expropriation dispute (at [2.27] and [2.29]). 

111    Justic e Nienaber saw the shuttering dispute as simply a means to the defendants’ end of obtaining c ompensation in the expropriation dispute, and henc e “part and parc el of one broad dispute relating to the loss of the mining rights”. It was only an “additional step in the c ontinuing proc ess of implementing and enforc ing the [defendants’] true c ause of ac tion for c ompensation for the loss of the mining rights”, and it would be wrong to “elevate” that one step into a dispute in its own right, thereby c irc umventing the _ratione temporis_ limitation whic h rendered the expropriation dispute beyond the PCA Tribunal’s jurisdic tion (at [2.23]). The shuttering dispute was “ac c essory” to the expropriation dispute and “an attribute of the substantive right to the promised performanc e”. Thus, rather than establishing a new jurisdic tion where none existed over the expropriation dispute, the 


shuttering dispute must share the other’s “jurisdic tional fate” (at [2.39]–[2.40]). 

112    Indeed, the remedy adopted by the majority ( _ie_ , the c onstitution of a new arbitral tribunal to determine the expropriation dispute) exemplified the “inesc apable nexus between the c losing down of the SADC Tribunal and the earlier c omplaint about the loss of the mining leases” (at [2.22]). The proper remedy to the shuttering dispute, then, would have been a “dec laratory order” as to the illegality of shuttering the SADC Tribunal, but suc h an order would have had little prac tic al benefit for the defendants (at [2.27]). I note that Justic e Nienaber did not address any c ases in his analysis of this issue. 

**_Parties’ submissions_** 

113    The defendants did not maintain the position that they had adopted in the arbitral proc eedings that an arbitral tribunal was required to ac c ept a c laimant’s c harac terisation of the dispute. They strove to defend the majority’s reasoning, emphasising the differenc es between the expropriation dispute and the shuttering dispute (see [106] above). They also pointed out another differenc e, _viz_ , that all nine defendants had been party to the expropriation dispute whereas only the sec ond to fourth defendants (Mr Van Zyl, the JVZF Trust and the Burmilla Trust) had been found c apable of pursuing the shuttering dispute. The defendants submitted that the remedy ordered by the majority ( _ie_ , the c onstitution of a new tribunal to hear the expropriation dispute) further “demonstrate[d] the essential differenc e” between the expropriation dispute and the shuttering dispute. 

114    The defendants referred to Zac hary Douglas, _The International Law of Investment Claims_ (Cambridge University Press, 2009) (“ _Douglas_ ”) at p 341, whic h states that a tribunal is entitled to “take into ac c ount fac ts relating to the c laim but oc c urring prior to the tribunal’s jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_ provided that those fac ts are not relied upon as c onstituent elements of the breac h of the obligation forming the basis of the c laim”. They also referred to various passages from the three c ases that the PCA Tribunal had relied on ( _Mondev v USA_ , _Chevron v Ecuador_ and _ATA v Jordan_ ) (see [106] above). I examine these c ases in detail below. The defendants argued that these c ases were analogous to the present c ase and supported their view that the shuttering dispute was distinc t from the expropriation dispute. 

115    The defendants also referred to _Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v Arab Republic of Egypt_ , ICSID Case No ARB/04/13, Dec ision on Jurisdic tion, 16 June 2006 (“ _Jan de Nul v Egypt_ ”), whic h was c ited with approval in _MCI Power Group LC and New Turbine, Inc v Republic of Ecuador_ , ICSID Case No ARB/03/6, Award, 31 July 2007 (“ _MCI Power Group_ ”). The tribunal in _MCI Power Group_ distinguished disputes arising prior to the entry into forc e of the BIT from “disputes arising after that date that have the same c ause or bac kground with those prior disputes”. It also observed that “a prior dispute may evolve into a new dispute”, although “disputes that c ontinue after the entry into forc e of the BIT are not c overed by the BIT”. Disputes that “arose or bec ame evident after the entry into forc e of the BIT” were within the tribunal’s jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_ “independently of whether they had a c ausal link with, or served as the basis of, allegations c onc erning ac ts or disputes prior to the entry into forc e of the BIT” ( _MCI Power Group_ at [65]–[66] and [190]). 

116    The Kingdom, on the other hand, maintained that this c harac terisation was an “artific e”. The PCA Tribunal (and now the c ourt) need not unquestioningly ac c ept the defendants’ c harac terisation of the nature of the dispute, whic h was to be objec tively determined. The c ases of _Mondev v USA_ , _Chevron v Ecuador_ and _ATA v Jordan_ were distinguishable and had no applic ation to the fac ts at hand. The test that should be applied in determining the true dispute was that stated by the ICSID tribunal in _Empresas Lucchetti, S.A. and Lucchetti Peru, S.A. v Republic of Peru_ , ICSID Case No 


ARB/03/04, Award, 7 February 2005 (“ _Lucchetti v Peru_ ”) at [50] (approved in _ATA v Jordan_ at [102]), whic h I reproduc e at [126] below. 

117    The Kingdom also referred to _Chagos Marine Protected Area Arbitration (Mauritius v United Kingdom)_ , PCA Case No 2011-03, Award, 18 Marc h 2015 (“ _Chagos Marine_ ”), in whic h the tribunal asked itself at [211] and [220] “where the relative weight of the dispute” lay, what the dispute “primarily c onc ern[ed]” and what the “true objec t of the c laim” and the “relief sought” were. The Kingdom c ritic ised the majority for having failed to have regard to any of these tests. In this regard, the Kingdom identified various portions of the defendants’ pleadings in the arbitration referring to the expropriation dispute and inviting the PCA Tribunal to assume the role of the SADC Tribunal and order c ompensation for expropriation of the Mining Leases. 

118    Applying these tests, the Kingdom submitted that the “real, and long-standing, dispute” was really about the “validity and performanc e of the [M]ining [L]eases and whether the [d]efendants are entitled to c ompensation with respec t to the alleged mistreatment of those [M]ining [L]eases between 1993 and 2000”. This dispute had arisen prior to 16 April 2010, the effec tive date of the Investment Protoc ol and by nec essary implic ation, Annex 1, and was therefore outside the PCA Tribunal’s jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_. 

**_My analysis_** 

119    I agree with the Kingdom that I should not simply ac c ept the defendants’ c harac terisation of the subjec t of the dispute, but should determine this on an objec tive basis. This position has been adopted in the ICJ (see, _eg_ , _Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v Canada) (Jurisdiction)_ [1998] ICJ 432 (“ _Fisheries Jurisdiction_ ”) at [30]–[31]) and followed by the PCA ( _Chagos Marine_ (see [117] above) at [208] and [211]). While these prec edents are not binding on Singapore c ourts, they are persuasive and I agree with the approac h therein (in this respec t) in princ iple. An arbitral tribunal must be entitled to look beyond what one party says or alleges in determining its own jurisdic tion, as the PCA Tribunal was empowered to do pursuant to Art 23(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010. The same applies to a c ourt, whic h would otherwise be unable to effec tively review the tribunal’s jurisdic tion _de novo_. This is a matter of c ommon sense and logic. Having said that, having regard to the relevant material – inc luding the parties’ c ases in the arbitration, their submissions in OS 492, the relief sought and the c ases c ited to me – I ac c ept the defendants’ position that the true dispute before the PCA Tribunal was the shuttering dispute, whic h arose after the entry into forc e of Annex 

1\. The shuttering dispute is within the PCA Tribunal’s jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_. 

_Past arbitral decisions_ 

120    Artic le 28(4) of Annex 1 is at the heart of the issue of whether the dispute is within jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_. The interpretation of Art 28(4) of Annex 1 should be guided by “the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their c ontext and in the light of its objec t and purpose”, whic h are to be asc ertained with referenc e to the provisions of the SADC Treaty, the Investment Protoc ol and Annex 1 (Art 31(2) of the VCLT, see [93] above). However, the key terms of Art 28(4) (“dispute” and “arose”) are not defined in any of these instruments, whose stated objec tives are also c rafted too generally to be determinative of the question whether the shuttering dispute should be understood as distinc t from the expropriation dispute. I also did not have the advantage of perusing the relevant _travaux préparatoires_. The parties’ submissions relied largely on awards by other arbitral tribunals analysing the question of whether the dispute submitted for arbitration was one whic h, properly c harac terised, had arisen before an investment treaty’s entry into forc e. Insofar as the treaties under c onsideration use the same terms as Art 28(4) of Annex 1, these awards shed some light on the ordinary meaning of Art 28(4) of Annex 1. I turn to them now. I will set 


out the fac ts and findings of _Lucchetti v Peru_ , _Mondev v USA_ , _Chevron v Ecuador_ , _ATA v Jordan_ and _Jan de Nul and Egypt_ , before distilling – not without some diffic ulty, I should add – the princ iples to apply in this c ase. 

(1) _Lucchetti v Peru_ 

1       2 1 _Lucchetti v Peru_ is often c ited for its c onsideration of the question of when a dispute c an be c onsidered distinc t from an earlier dispute arising before the treaty’s entry into forc e. The c laimants were a Chilean pasta produc er and a c ompany established to supply loc al and export markets in Peru. They c onstruc ted a plant, for whic h they c laimed they had obtained all nec essary authorisations and permits, near a protec ted wetland known as “Pantanos de Villa”. Nevertheless, from 1997 to 1998, the Munic ipality of the Lima Provinc e (“the Munic ipality of Lima”) annulled these permits, referring to environmental problems and supposed defic ienc ies relating to the granting of the permits. It also issued a stop work notic e to the c laimants. In response, the c laimants c ommenc ed proc eedings in January 1998 against the Munic ipality of Lima and other loc al authorities. The proc eedings c ulminated in four c ourt judgments from January to May 1998 in the c laimants’ favour whic h went unc hallenged. Another c ourt judgment in September 1998 ordered the Munic ipality of Lima to authorise the c onstruc tion of the c laimants’ plant. In Dec ember 1998, the Munic ipality of Chorrillos – a distric t within the Lima Provinc e – issued a c onstruc tion lic enc e and an operating lic enc e to the c laimants. 

122    On 16 August 2001, the Counc il of the Munic ipality of Lima promulgated Dec rees 258 and 259. Dec ree 258 c harged the Mayor of Lima to present to the Peruvian legislature proposals for the legislative expropriation of all areas nec essary for the preservation, maintenanc e and protec tion of the Ec ologic al Reserve of Pantanos de Villa. Dec ree 259 spec ific ally revoked the sec ond c laimant’s operating lic enc e, purportedly in response to the industrial plant’s environmental impac t on Pantanos de Villa. 

123    The c laimants c ommenc ed ICSID arbitral proc eedings against Peru for breac h of its obligations under the BIT between the Republic of Peru and the Republic of Chile (2 February 2000) (entered into forc e 3 August 2001) (“the Peru–Chile BIT”), alleging that Dec rees 258 and 259 and subsequent ac ts had c aused enormous losses to their investment and violated their rights. Artic le 2 of the Peru–Chile BIT stated: 

 This Treaty shall apply to investments made before or after its entry into forc e by investors of one Contrac ting Party, in ac c ordanc e with the legal provisions of the other Contrac ting Party and in the latter’s territory. It shall not, however, apply to differences or disputes that arose prior to its entry into force. 

 [emphasis added] 

124    Peru disputed the tribunal’s jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_ on the basis that the Peru–Chile BIT did not apply to disputes pre-dating its entry into forc e on 3 August 2001, whereas the dispute between the c laimants and the Peruvian authorities began in 1997–1998. The subjec t-matter of that dispute was the same as in 2001 when Dec rees 258 and 259 were adopted, and the c onflic t between the c laimants and the Peruvian authorities during that entire period of time amounted to an interrelated series of events together c omprising a single dispute. The c laimants c ounter-argued that the dispute really related to Dec rees 258 and 259, whic h were only issued in 2001. The ac ts of the Peruvian authorities in 1997–1998 had been definitively resolved by the c ourt judgments in 1998. 

125    The tribunal held that it had no jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_. First, it gave the following analysis of the term “dispute” at [48], c iting from past dec isions of the ICJ: 


 ... [A]s a legal c onc ept, the term dispute has an ac c epted meaning. It has been authoritatively defined as a [ sic ] “a disagreement on a point of law or fac t, a c onflic t of legal views or of interests between two persons,” or as a “situation in whic h two sides hold c learly opposite views c onc erning the question of the performanc e or non-performanc e” of a legal obligation. In short, a dispute c an be held to exist when the parties assert c learly c onflic ting legal or fac tual c laims bearing on their respec tive rights or obligations or that “the c laim of one party is positively opposed by the other.” 

126    It went on to say at [50]: 

 ... The Tribunal must therefore now c onsider whether, in light of other here relevant fac tors, the present dispute is or is not a new dispute. In addressing that issue, the Tribunal must examine the fac ts that gave rise to the [present] dispute and those that c ulminated in the [previous] dispute, seeking to determine in eac h instanc e whether and to what extent the subject matter or facts that were the real cause of the disputes differ from or are identical to the other. Ac c ording to a rec ent ICSID c ase, the c ritic al element in determining the existenc e of one or two separate disputes is whether or not they concern the same subject matter. The Tribunal c onsiders that, whether the foc us is on the “real c auses” of the dispute or on its “subjec t matter,” it will in eac h instanc e have to determine whether or not the fac ts or c onsiderations that gave rise to the earlier dispute c ontinued to be c entral to the later dispute. 

 [emphasis added] 

127    The tribunal observed (at [51]–[52]) that the preamble to Dec ree 259 “related” it “direc tly to the measures the munic ipal authorities took in 1998” to forc e the c laimants to c omply with regulatory requirements, and “foc use[d] on the failure of the munic ipal authorities to ac hieve their objec tive bec ause of the judgments entered in the [c ]laimants’ favour in 1998”. It thus found (at [53]) that the “reasons for the adoption of Dec ree 259 were thus direc tly related to the c onsiderations that gave rise to the 1997/98 dispute”, _viz_ , the Munic ipality of Lima’s c ommitment to protec t the environmental integrity of Pantanos de Villa and its repeated efforts to c ompel the c laimants to c omply with applic able rules and regulations. The two disputes had the “same origin or sourc e”, namely, the Munic ipality of Lima’s “desire to ensure that its environmental polic ies are c omplied with and the [c ]laimants’ efforts to bloc k their applic ation to the c onstruc tion and produc tion of the pasta fac tory”. They were thus one dispute whic h had “c rystallized by 1998” and was “c ontinued” by the adoption of Dec rees 258 and 259 (at [53]). Indeed, the Munic ipality of Lima “never c onsidered” that its dispute with the c laimants had ended with the judgments in 1998, and “adopted Dec rees 258 and 259 as soon as it c onc luded” that it c ould “reassert its earlier position” notwithstanding those judgments (at [56]). 

128    It is not c lear whether the tribunal in _Lucchetti v Peru_ was invoking at [50] one test or multiple tests for the distinc tness of the dispute. John P Gaffney notes in his c ommentary, “The Jurisdic tion _Ratione Temporis_ of ICSID Tribunals” (2007) 22(7) MEALEY’S International Arbitration Report 1 at p 8 that: 

 In Lucchetti the tribunal “appeared to regard as synonymous the “real c auses” and the “subjec t matter” of the dispute ... while later on it also c onsidered whether the two disputes at issue had the same “origin or sourc e”. In the author’s view, it is open to doubt whether these terms have the same meaning. For example, the Conc ise Oxford Dic tionary defines: “subjec t matter” as “the matter treated of in a ... lawsuit”; “c ause” as “that ... whic h gives rise to an ac tion”; and “origin” as “a beginning or starting-point.” 


12     9 _McLachlan_ also observes at para 6.69 that the tribunal’s foc us on subjec t-matter “runs c ounter” to the approac h adopted by other tribunals whic h, in c onsidering the meaning of “dispute”, have typic ally foc used “on the parties and the c ause of ac tion rather than the subjec t-matter”, _ie_ , a _lis pendens_ -type analysis. 

130    I agree with these remarks. It would seem that the c ause-of-ac tion approac h is a better way of asc ertaining the real dispute than the subjec t-matter approac h. Taking the former approac h would c learly differentiate the fac ts that are _background to the dispute_ from the fac ts that are _core to the claim_. Apart from providing a general sense of what the subjec t matter of the dispute was, I do not c onsider that the subjec t-matter approac h assists one in drawing this distinc tion, whic h I c onsider to be important. I note, moreover, that the _Lucchetti v Peru_ tribunal (at [50]) based its c riterion of “subjec t matter” on an earlier ICSID dec ision, _CMS Gas Transmission Company v Republic of Argentina_ , ICSID Case No ARB/01/8, Dec ision of the Tribunal on Objec tions to Jurisdic tion, 17 July 2003, whic h made the remark in quite a different c ontext. There, the Republic of Argentina c ritic ised the c laimant for having submitted two distinc t disputes, arising from different measures employed by the State, in the same arbitration. In the c laimant’s defenc e, the tribunal observed (at [109]) that “[a]s long as [the measures] affec t the investor in violation of its rights and c over the same subjec t matter, the fac t that they may originate from different sourc es or emerge at different times does not nec essarily mean that the disputes are separate and distinc t”. Given the differenc e in c ontext, the above remarks and the ambiguity of the phrase “subjec t matter”, I do not find the phrase in _Lucchetti v Peru_ partic ularly helpful as a test of distinc tness, at least for present purposes. 

(2) _Mondev v USA_ 

131    This was an ICSID arbitration c ommenc ed by Mondev International Ltd (“Mondev”) against the c ity of Boston and the Boston Redevelopment Authority (“the BRA”) c onc erning a dec ision by the Massac husetts Supreme Judic ial Court (“the MSJC”). For reasons that will bec ome apparent, I did not find _Mondev v USA_ instruc tive for present purposes. 

132    In 1978, Boston and the BRA entered into a tripartite agreement with Lafayette Plac e Assoc iates (“Lafayette”), a limited partnership owned by Mondev, for the c onstruc tion of a department store, retail mall and hotel in a dilapidated area of the c ity. Lafayette subsequently c laimed that the c ity of Boston and the BRA had breac hed their c ontrac tual obligations and sued them in 1992. The trial judge ruled on 17 August 1995 that the c ity and the BRA had breac hed the tripartite agreement, but that the BRA enjoyed statutory immunity from suit for intentional torts. On appeal, on 20 May 1998, the MSJC affirmed the trial judge’s dec ision regarding the BRA and upheld Boston’s appeal against its liability for the c ontrac tual c laim. Lafayette thus lost its c laims against both entities. After Lafayette’s petition for rehearing before the MSJC and its applic ation for _certiorari_ before the US Supreme Court were denied on 1 July 1998 and 1 Marc h 1999 respec tively, Mondev c ommenc ed ICSID arbitral proc eedings in 1999 pursuant to Art 1116 of the North Americ an Free Trade Agreement (17 Dec ember 1992) 32 ILM 289 (entered into forc e 1 January 1994) (“the NAF TA”) for loss and damage c aused to its interests in Lafayette. Mondev c laimed that the US had breac hed various NAFTA obligations due to the MSJC’s dec ision and the ac ts of the c ity of Boston and the BRA. 

133    The US c hallenged the ICSID tribunal’s jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_ on the basis that the c ontrac tual dispute had arisen from 1985 to 1991, whic h was well before the NAF TA entered into forc e in 1994. Mondev c ounter-argued that the c ontrac tual breac hes were not perfec ted until the US c ourts dealt with Lafayette’s c laims under domestic law. The pre-1994 c onduc t of Boston and the BRA was wrongful both in terms of the international minimum standard and Massac husetts law, and this c reated _a continuing situation_ whic h the US was obliged to remedy under Artic le 1105 of the NAFTA. The US’ failure to remedy this situation after 1994 c onstituted a breac h of the NAFTA. 


134    The ICSID tribunal took the view that the NAF TA lac ked retrospec tive effec t. It thus followed that c onduc t oc c urring before 1994 c ould not itself c onstitute a breac h of the NAF TA. That said, it was possible for an ac t “of a c ontinuing c harac ter”, initially c ommitted before the NAF TA entered into forc e, to c onstitute a breac h of NAF TA obligations following the NAF TA’s entry into forc e. Suc h an ac t must be distinguished from “an ac t, already c ompleted, whic h c ontinues to c ause loss or damage” (at [58]). On the fac ts, the tribunal found that there was no c ontinuing wrongful ac t at the date of the NAF TA’s entry into forc e. But this did not mean that events prior to the NAF TA’s entry into forc e were wholly irrelevant. The tribunal stated at [70]: 

 ... [ E]vents or conduct prior to the entry into force of an obligation for the respondent State may be relevant in determining whether the State has subsequently committed a breach of the obligation. But it must still be possible to point to c onduc t of the State after that date whic h is itself a breac h. In the present case the only conduct which could possibly constitute a breach of any provision of Chapter 11 is that comprised by the decisions of the [MSJC] and the Supreme Court of the United States, which between them put an end to LPA’s claims under Massachusetts law. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

135    The tribunal thus ac c epted that it was possible for the _post-1994 conduct_ of the US c ourts in dealing with Lafayette’s c laims under Massac husetts law, seen in the c ontext of the fac tual dispute out of whic h those c laims arose, to c onstitute breac h of the US’ NAF TA obligations. The c ourts’ c onduc t was within the tribunal’s jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_ , even though this c onduc t c omprised judgments in respec t of alleged breac hes by the BRA and the c ity of Boston c ommitted _prior to 1994_ ( _ie_ , the substantive dispute oc c urred before 1994). 

136    The defendants argued that _Mondev v USA_ (as well as _ATA v Jordan_ and _Chevron v Ecuador_ , whic h I shall deal with later) were analogous to the present fac ts in that the defendants’ “sec ondary rights had ac c rued before the relevant treaty c ame into forc e, but were adversely affec ted after the relevant treaty c ame into forc e”. 

137    I did not find _Mondev v USA_ helpful or relevant here. As the Kingdom pointed out, unlike Art 28(4) of Annex 1, there was no NAF TA provision exc luding jurisdic tion over pre-existing disputes. In _Mondev v USA_ , the question before the tribunal was not whether the _dispute_ had arisen after the NAF TA’s entry into forc e, but rather whether the ac ts alleged to have breac hed the NAF TA ( _ie_ , the _breach_ ) had oc c urred after the NAF TA’s entry into forc e. This explains the tribunal’s remarks (see [134] above). Artic les 1116(1)(a) and 1117(1)(a) of the NAF TA, read in light of the general princ iple of non-retroac tivity, only c onfer jurisdic tion over breac hes of spec ified obligations arising after the NAF TA entered into forc e. To put it simply, the treaty provisions in _Mondev v USA_ were different from those in the present c ase_._ The ICSID tribunal did not undertake any analysis of whether the _dispute_ c ould be said to have arisen after that date. It might be reasonably argued that if the dispute had been the defining term in the treaty, the tribunal would have c ome to the same c onc lusion as in _Lucchetti v Peru._ I will therefore say no more about _Mondev v USA_. 

(3) _Chevron v Ecuador_ 

138    In 1964, the Government of Ec uador granted oil exploration and produc tion rights in the Amazon region to Texac o Petroleum Company (“TexPet”) through a c onc ession c ontrac t with TexPet’s loc al subsidiary. This c ontrac t was superseded by a new c onc ession c ontrac t in August 1973 and a supplemental agreement in Dec ember 1977. The agreements entitled TexPet to explore and exploit oil reserves in regions of Ec uador, and required TexPet to provide a perc entage of its c rude oil 


produc tion to the Government to meet Ec uadorian domestic c onsumption needs. The Government of Ec uador was entitled to set the pric e at whic h it would purc hase the oil from TexPet for Ec uadorian domestic c onsumption needs, referred to as the “domestic market pric e”. The Government also had the right to purc hase additional oil in exc ess of the amount required for domestic c onsumption at international market pric es. After fulfilling its obligations to the Government, TexPet was free to export the remainder of its oil at prevailing international market pric es, whic h were always substantially higher than the domestic market pric e. 

139    Between 1991 and 1993, TexPet filed seven breac h of c ontrac t c laims against the Government of Ec uador in the Ec uadorian c ourts, c laiming over US$553m in damages. These were for Ec uador’s purported breac hes of the 1973 and 1977 c ontrac ts and related violations of Ec uadorian law. Essentially, Ec uador had overstated the domestic demand for oil and purc hased oil from TexPet, whic h was not meant for domestic c onsumption, at domestic market rates instead of international market rates. 

140    TexPet alleged that six of its seven c ases had been left pending in Ec uadorian c ourts for over 10 years without dec ision. TexPet c laimed that these c ases had been ready for dec ision under Ec uadorian law sinc e 1998 but the c ourts refused to rule. In the seventh c ase, the c ourts allegedly refused to take evidenc e from the appointed experts for over 14 years. Ec uador disputed this, asserting that TexPet’s c laims were legally c omplex and that it was far from c lear that the c laims were even made out. After TexPet served notic e of its intention to file the arbitration in May 2006, three of TexPet’s c laims were dismissed by the Ec uadorian c ourts in 2006 and 2007. A fourth was determined in TexPet’s favour. 

141    The c laimants argued that there had been undue delay in dec iding TexPet’s seven c ases, and that the three dismissals were “grossly inc ompetent, biased and manifestly unjust” dec isions made in “manifest disregard of c lear princ iples of Ec uadorian law”. Ec uador’s c onduc t purportedly gave rise to two c laims: a denial of justic e c laim under c ustomary international law, and a violation of Ec uador’s obligations to TexPet under the Treaty Between the Government of the United States of Americ a and the Government of the Republic of Ec uador for the Enc ouragement and Rec iproc al Protec tion of Investment (27 August 1993) (entered into forc e 11 May 1997) (“the US–Ec uador BIT”). 

142    Ec uador submitted that the tribunal lac ked jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_. Although the US– Ec uador BIT did not explic itly bar disputes whic h arose prior to its entry into forc e, Ec uador submitted that this must be the c ase given the princ iple of non-retroac tivity enshrined in Art 28 of the VCLT. Ec uador referred to _Lucchetti v Peru_ at [50] (see [126] above). It also c ited _Sociedad Anónima Eduardo Vieira v Chile_ , ICSID Case No ARB/04/7, Award, 21 August 2007 (“ _Vieira v Chile_ ”) at [72]– [76] for the proposition that ac ts oc c urring after the BIT’s entry into forc e would not c reate a new dispute if the ac ts were “‘sec ondary’ in importanc e or c entrality to the overall dispute when c ompared with the preBIT ac ts”. It pointed out that TexPet’s c laims in the Ec uadorian c ourts were the sourc e of the dispute and that Ec uador’s ac ts after the BIT’s entry into forc e were merely ac c essory to the denial of justic e c laim. The dispute had thus c rystallised prior to the BIT’s entry into forc e. 

143    The c laimants c ounter-argued that there was no need for the dispute to arise only after the BIT’s entry into forc e, as long as the _investment_ existed “at the time of entry into forc e [or was] made or ac quired thereafter” (Art XII(1) of the US–Ec uador BIT). The c laimants distinguished _Lucchetti v Peru_ and _Vieira v Chile_ as having been based on spec ific treaty language absent from the US–Ec uador BIT. Notably, the BIT in _Lucchetti v Peru_ c ontained a c lause barring its applic ation to pre-existing disputes. The c laimants argued that, in any event, their c laims would pass the _Lucchetti v Peru_ test bec ause their denial of justic e c laim c entred around ac ts and omissions of Ec uadorian c ourts and politic al branc hes c ommitted after the BIT’s entry into forc e. While the underlying lawsuits 


provided the “fac tual basis” for the BIT violations, Ec uador’s liability for denial of justic e c ould be determined without referenc e to the substantive merits of the nine lawsuits. 

144    The tribunal observed that the US–Ec uador BIT made an exc eption to the princ iple of nonretroac tivity enshrined in Art 28 of the VCLT. Artic le XII of the BIT stated that it would apply as long as there were “investments _existing_ at the time of entry into forc e” [emphasis added]. There was no requirement for the dispute to arise after its entry into forc e, unlike the BITs in _Lucchetti v Peru_ and _Vieira v Chile_ , whic h were henc e distinguishable (at [266]). In this c ase, there was indeed an existing investment at the time of entry into forc e, and this suffic ed for jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_ (at [264]). In any event, the tribunal found that a distinc t dispute had arisen after the BIT’s entry into forc e. Separate from and subsequent to the disputes relating to Ec uador’s breac hes of the 1973 and 1977 agreements, the c laimants had alleged ac tions (or inac tion) of the Ec uadorian c ourts whic h had c rystallised into a new dispute over a denial of justic e. A “c ustomary international law c laim for denial of justic e was a fundamentally different c laim than a domestic law c laim for breac h of c ontrac t” (at [269]). This new dispute thus only arose after the entry into forc e of the BIT. 

145    The tribunal (at [283]) also affirmed the princ iple artic ulated in _Mondev v USA_ at [70] (see the first italic ised proposition in the extrac t quoted at [134] above). In this c ase, a finding of denial of justic e c ould well require taking into ac c ount pre-BIT ac ts (at [284]). 

146    The defendants in OS 492 c ompared _Chevron v Ecuador_ to the fac ts of the present c ase, and c ited _Chevron v Ecuador_ at [283]: 

 ... [A]s the Claimants have argued, this does not mean that a breac h must be based solely on ac ts oc c urring after the entry into forc e of the BIT. The meaning attributed to the ac ts or fac ts post-dating the entry into forc e may be informed by ac ts or fac ts pre-dating the BIT; that c onduc t may be c onsidered in determining whether a violation of BIT standards has oc c urred after the date of entry into forc e. ... 

147    The Kingdom argued against relying on _Chevron v Ecuador_ for the following reasons: 

 (a) There, as in Mondev v USA , the tribunal’s jurisdic tion was not limited to disputes arising after the BIT’s entry into forc e, so the tribunal only c onsidered this objec tion “briefly” ( Chevron v Ecuador at [264]–[265]). 

 (b) The tribunal’s view that a separate dispute over denial of justic e had c rystallised after the BIT’s entry into forc e was based on its prior finding that “a c ustomary international law c laim for denial of justic e is a fundamentally different c laim than a domestic c laim for breac h of c ontrac t”. In the present c ase, however, the defendants had to distinguish an international law c laim for denial of justic e ( ie , the shuttering dispute) from an international law c laim for expropriation of the Mining Leases ( ie , the expropriation dispute). 

 (c ) The tribunal’s remarks at [283] and [284], inc luding its approval of Mondev v USA at [70], were made in the c ontext of the objec tion that the acts alleged to c onstitute a breac h of BIT obligations had oc c urred prior to the BIT’s entry into forc e, and had nothing to do with when the dispute had arisen. 

148    I found _Chevron v Ecuador_ of some but limited relevanc e for the reasons c ited by the Kingdom at [147(a)] and [147(c )]. As with _Mondev v USA_ , the US–Ec uador BIT applied as long as there were investments existing at the time of entry into forc e. The issue of when the dispute arose was, stric tly speaking, irrelevant to the question of the tribunal’s jurisdic tion. Perhaps for this reason, the tribunal’s 


analysis of the nature of the dispute was fairly c ursory. Nevertheless, I agree with the tribunal’s c onc lusion that a distinc t dispute had arisen after the entry into forc e of the BIT. The c onduc t of the Ec uadorian c ourts in purportedly delaying or denying justic e to the c laimants was itself a potential breac h of international law obligations, independent of the c ourts’ dec ision on the merits of the underlying c ontrac tual dispute. 

(4) _ATA v Jordan_ 

149    ATA Construc tion, Industrial and Trading Company (“ATA”), a Turkish c ompany, was engaged by Arab Potash Company (“APC”), a Jordanian entity, to c onstruc t a dike at a site on the Dead Sea pursuant to a c ontrac t entered into on 2 May 1998. Upon c ompletion, the dike was handed over to APC, whic h proc eeded to fill it with water, whereupon a sec tion of the dike c ollapsed. A dispute arose as to whether the c ollapse was the fault of ATA or APC. APC c ommenc ed arbitral proc eedings against ATA before a Fédération Internationale des IngénieursConseils (“FIDIC”) tribunal in ac c ordanc e with c l 67 of the c ontrac t. The FIDIC tribunal issued a Final Award on 30 September 2003 exonerating ATA from any liability for the c ollapse, and dismissing all of APC’s c laims. It partly upheld ATA’s c ounterc laim and awarded it c ompensation of US$5,906,828.30. 

150    On 29 Oc tober 2003, APC applied to the Amman Court of Appeal to have the Final Award annulled under the Jordanian Arbitration Law. The Amman Court of Appeal annulled the Final Award, princ ipally on the basis that the FIDIC Tribunal had erred in law, and also “dismiss[ed] the arbitration agreement c onc luded between the parties to the ac tion” by its judgment on 24 January 2006. This was pursuant to Art 51 of the 2001 Jordanian Arbitration Law, whic h stated: 

 ... If ... the c ourt dec ides the nullity of the award, its dec ision is subjec t to c hallenge before the Court of Cassation within thirty days following the date of notifying that dec ision. The final decision nullifying the award results in extinguishing the arbitration agreement. 

 [emphasis added] 

151    ATA appealed to the Jordanian Court of Cassation, whic h upheld the Amman Court of Appeal’s judgment on 16 January 2007. Although the Court of Cassation was able to exempt ATA from the operation of Art 51 of the 2001 Jordanian Arbitration Law whic h presc ribed the extinguishing of the arbitration agreement, it did not do so. This was ultimately an issue of c ritic al importanc e. 

152    On 14 January 2008, ATA requested an ICSID arbitration pursuant to the Agreement between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the Republic of Turkey Conc erning the Rec iproc al Promotion and Protec tion of Investment (2 August 1993) (entered into forc e 23 January 2006) (“the Jordan–Turkey BIT”), _which entered into force the day before the Amman Court of Appeal delivered judgment_. The alleged violations of the Jordan–Turkey BIT inc luded the unlawful expropriation of ATA’s c laims to money and rights to legitimate performanc e under the c ontrac t and the Final Award, as well as the failure to ac c ord fair and equitable treatment to its investment, _inter alia_ by way of serious and repeated denial of justic e by the Jordanian c ourts. ATA also argued that the Court of Cassation judgment gave rise to a denial of justic e c laim. 

153    Jordan argued that the tribunal lac ked jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_ over ATA’s c laims, bec ause the Jordan–Turkey BIT did not apply to a dispute whic h arose before its entry into forc e. It had entered into forc e on 23 January 2006, by whic h date all the proc eedings in both the FIDIC arbitration and the annulment ac tion before the Amman Court of Appeal had been c onc luded. Only the Amman Court of Appeal’s judgment of annulment and the subsequent proc eedings in the Court of Cassation oc c urred after the BIT’s entry into forc e. Jordan submitted that ATA’s c omplaint was essentially that 


the Final Award should not have been annulled under the Jordanian Arbitration Law, whic h was the same dispute that had been presented and litigated in the Court of Appeal. The proc eedings in the Jordanian Court of Cassation were merely a c ontinuation of the c ase presented to the Court of Appeal, and ultimately a c ontinuation of the original dispute whic h began in 2000. The Court of Cassation had simply affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the basis of the same rec ord and the same substantive arguments. ATA c ounter-argued that the dispute had arisen on 16 January 2007, when the Jordanian Court of Cassation delivered the final judgment in the domestic proc eedings between ATA and APC, thereby annulling the Final Award and extinguishing the arbitration agreement c ontained in the c ontrac t. The dispute therefore arose after the BIT’s entry into forc e. It further asserted that in any event, the denial of justic e c laim c ould not exist until loc al remedies had been exhausted, and therefore the “dispute” only arose upon the Court of Cassation’s judgment. 

154    The tribunal stated that an investment was not a “single right” but c onsists of “a bundle of rights, some of whic h are inseparable from others and some of whic h are c omparatively free-standing” (at [96]). It was henc e possible for measures c onc erning “the same investment to give rise to c laims of different violations of a BIT” (at [96]), and these c laims c ould be “subjec t to different jurisdic tional objec tions” (at [97]). The tribunal thus took the view that “different types of c laims require different jurisdic tional analyses _ratione temporis_ : c onventional BIT c laims, denial of justic e c laims and extinguishment of arbitral c lause c laims” (at [97]). 

155    The tribunal ac c epted that it only had jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_ over the c laims if the dispute arose after the BIT’s entry into forc e (at [98]). It adopted the definition of “dispute” from [48] of _Lucchetti v Peru_ (see [125] above) as well as its test for the distinc tness of the dispute (see [126] above) ( _ATA v Jordan_ at [99] and [102] respec tively). 

156    The tribunal determined that ATA’s c laims in c onnec tion with the annulment of the Final Award _per se_ , as well as all c laims of denial of justic e, were inadmissible for want of jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_. The dispute giving rise to the Court of Cassation’s dec ision on 16 January 2007 was “legally equivalent to the c ontrac tual dispute whic h was initiated on 6 September 2000 when the arbitration was c ommenc ed” (at [95]) and “indistinguishable from the original dispute” (at [103]). The tribunal stated at [102] that: 

 ... Where an analysis purports to identify two distinc t disputes and the “sec ond” dispute is c omprised of the same subjec t-matter and has the same origin or sourc e (in this c ase the c ollapse of Dike No. 19) as the first dispute, Lucchetti c onc luded that the disputes are legally equivalent. This Tribunal finds the Lucchetti holding persuasive. 

157    The tribunal therefore found that the dispute over the annulment of the Final Award _per se_ (as opposed to the extinguishment of the arbitration agreement) was “indistinguishable” from the original dispute, whic h had arisen prior to the BIT’s entry into forc e (at [103]). The parties had first expressed disagreement over the validity of the Final Award in Oc tober 2003, when APC filed an ac tion in the Jordanian c ourts for its annulment (at [104]). The proc eedings whic h followed were merely a “c ontinuation over this initial differenc e of legal opinion regarding the issue of annulment” (at [104]). Charac terising the dispute as a “denial of justic e c laim” did not c hange the analysis (at [108]). 

158    The tribunal also approved, at [109], the dic tum from _Mondev v USA_ reproduc ed at [134] above. 

159    Cruc ially, however, the tribunal held that it did have jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_ over the c laim resulting from the Court of Cassation’s judgment on 16 January 2007 _insofar as that judgment_ 


_affirmed that the arbitration agreement was extinguished_. The tribunal adroitly drew a distinc tion between the dispute over the annulment of the Final Award and the dispute over the failure by the Court of Cassation to exempt the arbitration agreement from the effec t of Art 51 of the 2001 Jordanian Arbitration Law. Even after annulment of the Final Award, the arbitration agreement in the c ontrac t would have entitled ATA to initiate another arbitration, under both the Jordanian law whic h existed at the time of the c onc lusion of the c ontrac t in 1998 and under the New York Convention, to whic h both Jordan and Turkey were party. The tribunal c onsidered this right to arbitration to be a distinc t “investment” within the definition in Art I(2)(a)(ii) of the Jordan–Turkey BIT (“c laims to [...] any other rights to legitimate performanc e having financ ial value related to an investment”). This right to arbitration was not annulled by Art 51 of the new Jordanian Arbitration Law, whic h had c ome into effec t in 2001 before the BIT’s entry into forc e, but upon the judgment of the Court of Cassation, whic h c ould have exempted the c laimant from the operation of the new law but did not do so (at [117]–[118]). Henc e, this aspec t of the Court of Cassation’s judgment – oc c urring after the BIT’s entry into forc e and distinc t from the underlying investment – was a separate and distinc t dispute from the dispute c onc erning the Final Award, and fell within the tribunal’s jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_. 

160    The defendants and the Kingdom both relied on _ATA v Jordan_ to support their respec tive positions. The defendants relied on the fac tual similarity between that c ase and the present one. The Kingdom submitted that: 

 ( a ) ATA v Jordan had expressly approved the test in Lucchetti v Peru (see [126] above), a proper applic ation of whic h would lead to the c onc lusion on the present fac ts that the shuttering dispute was indistinc t from the expropriation dispute; 

 ( b ) ATA v Jordan affirmed that the applic ation of the test laid down in Lucchetti v Peru was fac t-spec ific ; 

 (c ) it c onfirmed that simply re-c harac terising a dispute whic h pre-dated the BIT as a “denial of justic e” c laim c ould not automatic ally loc ate it later in time after the BIT’s entry into forc e; and 

 (d) the tribunal’s finding that the dispute arose after the entry into forc e of the Jordan–Turkey BIT depended on its finding that the c laimants’ right to domestic arbitration c onstituted a distinc t “investment” within the terms of the BIT, whereas the defendants’ sec ondary right in the present c ase did not c onstitute suc h an “investment”. 

161    Of the c ases c ited to me, I found _ATA v Jordan_ the most instruc tive. Similar to Art 28(4) of Annex 1, the Jordan–Turkey BIT did not apply to a dispute whic h arose before its entry into forc e. The ICSID tribunal rightly drew a distinc tion between the arbitral and judic ial dec isions on the merits of the c ontrac tual dispute on one hand, and the extinguishment of the arbitration agreement on the other hand. Only the latter gave rise to a new dispute: the former was simply a c ontinuation of a preexisting dispute. 

(5) _Jan de Nul v Egypt_ 

162    Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. (“the c laimants”) entered into a c ontrac t with the Suez Canal Authority (“the SCA”) for the widening and deepening of c ertain stretc hes of the Suez Canal. The c laimants c laimed that Egypt, through the SCA, dec eived them by intentionally misrepresenting the c onditions under whic h the c ontrac t was to be performed. The SCA denied these allegations and asserted that it had not given any of the alleged guarantees. 


163    On 17 July 1993, the c laimants brought proc eedings against the SCA for breac h of c ontrac t pursuant to a dispute resolution c lause in the c ontrac t before the Administrative Court of Port Saïd, whic h transferred the c ase to the Administrative Court of Ismaïlia (“the Ismaïlia Court”). On 9 Dec ember 1995, the c laimants filed a sec ond ac tion against the SCA in the Ismaïlia Court seeking the payment of sums of money whic h the SCA had deduc ted from the amount to be paid under the c ontrac t. On 22 May 2003, the Ismaïlia Court rendered its dec ision, rejec ting the c laims for annulment of the c ontrac t in their entirety and awarding approximately a third of the amounts sought by the c laimants for deduc tions applied by the SCA. On 20 July 2003, the c laimants appealed to the High Administrative Court of Egypt. 

164    On 23 Dec ember 2003, while the appellate proc eedings were pending, the c laimants c ommenc ed ICSID arbitral proc eedings. They asserted that Egypt’s c onduc t (both with regards to the c ontrac t and the legal proc eedings) c onstituted a breac h not only of the c ontrac t and of Egyptian law, but also of obligations under two BITs between the BelgoLuxembourg Ec onomic Union and the Arab Republic of Egypt in 1977 (“the 1977 BIT”) and 2002 (“the 2002 BIT”) respec tively. The 2002 BIT replac ed the 1977 BIT when it entered into forc e on 24 May 2002. 

165    Artic le 12 of the 2002 BIT restric ted its applic ability to disputes arising after its entry into forc e on 24 May 2002. It was ac c epted that the dispute dec ided by the Ismaïlia Court had arisen well before 24 May 2002 but notably the judgment was issued after the entry into forc e of the 2002 BIT. The c laimants argued that the judgment of the Ismaïlia Court had definitively eliminated all their prospec ts of obtaining redress from the Egyptian State and gave rise to a dispute within the tribunal’s jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_. Egypt c ounter-argued that the real dispute in the c ase c onc erned the SCA’s breac hes of c ontrac t. The question was whether the dispute before the tribunal was different from the dispute dec ided by the Ismaïlia Court. 

166    The tribunal determined that it was a distinc t dispute, for the following reasons: 

 (a) The original dispute (dec ided by the Ismaïlia Court) “related to questions of c ontrac t interpretation and of Egyptian law”, while the dispute before the ICSID tribunal related to “alleged violations of the two BITs, spec ific ally of the provisions on fair and equitable treatment, on c ontinuous protec tion and sec urity, and on the obligation to promote investments” (at [117]). 

 (b) The “intervention of a new ac tor”, ie , the Ismaïlia Court, was “a dec isive fac tor” (at [128]). The c laimants’ c ase was “direc tly based on the alleged wrongdoing of the Ismaïlia Court”, and the original dispute had henc e “(re)c rystallized into a new dispute when the Ismaïlia Court rendered its dec ision” (at [128]). The BIT violations were attributable to “ac tions of the c ourt system as suc h”, rather than the ac ts of the SCA, whic h had “formed the subjec t-matter of the domestic proc eedings” (at [119]). 

 (c ) One relevant c riterion was whether “the fac ts or c onsiderations that gave rise to the earlier dispute c ontinued to be c entral to the later dispute” ( Lucchetti v Peru at [50]; c ited in Jan de Nul v Egypt at [123]). In Lucchetti v Peru , the tribunal had held that the two disputes were indistinguishable as they had both originated from the munic ipality’s c ommitment to protec t the environmental integrity of the Pantanos de Villa. The tribunal distinguished the c ase before it on the basis that different motivations underlay the SCA’s alleged wrongdoings and the ac ts of the Egyptian c ourts ( Jan de Nul v Egypt at [127]). 

 (d) The 1977 BIT existed at the time that the c laimants made their investment. This was another reason to distinguish the c ase from Lucchetti v Peru (at [131]). 


167    The tribunal rec ognised that the domestic dispute “antedated” and ultimately “led towards” the international dispute ( _Jan de Nul v Egypt_ at [119]). It also rec ognised (at [127]) that the “previous dispute” was a sourc e, if not the main sourc e, of the sec ondary dispute. Nevertheless, it found for the above reasons that the disputes were distinc t. 

168    I have reservations about the tribunal’s c onc lusion on jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_. The Ismaïlia Court had done nothing but adjudic ate the pre-existing c ontrac tual dispute between the c laimants and the State, and the fac t that it issued its dec ision after the 2002 BIT c ame into forc e c ould not have suffic ed to transform it into a new dispute. That was a matter of c oinc idenc e and fortuitous. It was not alleged, as in _Chevron v Ecuador_ , that the Ismaïlia Court had ac ted improperly or c orruptly in hearing the dispute, whic h might possibly have given rise to a new c omplaint of denial of justic e (as opposed to mere disagreement with its dec ision on the merits). Nor was it alleged, as in _ATA v Jordan_ , that the Ismaïlia Court had determined a different legal right or question distinc t from the c ontrac tual dispute. I note that the award in _Jan de Nul v Egypt_ has drawn c ritic ism for this aspec t of its reasoning (see, _eg_ , _Douglas_ at pp 338–339). Having set out the five c ases above, I now turn to my analysis. 

_Relevant considerations for determining the distinctness of the dispute_ 

169    Not every c ase in whic h the dispute is alleged to have arisen prior to the entry into forc e of the relevant treaty will raise questions about the distinc tness of two or more putative disputes. In some c ases the diffic ulty lies simply in identifying the point, along a c ontinuum of naturally progressing events, when a disagreement between the parties c rystallised into a “dispute” in the legal sense ( _cf_ [125] above). A dispute requires “suffic ient c ommunic ation between the parties for eac h to know the other’s views and oppose them” ( _Railroad Development Corporation (RDC) v Republic of Guatemala_ , ICSID Case No ARB/07/23, Sec ond Dec ision on Objec tions to Jurisdic tion, 18 May 2010 at [129]). In this regard I respec tfully agree with the remarks of the tribunal in _Emilio Agustín Maffezini v The Kingdom of Spain_ , ICSID Case No ARB/97/7, Dec ision of the Tribunal on Objec tions to Jurisdic tion, 25 January 2000 (“ _Maffezini v Spain_ ”) at [96]–[97]: 

 96 ... [T]here tends to be a natural sequenc e of events that leads to a dispute. It begins with the expression of a disagreement and the statement of a differenc e of views. In time these events ac quire a prec ise legal meaning through the formulation of legal c laims, their disc ussion and eventual rejec tion or lac k of response by the other party. The c onflic t of legal views and interests will only be present in the latter stage, even though the underlying fac ts predate them. It has also been rightly c ommented that the existenc e of the dispute presupposes a minimum of c ommunic ations between the parties, one party taking up the matter with the other, with the latter opposing the Claimant’s position direc tly or indirec tly. This sequenc e of events has to be taken into ac c ount in establishing the c ritic al date for determining when under the BIT a dispute qualifies as one c overed by the c onsent nec essary to establish ICSID’s jurisdic tion. 

 97 ... The c ritic al date will in fac t separate, not the dispute from the c laim, but the dispute from prior events that do not entail a c onflic t of legal views and interests. ... 

170    This is different from situations where there are two or more disputes that share some c ommon DNA, in the sense that some of the fac ts that are pertinent to understanding the disputes are c ommon, whic h is the situation here. The c ases – leaving _Mondev v USA_ aside – suggest some c onsiderations for the analysis of whether the dispute submitted for arbitration is to be regarded as separate and distinc t from an underlying dispute whic h arose prior to the entry into forc e of the BIT. I now set out these non-exhaustive c onsiderations, in no partic ular order. No bright line c an be drawn between them, and they only provide different perspec tives from whic h to c ontemplate where the 


real dispute lies. However, as stated earlier, a bright line that c an or should in fac t be drawn between fac ts whic h c onstitute the bac kground and the fac ts in issue whic h c onstitute the dispute. 

171    One c onsideration is whether the two disputes involve the same fac tual or legal disagreement, _ie_ , the same c onflic t of legal or fac tual views or c laims (see the definition of “dispute” in _Lucchetti v Peru_ at [155] above). One indic ator of this is whether the sec ond dispute c an be resolved without simultaneously determining the first dispute. For example, in _ATA v Jordan_ , the tribunal stated at [104]: 

 The dispute over the Final Award first c ommenc ed in Oc tober 2003 when APC filed an ac tion in the Jordanian c ourts for annulment under Artic le 49 of the Jordanian Civil Code. It was at this point that the parties first expressed disagreement over the validity of the Final Award. ... [T]he Tribunal must view the proc eedings that followed as a c ontinuation over this initial differenc e of legal opinion regarding the issue of annulment. 

172    In other words, the Court of Cassation’s judgment had two elements: (i) it affirmed the Amman Court of Appeal’s dec ision to set aside the Final Award and (ii) it extinguished the arbitration agreement by refusing to exempt it from the provisions of the new Jordanian arbitration law. The first element dec ided the dispute over the _validity of the FIDIC arbitral award_ as a matter of Jordanian arbitral law, while the sec ond engendered a dispute over the c laimant’s _right to arbitrate_ and whether its extinguishment breac hed BIT obligations. These were c learly legally distinc t questions. The former had been litigated in the Jordanian c ourts sinc e 2003 and was finally disposed of by the Court of Cassation’s dec ision, while the latter was new. The latter dispute did not affec t the determination of the former dispute. Similarly, in _Chevron v Ecuador_ , the c onflic t that had been submitted to arbitration was over the propriety of the ac ts of the Ec uadorian c ourts, rather than over Ec uador’s alleged breac hes of the 1973 and 1977 c ontrac ts. Whether the Ec uadorian c ourts had ac ted improperly had no bearing on whether Ec uador had breac hed the c ontrac ts in question. 

173    A sec ond c onsideration is whether the two disputes have the same “real c ause”. This has also been phrased as whether the fac ts and c onsiderations that gave rise to the earlier dispute c ontinue to be c entral to the later dispute, or whether the disputes have the same origin or sourc e ( _Lucchetti v Peru_ at [50] and [53], c ited with approval in _ATA v Jordan_ at [102], _Jan de Nul v Egypt_ at [123] and _Chevron v Ecuador_ at [239]). 

174    A third c onsideration is whether the two disputes target or c entre on the same c onduc t ( _Chevron v Ecuador_ at [207]). One indic ator of this is whether the ac ts of wrongdoing were c ommitted by the same entity. For example, in _ATA v Jordan_ , the arbitration agreement had been extinguished by the Court of Cassation’s judgment, whereas the original dispute c onc erned errors in the Final Award issued by the FIDIC tribunal. In _Lucchetti v Peru_ , on the other hand, Dec rees 258 and 259 were promulgated by the Munic ipality of Lima, whic h had also interfered with the c laimants’ plant in 1997–1998. I found this to be a partic ularly helpful c onsideration. 

175    It should be noted that a fourth c onsideration, the motivations underlying the two sets of ac ts, appears to have been taken into ac c ount in _Jan de Nul v Egypt_ at [127] (see [166(c )] above). However, this does not seem to be reflec ted in any of the other c ases. It seems to me that the tribunal in _Jan de Nul v Egypt_ misinterpreted _Lucchetti v Peru_. The point in _Lucchetti v Peru_ at [53] was that the measures c hallenged by the c laimants were part of a unified whole, rather than disc rete measures giving rise to distinc t disputes. The fac t that some measures had been adopted later than others did not have the effec t of transforming the underlying dispute into a fresh one. There was only ever one overarc hing dispute, about the measures as a whole. The c laimants’ c laims thus c onc erned the same set of ac ts and were beyond the _Lucchetti v Peru_ tribunal’s jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_. 


The fac t that the same motivation underlay the different measures simply c onfirmed that they were indeed part of a unified whole; it was not a c riterion for the distinc tness of the dispute _per se_. 

176    To show that the two disputes were distinc t, it c learly does not suffic e to show that the ac ts sought to be c hallenged appear to breac h treaty obligations. That does not answer the question whether the ac ts are part of a pre-existing dispute or not. Merely re-c harac terising a pre-existing c laim as a “denial of justic e” or a breac h of treaty obligations c annot serve to shift the dispute later in time after the entry into forc e of the relevant treaty: _ATA v Jordan_ at [108]; _Lucchetti v Peru_ at [59]. Otherwise, any dispute whenever oc c urring would bec ome a “new” dispute upon the entry into forc e of the treaty provisions, thus rendering ineffec tive any provision limiting the treaty’s applic ation to prospec tive disputes. For this reason I disagree with the tribunal’s analysis in _Jan de Nul v Egypt_ at [117], whic h appeared to take into c onsideration the fac t that the c ontrac tual dispute also engaged provisions of the relevant treaty. 

_Application to OS 492_ 

177    I find that the PCA Tribunal did have jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_ bec ause it dealt with the shuttering dispute, whic h was distinc t and separate from the expropriation dispute for the following reasons: 

 (a) The two disputes did not involve the same legal c onflic t. This in my view is crucial. The substantive disagreement in the expropriation dispute was whether the Kingdom’s ac ts from 1991 to 1995 c onstituted an unlawful expropriation of the Mining Leases in breac h of its treaty obligations. The substantive disagreement in the shuttering dispute was whether the Kingdom’s partic ipation in the SADC Summit’s dec ision to shutter the SADC Tribunal without providing alternative rec ourse c onstituted a breac h of the Kingdom’s treaty obligations. The shuttering dispute is ac c ordingly distinc t from the expropriation dispute. 

 (b) The two disputes did not have the same origin in a meaningful sense. The expropriation dispute provided the fac tual bac kdrop to the shuttering dispute, but the real c ause of the shuttering dispute, and the fac ts that related to the c ause of ac tion as it were, was the Kingdom’s approac h and c onduc t towards the dispute resolution proc ess and not the alleged expropriation of the Mining Leases per se. A bright line c an sensibly be drawn between the two. The shuttering of the SADC Tribunal was not an ac t of expropriation of the Mining Leases, but a disruption of the proc ess by whic h the expropriation dispute was originally meant to be resolved under the Tribunal Protoc ol. The present c ase is thus distinguishable from Lucchetti v Peru , in whic h Dec rees 258 and 259 were simply the latest in a volley of measures that the Munic ipality of Lima employed to shut down the c laimants’ plant. I note in this regard that no evidenc e was produc ed to suggest that the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal by the SADC Summit was a c ontinuation of an effort by the Kingdom to expropriate the Mining Leases and put an end to the c laims that arose as a result. Indeed, suc h an argument would seem diffic ult given that the move to shutter the SADC Tribunal was made not by the Kingdom but by Zimbabwe. 

 (c ) The two disputes involved different c onduc t, ie , different ac ts of alleged wrongdoing, by different ac tors. The ac ts of alleged expropriation of the Mining Leases ( ie , c anc ellation of the leases, the 1992 Revoc ation Order, enac tment of legislation permitting the expropriation of the leases and the determination that the Rampai lease was void ab initio ) were attributable to the Commissioner of Mines, the Military Counc il, the Kingdom’s legislature and the domestic c ourts respec tively. On the other hand, the ac ts alleged to have breac hed the defendants’ rights under the SADC Treaty and protoc ols were attributable to the head of State of Lesotho (in supporting the resolution to shutter the SADC Tribunal) and the politic al leaders of Lesotho (in failing to 


 provide an alternative forum for the adjudic ation of the SADC c laim). 

178    As noted earlier, I find _ATA v Jordan_ instruc tive. The ICSID tribunal found that the Court of Cassation’s affirmation of the annulment of the FIDIC Final Award simply amounted to a final rejec tion of ATA’s c laims (in the underlying dispute) on their merits; c harac terising the annulment as a “denial of justic e” did not make it a new dispute. By analogy, in the present c ase, if the SADC Tribunal had dismissed the SADC c laim on its merits and the defendants sought to c hallenge that dismissal, that c hallenge would be legally equivalent to the expropriation dispute itself. However, the SADC Tribunal did not have the opportunity to c onsider the SADC Claim bec ause it was shuttered, and the Kingdom did not give the defendants an alternative avenue to pursue the SADC c laim. This was analogous to the Court of Cassation’s extinguishment of the arbitration agreement in _ATA v Jordan_ , bec ause it deprived the defendants of their right to have their disputes determined by the SADC Tribunal (assuming for the moment that that right c onstituted an “investment”, whic h is an issue of c ritic al importanc e in these proc eedings for reasons stated later). It was also analogous to the c onduc t of the Ec uadorian c ourts in _Chevron v Ecuador_ , whose purported delay and/or dismissal of the c laimants’ c ontrac tual c laims for politic al reasons gave rise to a new c laim of denial of justic e, and was not simply a c ontinuation of the c laimants’ c ontrac tual dispute with Ec uador. 

179    The Kingdom emphasised that _Chevron v Ecuador_ and _ATA v Jordan_ c onc erned ac tions by domestic c ourts rather than ac ts of an international forum. However, this does not nec essarily mean that the expropriation and shuttering disputes are not distinc t. To the c ontrary, the fac t that domestic c ourts were involved buttresses the defendants’ c ase in a sense. In those c ases, the judic ial ac ts or determinations were a c ontinuation of legal proc eedings in the domestic c ourts whic h had c ommenc ed prior to the entry into forc e of the relevant BIT. In the present c ase, however, the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal (c ausing the termination of the past-heard SADC c laim) was distinc t and separate from the proc eedings in the SADC Tribunal. It was not just another stage in a longdrawn legal battle between the parties, so the argument for distinguishing it from the expropriation dispute is _even stronger_. The issues that have to be addressed in dec iding the merits of the expropriation dispute and the shuttering dispute are quite different. This is c ritic al as it speaks to the fac t that the disputes are distinc t. 

180    The Kingdom submitted that the relief sought by the defendants in the arbitration ( _ie_ , for the PCA Tribunal to “step into the shoes” of the SADC Tribunal and award damages for the Kingdom’s expropriation of the Mining Leases) suggested that the true dispute was the expropriation dispute. I agree that suc h relief would not have been appropriate, sinc e it required adjudic ation of the expropriation dispute. However, as noted above, it is the similarity of issues and not of reliefs that is more relevant. I find that the defendants’ c ase as formulated genuinely c onc erned the shuttering dispute, although the relief they requested for was perhaps inappropriate. However, as will be seen, c harac terising the dispute as the shuttering dispute c reated additional problems for the defendants in establishing the PCA Tribunal’s jurisdic tion _ratione materiae_. 

**Second objection: whether there was an “investment” – jurisdiction** **_ratione materiae_** 

181    Under Art 28(1) of Annex 1 (reproduc ed at [40] above), the dispute must c onc ern an obligation whic h relates to “an admitted investment”. It is important therefore to first identify c learly and ac c urately what in fac t is the investment c onc erning whic h it is alleged that a dispute has arisen. There is also the anc illary issue of whether suc h investment was admitted, whic h I shall address later. “Investment” is defined in Art 1(2) of Annex 1 as follows: 

 “investment” means the purc hase, ac quisition or establishment of produc tive and portfolio investment assets, and in partic ular, though not exc lusively, inc ludes: 


 (a) movable and immovable property and any other property rights suc h as mortgages, liens or pledges; 

 (b) shares, stoc ks and debentures of c ompanies or interest in the property of suc h c ompanies; 

 (c ) c laims to money or to any performanc e under c ontrac t having a financ ial value, and loans; 

 (d) c opyrights, know-how (goodwill) and industrial property rights suc h as patents for inventions, trade marks, industrial designs and trade names; 

 (e) rights c onferred by law or under c ontrac t, inc luding lic enc es to searc h for, c ultivate, extrac t or exploit natural resourc es: 

 ... 

182    One c onsequenc e of the defendants c harac terising their dispute as the _shuttering dispute_ rather than the _expropriation dispute_ (whic h would have fallen foul of Art 28(4) of Annex 1) was that the c orresponding “investment” was not the Mining Leases, but the right to refer the dispute to the SADC Tribunal. This is an inevitable result. The Award c harac terised the investment variously as “an international law right to seek c ompensation for an expropriation of the investment” (at [7.31]); “the right to c laim for c ompensation” (at [7.38]); “the unheard c laim” (at [7.104]); “the c laim to c ompensation” (at [7.107]); the “sec ondary right to seek relief from the SADC Tribunal in respec t of the taking of the primary rights” (at [7.164]) and an “international law right to have their c laim heard by the SADC tribunal” (at [7.229]) _etc_. The defendants’ written submissions c harac terised their investment as the “sec ondary right to bring the SADC Tribunal Claim” [emphasis in original] (at para 90); the “sec ondary right to c laim for c ompensation” (at para 91); “the [d]efendants’ right to c laim for c ompensation” (at para 92); the “right to bring a c laim before the SADC Tribunal” (at para 108); “the [d]efendants’ right to bring the SADC Tribunal Claim” (at paras 142–143); _etc_. It is thus c lear that the alleged investment is not the defendants’ c laim to c ompensation _per se_ , but rather a _right_ to c laim for c ompensation before the SADC Tribunal for the expropriation of the Mining Leases. This also distinguishes the present c ase from _Mondev v USA_ and _Chevron v Ecuador_ , in whic h the lawsuits themselves (rather than the right to sue) were the “investment”. 

**_PCA Tribunal’s findings_** 

183    The majority said that it was “well-established” that the Mining Leases “c reate[d] a bundle of rights whic h [were] protec ted”, inc luding “both primary rights to performanc e and sec ondary rights to remedies” (at [7.24]). It thus held (at [7.23]–[7.24]) that the defendants’ investment enc ompassed: 

 (a) the defendants’ shares in Swissbourgh and the Tributees; 

 (b) the defendants’ interest in the Mining Leases through ownership of Swissbourgh and the Tributees; 

 (c ) the money, effort and resourc es expended by the defendants to pursue the exploitation of the Mining Leases; and 

 (d) the defendants’ secondary right to seek remedies should the Kingdom breac h its primary obligations under the Mining Leases. 


184    The majority took the view that “a legal c laim arising out of an investment” c onstituted a “[c laim] to money or to any performanc e under c ontrac t having a financ ial value” within the definition of “investment”. Suc h a legal c laim c ontinued the investment until the c laim was “finally resolved” (at [7.29]). After an investment has been made, where operations were subsequently c eased or terminated for any reason, a right to bring a c laim arising from that investment was a “nec essary and integral part of that investment” (at [7.31]). After all, if the c laim itself were not an investment then the State “c ould, by ending the underlying investment”, prevent the resolution of any c laim based on that investment (at [7.32]). The fac t that the Mining Leases had been terminated did not detrac t from the status of the Mining Leases (or the defendants’ SADC c laim) as “investments” under the Investment Protoc ol (at [7.34]). The majority referred to _ATA v Jordan_ , _Chevron v Ecuador_ and _Mondev v USA_ as support for its view. 

185    The majority stated that this analysis applied regardless of whether the sec ondary right to remedies had its origins in domestic or international law. It gave the example of _ATA v Jordan_ , whic h allegedly c onc erned a right to bring an international arbitration. The right to a remedy (whether that remedy was provided by a “domestic or multilateral international forum”) arose direc tly out of the Mining Leases, and there was no basis for severing it on the ground that it was “territorially removed” and henc e unprotec ted (at [7.37]). Moreover, there was a “c lear territorial nexus” between the investment and the Kingdom (at [7.36]), even if the forum where the c laim was heard was loc ated outside the Kingdom’s territory. Thus, an international law right to seek c ompensation for expropriation of the Mining Leases was part of the defendants’ investment. 

186    Justic e Nienaber’s Dissenting Opinion did not deal with this issue. 

**_Parties’ submissions_** 

187    The defendants adopted the majority’s reasoning, c ontending that the investment c onsisted of a “bundle of rights”, inc luding the sec ondary right to remedies. This sec ondary right fell within the definition of an investment as a “c laim to money” (limb (c ) of the definition of “investment” at [181] above), and was therefore an “investment asset” bec ause c laims to money c ould be c lassified as _choses_ in ac tion, a form of intangible property. The defendants also relied on _ATA v Jordan_ , _Chevron v Ecuador_ and _Mondev v USA_ , in whic h ATA’s right to arbitration as well as Chevron’s and Mondev’s c laims in the Ec uadorian and US c ourts respec tively had been found to be “investments”. 

188    The defendants submitted that whether the sec ondary right to remedies was a right to domestic or international arbitration had no bearing on whether it c onstituted an “investment” for the purposes of Annex 1. They also c ited various ac ademic passages whic h, in their view, stood for the proposition that an arbitration agreement in an international treaty remained effec tive notwithstanding amendment or termination of the treaty, onc e the investor c ommenc ed arbitration proc eedings. However, I note that these passages only say that terminating a tribunal where a c laim is part-heard does not dispose of the arbitration agreement or affec t the validity of the c laim. These passages might have been relevant to the merits of the dispute before the PCA Tribunal insofar as they suggest the wrongfulness of shuttering the SADC Tribunal in the fac e of the defendants’ SADC c laim. However, they do not disc uss whether the arbitration agreement in an international treaty itself c onstitutes an “investment” for the purpose of treaty protec tion (and, therefore, whether the PCA Tribunal had jurisdic tion to hear the dispute in the first plac e). 

189    The Kingdom submitted that the definition of “investment” in Art 1(2) was narrower than that provided for in many other BITs, being limited to “the purc hase, ac quisition or establishment” of “produc tive and portfolio investment assets”. Its submission on the import of those words was twofold. 


190    First, a “produc tive investment asset” was one that generated wealth or inc ome in some way or whose value apprec iated over time, suc h as land; a “portfolio investment asset” was one over whic h the investor exerc ised no managerial c ontrol but whic h might be traded on the market. Those words had to be read in light of the examples of assets spec ified in (a)–(e) of the definition of “investment” in Annex 1, all of whic h were rights and c laims. The phrase “produc tive and portfolio investment assets” should thus be read to exc lude advantages or benefits not amounting to “rights”, suc h as “privileges or liberties”. All that the defendants ac quired under the SADC Treaty and Tribunal Protoc ol was an ability to submit c laims to the SADC Tribunal. This was merely a benefit or advantage whic h did not fall within (a)–(e), whic h referred to property, property rights, rights or c laims. Moreover, the term “investment assets” referred to “something of more than ephemeral value”, and thus should be read to exc lude any rights whic h were defeasible or terminable at any time without the c onsent of the investor or the host State. The defendants’ ability to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal was defeasible and c ould be terminated at any time without the c onsent of either the investor or the host State, sinc e the c ontinued existenc e of the SADC Tribunal was subjec t to the dec ision-making of the other SADC Member States. 

191    Sec ondly, the term “investment assets” was limited to assets whic h had been established by and derived from domestic law, and whic h were loc ated in the territory and jurisdic tion of the host State. This was ac knowledged as a general princ iple by leading treatises and vindic ated by the following observations: 

 (a) The objec t and purpose of Annex 1 was to protec t against the risk that the host State might exerc ise its regulatory authority and enforc e its laws in a manner harmful to the investor and/or its investment. This was a risk that c ould only materialise in relation to rights established by domestic law through the purc hase, ac quisition or establishment of investment assets in the territory of the host State. 

 (b) The spec ified examples of investments in (a)–(e) were all c ontrac tual or property rights. Sinc e there was no international law of property or of c ontrac t, these nec essarily had to be rights arising under domestic law. 

 (c ) The definitions of “Host Government” and “Host State” in Art 1 both referred to an investment “made or loc ated” in the “territory” of the State party. There evidently had to be a territorial nexus between the “investment” and the host SADC State. 

 (d) The terms of Annex 1 more generally anc hored the “investment” in the domestic sphere. For example, Art 2 referred to investments “in [the Host State’s] territory” and Art 5 referred to investments “in the territory of any State Party”. 

192    As for limb (c ) of the definition of “investment” (see [181] above), the Kingdom submitted that this was c onfined to c ontrac tual c laims whic h c ould be c onverted into a fixed amount of money, whic h c learly did not desc ribe the ability to submit c laims to the SADC Tribunal. 

193    The Kingdom also sought to distinguish the c ases c ited by the defendants: 

 (a) In ATA v Jordan , the definition of “investment” in the Jordan–Turkey BIT was broader than that in Annex 1. ATA’s c ontrac tual right to domestic arbitration arose under a c ontrac t, so there was no question that it was properly c harac terised as a “right” (rather than a mere benefit). Moreover, although the tribunal referred to the “bundle of rights” analysis in its award, this referenc e “played no part” in its determination that the right to arbitrate was an investment – rather, the right to arbitration was a “distinc t” investment in its own right. Finally, ATA v Jordan 


 c onc erned the protec tion of a right to domestic arbitration arising under domestic law (that is, Jordan’s law of c ontrac t) for breac h of domestic law (that is, breac h of c ontrac t), not an international c laim for the breac h of a multilateral treaty. 

 (b) As regards Mondev v USA , the NAF TA’s definition of “investment” was also broader than the definition in Annex 1. Moreover, the tribunal regarded Mondev’s lawsuits as “subsisting interests” and did not c harac terise those subsisting interests as sec ondary rights to relief or part of a bundle of rights. The c laims were brought under the domestic law of Massac husetts in relation to a right to c laim before the US c ourts, rather than for breac h of international law before an international c ourt or tribunal. 

 (c ) In Chevron v Ecuador , the definition of “investment” was again broader than that under Annex 1 and the tribunal determined that it should be c onstrued broadly. In partic ular, the definition of investment in Art 1(1)(v) of the US–Ec uador BIT (“any right c onferred by law or c ontrac t and any lic enc es and permits pursuant to law”) c ould be c ontrasted with the definition in Annex 1 (“rights c onferred by law or under c ontrac t, including lic enc es to searc h for, c ultivate, extrac t or exploit natural resourc es”) [emphasis added]. The differenc e between “and” and “inc luding” suggested that “rights c onferred by law” in the US–Ec uador BIT were a general c ategory not limited by the subsequent language of “lic enc es and permits”, whereas “rights c onferred by law or under c ontrac t” in the c ontext of Annex 1 were narrower. As in Mondev v USA , the tribunal found that the c laimants’ lawsuits were “subsisting interests” and served to c ontinue their investment through the entry into forc e of the BIT, and there was no allusion to the “bundle of rights” analysis or the distinc tion between primary and sec ondary rights. Moreover, these interests were rights established by domestic law. 

**_My analysis_** 

_The right was not an “investment”_ 

194    The first port of c all _per_ Art 31 of the VCLT is the wording of the SADC Treaty and related protoc ols. The definition of “investment” in Annex 1 mirrors the drafting approac h adapted by “[a]lmost all BITs”, whic h generally “c ommenc es with a wide inc lusive phrase and then lists approximately five spec ific c ategories of rights” generally inc luding “property, shares, c ontrac ts, intellec tual property rights, and rights c onferred by law” ( _McLachlan_ at para 6.42). However, the inc lusive phrase used in Annex 1 is narrower than what _McLachlan_ desc ribes as a typic al “investment” definition, whic h c ommenc es with “‘investment’ means _every kind of asset_ ... and in partic ular, though not exc lusively, inc ludes...” [emphasis added] (Art 1(a) of the UK Model BIT (2005, with 2006 amendments) (see _Douglas_ at p 559)). The same phrase, “every kind of asset”, is used in Art 1(1) of the Germany Model BIT (2005) ( _Douglas_ at p 539), Art 1(1) of the Franc e Model BIT (2006) ( _Douglas_ at p 532) and Art 1(a) of the Netherlands Model BIT (1997) ( _Douglas_ at p 547), and in other “modern asset-based definitions” generally (Jan Asmus Bisc hoff & Ric hard Happ, “The Notion of Investment” in _Bungenberg_ at p 500 at para 9). That is not, however, the terminology employed in Annex 1. 

195    The prec ise terms adopted in the definition of “investment” in Annex 1, _ie_ , the “purc hase, ac quisition or establishment of produc tive and portfolio investment assets”, make the definition more restric tive than “every kind of asset”. I agree with the Kingdom’s submissions on the words “produc tive” and “portfolio” (see [190] above). The words “produc tive and portfolio ... assets” emphasise the ec onomic value of the investment. This is borne out by the examples enumerated at (a)–(e), whic h desc ribe tangible and intangible property, c laims with a “financ ial value” and rights suc h as “lic enc es to searc h for, c ultivate, extrac t or exploit natural resourc es”. The defendants’ sec ondary right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal is not suc h a right. 


196    Moreover, the textual c ontext of Annex 1 indic ates that a right to bring a c laim for c ompensation before the SADC Tribunal does not amount to an “investment”. Artic le 5 of Annex 1, c aptioned “INVESTMENT PROTECTION”, states: 

 Investments shall not be nationalised or expropriated in the territory of any State Party exc ept for a public purpose, under due proc ess of law, on a non-disc riminatory basis and subjec t to the payment of prompt, adequate and effec tive c ompensation. 

 [emphasis added] 

The artic le suggests that the “investments” whic h Annex 1 seeks to protec t are suc h as c an be expropriated “in the territory of” a State. Similarly, Art 2(1) of Annex 1 requires eac h host State to promote investments “in its territory”. Artic le 10 of Annex 1 requires investors to abide by the host State’s laws and polic ies. The sec ondary right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal does not, however, arise in the Kingdom’s territory and is not regulated by the Kingdom’s domestic laws. 

197    The textual c ontext thus reinforc es the ordinary meaning of the definition of “investment” in Annex 1 in indic ating that the objec t and purpose of the regime in Annex 1 was to protec t investments _made in the territory_ of the host State and/or _arising under the laws_ of the host State. The regime in Annex 1 func tions by regulating and harmonising individual States’ treatment of investments made within their respec tive territories. It does this by imposing obligations c onstraining what a Member State may or may not do with respec t to investments under its c ontrol or influenc e. 

198    There is good reason for this. As a general rule, investment treaty protec tion is ac c orded to an investor to protec t against ac ts of a State in expropriating investments made within that State. Ac c ordingly, the prevailing view is that the investment must be made within the territory of the host State or c omprise rights arising under its laws; “c apital must be c ommitted or expended in exc hange for rights over property either fac tually or legally sited in the host state” ( _Douglas_ at p 55). Zac hary Douglas, “Property, Investment and the Sc ope of Investment Protec tion Obligations” in _The Foundations of International Investment Law: Bringing Theory into Practice_ (Zac hary Douglas, Joost Pauwelyn & Jorge E Viñuales eds) (Oxford University Press, 2014) (“ _Douglas, Pauwelyn & Viñuales_ ”) states at p 373: 

 Another important feature of the c onc eption of an investment at the jurisdic tional stage is that a territorial link to the host state should be manifest. ... The jurisdiction or power to enforce national laws and regulations is granted to states by international law on a territorial basis. Contrac ting states parties must, in other words, enforc e their national laws and regulations c onsistently with the substantive obligations of protec tion in respec t of investments within the territory of the host state. Sometimes this territorial link is expressly referenc ed in the gateway provisions of the investment treaty or in the formulation of c ertain obligations. But the link need not be made explic it: the whole architecture of an investment treaty rests upon the imposition of constraints upon the exercise of territorial jurisdiction by the contracting states parties. 

 [emphasis added] 

If the right or property in question is loc ated outside the host State, it would generally be safe from expropriation by the host State. Furthermore, States generally have no extraterritorial enforc ement jurisdic tion and are thus unable to protec t rights or property loc ated outside the host State. As stated in Mic hael Waibel, “Investment Arbitration: Jurisdic tion and Admissibility” in _Bungenberg_ at pp 1248–1249, paras 144–145: 


 144 It is a c harac teristic feature of ‘investment’ ... that the investment be made in the territory of the ICSID State. Only in suc h c ases does the investment fall direc tly under the c ontrol of the host State’s legislative, exec utive and judic ial power and requires the protec tion afforded by the Convention. In keeping with princ iples of jurisdic tion in international law, States cannot reasonably be expected to protect investments outside their territorial jurisdiction, unless they have expressly undertaken such duties of extending investment protection extraterritorially. 

 145 ... With respec t to intangible rights, the jurisdic tional c riterion is met if the rules of private international law loc ate the right in the territory of the host State. 

 [emphasis added] 

199    The proposition that investments must be sited in the host State is reinforc ed by the fac t that domestic law governs the existenc e and sc ope of rights or property purportedly c omprising the investment. For example, in order to suc c eed in the expropriation dispute, the defendants would have had to show that the leases had been validly c reated and c onferred under the domestic laws of the Kingdom. But whether that property or right (if it exists) is rec ognised as an “investment” for the purposes of investment protec tion under a treaty will depend on the c onstruc tion of the treaty. This is reinforc ed by various sourc es. _Douglas_ explains at p 72: 

 ... [I]t is the munic ipal law of the host state that determines whether a partic ular right in rem exists, the sc ope of that right, and in whom it vests. It is the investment treaty, however, that supplies the c lassific ation of an investment and thus presc ribes whether the right in rem rec ognised by the munic ipal law is subjec t to the regime of substantive protec tion in the investment treaty. ... 

200    Andrew Newc ombe & Lluís Paradell, _Law and Practice of Investment Treaties: Standards of Treatment_ (Kluwer Law International, 2009) (“ _Newcombe & Paradell_ ”) states at para 2.11: 

 ... [W]hether a partic ular right, interest or asset held in the territory of a state party to an [international investment agreement (“IIA”)] is an investment protec ted by the IIA is a matter for the IAA not munic ipal law; but in order for a particular asset to be able to qualify as an investment under the IIA, it must first exist and such existence is owed to the law of the territory in which such asset is allegedly held. Thus, while IIAs designate whic h assets are to be c onsidered investments for the purposes of the treaty ... the preliminary question as to whether one of these types of investments exists is a matter primarily for the munic ipal law of the host state, not international law. 

 [emphasis added] 

2       0 1 _McLachlan_ observes at para 6.113 that “[t]he typic al definition of an investment found in a BIT requires that the status of the asset c laimed to be an investment must be c onsidered under the host State’s domestic property law” (see further UNCTAD, _UNCTAD Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements II: Expropriation – a sequel_ (United Nations, 2012) at p 22 and _EnCana Corporation v Republic of Ecuador_ , LCIA Case No UN3481, Award, 3 February 2006 at [184]). 

202    These passages all rec ognise, implic itly or explic itly, that an “investment” will usually c omprise property in the territory of the host State or rights arising under its domestic law. While these views are no substitute for the wording of Annex 1’s definition of “investment”, they represent the prevailing view in the broader c ontext of investment treaty law and c ohere with Annex 1’s foc us on a territorial nexus to the host State. The definition of “investment” in Annex 1 is relatively narrow as far as suc h 


asset-based definitions go, and c annot to my mind be interpreted to enc ompass a right ( _ie_ , the right to submit disputes to the SADC Tribunal) falling so wide of this paradigm. I note, moreover, that the PCA Tribunal’s finding that the defendants’ right c onstituted an investment was predominantly based on the “bundle of rights” reasoning, whic h I address below, rather than a direc t interpretation of the definition of “investment” in Annex 1. 

203    This does not mean that a right arising under international law, like the defendants’, c an never be an “investment”. It is always open to the State to internalise suc h a right in its domestic legal system (for example by enshrining it in a c ontrac t with the investor) or to expressly define it as an investment under the terms of the treaty. In this c ase, however, it was not c ontended by either the Kingdom or the defendants that the sec ondary right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal was one whic h arose or existed under the Kingdom’s national law, and the right was not one whic h fell within the terms of the definition of “investment” in Annex 1. 

204    In their written submissions, the defendants sought to bring the sec ondary right under limb (c ) of the definition of “investment” in Art 1(2) of Annex 1, _ie_ , “c laims to money or to any performanc e under c ontrac t having a financ ial value, and loans”. The phrasing of limb (c ) is susc eptible to four possible interpretations: 

 (a) c laims to money simpliciter , and c laims to performanc e under a c ontrac t (whic h c laim to performanc e has a financ ial value); 

 (b) c laims to money simpliciter , and c laims to performanc e under a c ontrac t (whic h c ontrac t has a financ ial value); 

 (c ) c laims under a c ontrac t, to money or to performanc e (whic h c ontrac t has a financ ial value); or 

 (d) c laims under a c ontrac t, to money or to performanc e (whic h c laims have a financ ial value). 

205    It is obvious that a c laim to money has a financ ial value, and a c laim to money made under c ontrac t c an only be made under a c ontrac t with a financ ial value. Options (c ) and (d) are thus redundant and c an be rejec ted. They appear to find support from _Poštová banka, A.S. and ISTROKAPITAL SE v The Hellenic Republic_ , ICSID Case No ARB/13/8, Award, 9 April 2015, in whic h the tribunal c onsidered the definition of “c laims to money or to any performanc e under c ontrac t having a financ ial value” and stated at [343] that “the investment c onsists of a c laim to money, or a c laim to performanc e, under a c ontrac t having a financ ial value” and therefore “the c laim to money must arise under a c ontrac tual relationship”. The Kingdom adopted this interpretation. However, no textual analysis was given in that award and I find it diffic ult to align myself with that c onc lusion. 

206    Between options (a) and (b), I prefer option (a). It appears that limb (c ) of the definition is intended to embrac e any c laims that c an be monetarily quantified – on the one hand c laims to money, and on the other hand c laims to performanc e having a financ ial value. This interpretation is supported by UNCTAD, _International Investment Agreements: Key Issues_ , vol I (2004) (“ _UNCTAD Key Issues_ ”), whic h interprets the same phrase “c laims to money or to any performanc e under c ontrac t having a financ ial value” (at p 119) to mean “c laims to money _and_ c laims under a c ontrac t having a financ ial value” (at p 120) [emphasis added]. Many obligations may arise under a c ontrac t with a financ ial value, but only those _obligations_ whic h themselves have a financ ial value c an c onstitute a produc tive or portfolio “asset”. 

2       0 7 _Douglas_ ’ exposition of the phrase “c laims to money whic h has been used to c reate ec onomic 


value” or “c laims to any performanc e having an ec onomic value” at pp 226–227 is instruc tive: 

 The common denominator for all these enumerated rights is an entitlement to a liquidated sum. Even in respec t of a ‘right to performanc e having ec onomic value’, it is the value represented by that performanc e that is the ec onomic interest in question that may form the basis of an investment. It is c ertainly true that these rights c an originate as c ontrac tual rights, but in order to qualify as an investment they must be more than rights in personam against a c ontrac tual c ounterparty. To be an ‘asset’, the right must transmute into an entitlement to a liquidated sum and thus constitute a debt in some form. For that transmutation to oc c ur, the right must have been adjudic ated in ac c ordanc e with its proper law so that the monetary value of the right has been asc ertained. Only at that point c an a ‘right to performanc e having ec onomic value’, for instanc e, qualify as an investment. This means that in prac tic e suc h rights must be evidenc ed in a c ourt judgment or arbitral award. 

 [emphasis added] 

208    Douglas takes the view that c ontrac tual rights may only c onstitute an investment for jurisdic tional purposes if they c an be properly c harac terised as _choses_ in ac tion. To the extent that an investment treaty refers to a “right to performanc e”, “this must be read as a right to performanc e in respec t of the transfer of money” (Douglas, “Property, Investment, the Sc ope of Investment Protec tion Obligations” in _Douglas, Pauwelyn & Viñuales_ at p 383). There is support elsewhere for a less restric tive view that interprets the phrase “c laims to money or to any performanc e under c ontrac t having a financ ial value” as inc luding “c ontrac tual rights for the performanc e of servic es” (see, _eg_ , _Mytilineos Holdings SA v The State Union of Serbia & Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia_ , Partial Award on Jurisdic tion, 8 September 2006 at [109] and _UNCTAD Key Issues_ at p 120). Nevertheless, the test for an “investment” in Annex 1 is whether it involves the purc hase, ac quisition or establishment of a produc tive or portfolio investment asset. Regardless of whether a c laim to money or to performanc e is restric ted to _choses_ in ac tion or otherwise, a right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal c learly does not fall within this c ategory. It is not a c laim, muc h less a c laim to money or to performanc e with financ ial value, it does not arise under c ontrac t, and it is c ertainly not a _chose_ in ac tion (let alone a _chose_ in ac tion arising under the Kingdom’s domestic law). 

209    During oral submissions, c ounsel for the defendants invited the c ourt to c onsider whether the right to seek c ompensation from the SADC Tribunal c ould fall within limb (e) of the definition of “investment”, _ie_ , “rights c onferred by law or under c ontrac t”. I do not think this c an be read to inc lude a right to dispute resolution in the SADC Tribunal. For one, applying the princ iple of _ejusdem generis_ , the illustrations given (“lic enc es to searc h for, c ultivate, extrac t or exploit natural resourc es”) point to rights direc tly related to the c ore investment ac tivity (here, the exploitation of the areas under the Mining Leases), rather than the means by whic h a dispute arising from the Mining Leases would be resolved. Moreover, it follows from what I have said at [196]–[202] above that “rights c onferred by law or under c ontrac t” must be understood as rights c onferred by _domestic_ law, rather than international law. 

210    Nor do the three c ases c ited by the defendants assist them. The definitions of “investment” in eac h of these c ases were signific antly different from that in Annex 1. In the c ase of _Mondev v USA_ , Art 1139 of the NAF TA defined “investment”, under Art 1139(h), as inc luding “interests arising from the c ommitment of c apital or other resourc es in the territory of a Party to ec onomic ac tivity in suc h territory” (see _Mondev v USA_ at [80]). Annex 1 does not have an analogous provision – it is worded not in terms of “interests arising” from the c ore investment but “produc tive and portfolio investment assets”. 


211    In the c ase of _ATA v Jordan_ , Art 1(2)(a) of the Jordan–Turkey BIT stated: 

 The term “investment”, in c onformity with the hosting Party’s laws and regulations, shall inc lude every kind of asset in partic ular, but not exc lusively: 

 ... 

 (ii) returns reinvested, c laims to money or any other rights to legitimate performanc e having financ ial value related to an investment, 

 ... 

 [emphasis added] 

212    The tribunal found at [117] that the right to arbitration was a distinc t investment. However: 

 (a) First, the definition of “investment” was worded muc h more broadly (“every kind of asset”) than in the present c ase. 

 (b) Sec ondly, the right to arbitration arose under domestic law, being enshrined in the c ontrac t between ATA and APC and therefore rec ognised as binding under Jordanian c ontrac t law. 

 (c ) Thirdly, under limb (ii) of the definition of “investment” in the Jordan–Turkey BIT, the rights to performanc e need not arise “under c ontrac t”. That is a requirement in limb (c ) of the definition in Annex 1. 

 (d) Fourthly, the tribunal did not explain its dec ision beyond remarking that the right to arbitration c ould “hardly be c onsidered as something other than a ‘right ... to legitimate performanc e having financ ial value related to an investment’” (at [117]). However, it is not c lear whether a right to arbitration c an indeed be said to be a right “to legitimate performanc e having financ ial value”. 

213    In the c ase of _Chevron v Ecuador_ , Art I(1)(a) of the US–Ec uador BIT stated: 

 “investment” means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or c ontrolled direc tly or indirec tly by nationals or c ompanies of the other Party, suc h as equity, debt, and servic e and investment c ontrac ts; and inc ludes: 

 ... 

 (iii) a c laim to money or a c laim to performanc e having ec onomic value, and assoc iated with an investment; 

 ... 

 (v) any right c onferred by law or c ontrac t, and any lic enses and permits pursuant to law; 

214    The tribunal found that the c laimants’ lawsuits c ontinued the original investment. However: 

 (a) First, the definition of “investment” was broader than that in Annex 1, enc ompassing “every kind of investment”. 


 (b) Sec ondly, the c laim to money or performanc e need not arise under c ontrac t, as long as it was “assoc iated with an investment”. 

 (c ) Thirdly, the lawsuits, unlike the defendants’ right to submit disputes to the SADC Tribunal in this c ase, were c learly a c laim to money. 

 (d) Fourthly, Art I(3) of the BIT provided that “[a]ny alteration of the form in whic h assets are invested or reinvested shall not affec t their c harac ter as investment”. The tribunal thus took the view (at [180]) that the lawsuits “c onc ern[ed] the liquidation and settlement of c laims relating to the investment and, therefore, form[ed] part of that investment”, and that the wording of the BIT suggested that “[o]nc e an investment is established, it c ontinues to exist and be protec ted until its ultimate ‘disposal’ has been c ompleted – that is, until it has been wound up” (at [183]). The tribunal did not say that the lawsuits were a distinc t investment, but that they had “c ontinued [the] original investment through the entry into forc e of the BIT and to the date of c ommenc ement of [the] arbitration” (at [184]). Annex 1, on the other hand, does not c ontain any provision equivalent to Art I(3). 

215    The three c ases are thus not analogous and do not avail the defendants. 

_Bundle of rights_ 

216    Although the defendants’ sec ondary right did not c onstitute a distinc t investment under the definition in Art 1(2) of Annex 1, c ould it nevertheless be part of the “bundle of rights” c reated by the Mining Leases? I am of the view that it c ould not. _Newcombe & Paradell_ gives an idea at p 282 of what rights might be c omprised in suc h a bundle: 

 ... Normally an investment c onsists of a bundle of rights, both tangible and intangible. These might inc lude leases of property, lic enses and permits, c ontrac ts, inventory and other assets. ... 

217    In this c ase, I do not think that the right is suffic iently c onnec ted with the defendants’ c ore investment ( _ie_ , the Mining Leases) to be c onsidered part of the c orresponding bundle of rights. The defendants’ sec ondary right did not derive from the provisions of the Mining Leases themselves. The defendants’ first applic ation instituting proc eedings in the SADC Tribunal on 12 June 2009 stated that the proc eedings were instituted “[b]y virtue of Artic le 15 of the [Tribunal Protoc ol] established by Artic le 9 read with Artic le 16 of the SADC Treaty”. Their sec ond applic ation on 25 January 2011 (see [34] above) stated that the proc eedings were instituted “[b]y virtue of Artic le 18 of the [Tribunal Protoc ol] established by Artic le 9 read with Artic le 16 of the [SADC] Treaty”. The alleged sec ondary right therefore arose under the SADC Treaty (whic h entered into forc e in 1993) and the Tribunal Protoc ol (whic h entered into forc e in 2001), muc h later than the Mining Leases themselves (whic h were granted in 1988). The “bundle of rights” analysis relied upon by the majority is therefore inappropriat e: _the conferral of this “secondary right” was not reciprocal with the defendants’ contractual obligations under the Mining Leases, but arose much later._ At the point in time when the defendants ac quired the Mining Leases, they did not have the advantage of any treaty protec tions. The right of rec ourse to the SADC Tribunal was not given to the defendants (or other investors) in response to, in exc hange for or in rec ognition of their investment ac tivities in the Kingdom. 

218    Rec iproc ity is one of the identifying features of an investment treaty. _Douglas_ explains at p 135 that a fundamental differenc e between investment treaties and human rights treaties is that the former require individuals to “undertake c ertain positive steps” and “ac quire an investment” in order to benefit from treaty protec tions. This is reflec ted in the definition of “investment” in Annex 1, whic h 


refers to the “purc hase, ac quisition or establishment” of assets in the host State. These words indic ate that some agenc y and initiative is required on the investor’s part in making the investment. _Douglas_ c ontinues at pp 135–136: 

273\. ... [T]he most c ommon investment treaty operates on the basis of a _quid pro quo_ with potential third party benefic iaries. If the national of one c ontrac ting state has invested its c apital in the ec onomy of another c ontrac ting state, then that c ontrac ting state whic h has benefited from this inflow of private c apital shall ... c onsent to arbitration proc eedings at the suit of the foreign national with respec t to disputes arising out of the investment. _The host state’s undertaking of substantive and procedural investment protection may well have influenced the foreign national’s decision to invest in the host state by reducing sovereign risk to an acceptable level._ ... [T]he protec tion is only operative onc e the foreign national has satisfied its part of the _quid pro quo_ by making an investment in the host state. 

 ... 

275\. This notion of a _quid pro quo_ is fundamental to the arc hitec ture of an investment treaty and c annot but impac t upon the princ iples governing the tribunal’s power to adjudge the merits of an investment dispute. 

 [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added] 

219    The right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal, on the other hand, was not a right _acquired_ by the defendants as part of their investment, but one _conferred_ by the SADC Treaty and protoc ols after their investment had been expropriated. 

220    Indeed, the bundle of rights analysis may ac c ommodate c auses of ac tion arising from the alleged expropriation of the investment ( _eg_ , the c ontrac tual c laims in _Mondev v USA_ and _Chevron v Ecuador_ ). Suc h c auses of ac tion would embody or c ontinue the original investment and would thereby inherit protec tion _qua_ investment under the treaty. In this c ontext, however, the c ause of ac tion arising from expropriation of the Mining Leases was the SADC c laim, whic h falls outside the PCA Tribunal’s jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_ by virtue of Art 28(4) of Annex 1. 

_Defeasible benefit or advantage_ 

221    For c ompleteness, I shall address the Kingdom’s two suggestions that the ability to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal was (i) a “benefit” or “advantage” falling short of a “right” and (ii) “defeasible” and “ephemeral” (see [190] above). 

222    Regarding the first suggestion, it is true that the host State’s c onsent is required for arbitration of a dispute. In the c ontext of investment treaty arbitration, the host State’s c onsent is found in the fac t of its ratific ation of the investment treaty, and c onstitutes a unilateral offer to arbitrate, whic h may be ac c epted by the investor by c ommenc ing arbitral proc eedings (see, _eg_ , _Douglas_ at p 360; Waibel’s c hapter in _Bungenberg_ (see [198] above) at p 1224, para 43; and _Plama Consortium Limited v Republic of Bulgaria_ , ICSID Case No ARB/03/24, Dec ision on Jurisdic tion, 8 February 2005 at [198]). 

223    In the present c ase, the Kingdom’s ratific ation of the SADC Treaty and Tribunal Protoc ol itself c onstituted the requisite c onsent. This is put beyond doubt by Art 15(3) of the Tribunal Protoc ol, whic h states, “Where a dispute is referred to the Tribunal by any party the c onsent of other parties to the dispute shall not be required.” 


224    The fac t that a BIT may c onfer a “right” (as opposed to what the Kingdom termed a mere “ability”) upon an investor to c ommenc e proc eedings against the host State before an international tribunal was rec ognised by the English Court of Appeal in _Republic of Ecuador v Occidental Exploration and Production Co_ [2005] EWCA Civ 1116 at [19]: 

 That treaties may in modern international law give rise to direc t rights in favour of individuals is well established, partic ularly where the treaty provides a dispute resolution mec hanism c apable of being operated by suc h individuals ac ting on their own behalf and without their national state’s involvement or even c onsent. ... 

2       2 5 _Oppenheim’s International Law_ , _Volume I: Peace_ (Robert Jennings & Arthur Watts eds) (Longman Group UK Limited, 9th Ed, 1992) (“ _Oppenheim_ ”) at p 847, para 375 put the matter this way: 

 States c an ... and oc c asionally do, c onfer upon individuals, whether their own subjec ts or aliens, international rights stricto sensu , ie rights whic h they ac quire without the intervention of munic ipal legislation and whic h they c an enforc e in their own name before international tribunals. 

226    The view that these rights are wielded by individuals direc tly, rather than derived from diplomatic protec tion by their States of origin, has also rec eived support in _McLachlan_ at para 3.124 and Zac hary Douglas, “The Hybrid Foundations of Investment Treaty Arbitration” (2003) 74 British Yearbook of International Law 151 (“ _Hybrid Foundations_ ”) at p 184. 

227    I therefore disagree with the Kingdom’s c harac terisation of the sec ondary right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal as a mere “advantage” or “benefit”. Nor do I agree with the Kingdom’s assertion that the defendants’ ability to submit a c laim to the SADC Tribunal was not an investment bec ause it was defeasible and “of ephemeral value only”. The Kingdom emphasised the fac t that it lac ked enforc ement jurisdic tion or c ontrol over the SADC Tribunal, so that even if a dispute were to be referred to the SADC Tribunal, there was a c hanc e that the Tribunal would not hear it due to the dec isions of other Member States. The Kingdom did not substantiate the link it drew between the duration or c ertainty of the right and its qualific ation as an “investment”. The key point, in my view, is not whether the right is “ephemeral” but whether it is fac tually or legally sited within the host State, therefore qualifying as an investment as defined in Annex 1, whic h I have c onc luded it is not. 

_Investment arising before Annex 1’s entry into force_ 

228    The Kingdom originally took the position that an asset existing before Annex 1’s entry into forc e c ould not c onstitute an “investment” within the meaning of Annex 1. However, this argument was not pursued in the Kingdom’s written submissions or oral submissions and appears to have been abandoned. In any event, it is c lear that Annex 1 is not c onfined to investments arising after its entry into forc e: the jurisdic tion _ratione temporis_ of the tribunal is delimited by Art 28(4), whic h relates to the timing of the _dispute_ rather than the timing of the _investment_. It does not matter whether the investment arose before or after Annex 1’s entry into forc e, as long as the dispute arose thereafter. If the SADC Member States had intended to protec t only those investments arising after Annex 1’s entry into forc e, they would have expressly provided so, and that would have _a fortiori_ exc luded preexisting disputes. In light of Art 28(4), it goes without saying that pre-existing investments may be protec ted under Art 28(1). A provision expressly extending Annex 1’s applic ation to pre-existing investments is not required to ac hieve that result ( _Nordzucker AG v The Republic of Poland_ , Partial Award, 10 Dec ember 2008 at [113(vi)]; _Douglas_ at p 340; Rudolf Dolzer & Christoph Sc hreuer, _Principles of International Investment Law_ (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2012) (“ _Dolzer & Schreuer_ ”) at p 41). However, in light of the foregoing analysis, the defendants’ right to submit 


disputes to the SADC Tribunal was not an “investment” for other reasons. I should add that it is entirely open to States to spec ific ally provide that treaty protec tion only extends to investments arising after the entry into forc e of the treaty. However, that was not the c ase here. 

**Third objection: whether the investment was “admitted”** 

**_PCA Tribunal’s findings_** 

229    The majority of the PCA Tribunal found that the defendants’ purported investment had been admitted. It took the view, relying on the bundle of rights argument, that it suffic ed for the _Mining Leases_ to have been admitted, even though the investment in question was the defendants’ right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal. The PCA Tribunal was unpersuaded that the “‘investment’ c reated by the unheard [SADC] c laim require[d] a separate admission”. Rather, the SADC c laim was “part and parc el of the original investment c reated by the [M]ining [L]eases”, and it was the Mining Leases that therefore had to be admitted (Award at [7.104]). 

230    The Mining Leases did not require admission through any spec ial admission proc edure: it suffic ed for the Kingdom to have ac c epted or c onfirmed the Mining Leases (at [7.105]). To support these propositions, the majority relied on _Desert Line Projects LLC v The Republic of Yemen_ , ICSID Case No ARB/05/17, Award, 6 February 2008 (“ _Desert Line v Yemen_ ”) and _Churchill Mining Plc v Republic of Indonesia_ , ICSID Case No ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Dec ision on Jurisdic tion, 24 February 2014 (“ _Churchill Mining v Indonesia_ ”) (at [7.105]–[7.106]). The majority then went on to enumerate (at [7.110]) the ac ts by whic h the Kingdom was taken to have “c onfirmed, authorised and ac c epted the Mining Leases”. In partic ular, the Mining Leases had been “issued, signed and approved by top offic ials of the [Kingdom] after a rigorous applic ation proc ess over the c ourse of two years”; approved by key Ministries; exec uted by the Commissioner of Mines and not objec ted by the Attorney General; registered by the Registrar of Deeds in Maseru; and granted by the King on the advic e of the Military Counc il. Moreover, the Kingdom seemed to ac knowledge the validity of the Mining Leases for three years after they were granted, by “seeking to ac quire an interest in [Swissbourgh] as lease holder, ac c epting sales tax on revenue from mining and rental payments for the leased areas, rec eiving progress reports on mining operations under the Leases, introduc ing [Swissbourgh] as the mining lease holder; and sending numerous letters requiring [Swissbourgh] to perform various obligations under the Leases”, as well as registering the Tributing Agreements in 1989 and 1990. 

231    The majority did not give its reasons for finding that the admission need not oc c ur after Annex 1’s entry into forc e. Its analysis of this issue (at [7.129]–[7.136] of the Award) was entirely foc used on whether Art 28(1) c ould apply to pre-existing investments, rather than whether suc h investments needed to be _admitted_ following Annex 1’s entry into forc e. 

232    Similar to the sec ond jurisdic tional objec tion, Justic e Nienaber did not deal with this issue in his Dissenting Opinion. 

**_Parties’ submissions_** 

233    The defendants adopted the majority’s reasoning, submitting that the Mining Leases (and by extension the right to refer the dispute to the SADC Tribunal) had been admitted _de facto_ prior to the entry into forc e of Annex 1. They relied on _Desert Line v Yemen_ and _H&H Enterprises Investments, Inc v Arab Republic of Egypt_ , ICSID Case No ARB/09/15, The Tribunal’s Dec ision on Respondent’s Objec tions to Jurisdic tion, 5 June 2012 (“ _H&H Enterprises v Egypt_ ”) for the proposition that an investment need only be admitted _de facto_ at the time of its initiation in order to benefit from treaty protec tion. 


234    The defendants also submitted that an investment need be “admitted” only onc e, at the time the investment was made, rather than during the entire operation of the projec t (c iting _Churchill Mining v Indonesia_ , _Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v Republic of the Philippines_ , ICSID Case No ARB/03/25, Award, 16 August 2007 (“ _Fraport v The Philippines_ ”) and _Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v Republic of Ghana_ , ICSID Case No ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010. These were c ases in whic h, like the present, the investments had been made prior to the relevant treaty’s entry into forc e. 

235    The Kingdom denied that either the defendants’ right to c laim before the SADC Tribunal or the rights and shares in the Mining Leases had been “admitted”. It submitted that Art 28(1) required the investment to be admitted spec ific ally for the purposes of Annex 1. This was a “pre-c ondition” of the Kingdom’s c onsent to international arbitration. Mere ac c eptanc e or c onfirmation of the investment would only amount to “admission” if the State intended the ac c eptanc e or c onfirmation to “result [in] the investment benefiting from the treaty protec tions”. Alternatively, _de facto_ admission might oc c ur where the host State endorsed an investment after Annex 1 c ame into forc e, knowing that the investor reasonably expec ted the treaty protec tions c urrently in forc e to apply. That was not the c ase here. 

236    In the Kingdom’s view, every investor assumed the risk that the legal regime governing the protec tion of foreign investments might c hange over time. An investment would therefore not normally benefit from the protec tion of whatever future laws subsequently c ame into forc e unless that protec tion had been spec ific ally negotiated by the investor. In this regard, the Kingdom referred to the “well-established princ iple that, in the absenc e of a spec ific ally negotiated agreement (whether in the form of a stabilisation c lause or otherwise), an investor has no right to assume that the host State’s legal regime will remain static ”. There was no evidenc e in this c ase that the defendants’ investment was intended to benefit from future protec tion under international law not yet in forc e at the time the investment was made, or that the Kingdom had represented or c onsented to it so benefiting. 

**_My analysis_** 

237    As noted earlier, the majority’s view that the sec ondary right was admitted as part of the defendants’ broader investment (the Mining Leases) seems to follow from its “bundle of rights” analysis, whic h I have c onsidered and rejec ted above. The ac ts alleged to c onstitute _de facto_ admission of the Mining Leases (see [230] above), whic h oc c urred between 1988 and 1991, c ould not have extended to the sec ondary right to refer the dispute to the SADC Tribunal, whic h only arose with the SADC Treaty in 1993 at the earliest. The only way for the sec ondary right to have been admitted was for it to have been admitted spec ific ally. The ostensible legal validity and governmental endorsement of the Mining Leases are therefore not relevant. 

238    But how does one go about determining whether a right to submit a dispute to an international forum like the SADC Tribunal, c onferred by an international treaty protoc ol, is an investment “admitted” by a signatory State? The very question illustrates the awkwardness of c harac terising suc h a right to relief as an “investment” in the first plac e for the purpose of Art 28(1): “investments”, as noted at [198] above, are generally c onc eived of as rights arising under the laws of the host State. The c ases c ited by the parties shed no light on “admission” of an “investment” arising under international laws or treaties bec ause they all predic tably deal with investments arising under domestic laws. There is no room for signatories of the SADC Treaty and Tribunal Protoc ol to c hoose whether to “admit” an investor’s right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal, sinc e this right arose by operation of the SADC Treaty and Tribunal Protoc ol and is not subjec t to additional implementation or derogation by Member States under their respec tive domestic laws. Nor c an it be argued that the ac t 


of ratific ation itself c onstitutes the “admission”; if this were so, Annex 1 would not need to further spec ify admission as its own and separate requirement. Nor are Member States able to “admit” individual c laims on a c ase-by-c ase basis, as Art 15(3) of the Tribunal Protoc ol does away with the need for the host State’s c onsent where an investor refers the dispute to the SADC Tribunal. 

_The meaning of “admission”_ 

239    An analysis of the Investment Protoc ol and other investment treaty awards and treatises whic h have c onsidered the c onc ept of admission shows that admission is a matter of c omplianc e with the host State’s domestic laws and regulations. In my view, the introduc tion of the requirement of admission in Art 28(1) is signific ant. 

240    The c onc ept of admission was absent from the SADC Treaty and was only introduc ed in Annex 1, whic h entered into forc e in April 2010. It features in three plac es in Annex 1, inc luding Art 28(1): 

## ARTICLE 1 

## DEFINITIONS 

## ... 

2\. In this Annex, unless the c ontext otherwise requires: 

 “investor” means a person that has been admitted to make or has made an investment; 

 ... 

## ARTICLE 2 

## PROMOTION AND ADMISSION OF INVESTMENTS 

1\. Eac h State Party shall promote investments in its territory, and _admit_ suc h investments in ac c ordanc e with its laws and regulations. 

 ... 

## ARTICLE 28 

## SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES 

1\. Disputes between an investor and a State Party c onc erning an obligation of the latter in relation to an _admitted_ investment of the former, whic h have not been amic ably settled, and after exhausting loc al remedies shall, after a period of six (6) months from written notific ation of a c laim, be submitted to international arbitration if either party to the dispute so wishes. 

 ... 


 [emphasis added] 

241    Annex 1 approac hes the c onc ept of admission somewhat unusually. Unlike some BITs (see, _eg_ , _Churchill Mining v Indonesia_ at [285]; _Desert Line v Yemen_ at [92], _Fraport v The Philippines_ at [282]–[283] and _H&H Enterprises v Egypt_ at [46]), Annex 1 does not make “admission” part of the definition of an “investment” or a c ondition for the applic ation of the treaty. The requirement of “admission” is absent from the substantive treaty protec tions in Annex 1, _eg_ , Art 6 (“Investments and investors shall enjoy fair and equitable treatment”), Art 7 (“State Parties may in ac c ordanc e with their respec tive domestic legislation grant preferential treatment to qualifying investments”) and Art 9 (“Eac h State Party shall ensure that investors are allowed fac ilities in relation to repatriation of investments”). Instead, admission is a gateway or threshold to the spec ific treaty protec tion of rec ourse to arbitration under Art 28(1). Moreover, an “investor” is not defined _exclusively_ as someone who has been “admitted” to make an investment, but c an also inc lude someone who “has made” one. 

242    The fac t that Art 28(1) requires an investment to be “admitted”, when it is not part of the definition of “investment” or required elsewhere in Annex 1, seems to suggest that it is a threshold requirement for rec ourse to arbitration spec ific ally. In other words, rights and property whic h would otherwise fall within the definition of “investment” for the purposes of other treaty protec tions must fulfil some additional c riterion in order to be arbitrable under Art 28(1). On the other hand, Art 2(1) seems to c ontemplate that every investment must be “admitted” in ac c ordanc e with the State’s laws and regulations. On this view, admission is not spec ific to Art 28(1) but a general requirement. 

243    I do not have to elec t between these two interpretations. What is c lear, and suffic es for these purposes, is that Art 2(1) gives c ontent to the “admission” requirement in Art 28(1). In other words, an investment must be admitted “in ac c ordanc e with [the host State’s] laws and regulations” in order to qualify for rec ourse to arbitration under Art 28(1). As to the meaning of “in ac c ordanc e with its laws and regulations” in Art 2(1), the phrase is one whic h has been analysed repeatedly in the investment treaty c ontext. In _Desert Line v Yemen_ , Art 1(1) of the relevant BIT required the investment to be “ac c epted, by the host Party, as an investment ac c ording to its laws and regulations, and for whic h an investment c ertific ate is issued”. The tribunal observed at [104]: 

 In State prac tic e in the BIT area, the phrase “ac c ording to its laws and regulations” is quite familiar. Moreover, it has been well traversed by arbitral prec edents, notably Inceysa ( Inceysa v. Republic of EI Salvador , ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, 2 August 2006) and Fraport ( Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Philippines , ICSID Case No. ARB/03/2S, 16 August 2007) whic h make c lear that suc h referenc es are intended to ensure the legality of the investment by exc luding investments made in breac h of fundamental princ iples of the host State's law, e.g. by fraudulent misrepresentations or the dissimulation of true ownership. ... 

244    The tribunal in _Desert Line v Yemen_ also c ited, at [113], the 2007 edition of _McLachlan_ at p 181: 

 In many investment treaties the definition of ‘investment’ inc ludes a requirement that the c ategories of assets admitted as ‘investments’ must be made ‘in accordance with the laws and regulations of the said party’. The plain meaning of this phrase is that investments whic h would be illegal upon the territory of the host State are disqualified from the protec tion of the BIT. Attempts by respondent States to broaden the matters enc ompassed by this phrase have failed. 

 [emphasis added] 

245    Moreover, the term “admission” is understood as referring to the right of foreign investors to 


make their investment in the host State _at the start of the investment_. This is supported by _Philip Morris Brands Sàrl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v Oriential Republic of Uruguay_ , ICSID Case No ARB/10/7, Dec ision on Jurisdic tion, 2 July 2013, whic h was c ited to me by the Kingdom. The arbitration there was brought under the Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay on the Rec iproc al Promotion and Protec tion of Investments (7 Oc tober 1988) (entered into forc e 22 April 1991). Artic le 2(1) of this BIT strongly resembles Art 2(1) of Annex 1 in the present c ase and states, “Eac h Contrac ting Party shall in its territory promote as far as possible investments by investors of the other Contrac ting Party and admit suc h investments in ac c ordanc e with its law.” At [169], the tribunal stated: 

 As the ordinary meaning of the word indic ates, “admission” is the ac t by whic h eac h State, having verified the c onformity of the proposed investments with internal legislation, allows them to be made in its territory, thus ac c epting that they are protec ted investments for purposes of the BIT. ... 

246    _Dolzer & Schreuer_ helpfully elaborate at p 88: 

 Ac c ording to general usage, the right of ‘admission’ of foreign investment has been distinguished from the right of ‘establishment’. P Juillard uses the terms ‘freedom of investment’ and ‘freedom of establishment’. Generally speaking, the right of ‘admission’ c onc erns the right of entry of the investment in princ iple, whereas the right of ‘establishment’ pertains to the c onditions under whic h the investor is allowed to c arry out its business during the period of the investment. ... 

 Typic al issues of admission c onc ern the definition of relevant ec onomic sec tors and geographic regions, the requirement of registration or of a lic enc e, and the legal struc ture of an admissible investment (eg the type and seat of c orporation, joint venture, restric tions of ownership). In c ontrast, the right of establishment is c onc erned with issues suc h as expansion of the investment, payment of taxes, or transfer of funds. An overlap may exist in important areas suc h as c apital or performanc e requirements. ... 

247    The authors explain the import of a provision like Art 2(1) at p 89: 

 ... A typic al [admission] c lause... reads: ‘Eac h Contrac ting State shall in its territory promote as far as possible investments by investors of the other Contrac ting State and admit suc h investments in ac c ordanc e with its legislation.’ 

 An admission c lause of this type means that the host state is under no obligation to revise its domestic laws of admission after ratific ation of the bilateral investment treaty (BIT). ... Also, the host state retains the freedom to revise its laws on admission after the investment treaty has entered into forc e. 

248    The authors add at p 93: 

 The rules on admission may ... limit the right of the investor to invoke the dispute settlement clause of a treaty in cases where the investor ignores the rules on admission. Whenever a c lause ‘in ac c ordanc e with the laws of the host state’ is c ontained in a treaty, it may be understood to imply that investments made in violation of national laws are not c overed by the treaty. Therefore, the words ‘in ac c ordanc e with the laws’ relate not just to the laws on admission and establishment but also to other rules of the domestic legal order, inc luding those relating to c orruption. ... 


 [emphasis added] 

That is the effec t of the requirement of “admission” in Art 28(1) of Annex 1. 

249    The same is reiterated in Jeswald W Salac use, _The Law of Investment Treaties_ (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2015) (“ _Salacuse_ ”) at p 187: 

 In general, the inc lusion of the qualific ation ‘in ac c ordanc e with the laws and regulations of the host State’ in the definition of ‘investment’ refers to the validity of the investment and is designed to prevent the treaty from protecting investments that were not made in compliance with the host state’s national legislation. 

 [emphasis added] 

250    The foregoing analysis shows that: 

 (a) The rules of “admission” in a bilateral or multilateral investment treaty are, simply put, the aggregate of the domestic rules and laws imposed by the host State as a prec ondition for permitting or fac ilitating foreign investment. Suc h rules need not inc lude any spec ial proc edure for the admission of investments in partic ular or for the purposes of the treaty spec ific ally, although this is possible. For example, Indonesia’s BITs with the UK, Australia and Chile require admission in ac c ordanc e with Indonesia’s Foreign Capital Investment Law No 1 of 1967 and any law amending or replac ing it. In this c ase, however, the Kingdom c ould not identify any partic ular proc edure for “admission” and I understand Art 2(1) of Annex 1 to simply require c omplianc e with the Kingdom’s applic able domestic laws. (See also Desert Line v Yemen at [98]–[116], where the tribunal took the view that a requirement of “an investment c ertific ate” did not require an ac tual c ertific ate, given the absenc e of any rec ognised proc edure for issuing any suc h c ertific ates.) 

 (b) The analysis of whether an investment has been “admitted” will usually require the tribunal to examine whether the investment was originally made in c omplianc e with the laws of the host State at its c ommenc ement. An investment that was validly and legally made at the point of its c ommenc ement generally need not be separately or subsequently “admitted” for the purposes of the treaty spec ific ally. 

 (c ) The purpose of the admission requirement is to prevent investments that are unauthorised by the host State from benefiting from treaty protec tions. In the c ase of Art 28(1) of Annex 1, the requirement of “admission” prevents a would-be investor from making an unauthorised and illegal investment in the host State and then referring any quarrel with the host State to the SADC Tribunal under Art 28(1), thereby leapfrogging the host State’s own laws and internal legal proc esses. 

251    All this reinforc es my earlier c onc lusion that “investment”, for the purposes of Annex 1, is meant to enc ompass rights or property ac quired in the host State and arising under its domestic laws. The defendants’ right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal does not fall within this c ategory and is not an “investment”, nor was it “admitted” as that term is ordinarily understood, sinc e it was not susc eptible to admission in ac c ordanc e with the Kingdom’s laws. 

_Whether the Mining Leases were admitted_ 

252    Although it c arries no c onsequenc es for the analysis, I agree with the majority’s view that the Mining Leases themselves were admitted. This is borne out by the internal proc edures undergone by 


the Kingdom’s offic ials and authorities prior to the grant of the Mining Leases, the grant and registration of the Mining Leases and the Kingdom’s apparent rec ognition of the Mining Leases in the years immediately following their grant (see [230] above). Although it may well be that the Mining Leases were tec hnic ally invalid (as was found as regards the Rampai Lease), a host State whic h has for some time tolerated a legal situation is thereafter prec luded from later insisting, against the investor, that “the situation was unlawful from the beginning” ( _Dolzer & Schreuer_ at p 94, c iting _Desert Line v Yemen_ at [97]–[123]; see also _H&H Enterprises v Egypt_ at [54]). Nevertheless, the admission of the Mining Leases does not serve as admission of the defendants’ right to submit disputes to the SADC Tribunal, whic h did not form any part of the bundle of rights c omprising the Mining Leases. 

**Fourth objection: whether there was an “obligation in relation to” an admitted investment** 

**_PCA Tribunal’s findings_** 

253    The majority’s analysis was brief. The majority identified the following obligations relating to the defendants’ “right to seek relief from the SADC Tribunal for expropriation” (Award at [7.163]–[7.164]): 

 (a) the obligation to not withdraw the Kingdom’s c onsent to, or otherwise interfere with, the SADC Tribunal’s jurisdic tion under Arts 14 and 15 of the Tribunal Protoc ol in respec t of the defendants’ part-heard c ase; 

 (b) the obligation to ac c ord fair and equitable treatment to the defendants under Art 6 of Annex 1; 

 (c ) the obligation to refrain from taking any measure likely to jeopardise the sustenanc e of human rights, democ rac y and the rule of law under Arts 4(c ) and 6(1) of the SADC Treaty; and 

 (d) the obligation to safeguard the defendants’ right of ac c ess to c ompetent c ourts, tribunals and authorities under Art 27 of Annex 1. 

254    As for the fac t that the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal was attributable to a c ollec tive dec ision by the SADC Member States, the majority c onsidered that there was “no basis for dismissing a c laim purely bec ause it involves – in part – State ac tions taken at an international organisation” (at [7.168]). In any event, the wrongdoing lay not only in dec isions taken by the SADC Summit but “involve[d] ac tions taken by [the Kingdom] individually” (at [7.168]). 

**_The Dissenting Opinion_** 

255    Justic e Nienaber found that even if he were to ac c ept the c harac terisation of the dispute as a distinc t one, the shuttering dispute was not a dispute “c onc erning an obligation of [the Kingdom] in relation to” the defendants’ investment. Rather, it was “a general dispute about the legality of SADC’s polic y dec ision to partially disband the SADC Tribunal and restric t its jurisdic tion and not a dispute whic h _per se_ was about the [defendants’] investments” (Dissenting Opinion at [3.1]). 

256    The resolution to shutter the SADC Tribunal was not c onc erned with any aspec t (say, the validity or sc ope) of the defendants’ investment, but had been adopted at Zimbabwe’s bidding in light of the problems c reated for it by the award issued by the SADC Tribunal in the _Campbell v Zimbabwe_ c ase (see [33] above). Justic e Nienaber noted that this general polic y dec ision had merely c aught the defendants’ investment “in the c ross-fire” and was not otherwise related to it (Dissenting Opinion at [3.2]). 


**_Parties’ submissions_** 

257    The Kingdom noted that the words “obligation of the latter in relation to the admitted investment of the former” were narrower than more standard BIT wording suc h as “disputes with respec t to investments”. Sinc e Art 28 was embedded in Annex 1, the “obligation” in question must be an obligation imposed by and arising under Annex 1. The phrase “in relation to” required a legally signific ant c onnec tion between the obligation at issue and the admitted investment. Moreover, sinc e the obligation must have related to an admitted investment of the investor, it c ould not be an obligation between States _inter se_. 

258    Spec ific ally, the obligation in Art 28(1) of Annex 1 referred to an obligation of the host State not to exerc ise its enforc ement jurisdic tion to the detriment of the investor and its investment. The Kingdom’s enforc ement jurisdic tion was limited to the extent of its territory, and there was no evidenc e that the Investment Protoc ol was intended to restrain the Kingdom’s ac ts “on the international plane” ( _ie_ , its ac ts within the SADC). 

259    Based on these princ iples, the Kingdom disputed eac h of the four putative obligations identified by the PCA Tribunal as follows: 

 (a) Artic les 4 and 6 of the SADC Treaty gave rise only to obligations between Member States inter se , and not obligations owed by States to individual investors. 

 (b) Artic les 14 and 15 of the Tribunal Protoc ol did not c onfer any right on the defendants or any obligation on the SADC Member States. They merely established the c ompetenc e of the SADC Tribunal in general terms. Alternatively, these artic les only gave rise to obligations between Member States inter se. 

 (c ) Artic les 6 and 27 of Annex 1 c ould not be relied on bec ause the defendants did not have an admitted investment. 

260    The defendants disputed that the “obligations” envisaged in Art 28(1) of Annex 1 were limited to obligations imposed by Annex 1. There were three planks to this argument: 

 (a) There was no suc h restric tion stated in Art 28(1), although other Annexes to the Investment Protoc ol c ontained suc h a restric tion. 

 (b) Sinc e the purpose of Annex 1 was to enc ourage investment, Art 28(1) should be interpreted broadly to inc lude all obligations (not merely those arising under Annex 1) as long as they c ould be said to relate to the protec ted investment. This was supported by SGS Société Générale de Surveillance S.A. v Republic of the Philippines , ICSID Case No ARB/02/6, Dec ision of the Tribunal on Objec tions to Jurisdic tion, 29 January 2004 (“ SGS v The Philippines ”) at [115]– [117], whic h I reproduc e below (at [267]). 

 (c ) The SADC Treaty, Tribunal Protoc ol and Investment Protoc ol are “c losely related and must be interpreted and applied as a whole”. In international law, a protoc ol “has the same legal c harac teristic s as a treaty” (c iting UN, Treaty Sec tion of the Offic e of Legal Affairs, Treaty Handbook (Rev Ed, 2012) at p 69). Artic le 28(1) c ould therefore inc lude obligations arising under the SADC Treaty, Tribunal Protoc ol and Investment Protoc ol, and not solely those arising under Annex 1. 

261    In response to the Kingdom’s argument that the PCA Tribunal c ould not hold it liable for its ac ts 


in the SADC Summit, the defendants c ounter-argued that: 

 (a) Nothing in Art 28 of Annex 1 limited the PCA Tribunal’s jurisdic tion to a State’s breac hes of obligations within its own territory. 

 (b) Whether the Kingdom’s role in the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal breac hed any of its obligations was “primarily an issue of liability” and not jurisdic tion (c iting the Award at [7.166]). It was henc e beyond this c ourt’s review. 

 (c ) The defendants’ c laim did not depend on attributing liability for the SADC Summit’s ac ts to the Kingdom, but rather targeted the Kingdom’s “own partic ipation in the SADC dec ision and its own failure to ensure that the SADC Tribunal or another neutral international forum c ould c omplete the [d]efendants’ part-heard SADC Tribunal Claim”. The Kingdom c ould, for example, have sought a savings c lause to enable the SADC c laim to be resolved by the SADC Tribunal or in an alternative forum. Not only did it not do so, but it even refused the defendants’ proposal for the SADC Tribunal c laim to be resolved by way of arbitration under the auspic es of the PCA (see [36] above). 

 (d) There was nothing in the SADC Treaty, Tribunal Protoc ol or Investment Protoc ol, or in international law, to prec lude the PCA Tribunal from taking into ac c ount the Kingdom’s c onduc t within the body of the SADC Summit. The ICJ dec ision of Application of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995 (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia v Greece) [2011] ICJ 644 (“ Macedonia v Greece ”) c onfirmed that a State may bear responsibility for its own c onduc t within an international organisation. Moreover, where several States are responsible for the same internationally wrongful ac t, the responsibility of eac h State may be invoked in relation to that ac t (c iting Art 47(1) of the International Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts , UN Doc A/56/83 (2001)). In this regard, Mr Justic e Pillay, the lastserving President of the SADC Tribunal, had given expert evidenc e in the arbitration that “[e]ac h individual SADC Member State, inc luding [the Kingdom], is c ulpable for supporting the SADC Summit’s dec isions” in violation of their individual obligations under Arts 4(c ) and 6(1) of the SADC Treaty ( ie , to uphold the rule of law). 

**_My analysis_** 

262    It has already been established that the dispute, in order to c omply with Art 28(4) of Annex 1, must be c harac terised as the shuttering dispute rather than the expropriation dispute. The question is whether the shuttering dispute c onc erns any obligations whic h exist “in relation to” the purported investment, whic h on the defendants’ c ase was the right to present a c laim to the SADC Tribunal. For the avoidanc e of doubt, this inquiry does not go into the _merits_ of the shuttering dispute, _ie_ , whether the PCA Tribunal was right or wrong to have found that the Kingdom _violated_ the relevant obligations, and the relief that should be ordered if so. Rather, the question here is whether the dispute was one whic h c onc erned “obligations” existing “in relation to” the purported investment in the first plac e, whic h is a c ondition for jurisdic tion. 

263    Under Art 31(1) of the VCLT, the starting point must be the ordinary meaning of the phrase “relating to”, but this does not take us very far. Under Art 28(1) it is not the dispute, but the obligation whic h the dispute c onc erns, that must relate to the investment. This is an unusual c hoic e of language amongst BITs or multilateral investment treaties, whic h more c ommonly restric t their applic ation to disputes “in relation to”, “with respec t to” or arising “out of” or “in c onnec tion with” the investment ( _Newcombe & Paradell_ at para 9.29; _Salacuse_ at p 427; see, _eg_ , Art 8 of the Franc e– Argentina BIT 1991; Art 25(1) of the ICSID Convention; Art 10 of the Netherlands–Pakistan BIT 1988; 


Art 8 of the Slovak–Czec h BIT 1992; and Art 9(1) of the Switzerland–Pakistan BIT 1995). A c lause allowing all disputes relating to the investment to be referred to arbitration would “permit a treaty tribunal to exerc ise jurisdic tion over disputes that do not arise out of, or relate to, treaty protec tions, but c onc ern c ontrac tual c laims or other c laims based on munic ipal law” ( _Newcombe & Paradell_ at para 9.29; see also _Compañía de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal (formerly Compagnie Générale des Eaux) v Argentine Republic_ , ICSID Case No ARB/97/3, Dec ision on Annulment, 3 July 2002 at [55]). 

264    On the other hand, the phrase “obligation in relation to an investment” features more c ommonly in observanc e-of-undertakings ( _pacta sunt servanda_ ) treaty c lauses than in dispute resolution c lauses. For example, Art X(2) of the Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the Swiss Confederation on the Promotion and Rec iproc al Protec tion of Investments, 31 Marc h 1997 (entered into forc e 23 April 1999) (“the Swiss–Philippines BIT”) states: “Eac h Contrac ting Party shall observe any _obligation it has assumed with regard to specific investments_ in its territory by investors of the other Contrac ting Party.” [emphasis added] Although Annex 1 has no equivalent provision, its language of “obligation ... in relation to an admitted investment” is similar. In _SGS v The Philippines_ (see [260(b)] above), the tribunal stated at [121] that for Art X(2) to be applic able, “the host State must have assumed a legal obligation, and it must have been assumed _vis-à-vis_ the spec ific investment—not as a matter of the applic ation of some legal obligation of a general c harac ter”. 

265    The Kingdom also c ited _Methanex Corporation v USA_ , Partial Award, 7 August 2002. The tribunal had to c onstrue Art 1101(1) of the NAF TA whic h states: “This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party _relating to_ : (a) investors of another Party; (b) investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party; and (c ) with respec t to Artic les 1106 and 1114, all investments in the territory of the Party.” [emphasis added] The tribunal interpreted “relating to” in this c ontext as requiring a “legally signific ant c onnec tion between the measure and the investor or the investment” (at [139]). 

266    I disagree with the Kingdom’s submission that the “obligation” must arise under Annex 1. As the defendants argued, it would be inc onsistent with the wording of the Investment Protoc ol to read suc h a restric tion into Art 28(1) of Annex 1, espec ially sinc e suc h a restric tion is c onspic uously absent from Annex 1 but present elsewhere ( _eg_ , Art 7(2) of Annex 3, whic h refers to “any dispute or differenc e arising from the interpretation, applic ation or implementation of this Annex”). This c an be c ontrasted with, for example, Art 8 of the UK–Venezuela BIT 1995 (“[d]isputes between a national or c ompany of one Contrac ting Party and the other Contrac ting Party c onc erning an obligation of the latter under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the former”) and Art 1116 of the NAF TA (“[a]n investor ... may submit to arbitration under this Sec tion a c laim that another Party has breac hed an obligation under ... Sec tion A or Artic le 1503(2) ... or Artic le 1502(3)(a)”). 

267    Instead, the phrase “obligation ... in relation to an admitted investment” in Art 28(1) is similar to Art X(2) of the Swiss–Philippines BIT, whic h reads, “Eac h Contrac ting Party shall observe any obligation it has assumed with regard to spec ific investments in its territory by investors of the other Contrac ting Party.” This was disc ussed at some length in _SGS v The Philippines_ at [115]–[117]: 

115\. ... The term “any obligation” is c apable of applying to obligations arising under national law, e.g. those arising from a c ontrac t; indeed, it would normally be under its own law that a host     State would assume obligations “with regard to spec ific investments in its territory by investors of the other Contrac ting Party”. Interpreting the ac tual text of Artic le X(2), it would appear to say, and to say c learly, that eac h Contrac ting Party shall observe any legal obligation it has assumed, or will in the future assume, with regard to spec ific investments c overed by the BIT.Artic le X(2) was adopted within the framework of the BIT, and has to be c onstrued as 


 intended to be effec tive within that framework. 

116\. The objec t and purpose of the BIT supports an effec tive interpretation of Artic le X(2). The     BIT is a treaty for the promotion and rec iproc al protec tion of investments. Ac c ording to the preamble it is intended “to c reate and maintain favourable c onditions for investments by investors of one Contrac ting Party in the territory of the other”. It is legitimate to resolve unc ertainties in its interpretation so as to favour the protec tion of c overed investments. 

117\. Moreover it will often be the c ase that a host State assumes obligations with regard to spec ific investments at the time of entry, inc luding investments entered into on the basis of c ontrac ts with separate entities. ... [I]f c ommitments made by the State towards spec ific investments do involve binding obligations or c ommitments under the applic able law, it seems entirely c onsistent with the objec t and purpose of the BIT to hold that they are inc orporated and brought within the framework of the BIT by Artic le X(2). 

268    The objec t and purpose of the Investment Protoc ol and Annex 1 thereto are similar: to c reate “a favourable investment c limate within SADC with the aim of promoting and attrac ting investment in the Region” (Art 2(2)(a) of the Investment Protoc ol) and institute “effec tive polic ies on investment protec tion and promotion” (Preamble to Annex 1). This would be inc onsistent with implying a restric tion as to the sourc e of obligations whic h would satisfy Art 28(1). However, I agree that the obligation must be an obligation owed by the Kingdom to the investor (rather than to other SADC Member States). This is the only sensible interpretation of Art 28(1), whic h is limited to investorState disputes (and not State-State disputes). 

269    However, I do not think that any of the four obligations ac c epted by the majority (see [253] above) are obligations whic h exist “in relation to” the “admitted investment” in question. This is again in part bec ause the defendants’ sec ondary right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal falls outside the paradigm of “investments” c ontemplated by Annex 1. As noted earlier, this regime establishes substantive obligations on the part of Member States in order to protec t investments in the hope that this will “[c reate] a favourable investment c limate within SADC” and attrac t foreign investment (Art 2(2)(a) of the Investment Protoc ol). The defendants’ purported “investment” (being the right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal), on the other hand, _is itself a treaty protection arising under the SADC Treaty and Tribunal Protocol_ and ac c orded _inter alia_ to investors. It c an be desc ribed as a “protec tion” (see _McLachlan_ at para 3.01) bec ause it gives investors the assuranc e of referring disputes to an international body whic h promises a greater degree of independenc e and impartiality than domestic c ourts. However, it is, with respec t, c ontrived and unnatural to desc ribe the aforementioned obligations as obligations existing “in relation to” the purported investment, whic h is itself another protec tion, rather than an investment, arising under the SADC Treaty and the Tribunal Protoc ol. It is a c irc ular argument. The diffic ulty with the argument is illustrated in [272(c )]. 

270    In fac t, one might say that it is the other way around: the right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal enc ompasses suc h disputes as those that might arise from the breac h of treaty obligations. When the Tribunal Protoc ol and the ac c ompanying Rules of Proc edure c ame into forc e in 2001, they c reated a mec hanism to refer disputes between States and persons to the SADC Tribunal. The c ontent of this proc edural right was c oloured by substantive obligations suc h as those owed under the SADC Treaty and protoc ols then in forc e, and subsequently other protoc ols later enac ted (inc luding the Investment Protoc ol, whic h c ame into forc e in 2010). If a dispute were to arise in whic h an investor alleged that a Member State had breac hed substantive obligations owing under the SADC Treaty and protoc ols, that investor would have been entitled to refer the dispute to the SADC Tribunal pursuant to Arts 14 and 15 of the Tribunal Protoc ol. It is c irc ular to c onstrue the very right to refer suc h disputes to the SADC Tribunal as itself an “investment” whic h c ould in turn be the 


subjec t of obligations arising under the SADC Treaty and protoc ols. I do not believe that Art 28(1) was intended to apply in suc h a manner. 

271    I now address the obligations spec ific ally identified by the majority. First, Arts 14 and 15 of the Tribunal Protoc ol c an be ruled out as the dispute does not “c onc ern” them. They state: 

## ARTICLE 14 

## BASIS OF JURISDICTION 

 The Tribunal shall have jurisdic tion over all disputes and all applic ations referred to it in ac c ordanc e with the Treaty and this Protoc ol whic h relate to: 

 (a) the interpretation and applic ation of the Treaty; 

 (b) the interpretation, applic ation or validity of the Protoc ols, all subsidiary instruments adopted within the framework of the [SADC], and ac ts of the institutions of the [SADC]; 

 (c ) all matters spec ific ally provided for in any other agreements that States may c onc lude among themselves or within the c ommunity and whic h c onfer jurisdic tion on the Tribunal. 

## ARTICLE 15 

## SCOPE OF JURISDICTION 

1\. The Tribunal shall have jurisdic tion over disputes between States, and between natural or legal persons and States. 

2\. No natural or legal person shall bring an ac tion against a State unless he or she has exhausted all available remedies or is unable to proc eed under the domestic jurisdic tion. 

3\. Where a dispute is referred to the Tribunal by any party the c onsent of other parties to the dispute shall not be required. 

272    With the utmost respec t, I do not agree with the majority’s view that Arts 14 and 15 c reate an “obligation to not ... interfere with, the SADC Tribunal’s jurisdic tion” (Award at [7.163]), whic h is what the shuttering dispute c onc erns, for the following reasons. 

 (a) Generally, the Tribunal Protoc ol serves to presc ribe the “c omposition, powers, func tions, proc edures and other related matters governing the Tribunal” (Art 16(2) of the SADC Treaty), rather than establish substantive rights and obligations in relation to SADC Member States. Artic les 14 and 15 delimit the sc ope of the SADC Tribunal’s jurisdic tion. They do not expressly c reate obligations – unlike, for example, Art 5 of Annex 1 (the obligation not to nationalise or expropriate the investment), Art 6(1) of Annex 1 (the obligation of fair and equitable treatment) or Art 9 of Annex 1 (the obligation to allow investors fac ilities in relation to the repatriation of investments and returns). 

 (b) In any event, Arts 14 and 15 presuppose the existenc e of the SADC Tribunal and serve 


 only to delimit or c irc umsc ribe its jurisdic tion. Even if they are interpreted as obligation-c reating, they c an, at best, give rise to an obligation on the Kingdom’s part to submit to the SADC Tribunal’s jurisdic tion. For example, Douglas states in Hybrid Foundations at p 184 that the proc edural obligation to submit to investorState arbitration upon the filing of a notic e of c laim by a qualified investor “is owed direc tly to the investor”. Artic les 14 and 15 c ertainly c annot, however, give rise to a transc endent obligation to protec t or defend the very existenc e of the SADC Tribunal. In fac t, Art 35 of the SADC treaty enables the SADC Tribunal to be dissolved by a resolution supported by three-quarters of all the members of the SADC Summit. 

 (c ) Even if the obligation were c harac terised as suggested in (b) for the purposes of Art 28(1), that would result in a tautologous formulation of the dispute. The Kingdom’s obligation ( ie , to submit to the jurisdic tion of the SADC Tribunal) would not exist “in relation to” the defendants’ investment (their right to submit disputes to the SADC Tribunal); it would be the investment. In other words, the ‘obligation’ and the ‘investment’ would be essentially one and the same, the former merely being the c orresponding duty of the latter right. This is c learly not how Art 28(1) of Annex 1 is intended to operate: the obligation must relate to something separate and disc rete from itself, for example, an investment in the form of property ac quired through c ontrac t with the host State or loans taken by the host State. The obligation c annot be the investment. 

273    Sec ondly, I do not think Arts 4(c ) and 6(1) of the SADC Treaty c reate obligations owed by the Kingdom to the defendants “in relation to” their investment. These artic les read: 

## ARTICLE 4 

## PRINCIPLES 

 SADC and its Member States shall ac t in ac c ordanc e with the following princ iples: 

 ... 

 (c ) human rights, democ rac y and the rule of law; 

 ... 

## ARTICLE 6 

## GENERAL UNDERTAKINGS 

1\. Member States undertake to adopt adequate measures to promote the ac hievement of the objec tives of SADC, and shall refrain from taking any measure likely to jeopardise the sustenanc e of its princ iples, the ac hievement of its objec tives and the implementation of the provisions of this Treaty. 

 ... 

274    The “general undertaking” to promote the rule of law is, in my view, too general and abstrac t to have given rise to an obligation “in relation to” an admitted investment. Artic les 4(c ) and 6(1) make no referenc e to “investments” at all, and to c onsider them as having given rise to obligations “in 


relation to” individual investments would be to take suc h a broad interpretation of “in relation to” as to render it nugatory. To borrow the language of _SGS v The Philippines_ (see [264] above), the obligation to promote the rule of law is a “legal obligation of a general c harac ter” rather than an obligation assumed _vis-à-vis_ the defendants’ investment. 

275    The remaining two options, Arts 6 and 27 of Annex 1, seem the most likely c andidates for the purposes of Art 28(1). The artic les state: 

## ARTICLE 6 

## INVESTORS OF THE THIRD STATE 

1\. Investments and investors shall enjoy fair and equitable treatment in the territory of any State Party. 

2\. Treatment referred to in paragraph 1 shall be no less favourable than that granted to investors of the third State. 

## ... 

## ARTICLE 27 

## ACCESS TO COURTS AND TRIBUNALS 

 State Parties shall ensure that investors have the right of ac c ess to the c ourts, judic ial and administrative tribunals, and other authorities c ompetent under the laws of the Host State for redress of their grievanc es in relation to any matter c onc erning any investment inc luding judic ial review of measures relating to expropriation or nationalization and determination of c ompensation in the event of expropriation or nationalisation. 

276    I ac c ept that these obligations were borne “in relation to” the Mining Leases, but the defendants have not c harac terised their investment thus. Instead they have c hosen to c harac terise their “investment” as the sec ondary right to refer the dispute to the SADC Tribunal. For the reasons stated at [194]–[220] above, I do not think this c an be c harac terised as an “investment” at all. In fac t, Art 6 reiterates the requirement of a territorial link between the investment and the host State, whic h is not the c ase here. I have also already explained at [269]–[270] above the diffic ulties with c onc eptualising treaty obligations as existing “in relation to” the defendants’ right to submit disputes to the SADC Tribunal. 

277    As for the Kingdom’s argument that it c ould not be held liable for its partic ipation in the ac ts of the SADC Summit on an international plane, this is not a question of jurisdic tion but of liability. I pause only to note that _Macedonia v Greece_ , whic h the defendants c ited to suggest that the Kingdom c ould be held responsible for its c onduc t within the SADC Summit (see [261(d)] above), does not apply to the present fac ts. _Macedonia v Greece_ was a dispute between sovereigns, in whic h Mac edonia alleged that Greec e had violated an Interim Ac c ord expressly restric ting its right to objec t to Mac edonia’s membership in any international organisation. There is no suc h express undertaking in the present investorState dispute and the fac ts are not analogous. Moreover, there appears to be 


tension between the Kingdom’s position that Aquilian relief is available and its position that its sovereign ac ts within the SADC Summit are immune from oversight. However, this point was not argued before me by either party and was therefore not one whic h I felt c ompelled to explore. I have therefore analysed the fifth jurisdic tional objec tion purely from the perspec tive of whether Aquilian relief is available and without referenc e to the tension. 

**Fifth objection: whether the defendants exhausted local remedies** 

278    Artic le 28(1) of Annex 1 states that disputes may only be submitted to international arbitration “after exhausting loc al remedies”. It follows that a dispute in respec t of whic h loc al remedies have not been exhausted is a dispute not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration for the purposes of Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) of the Model Law. 

**_PCA Tribunal’s findings_** 

279    The majority c larified that the question was whether the defendants had exhausted loc al remedies in respec t of “the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal and the c onsequent termination of [the defendants’] part-heard SADC c laim” (Award at [7.224]). The defendants were not required to have exhausted loc al remedies in respec t of the expropriation dispute. 

280    It was c ommon ground between the parties that the defendants had not pursued any loc al remedies in relation to the shuttering dispute. The question was therefore whether any suc h loc al remedies existed whic h were “reasonably available and ... c apable of providing effec tive redress for the c laim at hand” and not “futile or illusory” (Award at [7.225]–[7.226]). 

281    The majority noted that the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal had violated the defendants’ “international law right to have their c laim heard by the SADC tribunal” (at [7.229]). The “primary or direc t remedy” for this violation was, straightforwardly, to provide the defendants with an opportunity to have their c ase heard (at [7.228]). The only way to ac hieve this was to make “an order direc ting the Parties to establish a new international tribunal under the same c onditions as the SADC Tribunal to hear [the defendants’] original c laim for expropriation” (at [7.226]). Sinc e the Kingdom’s domestic c ourts did not have power to order suc h a remedy, no loc al remedy was available (at [7.229]); the defendants therefore satisfied the requirement of exhausting loc al remedies. 

282    The majority rejec ted the Kingdom’s argument that the defendants should have pursued an Aquilian ac tion for the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal. This was not a satisfac tory remedy bec ause all that the defendants would rec eive was monetary c ompensation relating to “damage c aused by the loss of opportunity to bring a c laim before the [SADC] tribunal” – this was not a “direc t or primary remedy for the underlying c laim”. It would not provide the defendants with an “opportunity ... to have their c ase heard” and henc e c ould not lead to “effec tive redress” for the expropriation of the Mining Leases (at [7.228]). 

**_The Dissenting Opinion_** 

283    Justic e Nienaber identified the “ultimate remedy” sought by the defendants as c ompensation for the loss of their mining rights (Dissenting Opinion at [4.4]). The question was whether any loc al remedies had existed for this c laim in 2012, when the arbitration proc eedings were c ommenc ed. He identified two suc h remedies: 

 (a) An Aquilian ac tion for pure ec onomic loss, ie , an ac tion for “patrimonial loss not attributable to any physic al injury to person or damage to property but nevertheless resulting 


 from the [Kingdom’s] alleged wrongful (i.e. unlawful) and c ulpable c onduc t” (Dissenting Opinion at [4.14]). This delic tual ac tion had been “vigorously developed” in rec ent times by the South Afric an Supreme Court of Appeal and would have been available in the Kingdom (at [4.15]). While the South Afric an dec isions did not bind the Kingdom’s c ourts, they would nevertheless have a “strong persuasive effec t” as both c ommon law systems are based on RomanDutc h law (at [4.12]). The Kingdom’s Court of Appeal had in fac t rec ognised the existenc e of “a c laim for pure ec onomic loss” in the c ase of Mpota Moiloa v Raohang Banna Le Basali [2009] LSCA 20 (“ Moiloa v Raohang ”) at [10]. Suc h a c laim would result in “the very damages c laimed by the [defendants] for the expropriation of the [M]ining [L]eases and for being deprived of the opportunity of rec overing that loss by reason of the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal” (at [4.34]). 

 (b) The defendants c ould have pursued pending ac tions for c ompensation in the Kingdom’s domestic c ourts, whic h the defendants had either withdrawn or failed to pursue to their c onc lusion. Justic e Nienaber referred to Van Zyl and others v Government of RSA and others [2007] SCA 109 (RSA) (“ Van Zyl v South Africa ”) (the defendants’ applic ation for diplomatic protec tion from South Afric a), whic h made it c lear that “as a matter of fac t and law all available remedies have not been exhausted in Lesotho” (Dissenting Opinion at [4.37]). 

284    In Justic e Nienaber’s view, the majority’s approac h of c onsidering whether the Kingdom’s c ourts c ould have ordered the same injunc tive relief as an international tribunal ( _ie_ , the c onstitution of a new tribunal to hear the SADC c laim) put the horse before the c art. The question of whether loc al remedies had been exhausted was logic ally prior to the question of what relief an international tribunal ought to order, as the latter question presupposed that the tribunal had jurisdic tion (at [4.22]). 

285    Finally, Justic e Nienaber rejec ted any notion that the Kingdom’s domestic c ourts would be biased against the defendants or would not judge fairly, given their readiness to be “c ritic al and dismissive of the ac tions of [their] own government even during the earlier stages of the ... proc eedings” (at [4.29] (fn)). 

**_Parties’ submissions_** 

286    The Kingdom c ritic ised the majority’s analysis regarding the “primary [or] direc t remedy” for the defendants’ c laim. This test had no basis in international law. Moreover, the Kingdom pointed out that the defendants had not sought the c onstitution of a new international tribunal to hear their original c laim before the SADC Tribunal – in fac t they had opposed it (Award at [9.19]). Instead, the defendants had sought a dec laratory order, whic h they would then rely on to ac c ess the real remedy sought (monetary c ompensation for the allegedly unlawful deprivation of their rights under the Mining Leases). Moreover, the majority had found that an Aquilian ac tion was dissatisfac tory bec ause it “c ould not provide c ompensation for the underlying dispute c onc erning the Mining Leases” (Award at [7.228]). On this reasoning, the majority ought therefore to have c onsidered the existenc e of loc al remedies c apable of yielding c ompensation for the expropriation dispute, but did not do so. 

287    The Kingdom asserted that what was required by way of exhaustion of loc al remedies was wellestablished as a matter of international law. The proper test was not whether the munic ipal system c ould award the exac t same remedies as an international tribunal, but whether the munic ipal system was reasonably c apable of providing remedies whic h were “available and effec tive”. In this regard, the following remedies were available in relation to the shuttering dispute: 

 (a) First, an Aquilian ac tion for the lost opportunity to bring a c laim before the SADC Tribunal. This was a tort c laim that would have required the defendants to show that they had suffered damage (inc luding financ ial loss) c aused by wrongful and intentional or negligent c onduc t on the 


 Kingdom’s part. This was made out on the defendants’ c ase: the Kingdom had allegedly partic ipated in the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal with the knowledge and intent of ridding itself of the defendants’ c laim, c ausing them to suffer the loss of a valuable c laim whic h would have resulted in their obtaining an award of sizeable damages. In terms of relief, a domestic c ourt would be able to award the defendants whatever relief they would have been able to obtain before the SADC Tribunal, inc luding monetary c ompensation for the expropriation of their mining rights, to the full extent rec overable. 

 (b) Sec ondly, a c onstitutional or public law c laim in relation to the Kingdom’s involvement in the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal. The defendants c ould thereby have sought to c ompel the Kingdom to provide an alternative forum for resolution of the SADC c laim. The Kingdom referred to the pending c ase of The Law Society of South Africa v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others , Case No 20382/15, c ommenc ed in Marc h 2015 in the High Court of South Afric a, Gauteng Division, Pretoria, in whic h the Law Soc iety of South Afric a brought an ac tion against the President, the Minister of Justic e and the Minister of International Relations and Co-operation of South Afric a regarding the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal. The Law Soc iety’s c hallenge (whic h has not been determined) was based on the right of ac c ess to c ourts and other tribunals and fora protec ted by the South Afric an Constitution. The Kingdom pointed out that ss 4(1)(h) and 12(8) of the Kingdom’s Constitution likewise enshrine a right to a fair determination of c ivil rights and obligations. 

288    The Kingdom also submitted that by c onstituting a new tribunal to hear the SADC c laim, the majority effec tively asserted jurisdic tion over the expropriation dispute. The defendants should therefore also have been required to exhaust loc al remedies _vis-à-vis_ the expropriation dispute. In this regard, the loc al remedies that were available and unexhausted were as follows: 

 (a) The various proc eedings before the Kingdom’s c ourts for damages in respec t of the expropriation of the Mining Leases, whic h were formally still pending. As the South Afric an High Court had held in Van Zyl and others v Government of RSA and others [2005] ZAGPHC 70 (RSA) at [75], the determination of invalidity of the Rampai lease was not res judicata in respec t of the other four leases and did not mitigate the nec essity of pursuing those proc eedings to c onc lusion. It was irrelevant, even if true, that the other four leases had c ome into existenc e under the exac t same c onditions as the Rampai lease. The question was not the defendants’ likelihood of suc c ess, but whether there were unexhausted loc al remedies. 

 (b) A potential new ac tion based on deliberate or negligent misrepresentation as to the validity of the Rampai lease (whic h ac tion would have been unaffec ted by any invalidity of the leases). 

289    The defendants agreed that the loc al remedies must be “available and effec tive” and not “futile [or] illusory”. The existenc e of loc al remedies in respec t of the expropriation dispute was irrelevant, being a matter for determination by the new tribunal ordered to be c onstituted by the PCA Tribunal. In any event, no remedies existed for the expropriation dispute, sinc e the Rampai lease dec ision set a prec edent for the other four mining leases. As regards the shuttering dispute, the mooted remedies were both futile and illusory: 

 (a) The Aquilian ac tion would have been “utterly futile” as it c ould not yield the full measure of c ompensation for the lost Mining Leases. The South Afric an authorities did not show that suc h c ompensation would be possible and were distinguishable on their fac ts. Moreover, a judgment obtained from the Kingdom’s domestic c ourts would not be as effec tive as an international arbitral award whic h “c ould be enforc ed in other c ountries”. It would not even be susc eptible to enforc ement under the Kingdom’s own laws in light of s 5 of the Government Proc eedings and 


 Contrac ts Ac t (Ac t 4 of 1965) (“the GPCA”). 

 (b) Ac c ording to the defendants, the Kingdom had always intended to dispense with the defendants without c ompensation. They said it was “neither reasonable nor logic al” to expec t the defendants to seek rec ourse from the domestic c ourts, implying that they c ould not be relied upon to dec ide impartially. 

290    The Kingdom denied that its domestic laws prevented the exec ution of judgments obtained against the Government of Lesotho; this argument was based on a misreading of the GPCA. The question in this c ase was not whether the Government might be the subjec t of forc ed exec ution, but whether it would in fac t c omply with any judgment made against it by the domestic c ourts. There c ould be no doubt that it would do so given its c omplianc e with past dec isions of the domestic c ourts whic h were favourable to the defendants. 

**_My analysis_** 

291    Artic le 28(1) of Annex 1 provides that investorState disputes whic h have not been amic ably settled may, “after exhausting loc al remedies”, be submitted to international arbitration. Ac c epting that the dispute in question is the shuttering dispute, the question is whether the defendants had exhausted all available loc al remedies for the shuttering dispute. My view is that they did not. 

_General principles_ 

292    The princ iple that loc al or domestic remedies must be exhausted before international proc eedings may be instituted derives from the international law on diplomatic protec tion (see Chittharanjan Felix Amerasinghe, _Local Remedies in International Law_ (Cambridge University Press, 2nd Ed, 2004) (“ _Amerasinghe_ ”) at p 3). The princ iple is part of c ustomary international law on diplomatic protec tion ( _Case Concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (USA v Italy)_ [1989] ICJ 15 (“the _ELSI_ c ase”) at [50]; _Interhandel Case (Switzerland v USA) (Preliminary Objections_ ) [1959] ICJ 6 (“ _Interhandel_ ”) at 27). However, it has been invoked before international tribunals outside the field of diplomatic protec tion. In partic ular, the princ iple has been applied by human rights tribunals whic h are established by treaties whic h inc orporate the princ iple (see, _eg_ , Art 35(1) of the European Convention for the Protec tion of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 4 November 1950, ETS 5, whic h applies to c laims before the European Court of Human Rights). 

293    The rule that domestic remedies must be exhausted gives a State an opportunity to redress the wrong that has oc c urred within its own legal order before being c alled to ac c ount for its ac tions on the international plane, thereby ac c ording respec t to the State’s sovereignty ( _The Loewen Group, Inc and Raymond L Loewen v United States of America_ , ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/98/3, Award, 26 June 2003 at [156]; _Interhandel_ at 27; Malc olm N Shaw, _International Law_ (Cambridge University Press, 7th Ed, 2014) (“ _Shaw_ ”) at p 596; _Amerasinghe_ at p 17). The rule also serves prac tic al purposes. Often it is more suitable and c onvenient for loc al c ourts to c onduc t the initial inquiries into the matter ( _Brownlie_ at p 711; _Oppenheim_ at p 524, n 5). Requiring rec ourse to domestic remedies also reduc es the number of international c laims that might be brought, partic ularly the proliferation of small c laims on the level of diplomatic protec tion ( _Shaw_ at p 596; _Brownlie_ at p 711). 

294    The princ iple of exhaustion of loc al remedies is rarely enc ountered in BITs, whic h “almost always waive the exhaustion of loc al remedies rule, allowing aggrieved investors to take their c laim straight to arbitration” ( _Brownlie_ at p 716). However, Artic le 28(1) of Annex 1 explic itly requires loc al remedies to be exhausted. I will henc e proc eed on the basis that Art 28(1) transposes the c ustomary international law doc trine of exhaustion of loc al remedies in the field of diplomatic protec tion into 


Annex 1. It was not c ontended that the exhaustion of loc al remedies had a different meaning in the c ontext of Art 28(1) than in the c ontext of diplomatic protec tion; on the c ontrary, the parties referenc ed judgments and c ommentary on the c ustomary international law doc trine in their submissions. 

295    I therefore now turn to the c ustomary international law doc trine of exhaustion of loc al remedies. Two aspec ts of the doc trine are pertinent here. First, what are the “loc al remedies” whic h must be exhausted? Sec ondly, what c onstitutes exhaustion? 

(1) Loc al remedies 

296    In 2006, the International Law Commission (“the ILC”) published its Draft artic les on Diplomatic Protec tion (“the Draft artic les”). Artic le 14(2) of the Draft artic les states: 

 Article 14. Exhaustion of local remedies 

 ... 

2\. “Loc al remedies” means _legal remedies_ whic h are _open to the injured person before the judicial or administrative courts or bodies_ , whether ordinary or spec ial, of the State alleged to be responsible for c ausing the injury. 

 [emphasis added] 

297    Artic le 15 of the Draft artic les states: 

 Article 15. Exceptions to the local remedies rule 

 Loc al remedies do not need to be exhausted where: 

 (a) there are no reasonably available local remedies to provide effective redress , or the local remedies provide no reasonable possibility of such redress ; 

 ... 

 [emphasis added] 

298    I ac c ept Arts 14 and 15 of the Draft artic les as broadly dec laratory of c ustomary international law. Artic les 14 and 15 purport to c odify the c ustomary international law doc trine of exhaustion of loc al remedies (Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its fifty-eighth session, _Draft articles on Diplomatic Protection with commentaries_ , reprinted in _Yearbook of the International Law Commission_ , _2006_ , vol II, Part Two, UN Doc A/CN.4/SER.A/2006/Add.1 (Part 2) (“ _Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2006_ ”) at p 44). Moreover, authoritative treatises suc h as _Brownlie_ and _Shaw_ treat Arts 14 and 15 as reflec tive of c ustomary international law ( _Brownlie_ at pp 713–714; _Shaw_ at p 596). 

299    The meaning of the phrase “loc al remedies” in Art 14 must be read in the light of the exc eptions in Art 15 of the Draft artic les (see _Yearbook of the International Law Commission_ , _2006_ at p 44). For present purposes, the only relevant exc eption is that stated in Art 15(a) of the Draft artic les. In my judgment, Arts 14(2) and Art 15(a) disc lose two c harac teristic s of the loc al remedies to whic h the exhaustion of loc al remedies princ iple applies. 


 (a) First, they must be ac c essible or available to the foreign national. This is implic it in the language of Art 14(2) (“open to an injured person”) and Art 15(a) and appears to be wellestablished (see Amerasinghe at pp 181–182). 

 (b) Sec ondly, they must provide effec tive redress. This is reflec ted in Art 15(a). 

300    The twin elements of availability and effec tiveness are reiterated in the c ases (see, _eg_ , _ST-AD GmbH (Germany) v The Republic of Bulgaria_ , Award on Jurisdic tion, 18 July 2013 at [365].) In relation to the effec tiveness requirement, the ILC noted that three formulations of the test were found in the authorities. On the stric test version, only loc al remedies whic h were “obviously futile” need not be exhausted. On the least stringent test, remedies with “no reasonable prospec t of suc c ess” need not be exhausted. The ILC rejec ted these two options in favour of the third, whic h it understood as a middle ground ( _Yearbook of the International Law Commission_ , _2006_ at p 47). Under the third test, there is no need to exhaust loc al remedies if there is “no reasonable possibility of effec tive redress”. This latter test derives from Judge Lauterpac ht’s separate opinion in _Case of Certain Norwegian Loans (France v Norway)_ [1957] ICJ 9 at 39–40. 

301    Artic le 15(a) of the Draft artic les thus embodies the two elements of availability and effec tiveness, both of whic h must be viewed through the prism of what is reasonable. _Brownlie_ summarises the two elements in these terms: “an effec tive remedy must be available ‘as a matter of reasonable possibility’” (at p 713). 

302    The ILC noted that the threshold set by Art 15(a) reflec ted judic ial dec isions on the exhaustion of loc al remedies ( _Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2006_ at p 47). These dec isions have held that there is no need to exhaust loc al remedies in, amongst others, the following sc enarios: 

 (a) the loc al c ourt is unable to grant the relief sought – whether bec ause it lac ks jurisdic tion over the dispute in question, is bound by statute or lac ks the c ompetenc e to grant an appropriate or adequate remedy ( The Panvezys-Saldutiskis Railway Case (Estonia v Lithuania) [1939] PCIJ (ser A/B) No 764 (“the Panvezys-Saldutiskis Railway c ase”) at 18; Claim of Finnish Shipowners Against Great Britain in respect of the Use of Certain Finnish Vessels During the War (Finland v UK) (1934) 3 RIAA 1479 (“ Finnish Ships Arbitration ”) at 1497); 

 (b) a point of law whic h c ould have been taken on appeal has previously been dec ided by the highest c ourt in a manner adverse to the foreign national, or there is a c onsistent and wellestablished line of prec edents adverse to the foreign national (the Panvezys-Saldutiskis Railway c ase at 18; Finnish Ships Arbitration at 1495); 

 (c ) the only issue on appeal would be one of fac t and the higher c ourts lac k the power to review findings of fac t ( Finnish Ships Arbitration at 1535; The Ambatielos Claim (Greece, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) 12 RIAA 83 at 119); and 

 (d) the loc al c ourts are notoriously lac king in independenc e or there is evidenc e that the c ourts are subservient to the exec utive ( Robert E Brown (United States) v Great Britain (1923) 6 RIAA 120 at 129). 

303    Importantly, it seems that if there is doubt as to whether an effec tive loc al remedy is available due to the absenc e of judic ial prec edent on the point, an international tribunal should not lightly c onc lude that there is no suc h remedy. The following authorities support this proposition: 

 (a) In the Panvezys-Saldutiskis Railway c ase, Estonia argued that there was no effec tive 


 remedy bec ause the Lithuanian c ourts would not take jurisdic tion over an ac t of State. The Permanent Court of International Justic e rejec ted this argument on the basis that there was no Lithuanian c ourt dec ision on the point. The Court rec ognised that “whether or not the Lithuanian c ourts [had] jurisdic tion to entertain a partic ular suit depend[ed] on Lithuanian law” and was a matter “on whic h the Lithuanian c ourts alone [c ould] pronounc e a final dec ision” (at 19). It took the position that until it had been “c learly shown” that the Lithuanian c ourts had no jurisdic tion to entertain the putative suit, it c ould not ac c ept Estonia’s argument that Lithuanian law afforded no means of redress (at 19). 

 ( b ) Amerasinghe also supports this proposition in disc ussing the Case Concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited [1970] ICJ 3. In that c ase, the Spanish Government c ontended that, where there was doubt as to whether a given remedy c ould offer a c hanc e of suc c ess, that point should be submitted to the loc al c ourts without an assumption being made that the remedy was ineffec tive. The Belgian Government argued that, in suc h a c ase, the test of effic ac y depended on the expressions of opinion by c ommentators on the law. Amerasinghe asserts at p 191 that “the better view seems to be that of the Spanish government”: the mere absenc e of a jurisprudence constante on the futility of a remedy is insuffic ient to displac e the duty to resort to the remedy, even if the prevailing c onsensus among c ommentators is that the remedy is futile (at pp 206–208). 

 (c ) Amerasinghe also states at p 204 that “it must be quite c lear ac c ording to the law of the host or respondent state that the remedy in question is inapplic able to the c laimant’s c ase”. 

 ( d ) Brownlie observes at p 713 that “the loc al law may be unc ertain and an international tribunal should show c aution in drawing c onc lusions on the non-availability of a loc al remedy”. 

(2) Exhaustion 

304    In the _ELSI_ c ase, the ICJ remarked at [59] as follows: 

 ... [T]he loc al remedies rule does not, indeed c annot, require that a c laim be presented to the munic ipal c ourts in a form, and with arguments, suited to an international tribunal, applying different law to different parties: for an international c laim to be admissible, it is suffic ient if the essence of the claim has been brought before the competent tribunals and pursued as far as permitted by local law and procedures , and without suc c ess. 

 [emphasis added] 

The passage identifies two elements of the exhaustion requirement. First, the foreign national must raise the basic arguments that he intends to raise in international proc eedings in the loc al proc eedings. Sec ondly, the foreign national must sec ure a final dec ision on the matter. If loc al law permits an appeal to the highest c ourt, the foreign national must appeal or, at the least, apply for leave to appeal ( _Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2006_ at p 45). 

_Application to OS 492_ 

305    The majority c orrec tly noted that whether loc al remedies have been exhausted must be evaluated with referenc e to the _shuttering dispute_ , not the expropriation dispute. The Kingdom’s proc eedings in the domestic c ourts regarding the Mining Leases are thus not relevant, either as remedies whic h have already been exhausted or as remedies whic h have not been pursued to c ompletion. For this reason _Van Zyl v South Africa_ (see [283(b)] above) is also irrelevant, sinc e it 


deals entirely with the expropriation dispute. The key question therefore is whether there are loc al remedies that address the termination of the defendants’ right to refer the expropriation dispute to the SADC Tribunal, whic h the defendants have not resorted to. 

306    I disagree with the majority that the defendants exhausted loc al remedies. In partic ular, it is c lear that the Kingdom’s domestic c ourts rec ognise an Aquilian ac tion. What is perhaps less c lear or even unc lear is whether suc h an ac tion is available in a c ase suc h this. Having said that, there is insuffic ient material before me to draw the c onc lusion that suc h an ac tion would be unavailable or ineffec tive. I therefore find that this is a remedy whic h ought to have been pursued by the defendants in order to satisfy the loc al remedies requirement in Art 28(1) of Annex 1. 

307    First, the c ase of _Moiloa v Raohang_ (see [283(a)] above), c ited by Justic e Nienaber (himself a retired Judge of the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Afric a), shows that the Kingdom rec ognises c laims for pure ec onomic loss, although the fac ts of that c ase were different. The c ause of ac tion was theft of the respondent’s bric k-making mac hine. The Court of Appeal held at [10], “A delic tual c laim founded on _dolus_ will entitle the c laimant to rec over a pure ec onomic loss he or she may have suffered.” It c ited two South Afric an authorities on Aquilian liability for this proposition: _Minister of Finance and Others v Gore NO_ [2006] SCA 97 (RSA) (“ _Gore NO_ ”) at [81]–[90] and _Mediterranean Shipping Co (Pty) Ltd v Tebe Trading (Pty) Ltd_ 2008 (6) SA 595 (SCA) (“ _Mediterranean Shipping_ ”) at [14]. The Kingdom also referred to a South Afric an treatise, J Neethling, J M Potgieter & P J Visser, _Law of Delict_ (LexisNexis, 7th Ed, 2015) (“ _Law of Delict_ ”) at pp 305–308, whic h states that “the Aquilian ac tion is in princ iple available to c laim damages for pure ec onomic loss” provided that the wrongdoer’s c onduc t “c ompl[ies] with the general delic tual requirements”. These requirements inc lude wrongfulness and fault ( _Mediterranean Shipping_ at [14]). The treatise states that “a general duty to prevent pure ec onomic loss for other persons does not exist” but “it must be determined in eac h c ase whether, ac c ording to the c irc umstanc es, there was a legal duty to avoid pure ec onomic loss”. This determination requires the c ourt to exerc ise “a value judgment embrac ing all relevant fac ts and involving c onsiderations of polic y” ( _Law of Delict_ at pp 307–308). 

308    It is c lear that, under South Afric an law, an Aquilian ac tion c an give rise to liability for pure ec onomic loss. For example, in _Trustees for the Time Being of Two Oceans Aquarium Trust v Kantey & Templer_ [2005] ZASCA 109, the trustees brought a delic tual ac tion for the loss of revenue resulting from the temporary c losure of the Two Oc eans Aquarium, due to c ertain defec ts in the aquarium’s tanks for whic h the respondent engineering c ompany was responsible. The Supreme Court of Appeal stated at [10] that whether pure ec onomic loss was ac tionable “depend[ed] on the existenc e of a legal duty”. Whether suc h a duty existed was “a matter for judic ial determination” based on the test of whether “public or legal polic y c onsiderations require[d] that suc h c onduc t, if negligent, is ac tionable; that legal liability for the resulting damages should follow” (at [12]). This c ase and others (see _Country Cloud Trading CC v MEC, Department of Infrastructure Development_ [2013] ZASCA 161; _Fourway Haulage SA (Pty) Ltd v SA National Roads Agency Ltd_ [2008] ZASCA 134) support the rec ognition of an Aquilian ac tion in South Afric a. They make it c lear that “in c ases of pure ec onomic loss the question will always be whether c onsiderations of public or legal polic y dic tate that delic tual liability should be extended to loss resulting from the c onduc t at issue” ( _Gore NO_ at [87]). I ac c ept the Kingdom’s submission that there is some reason to believe that its c ourts would likely take a similar approac h. 

309    On the other hand, the defendants were unable to persuade me that an Aquilian ac tion was unavailable. Notably, _the defendants did not assert that such an action was unavailable or did not suit the facts of the present case_. They simply submitted that the South Afric an dec isions were all “distinguishable on the fac ts and far from analogous to any c ase that the [d]efendants c ould have theoretic ally brought” on the fac ts of the present c ase. I agree that the dec isions c ited above are 


fac tually distinguishable from the present c ase and it might well take a signific ant extension of the c ases for the Kingdom’s c ourts to admit the defendants’ c laim for loss of opportunity arising from the Government’s ac ts on an international plane. However, as I have said at [303] above, the mere absenc e of judic ial authority showing that the remedy would be available does not justify c onc luding that it is unavailable. By analogy with the _Panvezys-Saldutiskis_ c ase (see [302(a)] above), whether or not the Kingdom’s c ourts would rec ognise an Aquilian ac tion in these fac tual c irc umstanc es is a matter of Lesotho law. If the Kingdom’s existing c ase law does not show whether their c ourts would or would not rec ognise it, it would be premature for me to infer that they would not, unless that is c learly proven. There must first be some evidenc e positively demonstrating that the remedy is ineffec tive – for example, a c onsistent and well-established line of prec edents adverse to the c omplainant (see [302(b)] above). But the defendants have not c ited any authorities or sourc es to show, for example, that there are elements of an Aquilian ac tion that are not made out even assuming that eac h of the defendants’ c ontentions is true, or that the Kingdom’s c ourts have rejec ted an Aquilian c laim or dec lined jurisdic tion in other c ases fac tually similar to this. The defendants’ submissions amount to nothing more than a bare assertion. No expert testimony was led by the defendants before the PCA Tribunal on this issue. 

310    I note that in the _ELSI_ c ase, the ICJ rejec ted Italy’s c ontention that the c laimants ought to have brought an ac tion in the Italian c ourts under Art 2043 of the Italian Civil Code despite it being “impossible to deduc e ... what the attitude of the Italian c ourts would have been” to suc h an ac tion (at [62]). However, the c ase is not analogous to the present one and should not be taken to suggest that ambiguity as to the availability of relief should be determined in the defendants’ favour. In the _ELSI_ c ase: 

 (a) one of the c laimants had previously c onsulted two Italian jurists on the question of loc al remedies for the purposes of a diplomatic c laim, and it did not oc c ur to either of them to refer to Art 2043 even as a possibility (at [62]); 

 (b) Italy was unable to c ite any c ases under Art 2043 suggesting its availability in this c ase, c iting only c ases on other provisions of the Italian Civil Code (at [62]); 

 (c ) the c laimants’ trustee in bankruptc y had already c ommenc ed an ac tion in the Italian c ourts whic h was of the same substanc e as the c laimants’ c omplaint, and the damages awarded therein passed into the pool of realised assets to be distributed amongst ELSI’s c reditors, inc luding the c laimants (at [58] and [60]); and 

 (d) there was already a great “deal of litigation in the munic ipal c ourts” about what was in substanc e the c laim before the ICJ; it was therefore “for Italy to demonstrate that there was nevertheless some loc al remedy that had not been tried; or at least, not exhausted” (at [59]). 

311    In other words, fac tors (a) and (b) gave some indic ation that Art 2043 would not yield relief. In fac t _Amerasinghe_ observes that “the established law worked definitely against [Italy’s] c ontentions” (at p 206). Moreover, various ac tions had already been c ommenc ed in the domestic c ourts and it would have been unreasonable to deny the c laimants’ c laim in the ICJ simply on the basis that they should have made an attempt under Art 2043 spec ific ally. By c ontrast, in the present c ase the defendants have not shown that an Aquilian ac tion would be unavailable on the fac ts, and they even ac knowledge that no steps have been taken in the Kingdom’s legal system regarding the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal. 

312    I next turn to the question of whether an Aquilian ac tion would provide effec tive redress. In this regard, the defendants c ontended that the quantum of c ompensation in an Aquilian ac tion would 


be so meagre as to be “utterly futile”. They made three submissions under this head. 

 (a) First, none of the South Afric an prec edents c ited by the Kingdom “demonstrate[d] that the full measure of c ompensation sought in the SADC Tribunal Claim would have been available to the [d]efendants”. The defendants ac c epted that an Aquilian ac tion c ould c ompensate them for the damage c aused by the loss of opportunity to bring a c laim before the SADC Tribunal, but submitted that this sum would fall short of the sum whic h the SADC Tribunal would have awarded as c ompensation for the Kingdom’s expropriation of the Mining Leases. Even if that is true (whic h the Kingdom denies), I do not ac c ept that that is the c orrec t standard. It is self-evident that the wrongdoing alleged in this c ase – ie , the defendants’ loss of opportunity to have their c laim adjudic ated by the SADC Tribunal – is addressed by any remedy whic h c ompensates for loss of that opportunity. The defendants’ approac h mistakenly measures the effec tiveness of an Aquilian ac tion against the yardstic k of c ompensation for expropriation of the Mining Leases, whic h is not the subjec t of the dispute in this c ase. They c onflate the measure of c ompensation for loss of an opportunity to bring a c laim with the c ompensation in respec t of that c laim. It is self-evident that the two are not the same. It would seem that the majority fell into the same error by fashioning the remedy as the c onstitution of a new tribunal to hear the SADC c laim on the basis that c ompensation for loss of a right to bring the c laim would not suffic e (see [281]–[282] above). 

 (b) Sec ondly, the defendants submitted that an Aquilian ac tion was not a remedy that “c ould have restored [them] to the position they were in before”. It was not c lear whether the defendants were referring to the position they were in before their Mining Leases were allegedly expropriated or the position they were in before the SADC Tribunal was shuttered. In any event, no authorities were c ited to support suc h a stringent test, whic h bears greater resemblanc e to expec tation loss in c ontrac t law than to the test of effec tiveness of relief under the exhaustion of loc al remedies princ iple in international law. I therefore see no reason to apply it. 

 (c ) Thirdly, the defendants submitted that any judgment that c ould have been obtained from the domestic c ourts “would not have been an ac c eptable substitute for an arbitral award by an international tribunal that c ould be enforc ed in other c ountries”. However, I fail to see the relevanc e of enforc ement in other c ountries: if the Lesotho c ourts were to give judgment for the defendants, the Kingdom would be bound to c ompensate the defendants pursuant to that judgment. The relief would therefore be effec tive without having to be enforc ed in other jurisdic tions. In any event, the defendants have erred in c omparing the effec tiveness of the loc al remedy against that of an international arbitral award. That is inc orrec t bec ause a loc al remedy need not be c apable of yielding the exac t same relief as the international tribunal was able to award. Brownlie explains at p 711 that the c omplainant’s duty is to use “suc h loc al proc edures as are available to protec t interests whic h c orrespond as c losely as may be and in prac tic al terms with the interests involved in a subsequent international c laim”. The passage from the ELSI c ase that I c ited at [304] above further reinforc es that the two regimes c annot be c ompared. 

313    The defendants also submitted that any remedy that might be given in an Aquilian ac tion would be “illusory”. In this regard, I c annot ac c ept the defendants’ imputation of partiality to the Kingdom’s domestic c ourts. I note that those same c ourts had found in the defendants’ favour during the years in whic h the Kingdom allegedly expropriated the Mining Leases. For example, the High Court dec lared the Kingdom’s 1992 Revoc ation Order null and void in 1994; the Court of Appeal affirmed that dec laration in 1995; and in 1995 the High Court also granted an order rec ording the Commissioner of Mines’ agreement to set aside the purported c anc ellation of the Mining Leases in 1991 (see [23] and [25] above). The ineffec tiveness of domestic legal proc eedings might be inferred where the loc al c ourts were “notoriously lac king in independenc e” ( _Yearbook of the International Law Commission_ , _2006_ at p 47) or where it is “c learly established” that “the supreme judic ial tribunal is under the 


c ontrol of the exec utive organ whose ac ts are the subjec t matter of the c omplaint” ( _Oppenheim_ at p 525). No evidenc e has been produc ed in this regard. All the defendants have is a mere unsubstantiated suspic ion of bias, whic h does not suffic e. 

314    I also rejec t the defendants’ submission that the GPCA renders any ac tion in the domestic c ourts illusory. Although this was a matter of Lesotho law, I did not rec eive any expert assistanc e on the c orrec t approac h to interpreting the GPCA under the laws of the Kingdom. I have therefore proc eeded, and the parties seemed c ontent to submit, on the basis that I c ould approac h the interpretation of the GPCA the same way I would any Singaporean statute. 

315    Sec tion 2 of the GPCA permits legal proc eedings to be brought against the Government and s 3(1) provides for the Princ ipal Legal Adviser to be the “nominal defendant or respondent” in any suc h ac tion. Sec tion 5 states: 

 No exec ution or attac hment or proc ess in the nature thereof shall be issued against the nominal defendant or respondent in any ac tion or other proc eedings against Her Majesty in [Lesotho] or against any property of Her Majesty; but the nominal defendant or respondent may c ause to be paid out of the revenues of [Lesotho] suc h money as may, by a judgment or order of the c ourt, be awarded to the plaintiff, the applic ant or the petitioner (as the c ase may be). 

316    The effec t of s 5 is to prohibit exec ution against, or attac hment of property of the Crown or of the nominal defendant; it does not prohibit the payment of damages out of the Kingdom’s revenues, whic h is surely the remedy that the defendants seek. The defendants have not disc harged the burden of establishing that the c ourts would either refuse suc h a remedy or that the Kingdom would refuse to c omply with a c ourt judgment requiring it to pay the defendants. I am therefore unable to c onc lude that an Aquilian ac tion would not provide effec tive redress on that basis. 

317    Finally, the Kingdom also submitted that it was possible for the defendants to bring a c onstitutional c laim analogous to that sought by the Law Soc iety of South Afric a (see [287(b)] above). Unfortunately c ounsel for the defendants did not address this possibility in either written or oral submissions. However, no Lesotho authorities were c ited to me by the Kingdom, and I have doubts whether suc h a c laim would be available. In partic ular, I note that s 4(1) of the Constitution of the Kingdom limits its applic ation to “every person in Lesotho”, and I am not c onfident that the sec ond to fourth defendants would fall within this c ategory. The JVZF Trust and the Burmilla Trust, the latter of whic h holds 90% of the shares in Swissbourgh as well as the rights of Swissbourgh and the Tributees against the Kingdom in respec t of the Mining Leases, are established under the laws of South Afric a, and Mr Van Zyl is a South Afric an national. I shall say no more on this topic. 

318    While it is not c lear whether the c ourts would have ruled in the defendants’ favour in an Aquilian ac tion, it suffic es that this was an avenue open to the defendants that appears to have been c apable of affording effec tive relief. The threshold for c onc luding that loc al remedies have been exhausted (due to the unavailability or ineffec tiveness of loc al remedies) has not been c rossed. It would therefore not be right to deprive the Kingdom’s munic ipal legal system of any opportunity to address the wrong that the defendants c laim they have suffered. The majority’s approac h was erroneous. As I have said at [312(a)] above, in taking the view that an Aquilian ac tion would be inadequate relief bec ause it might not yield the full measure of c ompensation sought by the defendants, the majority appears to have treated the dispute at hand as the expropriation dispute. But the true dispute c onc erns the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal, not the expropriation of the Mining Leases. Thus the effec tiveness of domestic relief must be analysed in terms of whether it adequately addressed the defendants’ loss of opportunity to have their c laim dec ided by the SADC Tribunal. 


319    I note that there may be some tension between the Kingdom’s position (whic h I agree with at [196] above) that the sec ondary right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal is not one whic h exists as a matter of Lesotho law, and their position here that the domestic c ourts would order relief in an Aquilian ac tion brought on the fac ts of this c ase. The argument might c onc eivably be made that if the Lesotho c ourts were to grant relief in this c ase, that would imply rec ognition of the defendants’ sec ondary right to refer the shuttering dispute to the SADC Tribunal. Suc h rec ognition might amount to a link between the defendants’ sec ondary right and the Kingdom’s domestic legal system. However, no suc h argument was raised and I do not have to rule on it. It is not nec essary for me to find that the defendants would positively suc c eed in an Aquilian ac tion on these fac ts; that is a matter for the Lesotho c ourts to dec ide. I find simply that there is insuffic ient evidenc e to c onc lude that they would not suc c eed, and the loc al remedies requirement is therefore unsatisfied. 

**Sixth objection: whether the defendants were “investors”** 

320    Another jurisdic tional objec tion raised by the Kingdom was that Swissbourgh and the Tributees were not c apable of qualifying as “investors” for the purposes of Art 28(1) of Annex 1. However, this objec tion appears to be largely ac ademic. Although the PCA Tribunal found that all nine defendants were c apable of being “investors” regardless of whether they were domestic or foreign, it also found that Swissbourgh and the Tributees had assigned their rights to pursue their c laims against the Kingdom for its alleged expropriation of rights under the Mining Leases and Tributing Agreements to the Burmilla Trust. This assignment was not denied by either the defendants or the Kingdom (Award at [7.77]). As a result, the PCA Tribunal found that the sec ond to fourth defendants were “the proper parties to pursue the ... c laim”. Swissbourgh and the Tributees were not “investors” for the purposes of Art 28(1) of Annex 1 and their c laims were dismissed. In the Interpretation (see [52] above), the PCA Tribunal further c larified that it only had jurisdic tion over the sec ond to fourth defendants and c ould not make (and had not made) any order _vis-à-vis_ Swissbourgh and the Tributees. There was henc e no basis on whic h I c ould set aside the Award for exc ess of jurisdic tion _ratione personae_. 

321    The defendants, on the other hand, sought to persuade me that the PCA Tribunal had erred in finding that it lac ked jurisdic tion over Swissbourgh and the Tributees. But the defendants had not applied to set the Award aside, either in whole or in part, and it was not c lear what remedy they had in mind. Although parties did not address me on this point, I have doubts whether this c ourt has jurisdic tion to review that ruling or set the Award (or that part of the Award pertaining to lac k of jurisdic tion over Swissbourgh and the Tributees) aside on that ground at the _defendants’ instance_ , for the following reasons: 

 (a) The c ourt’s jurisdic tion to set aside an arbitral award derives from either s 10 or s 24 of the IAA, or Art 34 of the Model Law. The limbs in s 24 are not made out, leaving s 10 of the IAA and Art 34. 

 (b) However, the defendants did not bring an applic ation under s 10 of the IAA. While the Kingdom filed OS 492 under s 10(3) of the IAA, it only did so in respec t of the PCA Tribunal’s positive jurisdic tional ruling. 

 (c ) Turning to Art 34 of the Model Law, none of the limbs in Art 34 appears to envisage a situation where the arbitral tribunal wrongly found that it lacked jurisdic tion over a party to the dispute. In partic ular, Art 34(2)( a )(i) is for setting aside a positive jurisdic tional ruling ( ie , that the tribunal did have jurisdic tion over the parties). It was for this reason that s 10 of the IAA was amended to allow the supervisory c ourt to review a negative jurisdic tional ruling. 

322    For these reasons, I am not c onfident that I would have the jurisdic tion to order any relief 


even if I were to disagree with the PCA Tribunal’s finding that it lac ked jurisdic tion over Swissbourgh and the Tributees. Nevertheless, sinc e parties addressed this objec tion in their submissions, I will give my reasons for my view that Swissbourgh and the Tributees are not “investors” for the purposes of Art 28(1) of Annex 1 and that the PCA Tribunal was right to find that it lac ked jurisdic tion over them (albeit on different grounds). 

**_PCA Tribunal’s findings_** 

323    The PCA Tribunal addressed the three following questions (Award at [7.65]). First, c ould Swissbourgh and the Tributees be “investors” for the purposes of Art 28(1) given that they were loc ally inc orporated c ompanies? Sec ondly, were the JVZF Trust and the Burmilla Trust (the third and fourth defendants) “persons” c apable of bringing a c laim under Art 28(1)? Thirdly, was the Burmilla Trust the only entity with rights whic h were c apable of being the subjec t of a c laim under Art 28(1) of Annex 1? 

324    I will only summarise the PCA Tribunal’s findings on the first question, sinc e that is the c rux of the parties’ disagreement in OS 492. The PCA Tribunal found that Art 28(1) was available to both loc al and foreign investors. The term “investor” was defined in Art 1(2) of Annex 1 as “a person who has been admitted to make or has made an investment”, without distinguishing between loc al and foreign persons. “Person” was in turn defined as “a natural person or a c ompany”, and “c ompany” was in turn defined as “any entity c onstituted or organised under the applic able laws of any State...”. These definitions drew no distinc tion between the host State and other States and the PCA Tribunal refused to imply “an additional requirement” into the Investment Protoc ol (at [7.71]). While it was “unusual to find an investment treaty that applies to both foreign and domestic investors alike” sinc e most investment treaties expressly exc luded domestic investors from bringing c laims against their own government, no suc h provision was found in the SADC Treaty and Investment Protoc ol (at [7.68]). Swissbourgh and the Tributees thus fell within the plain reading of the definition of “investor”. 

325    The PCA Tribunal also relied on _Mike Campbell (Pvt) Limited and William Michael Campbell v The Republic of Zimbabwe_ , SADC(T) Case No 2/2007, [2008] SADCT 2 (“ _Mike Campbell_ ”), a ruling in the _Campbell v Zimbabwe_ c ase in whic h the SADC Tribunal c onfirmed that a domestic entity c ould bring a c ase against its own government under Art 15(1) of the Tribunal Protoc ol (Award at [7.69]). Although this c ase did not involve the Investment Protoc ol spec ific ally, the SADC Member States would have made it amply c lear had they intended jurisdic tion to differ between the Tribunal Protoc ol and the Investment Protoc ol. 

**_Parties’ submissions_** 

326    The Kingdom disagreed with the PCA Tribunal’s finding that Swissbourgh and the Tributees were c apable of qualifying as “investors” for the purposes of Art 28(1), as they were inc orporated under the laws of the Kingdom. The PCA Tribunal had erred by overemphasising the express wording of Annex 1 at the expense of the c ontext of Art 28(1) and the objec t and purpose of the Investment Protoc ol. The Kingdom desc ribed the PCA Tribunal’s finding that Annex 1 applied to domestic investors as “unprec edented” and a “departure from well-established princ iples of international law”. Other multilateral treaties like the NAF TA, the Central Americ an Free Trade Agreement (2004) 43 ILM 514 (“the CAF TA”) and the Energy Charter Treaty (17 Dec ember 1994) 2080 UNTS 95 (entered into forc e 16 April 1998) (“the ECT”) applied only to foreign investors. In this regard, the Kingdom c ited _Bayview Irrigation District et al v United Mexican States_ , ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/05/1, Award, 19 June 2007. In rejec ting a c laim by US nationals who had made an investment in the US but alleged that this investment was being adversely affec ted by measures taken by Mexic o, the tribunal stated at [95]– [96]: 


95\. If, however, the NAF TA were intended to have suc h a signific ant effec t one would expec t to find very c lear indic ations of it in the _travaux préparatoires_. There are no suc h c lear indic ations, in the _travaux préparatoires_ or elsewhere ... 

96\. While NAF TA Artic le 1139 defines the term “investment” it does not define “foreign investment”. Similarly, NAF TA Chapter XI is named “Investment”, not “Foreign Investment”.     However, this Tribunal c onsiders that NAF TA Chapter XI in fac t refers to “foreign investment” and that it regulates “foreign investors” and “investments of foreign investors of another Party”. The ordinary meaning of the text of the relevant provisions of Chapter Eleven is that they are c onc erned with _foreign_ investment, not domestic investments. ... 

327    The Kingdom also identified various features of Annex 1 whic h revealed that its sc ope related to _foreign_ investors and _foreign_ investment. I inc lude these where relevant at [331] below. 

328    The Kingdom also submitted that the effec t of extending Annex 1 to domestic investors would be to introduc e “an additional tier to the judic ial system of eac h SADC State”, whic h would be “extraordinary and entirely inc onsistent with the sc ope of protec tion in both bilateral and multilateral investment treaties”. If that had been the Member States’ intention, they would surely have inc orporated express words to that effec t. 

329    Finally, the Kingdom c ritic ised the PCA Tribunal’s relianc e on _Mike Campbell_ (see [325] above), whic h had been dec ided in the materially different c ontext of Art 15 of the Tribunal Protoc ol. This c ould not be c ompared to Art 28 of Annex 1. _Mike Campbell_ c onc erned a c laim brought by a Zimbabwean national against Zimbabwe for breac h of the obligation to respec t human rights under Art 4 of the SADC Treaty. The Kingdom pointed out that human rights obligations apply to nationals and aliens without distinc tion. By c ontrast, in the Kingdom’s words, the “appropriate starting point [in an investment treaty] is that there is an important distinc tion (as a matter of general international law) between the status and treatment of nationals and aliens”. 

**_My analysis_** 

330    I agree that the definitions of “investor”, “person” and “c ompany” in Art 1 of Annex 1 do not expressly exc lude Lesotho nationals or c ompanies from being investors. However, the meaning to be attributed to the term “investors” is to be asc ertained with referenc e to the ordinary meaning of that t erm _in its context and in the light of the object and purpose of Annex 1_ (and more broadly the Investment Protoc ol and the SADC Treaty) ( _cf_ [95] above). Obviously, having the _travaux préparatoires_ before me would have been of signific ant assistanc e in this regard. In my view, the c ontext of Annex 1’s disc ussion of investment, together with the objec t and purpose of Annex 1, the Investment Protoc ol and the SADC Treaty, strongly indic ate that Annex 1 is intended to attrac t and protec t _foreign_ investors within eac h host State. 

331    The obvious purpose of the Investment Protoc ol is to inc entivise investment by providing various protec tions to investors; the SADC Member States would hardly need to resort to a regional multilateral treaty to inc entivise investments by their own nationals. In this regard, Annex 1 bears numerous indic ations of its orientation towards foreign investments, inc luding the following. 

 (a) The Preamble to Annex 1 generally reflec ts a c onc ern that the SADC region as a whole does not rec eive suffic ient investment. The Preamble notes “the low levels of investment into the SADC”, rec ommends greater regional c ooperation to “enhanc e the attrac tiveness of the Region as [an] investment destination”, notes that “without effec tive polic ies on investment protec tion and promotion, the Region will c ontinue to be marginalised in terms of investment inflows”, and 


 expresses a desire to be guided by the Investment Protoc ol “in the fac ilitation and stimulation of investment flows ... into the Region”. These phrases show that the purpose of Annex 1 is not to inc entivise nationals to invest in their own States but to make the region as a whole more desirable to external investors. 

 (b) This is reinforc ed by Arts 19 and 23 of Annex 1. Artic le 19 requires Member States to “pursue harmonisation with the objec tive of developing the region into a SADC investment zone”. Artic le 23 c reates c ertain obligations on Member States vis-à-vis their Investment Promotion Agenc ies, defined in Art 1 as agenc ies whic h, inter alia , “develop a favourable investment image of their c ountries”, “make rec ommendations for improvements of their c ountries as investment destinations” and “keep trac k of all investors entering and leaving the c ountry...”. These artic les thus give effec t to the Preamble’s foc us on attrac ting external investors to eac h SADC Member State. 

 (c ) Artic le 3 of Annex 1 obliges Member States to support the development of loc al and regional entrepreneurs, but allows Member States to “plac e emphasis on industries that ... have a favourable effec t on attrac ting foreign direc t investment”: see Art 3(2) of Annex 1. 

 (d) Artic le 9 of Annex 1 provides that eac h Member State shall “ensure that investors are allowed fac ilities in relation to repatriation of investments and returns in ac c ordanc e with the rules and regulations stipulated by the Host State”. This is a protec tion that c an only apply to foreign investors. 

 (e) Artic le 28(1) of Annex 1 provides for the settlement of investment disputes by “international arbitration” (by either the SADC Tribunal, ICSID or an international arbitrator or ad hoc arbitral tribunal, as spec ified in Art 28(2)). Notably, c laims by nationals of the host State are expressly exc luded from the sc ope of the ICSID Convention by Art 25(1) thereof. The fac t that only international arbitration is provided for, and that ICSID is one of the options, suggests that the types of disputes whic h Art 28(1) envisages are those whic h arise between the host State and a foreign investor. 

332    This analysis is supported by the requirement of exhaustion of loc al remedies in Art 28(1) of Annex 1. As I have observed at [293] above, the requirement serves to protec t State sovereignty. Without suc h a requirement, foreign nationals would be free to leapfrog the domestic legal system and take their c omplaints direc tly to international entities. The requirement of exhausting loc al remedies is thus inc luded in Art 28(1) to protec t Member States from being held internationally responsible by foreign investors without having an opportunity to remedy the wrong internally. It reinforc es the Investment Protoc ol’s foc us on foreign investment. 

333    The fac t that Annex 1 does not _expressly_ c onfine its terms to foreign investors is not so c ompelling as to outweigh the c lear c ontext, objec t and purpose of Annex 1. On the c ontrary, it is diffic ult to believe that if SADC Member States did intend to c onfer treaty protec tions on domestic investors, whic h would trigger broad-ranging and signific ant legal c onsequenc es (not least the _de facto_ c reation of a new tier to the judic ial system for domestic investors), they would have neglec ted to provide for and regulate these c onsequenc es expressly. That is far less plausible than the alternative, _ie_ , the SADC Member States did not intend to trigger suc h c onsequenc es although they did not expressly say so. The definition of “investment” in Annex 1 is one whic h, if applied to nationals, would invariably inc lude every national who had ever purc hased property, ac quired c ompany shares or ac quired lic enc es to exploit natural resourc es (amongst others). Extending treaty protec tions to nationals would c onstitute a signific ant intrusion into the sovereignty and freedoms of eac h Member State. Indeed, it seems quite extraordinary to c onc lude as suc h in the absenc e of c lear 


and explic it language. Construing Annex 1 in suc h a way c ontradic ts the princ iple that treaties must be interpreted with due rec ognition to the interests of the negotiating States and their sovereignty (see [100]–[101] above). 

334    In addition, various c onc epts in Art 28(1) do not easily lend themselves, without modific ation, to domestic investments. For example, the c onc ept of “admission” is one whic h relates to the host State granting permission to a foreign investor to invest in the territory of the host State provided it c omplies with the host State’s laws and regulations. In the c ase of a domestic investor, it is not c lear what the proc ess of “admission” would entail: the only relevant laws and regulations would be domestic laws, for example those pertaining to the purc hase of property, ac quisition of shares and so on. 

335    I disagree with the PCA Tribunal’s view that _Mike Campbell_ is “persuasive authority” for the proposition that a domestic entity may sue its own government under the Investment Protoc ol (Award at [7.69]). As the Kingdom pointed out, the respec tive c ontexts of the two c ases are inc omparable. _Mike Campbell_ rec ognised that a national may sue his own State in the SADC Tribunal for breac h of _human rights_ , whic h is a breac h of Art 4(c ) of the SADC Treaty. This rec ognition must be read in light of (a) the objec tives of the SADC Treaty and (b) the jurisdic tional c onditions of the SADC Tribunal: 

 (a) The objec tives of the SADC Treaty are not c onfined to the promotion of investments. They inc lude, for example, the alleviation of poverty; the support of the soc ially disadvantaged; the promotion of shared values through institutions whic h are democ ratic , legitimate and effec tive; and the maintenanc e of democ rac y, peac e, sec urity and stability (see Art 5 of the SADC Treaty). These are objec tives whose suc c ess depends signific antly upon the relationship between a host State and its own nationals, and not solely its relationship with foreign nationals. 

 (b) Artic les 14 and 15 of the Tribunal Protoc ol delimit the jurisdic tion of the SADC Tribunal. Artic le 14 spec ifies broad c ategories of disputes within the SADC Tribunal’s jurisdic tion ( eg , the interpretation and applic ation of the Treaty and all protoc ols). Artic le 15 of the Tribunal Protoc ol gives the SADC Tribunal jurisdic tion over disputes between natural persons and States. The SADC Tribunal’s jurisdic tion is therefore not c onfined to disputes c onc erning spec ific subjec t-matter or persons suing in a partic ular c apac ity. The SADC Tribunal serves as the general adjudic ative body of the SADC, and the breadth of its jurisdic tion mirrors the SADC’s varied objec tives. 

336    Artic le 28(1) of Annex 1, on the other hand, c reates a muc h narrower avenue for submitting a dispute to international arbitration. 

 (a) First, Art 28(1) resides in Annex 1, whic h has a far more c irc umsc ribed purpose than the overarc hing SADC Treaty. I have already explained that the wording and provisions of Annex 1 suggest that its aim is to attrac t foreign investment into eac h Member State, an objec tive whic h bears no relation to the relationship between eac h host State and its own nationals. It c learly c annot be assumed, for the purposes of c omparing Mike Campbell to the present c ase, that the international arbitral body referred to in Art 28(2) shares the same purpose and func tion as the SADC Tribunal, unless of c ourse the SADC Tribunal is selec ted as the mode of dispute resolution pursuant to Art 28(2)( a ). But even then, the SADC Tribunal would have to fulfil this role with regard to the terms of referenc e of Art 28(1), whic h is limited to investment disputes only. 

 (b) Sec ondly, the right to refer disputes to international arbitration under Art 28(1) is limited exc lusively to persons suing in a partic ular c apac ity ( ie , as investors) and to disputes with a spec ific subjec t-matter ( ie , c onc erning a host State’s obligations in relation to an admitted investment). 


337    Clearly, the SADC Tribunal and the international arbitral body in Art 28(2) of Annex 1 do not fulfil the same purpose and func tion, and they have different jurisdic tional c onditions. As suc h, _Mike Campbell_ c annot be “persuasive authority” that a national may bring a c laim against his own Member State under Art 28(1). 

338    For the reasons I have stated above, I do not think that Art 28(1) of Annex 1 was intended to ac c ommodate domestic investors. In reac hing this c onc lusion, I plac e no weight on the NAF TA, the CAF TA and the ECT. The mere fac t that other investment treaties are exc lusively c onc erned with foreign investors, without more, says nothing about the proper interpretation of Annex 1. My c onc lusion is c onsistent with the PCA Tribunal’s c onc lusion that it lac ked jurisdic tion _ratione personae_ over Swissbourgh and the Tributees, although its c onc lusion was based on the assignment of their rights to the Burmilla Trust. 

339    In this regard, I note that there is another subsidiary question c onc erning whether the sec ond to fourth defendants are “investors” for the purposes of Annex 1. The sec ond to fourth defendants did not own the Mining Leases and their only c onnec tion to them lies in their ownership of shares in Swissbourgh and the Tributees, from whom the Mining Leases were expropriated. However, the parties did not submit on this before me and it is henc e unnec essary for me to c onsider it. 

**Conclusion on setting aside** 

340    In summary, my c onc lusions on eac h of the Kingdom’s jurisdic tional objec tions are as follows: 

 (a) The dispute submitted to arbitration was the shuttering dispute, whic h was within the PCA Tribunal’s jurisdic tion ratione temporis under Art 28(4) of Annex 1. 

 (b) The defendants’ right to submit disputes to the SADC Tribunal was not an “investment” within the meaning of Art 28(1) of Annex 1. 

 (c ) Nor was it “admitted” for the purposes of Art 28(1) of Annex 1. 

 (d) The shuttering dispute did not c onc ern any obligation of the Kingdom’s in relation to the purported investment ( ie , the defendants’ right to submit disputes to the SADC Tribunal). 

 (e) The defendants failed to exhaust loc al remedies, in partic ular, an Aquilian ac tion for financ ial loss. 

 (f ) Swissbourgh and the Tributees were not “investors” for the purposes of Art 28(1) of Annex 1, and this was c onsistent with the PCA Tribunal’s ruling that it lac ked jurisdic tion over them, although the PCA Tribunal had c ome to that view on different grounds. 

341    It follows that, in my view, the Award dealt with a dispute not c ontemplated by and not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration and thereby fell foul of Art 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) of the Model Law. While the c ourt retains a residual disc retion not to set aside an award even where grounds under Art 34(2) of the Model Law are made out, this disc retion should only be exerc ised “if no prejudic e has been sustained by the aggrieved party” ( _CRW Joint Operation_ at [100]). That is c learly not the c ase here bec ause jurisdic tion has been wrongly assumed. I therefore set aside the Award in entirety. In the c irc umstanc es, there is no need for me to address the Kingdom’s arguments for spec ific ally setting aside only the portion of the Award whic h awarded the c osts of the arbitration to the defendants. I allow prayer 2 of the OS only ( _ie_ , only [53(a)(ii)] above and not [53(a)(i)] or [53(b)]). 


342    As the Kingdom has prevailed in OS 492, I award the c osts of OS 492 to the Kingdom, to be taxed if not agreed. 

343    As I observed earlier, investment treaties are fine-tuned to balanc e the interests of host States and investors, and it would be ultimately c ounterac tive to a treaty’s objec t and purpose to extend its protec tions to situations c learly beyond its c ontemplation. While the defendants are understandably disappointed with the turn their investment has taken, that c annot be c ured by doing violenc e to a dispute resolution provision in the treaty. The defendants’ diffic ulties in establishing jurisdic tion stem from the fac t that their true investment – the Mining Leases – was made before Annex 1’s entry into forc e. The remarks of the tribunal in _Lucchetti v Peru_ at [61] are apt in these c irc umstanc es: 

 Luc c hetti may therefore c onsider it a harsh result that its effort at obtaining an international remedy is brought to a halt before the merits of its c ontentions are even examined. Suc h a c onc lusion, however, would not be warranted in light of the fac t that Luc c hetti did not have an a priori entitlement to this international forum. It c annot say that it made its investment in relianc e on the BIT, for the simple reason that the treaty did not exist until years after Luc c hetti had ac quired the site, built its fac tory, and was well into the sec ond year of full produc tion. It c annot c onc eivably c ontend that it invested in relianc e on the existenc e of this international remedy. 

**Costs of the arbitral proceedings** 

344    That leaves the question of the c osts of the arbitration. Two questions arise. The first is whether the c ourt has jurisdic tion to make an order as to the c osts of the arbitration. The sec ond question is, if so, what c osts order would be appropriate. The Kingdom submitted that the PCA Tribunal was _functus officio_ as regards the question of liability for c osts and urged me to award the c osts of both the arbitration and of OS 492 in its favour. The defendants did not explic itly dispute that I had jurisdic tion to do so but submitted that if I were to set aside the Award, I ought to leave the question of alloc ation of the c osts of the arbitration to the PCA Tribunal, whic h was better-plac ed to deal with that question. 

345    There is doubt as to whether I am able to remit the question of c osts in the arbitration to the PCA Tribunal. The PCA Tribunal would appear to be _functus officio_ , having issued a final and binding award in respec t of the matters submitted to it (s 19B of the IAA; see also _AKN and another v ALC and others and other appeals_ <span class="citation">[2016] 1 SLR 966</span> (“ _AKN v ALC_ ”) at [18]). Artic le 34(4) of the Model Law, whic h exhaustively sets out the c ourt’s power of remission, “does not empower the c ourt to remit any matter _after_ setting aside an award” [emphasis in original] ( _AKN v ALC_ at [22]). 

346    However, in the event that I am unable to remit the question of c osts in the arbitration to the PCA Tribunal, what would bec ome of the c osts in the arbitration? In this regard, I note that s 10(7) of the IAA empowers a High Court Judge who hears an appeal against jurisdic tion under that sec tion to make an order of c osts in the arbitration. But the Award here is being set aside not under s 10 of the IAA but under Art 34 of the Model Law, whic h does not c onfer an equivalent power. In the absenc e of legislative provision, it would seem that there is c ertainly an argument that I have no power to make suc h an order: _Crest Nicholson (Eastern) Limited v Mr and Mrs Western_ [2008] EWHC 1325 (TCC) at [54]. In fac t, s 10(7) of the IAA was introduc ed prec isely to plug suc h a lac una in the c ontext of s 10: see the Law Reform Committee Report at para 31. 

347    Assuming that I have jurisdic tion to make an order of c osts in the arbitration, what should be the quantum? I note that the PCA Tribunal awarded the defendants the c osts of the arbitration _as well as the defendants’ reasonable legal costs_ , whic h the PCA Tribunal desc ribed as a “growing trend 


in investment arbitration” (Award at [10.7]). The PCA Tribunal also set this sum off against c osts whic h the defendants had been ordered to pay the Kingdom in domestic proc eedings in the c ourts of Lesotho. These are issues on whic h the parties did not submit. In the c irc umstanc es, I will hear further submissions from the parties on two issues: (a) whether the c ourt has jurisdic tion to remit the c osts of the arbitration to the PCA Tribunal for assessment or to make an order of the c osts of the arbitration itself; and, (b) the quantum of suc h c osts on the assumption the c ourt has jurisdic tion. 

348    Finally, it leaves me to thank both c ounsel for their exc ellent assistanc e and submissions. Steven Chong J (as he then was) noted in hearing the applic ation for Mr Wordsworth QC’s admission that this was a matter that “tic k[ed] all four boxes of c omplexity, diffic ulty, novelty and prec edential value” ( _Re Wordsworth, Samuel Sherratt QC_ <span class="citation">[2016] 5 SLR 179</span> at [52]). I c ould not agree more. Counsel’s assistanc e was tremendously helpful to me in navigating the diffic ult issues I have had to address.
