_Arbitration_ – _Application for extension of time to apply for leave to appeal_ – _Test for granting for extension of time_ – _Whether applicants' appeal had prospects of success_ 

1\. The plaintiffs, a c ompany under judic ial management, were the main c ontrac tors to the defendants in a pipes and manholes installation projec t in Pulau Sakra. Dispute arose between them and the parties went to arbitration. The arbitrator was asked to dec ide on two preliminary c laims by the plaintiffs. These were, first, a c laim for "prolongation c osts", that is, c osts for delays c aused by the defendants that resulted in additional c osts and expenses inc urred by the plaintiffs. Sec ondly, the plaintiffs c laimed the c osts of variations to the c ontrac t. These variations c onc erned the c hanging of reinforc ed c onc rete pipes (RC pipes) originally provided, to H-c lass or vitrified pipes (VC pipes). The arbitrator made his award ("the interim award") on these two issues and the plaintiffs, being dissatisfied, applied for leave to appeal to the High Court. 

2\. The plaintiffs, being out of time, had to apply by Originating Summons 1416 of 2002 for an extension of time to apply for leave. The interim award was made on 5 September 2002. The intended appellant had 21 days from the date of the award to apply for leave to appeal. That would have, in this c ase, expired on 27 September 2002. However, the plaintiffs’ solic itors mistook the time limit to be 28 days as provided under the Arbitration Ac t 2001. If that had been the time limit, the last day for applying for leave would have been 5 Oc tober 2002. The plaintiffs thus applied for leave on 2 Oc tober 2002 but on 3 Oc tober 2002, their attention was drawn to the provision that the Ac t only applies to arbitration proc eedings that c ommenc ed on or after 1 Marc h 2002. The arbitration proc eedings in this c ase c ommenc ed on 14 Marc h 2000. 

3\. On 23 Oc tober 2002 I granted the extension of time prayed for. Mr Maniam, c ounsel for the defendants wrote and asked for further arguments on the ground that by virtue of the Court of Appeal dec ision in _Hong Huat Development (Pte) Ltd v Hiap Hong & Co Pte Ltd_ [2000] 2 SLR 609, a part of the test for granting an extension of time is the same as that in an applic ation for leave to appeal, namely, that the applic ant must c onvinc e the c ourt that there is a prospec t of suc c ess. I shall elaborate on this aspec t of the test shortly. 

4\. Relying on the _Hong Huat_ c ase, Mr Maniam then asked for the further arguments in respec t of the applic ation for extension of time to be heard together with the applic ation for leave. He pointed out that that was what the Court of Appeal did in the _Hong Huat_ c ase. 

5\. The appellant in _Hong Huat_ were out of time and their applic ation for an extension of time to file their applic ation for leave to appeal was dismissed. They appealed to the Court of Appeal who allowed 


their appeal for an extension of time and also granted leave to appeal. 

6\. The princ iples set out in _Chen Chien Wen Edwin v Pearson_ [1991] SLR 212 in respec t of an applic ation for extension of time were ac c epted and applied by the judge at first instanc e as well as the Court of Appeal in _Hong Huat_ ’s c ase. In short, the c ourt is bound to c onsider the length of delay, the reasons for the delay, and also the question of prejudic e to the respondents. I shall refer to these as the stage one c onsiderations. Following _Hong Huat_ , the c ourt must also c onsider the prospec ts of the appellants’ c ase on the appeal – and not merely the prospec ts of suc c eeding in getting an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal. I shall refer to this as the stage two c onsideration. 

7\. Thus, in an applic ation for an extension of time for leave to appeal, the applic ation will be dismissed if the applic ant fails to satisfy the stage one c onsiderations. In other words, if the c ourt is of the view that the applic ation was made after an inordinate delay, or that the reason for the delay was unjustifiable or without any merit, or that an extension of time would prejudic e the respondents then an extension of time shall not be granted. None of these fac tors operated suffic iently in the present c ase against the plaintiffs. 

8\. If an applic ant satisfies the c ourt in respec t of the stage one c onsideration then he may still be refused an extension of time if he fails to satisfy the c ourt on the stage two c onsiderations. When stage two is reac hed, it means that should the c ourt be of the view that there are merits in the applic ants’ substantive appeal, then not only will an extension of time be granted but leave to appeal shall also be granted at the same time bec ause the test is essentially the same. It means, therefore, that an applic ation for an extension of time should be heard together with the applic ation for leave to appeal. 

9\. In the present c ase, I am of the view that the appellants had satisfied the stage one c onsiderations. I will only point out that a solic itor’s mistake in itself is not an exc use, but the error must be c onsidered in the c ontext of the c ase and the c irc umstanc es in whic h the error arose. At the hearing of further arguments, Mr Maniam c onc entrated only on the sec ond stage c onsiderations. 

10\. In this regard, the basic question c onc erned the test that the c ourt ought to apply in determining the prospec ts of suc c ess of the appeal. Counsel drew my attention to _American Home Assurance Co v Hong Lam Marine Pte Ltd_ [1999] 3 SLR 682. In that c ase, the Court of Appeal ac c epted the approac h taken in two English c ases, namely _The Nema_ [1982] AC 724 and _The Antaios_ [1985] AC 

191\. The Court of Appeal observed that the trend was towards restric ting the possibility of appeals from arbitration awards espec ially when the dispute c onc erned the interpretation of words inserted into a c ommerc ial c ontrac t in order to asc ertain the meaning intended by the parties. In suc h c ases, the speed and finality of an arbitral dec ision ought not generally to be disturbed. 

11\. The Court of Appeal rec ognised the disc retion to grant leave to appeal may be exerc ised differently, depending on "whether the question of c onstruc tion arises in the c ontext of a ‘one-off’ c ontrac t or c lause, or that of a standard form c ontrac t or c lause". The authorities that I mentioned above drew a distinc tion between c ases involving a "one-off" c ontrac t and those involving a standard form c ontrac t. They applied a stric ter test in the former c ase. The rationale is that in a "one-off" c onstruc tion, no one else would benefit from the dec ision other than the suc c essful party in that 


appeal. There are other fac tors that support this approac h. Parties to an arbitration are at liberty to selec t an arbitrator by mutual c onsent; whereas parties in a c ourt ac tion have no right to c hoose their judge. In this small way, it is not unreasonable to expec t the parties to adhere to the dec isions of their arbitrator espec ially in matters of c onstruc tion unless that dec ision was, in the words of Lord Diploc k in the _Antaios_ , "in the judge’s view so obviously wrong as to prec lude the possibility that he might be right" [1985] AC 191, 206. In the c ases in whic h standard form c ontrac ts are in question, the c ourts would grant leave to appeal if, again in Lord Diploc k’s words, "a strong _prima facie_ c ase" has been made out that the arbitrator was wrong. To that it has been added that the c ourt must first be satisfied that "the resolution of the question of c onstruc tion would add signific antly to the c larity, c ertainty and c omprehensiveness of the law" per Yong CJ in _American Home Assurance Co v Hong Lam Marine Pte Ltd_ [1999] 3 SLR 682, 695. In other words, the appeal must be able to benefit parties in future c ases. These two parts are intended to be applied c umulatively so that even if the appeal would add to the c larity of the law, the intended appellant must persuade the c ourt that a "strong _prima facie_ c ase that the arbitrator was wrong has been made out". 

12\. Before I move on to c onsider whether the present applic ation before me c onc erned a "one-off" c ontrac t or a standard form c ontrac t, I would note that the use of the phrases "obviously wrong" and "strong _prima facie_ c ase" invites c omment. In the c ase of "one-off" c ontrac ts, the effec t of refusing leave to appeal on the basis that the arbitrator was not "obviously wrong" implies that when leave is granted, the appeal itself is as good as having been heard. I say "as good as" bec ause allowanc e must be given to the fac t that the judge hearing the appeal (whether the same judge who granted leave or some other judge) is entitled to differ. But the use of the adjec tive "obviously" appears to be a deliberate one. In ac c epting the formulation, as I do, it appears that the test, in so far as "one-off" c ontrac ts are c onc erned, implies that the applic ant may have to prove his entire c ase even at this leave to appeal stage; espec ially if he would otherwise be unable to show why the arbitrator was so "obviously wrong as to prec lude the possibility that he might be right". In showing why the arbitrator was or was not ‘obviously wrong’ the parties ought to put their best c ase forward if they are to persuade the c ourt one way or the other. ‘Obviously wrong’ does not mean ‘ _prima facie_ wrong’ or ‘wrong unless proven otherwise at the hearing of the appeal’. 

13\. I now revert to the fac ts at hand. Mr Thulasidas, for the plaintiffs, submitted that the lower ("strong _prima facie_ c ase’) test is applic able in the present c ase bec ause the c ontrac t was signed on the defendants’ standard form c ontrac t. Mr Maniam disagreed and submitted that although the standard form was used as the base doc ument, it was an old form that is no longer in use and would therefore not be of interest to anyone in future. Sec ondly, he submitted that the terms were negotiated terms and the standard terms had thus been spec ific ally altered. In the c irc umstanc es, he submitted that the c ontrac t must be regarded as a "one-off" and following that, leave to appeal should only be granted if the arbitrator was shown to be so "obviously wrong as to prec lude the possibility that he might be right". 

14\. There are two aspec ts in whic h the plaintiffs say the arbitrator erred. The first c onc erned the c onstruc tion of c l 32(b) of the Conditions of Contrac t. For c onvenienc e, that c lause is set out as follows: 

 "(b) If the [plaintiffs] shall be prevented from or be materially impeded or delayed in the exec ution or c ompletion of the Works by reason or in c onsequenc e of any ac ts or omissions of the [defendants] c ontrary to the true intent and meaning of these presents suc h prevention, impediment or delay shall not vitiate the Contrac t or affec t the same exc ept that in suc h c ases 


 the question whether any or what c ompensation or allowanc e ought to be paid or made to the [plaintiffs] in respec t of suc h prevention, impediment or delays and in what manner suc h c ompensation or allowanc e ought to be paid or made shall be determined and settled by the [defendants] whose dec ision shall be final." 

I shall refer to this as the first question. 

15\. The first question, broken down to its essenc e, is whether the arbitrator c orrec tly c onstrued the c lause to mean that c ompensation for delays shall be determined by the defendants even though arbitration proc eedings had already c ommenc ed. The arbitrator answered this question in the affirmative. Mr Thulasidas argued forc efully before me that the issue of c ompensation must be reserved to the arbitrator onc e the arbitration proc eedings have c ommenc ed. Counsel relied on the authority of _Milestone v Yates_ [1938] 2 All ER 439 in support. That c ase, as well as the loc al c ase of _Loke Hong Kee v United Overseas Land_ [1978-79] SLR 391, in turn, relied on _Lloyd v Milward_ [1985] 

Hudson BC (4th ed.) Vol. 2 page 262. These c ases lay down the princ iple that where a c ontrac t provides that the arc hitec t’s c ertific ate shall be final and c onc lusive, it shall be so exc ept that the arc hitec t shall not issue his c ertific ate after arbitration proc eedings have c ommenc ed between the employer and the c ontrac tor. 

16\. In substanc e a c omparison of those c lauses and the present c l 32(b) will show that they are different. In those c ases c ited, the arc hitec t was a third party who ought rightly to step aside and, unless spec ific ally allowed under the c ontrac t, dec line to ac t in a way whic h may have an impac t on the outc ome of the arbitration between the princ ipal parties. In the present c ase, c l 32(b) reserved a right to the defendants as a princ ipal party, and there being no express limitation as to the exerc ise of that right, the arbitrator was not wrong to hold that the defendants were entitled to exerc ise it even though arbitration had began. Whether the differenc e is signific ant or not is a matter within the purview of the arbitrator. The question I need to ask is whether the Diploc k test has been met. So far as this first question is c onc erned, I am inc lined to the view that it was a standard form c lause and, in holding that leave to appeal against this question should not be granted, I applied the test that the plaintiffs had not made out a strong _prima facie_ c ase that the arbitrator was wrong. Under the c ontrac t, the dec ision of the defendant would be final. It was not argued before me whether suc h a term oc c ludes a c hallenge on the ground of _mala fides_ sinc e no determination was in fac t made, and I shall express no opinion on it save to say that in my view, c l 33(b) seems c lear and unambiguous and if there is any room whatsoever for c hallenge it would have to be based on the argument of _mala fides_. Henc e, on the fac ts the arbitrator’s dec ision c annot be faulted. 

17\. I c ome now to the sec ond question. The dispute in this regard c onc erned the question of what formula was to be adopted when the c ontrac t was varied so that RC or ‘M’ type pipes were c hanged to VC or ‘H’ type pipes. The essenc e of the opposing formulae was that the defendants’ version resulted in a pipe-for-pipe exc hange but the plaintiffs c laimed that this formula was inadequate bec ause it did not take into ac c ount the c osts of exc avating and laying the new pipes. I need not expand on the details as muc h of it c an be found in the arbitrator’s interim award. 

18\. The diffic ulty in c alc ulating the rates for the variations stems from the fac t that the rates stipulated in the standard sc hedule to the c ontrac t were different from those found in the supplementary sc hedule. The plaintiffs c ontended that the rates in the standard sc hedule applied by virtue of c l 8 of the supplementary sc hedule in order to supply the omission of rates for the spec ified 


‘H’ type and VC type pipes: 

 "This Supplementary Sc hedule of Rates, whic h shall be c ompleted by the Tenderer is to form part of the Contrac t Doc uments and shall supersede similar items in the Standard Sc hedule of Rates. This Sc hedule of Rates will be used for assessing the value of variations for the spec ified items of works stated herein. The rates inserted by the Contrac tor herein shall be those rates used by him in the pric ing of his Tender. The Superintending Offic er reserves the right not to use any rate entered herein that he c onsiders unrealistic. Tenderers shall note that a c ompleted sc hedule with realistic rates will enable the evaluation of variations for items of works stated herein to be settled amic ably" 

19\. The defendants disputed the plaintiff’s c onstruc tion and they c ontended that the variation rates must be taken from both the standard as well as the supplementary sc hedules. There was no c lear and definitive rates from whic h a c alc ulation for the variations c an be c osted. Ac c ordingly, after c onsidering the rival c ontentions of the parties, the arbitrator produc ed a formula based on the evidenc e as he was able to gather from the parties, and used the rates in the supplementary sc hedule as a base. The details he arrived at that formulation are set out essentially in [3.3.9] to [3.3.20] of the Interim Award. 

20\. In these c irc umstanc es, I am unable to fault the arbitrator in any way. Although this partic ular question is, in my view, a "one-off" issue and therefore the "obviously wrong" test ought to apply, I do not think that it passed even the lower test, that is to say, that there is a strong _prima facie_ c ase that the arbitrator was wrong. I think that the most that c an be said in the plaintiffs’ favour is that another arbitrator might have used a different formula, but, given the vagueness of the c ontrac t on this point, it c an be expec ted that different arbitrators may c ome to different c onc lusions as to what the c orrec t formula should be. The arbitrator in this c ase had balanc ed the c ompeting c ontentions, sought additional evidenc e and fac ts, and arrived at a reasoned dec ision that had no indic ation of being _prima facie_ wrong. 

21\. Furthermore, in the interests of speed and finality, I am of the view that leave to appeal should not be allowed and I therefore dismissed the plaintiffs’ applic ation. The applic ation for an extension of time to apply for leave was c onsequently also dismissed. I should add generally, that in respec t of the way the arbitrator c ame to his dec ision on the two disputed points, I am of the view that had the arbitrator dec ided in the way the plaintiffs say he should and the defendants were to ask for leave to appeal, their applic ation would similarly have been dismissed
