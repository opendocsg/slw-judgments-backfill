1       The fac ts of this c ase are c onnec ted to those in Suit No 546 of 2003. Stratec h Systems Ltd was the plaintiff in both suits. Guthrie Engineering (S) Pte Ltd, the third defendant here, was the sole defendant in Suit No 546 of 2003. The first and sec ond defendants were former employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff and third defendant were business partners whic h bec ame rivals and c ompetitors. They had originally c ollaborated to sec ure a c ontrac t to design and install for the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) an automated elec tronic system for the c ollec tion of toll from foreign vehic les entering Singapore through three c hec kpoints. In that venture, the tender was awarded by the LTA to the third defendant and the latter, in turn, sub-c ontrac ted large parts of the c ontrac t to the plaintiff. The plaintiff and third defendant subsequently quarrelled over the sub-c ontrac t as well as the post-c ontrac t work done to maintain the system for the LTA. Consequently, the plaintiff sued the third defendant for breac h of c ontrac t in Suit No 546 of 2003. That ac tion has been tried and judgment handed down: see _Stratech Systems Ltd v Guthrie Engineering (S) Pte Ltd_ [2004] SGHC 146. 

2       The original vehic le entry permit system (“VEPS”) was c ommissioned by the LTA on 9 May 

2000\. On 6 February 2003, the LTA requested the third defendant to integrate the VEPS with the elec tronic road pric ing system (“ERPS”). The plaintiff was initially asked to develop this link. It is important to note that in the previous development programmes in respec t of the VEPS the plaintiff had been using the “V” series as its nomenc lature for the software programmes and filenames. The last fully-established programme in the series was known as V115. The programme for the development of the VEPS-ERPS link was dubbed V116. 

3       In Marc h 2003 the plaintiff asked for payment from the third defendant in respec t of the VEPS c ontrac t and the signing of a formal maintenanc e c ontrac t. This led to two c ivil ac tions. In the first, the plaintiff sued the third defendant in Suit No 546 of 2003 for breac h of the sub-c ontrac t and for payment in respec t of work done on the VEPSERPS link. The sec ond was this present suit. In this 


ac tion, it will be useful to note that the first and sec ond defendants were programmers working on the V116 programme for the plaintiff. The first defendant was the leader of a team of programmers that inc luded the sec ond defendant, Armin Budiman, Frankie Tan and Ng Tiong Khoon. The plaintiff and the third defendant differed as to what the nature of the VEPSERPS work was – whether it was a new job or an enhanc ement of the old one – but this was not material to the true issues for reasons that will bec ome apparent shortly. It is, however, relevant to note that the plaintiff’s c ase was based on the assertion that all the work done by the first defendant and her team to integrate the VEPS with the ERPS was done on a file named “V116”, and that that file was stored in the five c omputers that the plaintiff kept at the LTA’s c onsole room. As far as the third defendant was c onc erned, the integration work was merely “work-in-progress”. 

4       When the plaintiff was not paid in respec t of its c laims against the third defendant for the VEPS work and maintenanc e, it c eased all work, that is, the maintenanc e work in respec t of the VEPS, and the development work in respec t of the integration between the VEPS and the ERPS. It stopped work on the integration of the systems on 25 Marc h 2003, and the maintenanc e work in respec t of the VEPS on 28 Marc h 2003. Armin was instruc ted to bring his c omputer from the LTA’s c onsole room bac k to the plaintiff’s offic e and there to make a c opy of his work on the integration programme (then titled “V116”) on to the plaintiff’s server as well as a c opy on to a c ompac t disk. After that was done, Armin made a c opy of V115, re-installed it into his c omputer and renamed it “V116”. There were some c ontentious aspec ts at this point but they are not signific ant enough, in my view, to affec t the outc ome of this dispute. One of the disputes c onc erned the question whether the c ompac t disk had been broken and disc arded as Armin testified, or whether it was still in the possession of the defendants. It will be more helpful, presently, to see what all this has led to in so far as this suit is c onc erned. But first, it is important to note that on 25 April 2003 the first defendant terminated her employment c ontrac t by paying two months’ pay in lieu of notic e to the plaintiff. About that time, the sec ond defendant similarly terminated his employment c ontrac t with the plaintiff. Both of them were employed almost immediately by a c ompany c alled Elec tric al Produc t International Pte Ltd (“EPI”), a subsidiary of the third defendant whose business as a c able trader was totally unc onnec ted to that of its parent c ompany or of the plaintiff. However, the first and sec ond defendants were direc tly sec onded by EPI to work for the third defendant on the VEPSERPS integration. 

5       In this ac tion the plaintiff c laimed damages against the first and sec ond defendants for breac h of c ontrac t in that, c ontrary to an express term of c ontrac t of employment, they entered the employment servic e of a c ompetitor before the stipulated nine-month mandatory restric tion period was over. The spec ific c lause in question is c l 9 whic h reads as follows: 

9\. Termination 

 ... 

 9.3 You shall not, during the c ontinuanc e of your employment with the Company and after the termination of your employment with the Company, c anvass, solic it, interfere with or entic e away any person or entity who shall at any time during the c ontinuanc e of your employment hereunder have been in the employment of or in the habit of dealing with the Company. 

 9.4 You shall not, during the c ontinuanc e of your employment with the Company and for a period of nine (9) months after the termination of your employment with the Company, and whether on your own ac c ord or as an employee, partner or otherwise, direc tly or indirec tly engage or be c onc erned in any business in direc t c ompetition with the Company or be employed by any person or entity who shall at any time during the c ontinuanc e of your employment 


 hereunder have been in the employment of or in the habit of dealing with the Company in Singapore. 

The first two defendants were also sued for damages for breac h of their duties of fidelity and good faith for allegedly divulging “c onfidential information, trade sec rets, and business information” to the third defendant in breac h of c l 8, whic h provides as follows: 

 8 Confidentiality 

 8.1 You shall not either during the c ontinuanc e of your employment hereunder or after termination of your employment exc ept in the proper c ourse of your duties with the Company divulge to any person and/or outside party any information as to the prac tic e, business dealings or affairs of the Company or any of its c ustomers or any c ompany in the habit of dealing with the Company and shall use your best endeavours to prevent the public ation or disc losure of any trade sec ret or any information c onc erning the business tec hnology or financ es of the Company or any of its dealings, transac tions or affairs whic h may c ome to your knowledge during or in the c ourse of your employment. 

The third defendant was sued for induc ing the first and sec ond defendants’ breac h of c ontrac t. It was also sued for wrongfully retaining and using c onfidential information belonging to the plaintiff, namely, the c omputer programme known as “V116”. 

6       The evidenc e showed that some time about 10 April 2003 Foong Siew Peng, the third defendant’s manager, c ontac ted the first defendant and asked if she would work for the third defendant and also to ask if her team members from the plaintiff would similarly join it. Ac c ording to the sec ond defendant as well as Armin (who was c alled as a witness by the first and sec ond defendants) the first defendant c ontac ted them and told them about the third defendant’s proposal. Armin said that he rec eived a text message from her over his mobile phone. The team members had a meeting about the proposal. They were c onc erned by the plaintiff’s withdrawal from the VEPSERPS projec t, but were also worried about being sued if they joined the third defendant c ompany. The evidenc e in c ourt from the first and sec ond defendants, whic h was c orroborated by Foong, was that the third defendant agreed to indemnify the employees should they be sued suc c essfully by the plaintiff. In the present c ase, lawyers were provided and paid by the third defendant in defending the first and sec ond defendants. The first and sec ond defendants also sec ured a 20% inc rease in pay when they joined the third defendant. Armin, who joined after the nine-month prohibition period was over, was paid a little more than $7,000 c ompared to the $2,000 to $3,000 he was earning with the plaintiff. Henc e, Mr N Sreenivasan, c ounsel for the plaintiff, submitted that the inc rease was to c over the months of unemployment after he left the plaintiff. Furthermore, Foong c andidly c onc eded that the first and sec ond defendants were formally employed by EPI instead of the third defendant “in order to put more distanc e” between them (the employees) and the third defendant. It was obvious that the former employees of the plaintiff, as well as the third defendant, were worried about the restraining c lause in the employees’ c ontrac t of employment. It is also c lear to me that the third defendant initiated all the steps taken to proc ure the employment of the plaintiff’s employees. Given the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, the third defendant would thus be liable for induc ing a breac h of c ontrac t of employment if it c ould be shown that the first and sec ond defendants, as well as Armin, were in breac h of their c ontrac ts of employment. It is to this point that I now turn. 

7       The employment c ontrac ts of the first and sec ond defendants, as well as Armin (all of whom I shall, for this purpose, refer to c ollec tively as “the employees”), with the plaintiff c ontain a termination c lause to the effec t that the employees c an terminate the c ontrac t by giving two months’ notic e of termination, or by payment of two months’ salary in lieu of suc h notic e. In this c ase, the 


evidenc e was that the employees elec ted to pay the salary in lieu of notic e bec ause the third defendant was in a hurry to employ them. It was also proved to my satisfac tion that the salary in lieu in eac h c ase was borne by the third defendant. This fac t is relevant for the purpose of establishing whether the third defendant was liable for induc ing the employees to leave their employer. But that by itself is not the same thing as induc ing a breac h of c ontrac t. A person c annot be said to have induc ed another to breac h his c ontrac t of employment if all that was done by the employee was to tender a notic e of termination or payment in lieu whic h was provided for as a term of the c ontrac t. The c ruc ial question c onc erned c l 9 of the employment c ontrac ts. If that c lause was valid and enforc eable, then the third defendant would be liable on ac c ount of its entic ement, proc urement and assistanc e in the breac hing of c l 9 with the knowledge that the employees would be in breac h of the c lause. It is important to state at this point that whether the third defendant knew it was assisting a breac h is a finding of fac t for this c ourt. It is not a subjec tive matter whic h the third defendant may esc ape responsibility for by merely dec laring that it did not believe that c l 9 was an impediment. Foong testified that he did not think that c l 9 prevented the third defendant from employing the employees and that the reason EPI was used to employ them was an ac t in exc ess of c aution. While I find that Foong was frank and c andid in his testimony, and I c an ac c ept that he personally (though not the third defendant) believed that c l 9 was not a problem, this c ould not validate the breac h. The fac t is that the third defendant was aware of c l 9 and suspec ted that it might be a potential problem. The fac t that one of its princ ipal offic ers (Foong) took it into serious c onsideration and c onc luded in good faith that it was not a problem (in other words, that he was wrong) does not absolve the third defendant bec ause the test is an objec tive one. Was a breac h of c l 9 a breac h of the c ontrac ts of employment? If it was, then would a person who induc ed an employee into c ommitting a breac h of c l 9 be said to have induc ed a breac h of his or her c ontrac t of employment? I think that it would be so. Otherwise, it is only too easy to provide an exc use from the effec t of a reasonable restric tive c lause and c onc lude that the term does not apply in a given c ase. Whether it applies or not is a question to be dec ided by the c ourt. In this c ase, I must first determine whether the c lause is valid and applic able and, sec ondly, whether the third defendant did an ac t that induc ed the employees to violate the terms of that c lause. I have first determined the sec ond part for c onvenienc e, and now turn to the first part. 

8       The question here is whether c l 9 is a valid and binding term, and if so, whether it applied in this c ase. Mr Goh Phai Cheng, c ounsel for the third defendant, foc used his submission on two points. First, he argued that bec ause the plaintiff “walked out” on them (the third defendant and LTA), c l 43.4 of the main c ontrac t between the plaintiff and the third defendant obliged the third defendant to take suc h steps as were nec essary to c arry on with the maintenanc e of the VEPS. Counsel maintained that the c ontrac t provided a right to employ anyone, inc luding the employees of the plaintiff. The relevant c lause provided as follows: 

 43.4 In the event of termination of the Contrac t as provided for in Clause 43.1 or Clause 43. or in ac c ordanc e with law, the following shall apply: 

 (a) (i) all payments that shall have been made under the Contrac t shall be refunded by the Contrac tor to the Authority forthwith Provided Always that suc h refunds as aforesaid shall not prejudic e or affec t any right of ac tions or remedy whic h shall have ac c rued or shall thereafter ac c rue to the Authority as a result of the termination of the Contrac t or as a result of the breac h of the Contrac t by the Contrac tor; 

 (ii) the Contrac tor shall upon written notic e from the Authority be required to remove, at the Contrac tor’s expense, the System or any part thereof spec ified in the notic e from the loc ation at a date spec ified by the Authority, and in default the Authority may (without being responsible for any loss or damage) remove and sell the same, holding the proc eeds less all 


 expenses inc urred to the c redit of the Contrac tor; 

 (iii) the Authority shall be entitled to rec over from the Contrac tor any damages, c osts and expenses whic h the Authority may sustain or inc ur in c onsequenc e of suc h termination; all suc h damages, losses, c osts and expenses whic h are or bec ome so rec overable under the Contrac t together with any sum payable by the Contrac tor as liquidated damages, may be deduc ted from any money that may then be due to the Contrac tor and if the money then due to the Contrac tor under the Contrac t or deposited by him under the Contrac t as aforesaid is not suffic ient for that purpose, the balanc e remaining unpaid shall be a debt due from the Contrac tor to the Authority, and may be set off against any other monies whic h may be or bec ome due to the Contrac tor from the Authority or may be rec overed as a debt due from the Contrac tor in any c ourt of c ompetent jurisdic tion; 

 OR, at the sole disc retion of the Authority: 

 (b) (i) the Authority may c arry out and c omplete the works on its own or employ and pay other person or persons to c arry out and c omplete the works and he or they may enter upon the loc ation and use all materials, software and equipment thereon, and may purc hase all materials nec essary for the purc hase aforesaid; 

 (ii) the Contrac tor shall if so required by the Authority assign to the Authority and without further payment the benefit of any c ontrac t for the supply of material and/or works intended for use under the Contrac t or for the exec ution of any works and the Authority shall pay the agreed pric e (if unpaid) for suc h material or works supplied or exec uted after the said termination; 

 (iii) the Contrac tor shall during the exec ution or after c ompletion of the works under this sub-c lause as and when required remove from the loc ation any materials within suc h reasonable time as the Authority may spec ify in a written notic e to him and in default the Authority may (without being responsible for any loss and damage) remove and sell the same, holding the proc eed less all expenses inc urred to the c redit of the Contrac tor; 

 (iv) until c ompletion of the works under this sub-c lause no payment shall be made to the Contrac tor under the Contrac t; provided that upon c ompletion as aforesaid and the verific ation within a reasonable time of the ac c ount added to the monies paid to the Contrac tor before suc h termination exc eeds the total amount whic h have been payable on due c ompletion, the differenc e shall be a debt payable to the Authority by the Contrac tor, and if the said amount added to the said money be less than the said total amount, the differenc e shall be a debt payable by the Authority to the Contrac tor; provided always aforesaid shall not prejudic e or affec t any right of ac tion or remedy whic h shall have ac c rued or shall thereafter ac c rue to the Authority as a result of the termination of the Contrac t or as a result of the breac h of the Contrac t by the Contrac tor; 

 (v) in the event of the c ompletion of the works being undertaken by the Authority, allowanc e shall be made, when asc ertaining the amount to be c ertified as expenses properly inc urred by the Authority, for the c ost of supervision, interest and deprec iation on equipment and all other usual overhead c harges and profits, as would be inc urred were the work c arried out by the Contrac tor. 

I agree that one possible reading of the above c lause permits the third defendant to employ anyone, inc luding an employee of the plaintiff, notwithstanding the restric tive c ovenant c lause in the employment c ontrac t. However, a reasonable reading must inc lude the interpretation that the third defendant is permitted to employ the employees only if it does not c reate a c ivil wrong (suc h as 


induc ing a breac h of c ontrac t) in the proc ess. The next point advanc ed by Mr Goh was that the third defendant did not habitually deal with the plaintiff. The referenc e to habitual dealing in c l 9 must refer to the dealings between the two c ompanies and not a habitual dealing between the employees of the two c ompanies. The evidenc e from the third defendant’s witnesses, and indeed the rec ord itself, indubitably showed that the plaintiff’s employees were dealing c onstantly with the employees of the third defendant in the VEPS projec t. That is as strong a c omplianc e with the term “habitual dealing” as c an be envisaged. That argument of c ounsel does not advanc e the defenc e any further. Counsel for the defendants also argued that the restric tive period was unreasonably long, but I do not think so. 

9       I therefore find the third defendant liable for induc ing a breac h of c ontrac t by the first and sec ond defendants. However, on the evidenc e, it seems palpably c lear that the plaintiff suffered no real or substantial damage. If the third defendant had not induc ed the termination of employment by the first and sec ond defendants, and they had proc eeded to join the former of their own ac c ord, there would have been no damage at all. Furthermore, there was no evidenc e of what damage the plaintiff suffered by the absenc e of the two employees (three, c ounting Armin). There will, therefore, be judgment for the plaintiff against the third defendant on this ground, but I only order nominal damages of $1,000. 

10     I now turn to the issue of c onfidential information. The c ruc ial question is whether there was any c onfidential information or trade sec ret belonging to the plaintiff that had been wrongfully taken or used by the defendants. This question was relevant to the defenc e of all three defendants. The plaintiff did not partic ularize what it had regarded as c onfidential information and trade sec rets belonging to it. The basis and relevanc e of giving the nec essary partic ulars have been amply disc ussed in c ases suc h as _Lock International Plc v Beswick_ [1989] 1 WLR 1268 at 1274–1275 where Hoffman J made the point that assertions of c onfidentiality are no substitute for evidenc e of what the plaintiff’s sec rets really are. Mr Sreenivasan generated a veil of importanc e to the programme file known as V116. But all that we know about it is that it was the programme that was being developed by the first defendant and her team, princ ipally Armin, to integrate the VEPS and ERPS. V116’s sourc e c odes were written in Pasc al, a c omputer language. V116 enabled the VEPS and ERPS to integrate, but what aspec t or part of it was c onfidential was not disc losed, let alone why it was c onfidential. Mr Sreenivasan alluded to the saving of time, but that was inadequate bec ause not every time-saving devic e is a trade sec ret or is c onfidential in nature. It is also important to note that the plaintiff was not c laiming a breac h of c opyright in the c opying or use of the sourc e c odes, nor for trespass in ac c essing the file. Its c ase was stric tly for damages for unauthorised use of c onfidential information and trade sec rets. In this regard I find nothing in the evidenc e that required me even to adjudic ate as to whether any partic ular piec e of material was or was not c onfidential or a trade sec ret. The diffic ulties in making a list of matters that c an be regarded as trade sec rets were disc ussed by Neill LJ in _Faccenda Chicken Ltd v Fowler_ [1987] Ch 117. It was pointed out by him that not everything an employer tells his employee is to be regarded as c onfidential is, in law, c onfidential; and that inc ludes instruc tions used in the c ourse of employment and so on. What it all means, therefore, is simply that the c ourt must dec ide on the evidenc e whether the fac ts alleged in the c ase amount to c onfidential information or trade sec rets – the familiar and basic reminder of the c ourt’s duty at first instanc e. Here, there was a c lear c onflic t of evidenc e as to whether the third defendant was using V115 (as it alleged) or the c onfidential V116 (as the plaintiff alleged). On the balanc e, I ac c ept the evidenc e of the defendants. Mr Sreenivasan made the obvious point that the evidenc e c ame from the defendants only bec ause they – in partic ular the first and sec ond defendants and Armin – were the only ones who had direc t knowledge of these matters. He argued that these employees were serving their own interests. I think that that might well be so. The evidenc e of suc h witnesses might often be slanted or biased, if not entirely false. However, they might still speak truthfully or objec tively. The first defendant might not have been as c andid as the other witnesses of the defendants when it c ame to 


the question of whether she was being employed by the third defendant or EPI, but her evidenc e generally was plausible and c onsistent on the whole. The sec ond defendant was a straightforward and forthright witness in all aspec ts of his evidenc e, and Armin was similarly plausible. Mr Sreenivasan c hallenged the c redibility of Armin’s evidenc e in regard to the c ompac t disk that the plaintiff said Armin used to c opy V116 and whic h he said had been broken and thrown away. I am inc lined to ac c ept Armin’s evidenc e in this instanc e bec ause his evidenc e impressed me generally and, whic h is equally important, I was unable to find anything that inc lined me to think that his story was probably untrue. 

11     I shall deal very briefly with the evidenc e of the plaintiff’s expert witness Mr Daniel Chong and that of the plaintiff’s employee, Nellore Siva Sai. These two witnesses testified as to the similarities between the files in the plaintiff’s version of V116 and the files found in the third defendant’s c omputers that were seized and studied under an Anton Piller order. The sum of their evidenc e is that there were some similarities in the files and sourc e c odes in the two materials under c omparison but nothing to indic ate that the one was c opied from the other. Apart from the defendants’ denial, whic h I ac c ept, it must be borne in mind that these were files and material written in a c omputer language by c omputer programmers and was something easily replic ated without rec ourse to c opying. There were some points that might lead one to the supposition that the defendants’ version was a c opied one, but those were points based on the assumption that c opying is quic kest. That might be true in many instanc es, but the fac ts before me were a little more c omplex, and c learer proof was required – the burden of whic h was the plaintiff’s responsibility to disc harge. 

12     The plaintiff’s c laim against the first and sec ond defendants in respec t of the alleged use of c onfidential information and trade sec rets must therefore be dismissed. Its c laim against the third defendant must also similarly be dismissed. I shall hear the parties on the question of c osts at a later date if they are unable to agree on c osts. 

_Plaintiff’s claim allowed in part against the third defendant, and dismissed as against the first and second defendants._
