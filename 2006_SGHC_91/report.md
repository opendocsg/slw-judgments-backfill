**Belinda Ang Saw Ean J:** 

1       The appeals before me were related to several applic ations for disc overy and produc tion of various c ategories of doc uments. Spec ific ally, Asia Pac ific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“APBS”) was ordered by the assistant registrar on 17 Oc tober 2005 to, _inter alia,_ produc e for inspec tion the report (inc luding all drafts thereof ) c ommissioned or authorised by the Spec ial Committee of direc tors (hereafter c ollec tively referred to as the “PWC Draft Reports” as no engrossed final report was issued). The PWC Draft Reports were disc losed under Part II of APBS’s list of doc uments filed respec tively on 29 April 2005 in eac h of the four ac tions c ommenc ed by the banks named below. I upheld APBS’s c laim to privilege in respec t of the PWC Draft Reports and allowed APBS’s appeals. The banks have now appealed against that part of my dec ision relating to produc tion for inspec tion of the PWC Draft Reports. 

**The banks’ actions** 

2       The banks’ ac tions c ame about as a result of the fraud perpetrated on eac h individual bank by Chia Tec k Leng (“Chia”), the former financ e manager of APBS. Chia is c urrently serving a long term of imprisonment for c heating the banks of large sums of money totalling approximately US$83m and S$18m. 

3       The four ac tions are as follows: 

 (a) The plaintiff in Suit No 774 of 2004 is Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ) (“SEB”) and its c laim is for US$26,559,371.94 or alternatively S$45,347,671.235. 


 (b) The plaintiff in Suit No 775 of 2004 is Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd (“Mizuho”) and its c laim is for US$8,024,045.97. 

 (c ) The plaintiff in Suit No 763 of 2004 is Bayerisc he Hypound Vereinsbank AG (“Hypo”) and its c laim is for US$32,002,332.85. 

 (d) The plaintiff in Suit No 781 of 2004 is Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation Singapore Branc h (“Sumitomo”). Sumitomo’s c laim is for S$10,323,207.94. 

4       The banks have sued APBS in c ontrac t. Hypo also sued in negligenc e c laiming that APBS owed a duty to Hypo to ensure not only that persons employed in senior financ ial positions were individuals of integrity, honesty and good c harac ter, but that it also had in plac e a system of c hec ks to monitor the ac tivities of its bank ac c ounts. The banks’ pleaded c ase is that Chia’s fraud on the banks was c ommitted in the c ourse of Chia’s employment and the c onnec tion between the wrongdoing and his authorised and legitimate work responsibilities was suffic iently c lose for the wrongdoing to be within the sc ope of his employment. Separately, SEB has an alternative c laim in restitution against APBS for the sum of S$45,347,671.23 being moneys whic h had been paid into APBS’s ac c ount with OverseaChinese Banking Corporation Ltd on the instruc tions of Chia. APBS has denied all liability. It has c ounterc laimed against SEB in respec t of the c laim in restitution. 

**Appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers and Drew & Napier LLC** 

5       The events leading to the appointment of Pric ewaterhouseCoopers (“PWC”) and Drew and Napier LLC (“D&N”) are gathered from, _inter alia_ , the affidavits filed in support and opposition and the written submissions tendered. APBS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Asia Pac ific Breweries Limited (“APBL”). On or about 2 September 2003, offic ers from the Commerc ial Affairs Department of the Singapore Polic e Forc e (“CAD”) informed the senior offic ers of APBL that Chia had used forged doc uments to borrow very large sums of money in APBS’s name for his gambling debts inc urred overseas. Funds from c redit fac ilities obtained fraudulently in APBS’s name from the four banks were c hannelled into the SEB ac c ount and then into Chia’s bank ac c ounts for his personal use. Chia was arrested on 2 September 2003 and c harged two days later. 

6       On 3 September 2003, APBS wrote to the banks for verific ation of the ac c ounts opened in APBS’s name of whic h it had no prior knowledge. At the same time, APBS requested all ac c ount opening doc uments and bank statements in APBS’s name. The banks were also asked to immediately suspend operation of the unauthorised ac c ounts until further notic e. 

7       Hypo wrote to APBS on 3 September 2003. In that letter, whic h was faxed to APBS the following day, APBS was informed of the term loan of US$30m borrowed in its name and was advised that the first repayment of the princ ipal instalment of US$5m plus interest of US$465,520 was due on 25 September 2003. 

8       Sumitomo also wrote to APBS on 4 September 2003 terminating with immediate effec t a short term c redit fac ility it had granted on 11 July 2001 to APBS. Sumitomo also demanded immediate repayment of the sum of S$10,022,891.78 by 5 September 2003. This notic e was faxed to APBS in the late afternoon of 4 September 2003. 

9       On 4 September 2003, APBS learnt that Chia had been c harged. On the same day, the board of APBL appointed a Spec ial Committee of direc tors (“the Spec ial Committee”) to oversee the investigations and to take any nec essary ac tions in relation to Chia’s fraud in order to protec t the interests of APBS and APBL. The Spec ial Committee appointed D&N and PWC as spec ial ac c ountant. 


As announc ed by APBL in MASNET, in the form of MASNET No 7 of 4 September 2003, PWC and D&N were “to undertake” the following matters: 

 (a) identify the nature, c irc umstanc es and extent of any unauthorised transac tions; 

 (b) quantify the financ ial impac t of suc h unauthorised transac tions; 

 (c ) assist the c ompany in taking the nec essary ac tion to prevent suc h unauthorised transac tions; and 

 (d) c onduc t a review of the system of internal c ontrol and proc edures to prevent the oc c urrenc e of suc h unauthorised transac tions in the future. 

10     APBL announc ed 20 days later in MASNET No 28 of 24 September 2003 the c ompletion of the review by PWC of signific ant c ash transac tions, and the findings were as follows: 

 The sc ope of [PWC]’s work inc luded reviewing APBS’ ac c ounting rec ords, c hec king all material c ash rec eipts and payments for the relevant period. Their work has revealed that unauthorised payments have been made from APBS’ banks ac c ounts. The aggregate of all suc h unauthorised payments matc h the aggregate of payments into APBS’ bank ac c ounts from the unauthorised ac c ounts. All material c ash balanc es of APBS have been ac c ounted for. 

11     At the same time, APBL announc ed that: 

 Claims against APBS have been asserted by banks with respec t to the unauthorised transac tions. The Company [APBL] has sought legal advic e on these c laims and has been advised that legal defenc es are available to APBS. APBS intends and has instruc ted its lawyers, [D&N], to c ontest these c laims vigorously. 

12     No engrossed final report was ever issued by PWC. The banks understandably wanted the PWC Draft Reports produc ed for inspec tion. No doubt the banks imagined the PWC Draft Reports to be partic ularly informative for a c ontemporaneous insight into what was disc overed in the c ourse of the investigations inc luding systemic failure or weakness in internal c ontrols, if any. 

**The claim to legal professional privilege** 

13     Mr Hri Kumar for APBS submitted that APBS c ould not be c ompelled to produc e the PWC Draft Reports as these reports were subjec t to legal professional privilege whic h c omprises legal advic e privilege under the provisions of the Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”) and c ommon law litigation privilege. 

14     APBS argued that D&N and PWC jointly c onduc ted interviews and/or meetings with APBS’s employees and other witnesses and jointly worked on the drafts prepared by PWC before they were sent to the Spec ial Committee. Material from the interviews was used for the PWC Draft Reports. A c entral plank of the APBS’s argument was that D&N and PWC were for all intents and purposes a single team working on the matter. The PWC Draft Reports were brought into existenc e together with D&N for the purpose of giving c onfidential legal advic e to APBS and thus c ame within the ambit of legal advic e privilege. Alternatively, the PWC Draft Reports were subjec t to litigation privilege as they c ame into existenc e for the dominant purpose of c ontemplated or antic ipated litigation by the banks against APBS. APBS needed only to suc c eed on one ground to resist the banks’ applic ation for produc tion of these draft reports. 


15     The banks disagreed with APBS’s c laim that the PWC Draft Reports c ould c ontain “c onfidential c ommunic ation” to the Spec ial Committee. It was argued that the PWC Draft Reports would not c ontain any legal advic e from D&N or c onfidential c ommunic ations for obtaining suc h legal advic e as the purpose of PWC’s work as ac c ountants was investigative in nature. On the objec tive evidenc e before the c ourt, the PWC Draft Reports were produc ed bec ause of either APBS’s Reporting Proc edure on Fraud whic h was akin or analogous to the internal report prepared as a matter of prac tic e for “railway operation and safety purposes” as in _Waugh v British Railways Board_ [1980] AC 521, or the fac t situation in _Price Waterhouse v BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) SA_ [1992] BCLC 583 (“ _Price Waterhouse v BCCI_ ”). Consequently, there was no relevant legal c ontext (as per the _Balabel v Air India_ [1988] Ch 317 test referred to in [18] below) in whic h the PWC Draft Reports c ould be protec ted by legal advic e privilege. The same points were used to c hallenge the c laim for litigation privilege. The PWC Draft Reports, it was submitted, were not made for the dominant purpose of use in, or in relation to litigation then existing, antic ipated or c ontemplated. 

16     The c ommon issue in the banks’ applic ations for produc tion for inspec tion of the PWC Draft Reports turned on the question of legal professional privilege. Ms Rebec c a Chew for SEB led the princ ipal arguments c ommon to all the banks. Whilst c ounsel for the other banks aligned themselves with Ms Chew’s submissions, other points were also advanc ed to augment their respec tive c ases. 

**Discussions and decision** 

**_Legal advice privilege_** 

17     It is c onvenient to c onsider the issue of legal advic e privilege first. Legal advic e privilege in Singapore is basic ally governed by ss 128 and 131 of the Ac t (see _Singapore Civil Procedure_ (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2003) at p 468). The c ommon law princ iples on legal advic e privilege are applic able as long as they are c onsistent with the applic able provisions of the Ac t: s 2(2) of the Ac t. The relevant sec tions read as follows: 

**128.** —(1) No advoc ate or solic itor shall at any time be permitted, unless with his c lient’s express c onsent, to disc lose any c ommunic ation made to him in the c ourse and for the purpose of his employment as suc h advoc ate or solic itor by or on behalf of his c lient, or to state the c ontents or c ondition of any doc ument with whic h he has bec ome ac quainted in the c ourse and for the purpose of his professional employment, or to disc lose any advic e given by him to his c lient in the c ourse and for the purpose of suc h employment. 

 (2) Nothing in this sec tion shall protec t from disc losure — 

 (a) any suc h c ommunic ation made in furtheranc e of any illegal purpose; 

 (b) any fac t observed by any advoc ate or solic itor in the c ourse of his employment as suc h showing that any c rime or fraud has been c ommitted sinc e the c ommenc ement of his employment. 

 (3) It is immaterial whether the attention of suc h advoc ate or solic itor was or was not direc ted to suc h fac t by or on behalf of his c lient. 

**131.** No one shall be c ompelled to disc lose to the c ourt any c onfidential c ommunic ation whic h has taken plac e between him and his legal professional adviser unless he offers himself as a witness, in whic h c ase he may be c ompelled to disc lose any suc h c ommunic ations as may appear to the c ourt nec essary to be known in order to explain any evidenc e whic h he has given, but no 


 others. 

18     The privilege rec ognised in ss 128 and 131 relates to legal professional c ommunic ations. It protec ts the c lient as well as his advoc ate or solic itor from being c ompelled to disc lose and produc e for inspec tion c onfidential c ommunic ations about legal advic e and assistanc e stemming from the latter’s professional employment. Legal professional c ommunic ations enc ompass c ommunic ations passing between the c lient and his lawyer and _vice versa_ , the c ontents or c ondition of doc uments whic h the lawyer bec ame ac quainted with, and advic e given in the c ourse and for the purpose of his professional employment. Sec tion 128 refers to c ommunic ations for “the purpose of [the advoc ate or solic itor’s] employment” as legal adviser whic h, on a purposive reading, is wide enough to c over c onfidential c ommunic ations arising from the extensive range of ac tivities undertaken by c ontemporary advoc ates and solic itors. As Taylor LJ said in _Balabel v Air India_ ([15] _supra_ ) at 330: 

 [T]he test is whether the c ommunic ation or other doc ument was made c onfidentially for the purposes of legal advic e. Those purposes have to be c onstrued broadly ... [L]egal advic e is not c onfined to telling the c lient the law; it must inc lude advic e as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal c ontext. 

19     Not only must the c ommunic ation pass between the c lient and the lawyer ac ting as suc h, c onfidentiality is another nec essary element to establish legal professional privilege over suc h c ommunic ations. Confidentiality may be lost if a c ommunic ation between a c lient and his lawyer is made in the presenc e of a third party. The exac t c irc umstanc es of the presenc e of the third party will have to be examined to see if the c ommunic ation is intended to be c onfidential. In the present c ase, the fac t that PWC and D&N c ollaborated as a team was partic ularly signific ant. I shall elaborate more on these points below. 

20     The rationale of the privilege, whic h is that of the c lient’s and not the solic itor or advoc ate, is to enable the legal advic e to be both freely sought and given in c onfidenc e. Jessel MR in _Wheeler v Le Marchant_ (1881) 17 Ch D 675 at 682 said, “It is a rule established and maintained solely for the purpose of enabling a man to obtain legal advic e with safety.” The rule is founded on “the impossibility of c onduc ting legal business without professional assistanc e, and on the nec essity, in order to render that assistanc e effec tual, of sec uring full and unreserved interc ourse between the two”: _Sarkar’s Law of Evidence_ (Wadhwa and Company, 15th Ed, Reprint 2001) vol 2 at p 2027 and the English authorities c ited there. 

21     Ms Monic a Chong for Hypo ac c epted that legal professional privilege c omprises legal advic e privilege and litigation privilege. For Ms Chong, the only dispute before the c ourt was whether or not APBS had satisfied the evidentiary burden in order to suc c eed in its c laim for privilege. Separately, Ms Chew argued that where legal advic e privilege was c onc erned, ss 128 and 131 of the Ac t were inapplic able for the simple reason that the banks were not seeking disc overy and produc tion of D&N’s legal advic e to either the Spec ial Committee or APBS that was based on the PWC Drafts Reports. It was the banks’ c ase that no legal advic e was set out in the PWC Draft Reports. They were also not seeking to obtain disc overy and produc tion of c ommunic ations made by or on behalf of APBS to D&N in the c ourse and for the purpose of D&N’s professional employment as legal adviser. 

22     The banks’ first argument related to a determination of the purpose of the PWC Draft Reports. A perc eived shift in emphasis by the deponents of affidavits filed on behalf of APBS on two different oc c asions had c aused some suspic ion and henc e, the argument that the purpose of the PWC Draft Reports appeared to have c hanged over time due to APBS’s attempts to c over the PWC Draft Reports with privilege. In this respec t, c omparing the affidavit of Anthony Cheong Fook Seng (“Cheong”) dated 8 September 2005 with the earlier affidavit of Tay Kok Chye (“Tay”) filed on 


26     Marc h 2004 to oppose the banks’ pre-ac tion disc overy applic ations, the banks c onc luded that there were inc onsistenc ies between the two affidavits whic h undermined the overall reliability and verac ity of Cheong’s affidavit. Ms Chong further submitted that the evidenc e adduc ed by APBS on the role of D&N was “at odds with c ontemporaneous evidenc e”. The banks submitted that in determining the purpose of the PWC Draft Reports, Cheong’s affidavit should be viewed with c aution and disc ounted in favour of the only available c ontemporaneous evidenc e in the form of the two MASNET announc ements. The banks gave three reasons in support of their c ontention that the PWC Draft Reports did not c ontain any c ommunic ation made to D&N for the purpose of its employment as legal adviser to APBS. 

23     Their first point was that APBS had not at the stage of pre-ac tion disc overy c laimed that D&N was ac tually involved in the investigation and that the preparation of the PWC Draft Reports was a joint effort by both PWC and D&N. When pre-ac tion disc overy was sought against APBS for the same draft reports in Marc h 2004, APBS c laimed litigation privilege and not legal advic e privilege. Tay was Assistant General Manager, Financ e, of APBS, and the relevant paragraphs of his affidavit read: 

 37 [T]he Spec ial Committee has draft reports prepared by [PWC], working with [D&N], whic h were engaged to ac t for APBL and [APBS] jointly in relation to the fraud by [Chia]. Their reports are being prepared for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advic e in relation to the antic ipated litigation brought by various banks ... The various banks have issued notic es and/or letters of demand against [APBS]. The present applic ation, as well as those filed by the other banks, c onfirm the intention of the said banks to sue [APBS]. 

 38 In the c irc umstanc es, I have been advised and do verily believe that the draft reports prepared by [PWC] with [D&N] are c learly privileged. 

24     Sec ond, at the hearing for pre-ac tion disc overy on 13 April 2004, c ounsel for APBS informed the c ourt that in relation to the PWC Draft Reports, D&N had “penc illed in” legal advic e on the drafts. Cheong’s affidavit, however, made no referenc e at all to D&N’s alleged “penc illed in” legal advic e to APBS. Instead, Cheong deposed that the PWC Draft Reports c ontained “c onfidential c ommunic ations between [D&N] and the Spec ial Committee for the purpose of obtaining legal advic e and assistanc e in the c ourse of and for the purpose of [D&N’s] professional employment as legal adviser to APBL and [APBS]”. 

25     Third, it was argued that c ontemporaneous evidenc e in the form of the two MASNET announc ements in September 2003 did not support APBS’s assertion as to the nature of the PWC Draft Reports or D&N’s role. The roles stated in the first MASNET announc ement all related to func tions normally undertaken by an ac c ounting firm. The mere referenc e to D&N in the first MASNET announc ement did not detrac t from the envisaged investigative role of PWC, as was evident from the c ontents of the sec ond MASNET announc ement (see [10] above). The PWC Draft Reports were investigative in nature and henc e fac tual. Ms Chew pressed the point that PWC’s undertaking as disc losed in the first MASNET announc ement mirrored APBS’s Reporting Proc edure on Fraud so muc h so that the PWC Draft Reports were produc ed in fulfilment of that proc edure. In short, the purpose of the PWC Draft Reports was not to obtain legal advic e but to fulfil APBS’s obligation under the Reporting Proc edure on Fraud. 

26     Mr Kumar denied that APBS had shifted its position. I ac c epted his arguments and reasoning whic h suffic iently disposed of the banks’ first argument. Tay’s affidavit did not c ontradic t Cheong’s affidavit where legal advic e privilege and litigation privilege were c onc erned. Tay’s affidavit c learly alluded to the PWC Draft Reports having being prepared _with_ D&N. As the notes of evidenc e taken by the assistant registrar at the first hearing of the pre-ac tion disc overy applic ations in 2004 bear out, 

 [note: 1] 


Mr Jimmy Yim SC, who was then c ounsel for APBS, made it known at the outset that APBS was c laiming both privileges. As for the penc illed-in advic e, Mr Kumar dismissed it as c ounsel’s submission from the bar. Any penc illed-in advic e for that matter would appear in the next draft as textual amendments, whic h amendments would likewise be protec ted by legal advic e privilege. By c omparing the drafts, D&N’s c omments c ould be identified and extrac ted. I should add that drafts are an essential part of the proc ess of advising and being advised. As for the first MASNET announc ement, it listed the tasks that both PWC and D&N were to “undertake”. The undertaking was to be a joint effort. I agreed with Mr Kumar that Cheong’s affidavit evidenc e was not inc onsistent with the statements in the two MASNET announc ements whic h were issued by APBL to ensure c omplianc e with its disc losure obligations under the relevant provisions of the Singapore Exc hange’s Listing Manual. 

27     The banks’ sec ond argument, whic h was also the princ ipal dispute between the parties, was the extent to whic h APBS c ould c laim privilege for c ommunic ations passed in c onfidenc e between APBS and D&N in the presenc e of PWC, whic h c ommunic ations were later inc orporated in the PWC Draft Reports that also c ontained D&N’s input. 

28     The starting point is that legal advic e privilege only c overs c ommunic ations between the legal adviser and his c lient. Ms Chew’s c ontention was that the Spec ial Committee was D&N’s c lient for the purposes of legal advic e privilege. As suc h, privilege did not attac h to c ommunic ations between D&N and the employees of APBS. 

29     The English Court of Appeal in _Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England (No 5)_ [2003] QB 1556 (“ _Three Rivers (No 5)_ ”) held that legal advic e privilege c ould not extend to doc uments prepared by employees or ex-employees of the Bank of England, whether or not for the purposes of the Bingham Inquiry into the c ollapse of BCCI. In that c ase, the Bank of England had set up the Bingham Inquiry Unit (“BIU”), an internal unit, to c oordinate its response to and evidenc e for the Bingham Inquiry. There was no dispute that legal advic e privilege applied to the ac tual c ommunic ations between the BIU and the Bank of England’s solic itors. In the c ontext of the preparations for the Bingham Inquiry, the c ourt regarded the BIU, and not the Bank of England or its individual employees, as the c lient. It therefore held that only c ommunic ations between the BIU and the lawyers would qualify for legal advic e privilege. Material brought into existenc e internally for the purpose of the Bank of England obtaining legal advic e was not protec ted as c ommunic ations between the lawyers and the Bank of England’s employees and offic ers, whether former or c urrent, were outside the ambit of legal advic e privilege. 

30     In the present c ase, the Spec ial Committee c omprised a spec ific group of direc tors of APBL with authority to ac t for and on behalf of APBL and APBS in their dealings with D&N in c onnec tion with Chia’s fraud and the unauthorised ac c ounts opened by Chia in APBS’s name. In fac t, D&N was ac ting for APBS and APBL. APBS is c laiming the privilege as “c lient”. Ms Chew’s question, “Who is the c lient?” is irrelevant bec ause, as Mr Kumar rightly pointed out, the wording of s 128 of the Ac t expressly inc ludes c ommunic ations made to the solic itor “by or on behalf of his c lient”. The provision makes no distinc tion between c ommunic ations made by an individual and those made by his employee or agent. Neither is there a distinc tion made between c ommunic ations made by a c orporate c lient and those made by the c orporate c lient’s employees or agents. This view is the same as the c ommon law position, whic h is that both the c lient and the solic itor may ac t through the medium of an agent (see [34] below). From this perspec tive, the dec ision in _Three Rivers (No 5)_ is inc onsistent with the provisions of s 128 on professional c ommunic ations and is inapplic able by virtue of s 2(2) of the Ac t. 

31     There is thus no question that the c ommunic ations between APBS and D&N _prima facie_ fell within the ambit of legal advic e privilege. The c omplic ation arises from the fac t that these c ommunic ations were made in the presenc e of PWC, who was stric tly speaking a third party to the 


solic itor-c lient relationship between D&N and APBS. The question is whether c onfidentiality, whic h is an essential element of legal advic e privilege, is lost in these c irc umstanc es. Put another way, the issue is whether APBS, in disc losing the interviews, was nec essarily manifesting an intention to give up privilege for a c ommunic ation whic h might otherwise be privileged. 

32     Case law indic ates two strands of authorities in whic h c onfidentiality, and thus privilege, c ontinues to attac h to c ommunic ations made between a c lient and his lawyer in the presenc e of a third party. 

33     The first strand of authorities c onc erns solic itor-c lient c ommunic ations that are disc losed to the third party in c onfidenc e. In suc h c ases, legal advic e privilege still attac hes to the c ommunic ations as against outsiders suc h as the banks in the present proc eedings. This c an be seen from the dec ision of Colman J in _Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding NV v Bacon & Woodrow_ [1995] 1 All ER 976. There, the plaintiff (“NRG”) assembled a team c omprising, _inter alia_ , merc hant bankers, lawyers and ac c ountants to advise on the purc hase of the share c apital of three insuranc e c ompanies. Subsequently, NRG disc overed that it had taken on more liabilities and sued its non-legal advisers for negligent advic e. The ac c ountants sought spec ific disc overy of c ommunic ations that passed between NRG and its lawyers for the purpose of obtaining advic e in c onnec tion with the transac tion. The ac c ountants c ontended that NRG c ould not c laim legal advic e privilege against them sinc e all of NRG’s advisers worked together in a team. Communic ations had passed between the legal and non-legal advisers on many oc c asions both at meetings and in telephone c onversations and by c orrespondenc e. Sometimes, the legal advisers c ommunic ated only with NRG. Sometimes, the legal advisers c ommunic ated with the other advisers and sometimes with both. There was also disc losure to the non-legal advisers of doc uments c ontaining legal advic e given to NRG. Colman J held that the lawyers owed a qualified duty of c onfidenc e to NRG to the extent that if, for the purpose of giving advic e on the transac tion, the lawyers exerc ising their professional judgment c onsidered it nec essary in the performanc e of their duties to disc lose any c ommunic ations passing between them and NRG to the non-legal advisers, the lawyers c ould go ahead to do so. Correspondingly, the non-legal advisers owed a duty of c onfidenc e to their c lient. As suc h, they would have been professionally unable to show doc uments whic h they were shown by NRG or its legal advisers to a third party. In explaining that the lawyers had professional disc retion in the matter, Colman J at 984 said: 

 They were working in a developing transac tion where negotiations in respec t of the terms of the deal were progressing and where many of those terms related to matters on whic h the other nonlegal advisers were retained to advise. It was obviously essential that in order to give further advic e and in order that NRG should get the professional advic e whic h it needed from the team, the legal advisers should from time to time be able to disc lose to those other advisers their c ommunic ations whic h NRG or the advic e they were giving to NRG. This was c learly an implied qualific ation to the duty of c onfidenc e whic h [the lawyers] owed to NRG. 

As for c ommunic ations whic h were never disc losed to the other non-legal advisers and whic h were the subjec t matter of the disc overy applic ation, Colman J held that they remained c onfidential and privilege c ontinued to attac h to them. Signific antly, even if as between the team members no c laim for privilege c ould be maintained for the c onfidential c ommunic ations disc losed, NRG c ould still have c laimed privilege as against the rest of the world. See also Charles Hollander QC, _Documentary Evidence_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2003) at para 17-04. 

34     The sec ond strand of authorities c onc erns a third party as an agent for c ommunic ation. Both the c lient and solic itor may ac t through the medium of an agent. Communic ations between a c lient and his lawyer in a third party’s presenc e will remain c onfidential (and legal advic e privilege is available) where the third party is an agent for c ommunic ation of either the c lient or the lawyer, or of 


both (see _Wheeler v Le Marchant_ ([20] _supra_ ) at 682). 

35     The above princ iples are c lear enough. The diffic ulty lies in applying them to the c irc umstanc es of any partic ular c ase. Eac h c ase must of c ourse depend upon its own partic ular fac ts, and a detailed sc rutiny of the exac t c irc umstanc es under whic h the solic itor-c lient c ommunic ations in question passed is definitely required. 

36     Turning to the c irc umstanc es of the present c ase, as stated in [9] above, APBS appointed external lawyers at the outset on 4 September 2003 to jointly undertake the work desc ribed in the first MASNET announc ement. The degree of c ollaboration between PWC and D&N as a team, and the extent of the latter’s legal input were real and not peripheral. It was not suggested, and I would not find that the engagement of external lawyers by APBS was a c olourable devic e to c over the PWC Draft Reports with privilege. It was in the c ontext of a legal professional relationship that involved advising on legal rights and obligations in respec t of the unauthorised loans taken out by Chia in APBS’s name that D&N met and interviewed employees of APBS. These interviews and meetings were jointly c onduc ted by D&N and PWC, and the information gathered from the interviews would have been proc essed by D&N and inc orporated in the PWC Draft Reports. Although these draft reports were eventually prepared and sent to the Spec ial Committee in PWC’s sole name, the fac t remains that they were worked on jointly by the ac c ountants and D&N before being submitted. 

37     In these c irc umstanc es, I was able to infer from the joint appointment of PWC and D&N an obligation of c onfidenc e owed to APBS by both PWC and D&N. It followed that disc losure of the interviews between D&N & APBS’s employees to PWC took plac e on a c onfidential basis. The c onfidential c harac ter of these c ommunic ations was not destroyed even when passed or made in the presenc e of PWC. On this ground, the PWC Draft Reports, whic h inc orporated suc h c onfidential c ommunic ations, c ontinued to be privileged. For privilege purposes, eac h draft report was a rec ord of the privileged c ommunic ation and had the same sort of quality as the c ommunic ation itself. The PWC Draft Reports were direc tly related to the performanc e of the duties undertaken by D&N and c onfidential c ommunic ation passing between D&N and PWC was privileged against the banks. Protec tion is afforded for disc losure of that material might reveal the c ontents of c onfidential c ommunic ations gathered by D&N from the interviews with employees of APBS for the purpose of fulfilling its professional employment. Suc h information would equally have c ontained the thoughts of the lawyers in regard to the matters c ommunic ated to them at the interviews and would thus be protec ted by privilege: see _Kennedy v Lyell_ (1883) 23 Ch D 387 at 408. 

38     A further ground whic h led me to rule that legal advic e privilege c ontinued to attac h to those c ommunic ations between APBS and D&N whic h were made in PWC’s presenc e was that PWC was APBS’s agent for c ommunic ation (see [34] above). 

39     On this point, Ms Chong c ontended that APBS made no mention of agenc y in the sense desc ribed above. With respec t, Ms Chong omitted to take into ac c ount the nature of PWC’s and D&N’s joint appointment and the fac t that the ac c ounts and the lawyers c ollaborated as a team in fulfilment of their engagement. These two fac tors were c entral to APBS’s c ase on legal advic e privilege. Implic it from the lawyers’ and the ac c ountants’ joint appointment (and it would be unrealistic if that was not the c ase) would be c onsent and authorisation from the c lient to eac h adviser to request, give and rec eive information and views to and from the other. Inevitably, APBS, its lawyers and its ac c ountants would interac t and c ommunic ate to rec eive and pass on any information or doc ument (inc luding privilege material) c onc erning the unauthorised ac c ounts whic h either D&N or PWC thought appropriate so to do. Eac h of them was the agent of APBS in c ommunic ating with the other. To give an example, PWC had spec ial duties and responsibilities as ac c ountant to follow the money trail and rec ommend enhanc ing or c hanging existing internal c ontrols. 


At the same time, on ac c ount of its joint appointment with D&N, PWC also had the duty to give and rec eive c ommunic ations to or from the lawyers as APBS’s agent for c ommunic ations so as to bring it within the purview of legal advic e privilege. 

40     I pause here to mention that in so far as the issue of agenc y is c onc erned, the fac ts of this c ase differ from those in _Wheeler v Le Marchant_ ([20] _supra_ ). There, a solic itor rec eived reports from a surveyor on a property in the c ourse of advising his c lient at a time when there was no pending litigation. When the property later bec ame the subjec t matter of litigation, it was held that the reports were not protec ted by legal advic e privilege as the surveyor was merely a produc er of the information in question, and not an agent for the c ommunic ation of suc h information. Similarly, in _Price Waterhouse v BCCI_ ([15] _supra_ ), the c laim for legal advic e privilege did not rest upon any notion of the ac c ountants being an internal organ of BCCI. The ac c ountants’ report was to enable BCCI’s solic itors to give legal advic e to BCCI in respec t of the problem loans and was thus not privileged. The c ourt equated the position of Pric e Waterhouse with the surveyors in _Wheeler v Le Marchant_ , _ie_ as produc ers of the material and not agents for c ommunic ation. 

41     Quite apart from the fac t that PWC was APBS’s agent for c ommunic ations and that those c ommunic ations between APBS and D&N whic h took plac e in PWC’s presenc e oc c urred in c onfidenc e, the PWC Draft Reports in their entirety attrac ted legal advic e privilege for another added reason – namely, the privileged material c ommunic ated to PWC was, so to speak, inseparably embedded in the reports. I agreed with Mr Kumar that the findings of the ac c ountants in the PWC Draft Reports c ould not be presented from purely an ac c ounting point of view without a legal dimension and perspec tive. Redac tion or separation of parts of the drafts so as to exc lude passages c ontaining privileged information would not be prac tic al here sinc e PWC and D&N ac ted as a single unit. The PWC Draft Reports were in all likelihood so intertwined with the legal advic e and assistanc e given by D&N to PWC that these reports bec ame part of the privileged solic itor-c lient c ommunic ations. A similar view was taken in _Re Sarah Getty Trust_ [1985] QB 956, where a direc tor of an oil c ompany sought disc losure of information whic h a solic itor had rec eived from the c ompany’s representatives and whic h he had then passed on to his c lient. The c ourt rejec ted the suggestion that part of the privileged solic itor-c lient c ommunic ations c ould be separated out and taken outside the ambit of the privilege. It held that the c ommunic ations between the solic itor and his c lient, inc luding the information in question, were made in a professional c apac ity for the purpose of giving legal advic e and therefore, the information c ould not be separated from the rest of what was said between them. 

42     Lastly, I should mention that the notion of severanc e was advoc ated by Tan Yoc k Lin in _The Law of Advocates and Solicitors in Singapore and West Malaysia_ (Butterworths Asia, 2nd Ed, 1998). The author argued for its applic ation where c ommunic ations passed between a c lient and all the members of its team, as well as between the members of the team _inter se_. Tan Yoc k Lin at p 551 reasoned: 

 [T]he only situation in whic h c ommunic ations from third parties not for the purpose of litigation c an attrac t privilege would be where they c annot be hived off from the rest of the solic itor and c lient c ommunic ations. 

After explaining his view that the “doc trine of severanc e gives flexibility to the rule of privilege given the c hanging role of solic itors in modern soc iety where solic itors are engaged in a wider range of ac tivities of a legal nature”, the author added at p 539: 

 Where disc losure is sought of a doc ument, it may be impossible to sever one part of it from another. If one part is privileged, the privilege must be asserted to the whole. In these c irc umstanc es, the c ourt will ac c ord privilege to the whole doc ument as being the simplest, 


 safest and most straightforward thing to do. 

43     For these reasons, I held that APBS’s c laim for legal advic e privilege was made out. 

**_Litigation privilege_** 

44     I now turn to the question of litigation privilege in the event a different view is taken on legal advic e privilege. Whilst it appears that legal advic e privilege ac c ords with the Ac t, litigation privilege is based on c ommon law princ iples: see _Singapore Civil Procedure_ ([17] _supra_ ) at p 469; _Brink’s Inc v Singapore Airlines Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 657</span>; and _The Patraikos 2_ <span class="citation">[2001] 4 SLR 308</span> at [13]. Litigation privilege is wider than legal advic e privilege and c an inc lude doc uments brought into being by a third party, provided that the dominant purpose of suc h doc uments is to obtain legal advic e as to whether a c laim c an be made or defended in litigation. The test for determining whether or not litigation privilege attac hes to the PWC Draft Reports is as follows: (a) the draft reports must have c ome into existenc e when litigation was pending or antic ipated or in c ontemplation; and (b) the dominant purpose of preparing these draft reports must have been for use in, or in c onnec tion with litigation then pending or antic ipated or in c ontemplation. 

45     The leading authority on litigation privilege is _Waugh v British Railways Board_ ([15] _supra_ ) whic h was adopted and followed in _Brink’s Inc v Singapore Airlines Ltd._ The argument in _Waugh v British Railways Board_ c entred on the status of an internal report prepared by two of the British Railways Board’s offic ers two days after a c ollision involving the death of a loc omotive driver. While the report undoubtedly c ontained material c ollec ted by or on behalf of the Railways Board for use of their solic itors in antic ipated litigation, the House of Lords ruled that bec ause it c ould not be shown that suc h use was the dominant purpose for preparing the report, the doc ument did not attrac t litigation privilege. Lord Edmund-Davies said of this aspec t of privilege from disc losure: 

 Litigation, apprehended or ac tual, is its hallmark. 

Litigation is antic ipated or in c ontemplation if, objec tively on the fac ts and c irc umstanc es, litigation was a reasonable prospec t as distinc t from “an average possibility of a c laim”: see _Brink’s Inc v Singapore Airlines Ltd_ at [19] and _Re Highgrade Traders Ltd_ [1984] BCLC 151 at 172. 

46     Dealing first with the question of whether litigation was pending or c ontemplated when the PWC Draft Reports c ame into existenc e, the relevant time to c onsider this is the time when the PWC Draft Reports were prepared; c ontrary to the banks’ submission, it is not the time when D&N was first instruc ted by the Spec ial Committee on 4 September 2003. Given that APBS, through D&N, wrote to Hypo’s lawyers on 5 September 2003 disavowing the unauthorised loans and ac c ounts c reated by Chia, there was little doubt that litigation would ensue given, _inter alia,_ the magnitude of the fraud. The prospec t of litigation was beyond doubt by the time the sec ond MASNET announc ement was made, as evidenc ed by APBL’s statement therein that the banks had asserted c laims against APBS (see [11] above). Indeed, Hypo, Sumitomo and Mizuho had sent demand letters to APBS before the sec ond MASNET announc ement was made. Peter Vassiliou, the managing direc tor of Hypo, stated in his affidavit of 5 September 2003 that APBS was likely to be made a party to subsequent proc eedings. For these reasons, I found that litigation was reasonably in prospec t at the time the PWC Draft Reports were prepared. A first draft of the reports would have been ready sometime before 24 September 2003 to enable APBL to release the sec ond MASNET announc ement in those terms. The fac t that an engrossed final report was never issued (unlike the fac tual sc enario in all the other c ases c ited by the parties) and that it was unc lear when exac tly the PWC Draft Reports were sent to the Spec ial Committee were immaterial. 


47     As for APBS’s dominant purpose in preparing the reports, the banks c ontended that litigation c ould not have been the dominant purpose. Ms Chew emphasised that the first MASNET announc ement made no mention of possible c laims by the banks against APBS arising from Chia’s fraud. The main foc us, she argued, was instead to gather the relevant fac ts, assess the financ ial impac t of the fraud on APBS and review the c ompany’s internal c ontrol and proc edures so as to prevent the oc c urrenc e of similar unauthorised transac tions. This showed that APBS’s dominant purpose in preparing the PWC Draft Reports was to c omply with its Reporting Proc edure on Fraud, under whic h the c ompany had to investigate and report all fraud c ommitted regardless of whether there was any pending litigation. Litigation, it was said, was at best a sec ondary purpose for preparing the PWC Draft Reports and that was insuffic ient for litigation privilege to attac h to the doc uments. 

48     I was not persuaded by the banks’ arguments on the dominant purpose of the PWC Draft Reports. How the banks c ame to be defrauded had already been made known on 2 September 2003. As far as APBS was c onc erned, the ac c ounts that Chia opened with the banks and the bank loans whic h he obtained were unauthorised. By 5 September 2003, APBS had disavowed these loans and ac c ounts. The PWC Draft Reports would have been required for legal advic e on whether the denial of liability c ould be maintained. By 24 September 2003, APBL’s position, as set out in the announc ement in MASNET, was that the c laims by the banks against APBS would be strenuously defended. Taking an objec tive view of all of the evidenc e, I felt that the c onfidential legal advic e c ontained in the PWC Draft Reports was prepared predominantly for the purpose of prospec tive litigation against APBS. Asc ertaining the financ ial impac t of the fraud on APBS would in c ontext be relevant for litigation as well, as at that time, APBS was c o-operating with Hypo to injunc t the assets of Chia. Rec ommendations, if any, on improving internal c ontrols in APBS were merely a subsidiary purpose. 

49     In view of these fac ts, I was satisfied that APBS had a sustainable c laim for litigation privilege as well. 

**Result** 

50     Sinc e APBS suc c eeded on either the legal advic e privilege or the litigation privilege issue, I allowed its appeal and ruled against produc tion of the PWC Draft Reports.
