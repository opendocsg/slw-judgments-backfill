**Introduction** 

1       This appeal arises from an applic ation made by JAK Alhadad & Co Pte Ltd ("JAK") to be joined as 

14     th defendant in this ac tion c ommenc ed by Beng Tiong Trading Import & Export (1988) Pte Ltd ("Beng Tiong") against 12 benefic iaries of the estate of Shaik Ahmad Bin Abdullah Wahdain Basharahil 

("the Testator"), with the Public Trustee being named as the 13th defendant. However JAK’s applic ation also inc luded a prayer that an Order of Court dated 19 July 1999 ("the 1999 Order) be set aside. 

2       The Testator died on 15 July 1995 in Madura, Indonesia, leaving a large number of properties in Singapore. He made a Will in Singapore on 3 September 1938. 

3       Probate to the Will of the Testator was originally granted to Shaik Sayeed bin Ahmad Wahdain Basharahil, one of the Exec utors and Trustees named in the Will. Subsequently the Public Trustee was appointed trustee of the Will by an Order of Court dated 11 Oc tober 1976 in Originating Summons No. 80 of 1976 as the Court was satisfied that the original trustee was permanently residing out of the jurisdic tion and was unfit to ac t as suc h trustee. By this order, 61 immovable properties belonging to 


the estate of the Testator bec ame vested in the Public Trustee. Sinc e then 32 of those properties have been c ompulsorily ac quired by the State leaving only 29 immovable properties vested in the Public Trustee. 

4       On 11 July 1996, Beng Tiong c ommenc ed the present ac tion ("Beng Tiong’s ac tion) to c laim the rights and interests of 12 benefic iaries in the immovable properties identified in a Consent to Sale dated 12 August 1993 ("the Consent"). The Consent had an annexure whic h was a draft agreement. About three years later, on 19 July 1999, Beng Tiong obtained the 1999 Order before an Assistant Registrar. The 1999 Order was obtained after arguments had been presented by Counsel for Beng Tiong and Counsel for the Public Trustee. It states, inter alia: 

 1.0 The Pla intiffs a re he re by de cla re d e ntitle d to the rights , inte re s ts , be ne fits a nd e ntitle me nts o f the 1s t, 2n d, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 9th, 10th a nd 12th De fe nda nts in the immo va ble pro pe rtie s ide ntifie d in the C o ntra ct da te d 12 Augus t 1993.

 [the o the r o rde rs a re no t ma te ria l fo r pre s e nt purpo s e s .] 

5       Subsequently, the Public Trustee, as the first applic ant, and Quraisj Wahidin ("Quraisj"), as the sec ond applic ant, applied for various reliefs in OS 1030/2000. Quraisj was the attorney of six persons c laiming to be some of the benefic iaries under the will of the Testator. In that applic ation, the applic ants sought, inter alia, an order that the Public Trustee be empowered to sell the properties desc ribed in the sc hedule thereto free from enc umbranc es inc luding: 

 (a) the equitable interests of the benefic iaries under the will of the Testator, 

 (b) the interest c laimed by various c aveators against the properties. 

6       The applic ation for sale was objec ted to by the fifth respondent ("Musa") and the sixth respondent ("Salim"). They c laimed to represent another group of benefic iaries. They also c laimed that the persons whom Quraisj represented were not benefic iaries under the will of the Testator. Musa and Salim c laimed that those whom they represented c onstituted all the benefic iaries. 

7       Musa and Salim then filed OS 600626/2001 as plaintiffs and named the Public Trustee and Quraisj as 


defendants. In that applic ation, they sought a determination of the true and lawful benefic iaries of the estate of the Testator and their respec tive shares and properties. 

8       At a hearing of OS 1030/2000 on 1 September 2000, Beng Tiong appeared as an interested party. JAK was the fourth Respondent in this OS. 

9       On 28 September 2001, after hearing parties, Judic ial Commissioner Lee Seiu Kin ordered that: 

 (a) the Public Trustee be empowered to take steps in preparation for the sale of the Properties provided that no sale was to be made without the prior approval of the c ourt, 

 (b) an inquiry be c onduc ted to asc ertain the persons entitled to the Properties, 

 (c ) OS 600626 of 2001 be c onsolidated with OS 1030 of 2000 and that any inquiry be held on a date to be fixed. 

He also gave c onsequential direc tions. 

10     On the same day, Beng Tiong was given leave to be joined as the seventh Respondent in OS 1030/2000 in view of the 1999 Order that Beng Tiong had obtained. 

11     The inquiry ordered by Lee JC was c onduc ted on 3 July 2002 after whic h he made a determination of the benefic iaries. After hearing the parties as to c osts, he made the following dec larations and orders (Lee JC’s 2002 Order’):

 THE SC HEDULE ABO VE REFERRED TO 

 [De ta ils o f the pro pe rtie s w e re s ta te d.] 

12     JAK c laimed to have loc us standi to make its present applic ation in Beng Tiong’s ac tion on the basis of two doc uments: 

 (a) An agreement dated 5 November 1994 between JAK and one Abdurrac hman who signed in his c apac ity as the attorney of the heirs and heiresses of the testator. 

 (b) A series of assignments made on 12 February 1996 between the representatives of those who c laimed through 6 original benefic iaries and a former direc tor of JAK, one Syed Jafaralsadg Bin Abdul Kadir Alhadad. 


13     The applic ation was heard on 13 November 2002 by an Assistant Registrar who ordered, inter alia, that: 

 (a) JAK be granted leave to be joined as the 14th Defendant in the ac tion, 

 (b) the 1999 Order be set aside. 

That order also required Beng Tiong to pay c osts to various parties. Beng Tiong was appealing against that order. 

**Submission for Beng Tiong** 

14     Mr Stanley Wong, Counsel for Beng Tiong, made submissions on the lac k of merit about JAK’s c laim and the merits of Beng Tiong’s c laim. 

15     He also submitted that JAK had been guilty of inordinate delay for the following reasons: 

 (a) Beng Tiong had lodged c aveats on the Properties on 28 September 1993, before the agreement or assignments whic h JAK was relying on. 

 (b) On 14 September 1999, Beng Tiong had lodged a memorandum with the Registry of Deeds regarding the 1999 Order. 

 (c ) JAK was a Respondent in OS 1030/2000 and when Beng Tiong appeared in that ac tion and eventually obtained leave to be added as a Respondent, JAK must have been aware of Beng Tiong’s c laim. 

 (d) On 2 May 2002, in OS 1030/2000, Lee JC had direc ted JAK to file any applic ation to set aside the 1999 Order within two weeks but JAK did not do so until about one and a half years later. No explanation for the delay was given. Its c onduc t bordered on the c ontumac ious. However, he ac c epted that no prejudic e had been c aused to Beng Tiong by JAK’s delay. 

16     Mr Wong also submitted that none of the benefic iaries who had signed the Consent was disputing its validity. Furthermore, before the 1999 Order was made, the Public Trustee was represented by Counsel (although it was a different one from Mr T P B Menon who was c urrently appearing for the Public Trustee) and that Counsel had made submissions against the c laim of Beng Tiong. 

17     However, Mr Wong admitted that Beng Tiong did not serve its applic ation, upon whic h it obtained the 1999 Order, on JAK whic h had also filed c aveats, or on other c aveators, even though Beng Tiong was aware of the c aveators before the 1999 Order was made. He said that there were too many c aveators and he c laimed that he had disc losed to the Assistant Registrar who made the 1999 Order the existenc e of the other c aveats. However, he was not direc ted to serve Beng Tiong’s applic ation on anyone else. Unfortunately, the notes of arguments leading to the 1999 Order did not reflec t the disc losure made by Mr Wong. 

**Submission for the Public Trustee (Thirteenth Defendant) and Quresh Bin Muchsia Bin Achmad Abdullah Wachdin Basharahil Alias Quraisj Wahidin S.H. Quresh Muchsin Wachdin (‘Quresh’) (Sixth defendant)** 

18     As I have mentioned, Mr T P B Menon was the c urrent Counsel for the Public Trustee who is the 


Thirteenth Defendant in Beng Tiong’s ac tion. Mr Menon also ac ted for Quresh who is the Sixth Defendant in the same ac tion. Mr Menon said that various persons c laiming to be benefic iaries had purportedly sold their interests in the estate of the Testator to various parties. 

19     Mr Menon submitted that the Consent was invalid for various reasons. I need only deal with his main reason whic h is that the Court of Appeal had dec ided that the Consent had been fatally impinged in _Lee Siong Kee v Beng Tiong Trading Import and Export (1988) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2000] 4 SLR 559</span>. This demonstrated that the 1999 Order was wrongly made. 

20     Sec ondly, he submitted that Lee JC’s 2002 Order had impliedly over-ruled the 1999 Order sinc e the Public Trustee c ould now sell the Properties free from all enc umbranc es. He submitted that Lee JC’s 2002 Order was c ontrary to the 1999 Order and Beng Tiong had not appealed against Lee JC’s 2002 Order even though it had objec ted to the applic ation for an order empowering the Public Trustee to sell the Properties. 

21     Thirdly, Mr Menon submitted that the Writ in Beng Tiong’s Ac tion was only served on six out of the 12 Defendants and not on Quresh. Furthermore, it was only served on a village headman. Also the affidavit in support of the servic e did not set out all the fac ts and, also, the 1999 Order was obtained without disc losure of all the relevant fac ts. 

22     Fourthly, Mr Menon submitted that the Public Trustee had, pursuant to Lee JC’s 2002 Order put up the Properties for sale by public tender on 27 November 2002 and yet Beng Tiong had not taken any step to stop the Public Trustee from proc eeding with the tender. 

23     Ac c ordingly, Mr Menon submitted that the c ourt was not prec luded whether by issue estoppel or res judic ata from setting aside the 1999 Order. Mr Menon said that there were spec ial c irc umstanc es why the c ourt should reopen the matter and set aside the 1999 Order in view of the dec ision of the Court of Appeal in the c ase of _Lee Siong Kee_. Mr Menon c ited _Property & Revisionary Ltd v Templar_ [1977] 1 WLR 1223 and _Arnold v National Westminister Bank_ [1991] 3 All ER 41 to support his argument. 

**Submission for JAK** 

24     Ms Norain Abu Bakar, Counsel for JAK, ac c epted that there was delay on the part of JAK in proc eeding with its applic ation to be added as a party in Beng Tiong’s ac tion and to set aside the 1999 Order. However she submitted that as Lee JC’s direc tion to JAK (to do so within two weeks of his order) was not an "unless" order, JAK was not prec luded from making its applic ation late. 

25     Ms Tan, the c o-c ounsel for JAK, also ac c epted that the order of the Assistant Registrar allowing 

JAK’s applic ation to be joined as a 14th defendant in Beng Tiong’s ac tion and to set aside the 1999 Order was not a determination of the merits of Beng Tiong’s c laim. 

**Reply Submission for Beng Tiong** 

26     Mr Wong submitted in his reply that the c ase of _Lee Siong Kee_ was on different fac ts. There, the plaintiff was suing Beng Tiong for his remuneration under an agenc y agreement. He did not agree that the Court of Appeal had thrown out all Beng Tiong’s rights under the Consent. 

27     Mr Wong also informed me that while Beng Tiong was not trying to stop the Public Trustee from selling the properties whic h were before Lee JC, Beng Tiong’s position was that it was still entitled to the proc eeds of sale and, for this reason, to rely on the 1999 Order. 


**My Decision** 

28     As there was no prejudic e to Beng Tiong arising from JAK’s delay and Lee JC’s order was not an "unless" order, I was of the view that JAK should not yet be shut out from pursuing its c laim just bec ause of its failure to c omply with the two week dead-line from Lee JC. 

29     However, I was of the view that the 1999 Order should not be set aside until there was a final order to the c ontrary. Before it was set aside, the 1999 Order itself was a final order as between Beng Tiong and the first, sec ond, third, fifth, sixth, nineth, tenth, twelfth and thirteenth defendants. 

As I have said, the Public Trustee is the 13th defendant in Beng Tiong’s ac tion. If the 1999 Order was set aside on the applic ation of JAK to be added as a defendant, then, it would mean that the Public Trustee c ould re-argue its c ase against Beng Tiong, without more, even though JAK had not yet established its c laim on the merits. 

30     Ac c ordingly, I was of the view that the Public Trustee c ould not simply ride on JAK’s applic ation to be added as a defendant. It seemed to me that even if the dec ision of the Court of Appeal in the _Lee Siong Kee_ c ase meant that the 1999 Order was wrongly made, this did not mean that the 1999 order was automatic ally set aside or c eased to have effec t. The Public Trustee would still have to make his own applic ation to set aside the 1999 order. 

31     As regards the _Templar_ c ase, the landlords there had c ommenc ed proc eedings in c onnec tion with a rent review c lause. The High Court made a determination of the rent review c lause against them. Subsequently, they attempted to set aside the earlier order made by the High Court in the light of a subsequent dec ision of the House Lords in another c ase whic h involved a similar rent review c lause. However, their attempt was made in the c ontext of their applic ation for leave to appeal out of time. Here, before me, the Public Trustee had not made any applic ation to appeal out of time. 

32     As for the _Arnold_ c ase, there was also a dispute regarding a rent review provision. The dispute arose on the first rent review date and the c ourt made a determination on the c onstruc tion of the provision whic h was favourable to the landlords. Shortly before the sec ond review date, the lessees sought a rec tific ation of the lease and a determination again on the true c onstruc tion of the provision on the ground that subsequent c ases had shown the judge’s earlier determination to be wrong. The landlords applied to strike out the lessees’ c laim on the ground of issue estoppel but their applic ation was dismissed. An important c onsideration was the fac t that the lessees’ c laim was not in respec t of rent as at the first rent review date but as at the sec ond review date. The landlords were relying on issue estoppel and not c ause of ac tion estoppel. In any event, my point is that the lessees there did make a separate c laim or applic ation rather than assume that the first dec ision had c eased to apply to the next rent review date in the light of subsequent dec isions in other c ases. 

33     Ac c ordingly, it was not nec essary for me to dec ide whether the Court of Appeal’s dec ision in the _Lee Siong Kee_ c ase nec essarily meant that the 1999 Order was wrong or whether the 1999 Order should be set aside. Likewise, if the Sixth defendant was to take the position that the Writ in Beng Tiong’s ac tion had not been properly served on him, then it was for him, and not JAK, to apply to set aside the 1999 Order vis-à-vis himself. 

34     As JAK wanted to c hallenge Beng Tiong’s entitlement to sale proc eeds, then it should c hallenge Beng Tiong’s c laim before the Public Trustee is persuaded or c ompelled to pay Beng Tiong part thereof by virtue of the 1999 Order. JAK was doing that but, as I have said, a final order had already been made under the 1999 Order as regards Beng Tiong and the first, sec ond, third, fifth, sixth, nineth, tenth, twelfth and thirteenth defendants. It seemed to me that it was too late for JAK to apply to be joined as a party in Beng Tiong’s ac tion. What it should do instead was to file a fresh ac tion and name 


Beng Tiong as one of the defendants. It would be for JAK’s solic itors to c onsider what the appropriate reliefs should be and who else should be named as defendants in the fresh ac tion. For example, should the benefic iaries, as determined by Lee JC, or some of them, be made defendants in JAK’s ac tion, sinc e JAK would presumably want whatever order it manages to obtain suc c essfully to be binding on those benefic iaries through whom it c laims? Should the Public Trustee be named as a defendant if JAK seeks, inter alia, an order for payment of the sale proc eeds from the Public Trustee? Should the other c aveators be inc luded as defendants as well, even though there may be many of them, otherwise, JAK may find itself in the same situation as Beng Tiong i.e even if JAK is suc c essful and the Public Trustee pays the sale proc eeds, or part thereof, to JAK, JAK is still at risk of fac ing a c laim by one or more of the other c aveators. Whether that c laim will be suc c essful or not is another matter. 

35     Even if the 1999 Order had not been made, it would not be suffic ient for JAK to be merely joined as a defendant in Beng Tiong’s ac tion bec ause it must not only c ontest Beng Tiong’s c laim but seek an order dec laring its own rights. If JAK were to be made a defendant in Beng Tiong’s ac tion, it would still have to make a c ounterc laim naming not only Beng Tiong but at least the benefic iaries through whom JAK c laims as defendants to its c ounterc laim. That would make matters in Beng Tiong’s ac tion very untidy. 

36     As for the question whether Lee JC’s 2002 Order had impliedly over-ruled the 1999 Order, I was of the view that it did so only to a limited extent, that is, the sec ond paragraph of the 1999 Order or part of the said sec ond paragraph would no longer apply (see paras 11and 4 above for Lee JC’s 2002 Order and the 1999 Order). I was also of the view that Lee JC’s 2002 Order was not intended to and did not affec t Beng Tiong’s entitlement as stated in paragraph 1 of the 1999 Order as that was not an issue to be dec ided by him. 

37     Ac c ordingly, on 24 Marc h 2003, I allowed the appeal of Beng Tiong on terms: 

 (a) the Order of the Assistant Registrar dated 13 November 2002 was set aside, 

 (b) JAK was at liberty to file a fresh ac tion by 14 April 2003 vis-à-vis Beng Tiong and any other party as JAK thought fit failing whic h JAK was prec luded from pursuing its c laim, 

 (c ) liberty was granted to JAK and the Public Trustee to apply to set aside the Order dated 19 July 1999 if the outc ome of JAK’s fresh ac tion warranted suc h an applic ation. 

38     If the Public Trustee still c onsiders that it is nec essary to set aside the sec ond paragraph of the 1999 Order or part thereof or the entire order, then it is up to him to seek suc h a prayer as when he dec ides to make an applic ation. 

39     Indeed, by 24 Marc h 2003, the Public Trustee had applied for an extension of time to appeal against only the sec ond paragraph of the 1999 Order. Mr Wong did not c ontest that applic ation as it was c onfined to the said sec ond paragraph although he was of the view that the said sec ond paragraph need not be entirely deleted. Ac c ordingly, I allowed the applic ation for extension of time to appeal and this order of mine was also made on 24 Marc h 2003 in respec t of the Public Trustee’s applic ation. 

40     There is one other observation I wish to make. Counsel for the Public Trustee should re-c onsider whether it is appropriate for him to ac t for Quresh or any of the other benefic iaries vis-à-vis any c laimant of a benefic iary’s interest.
