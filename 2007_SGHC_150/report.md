**Introduction** 

1       This was an appeal from the dec ision of Distric t Judge Teoh Ai Lin (“the judge”) reported in <span class="citation">[2006] SGDC 37</span>, whereby it was, _inter alia_ , ordered that the petitioner, Au Kin Chung (“AKC”), and the respondent, Ho Kit Joo (“HKJ”), be awarded 30% and 70% of the matrimonial assets respec tively. AKC appealed against the dec ision, c ontending that (a) he should be awarded 50% of the matrimonial assets, and (b) the pool of matrimonial assets should be inc reased to inc lude profits derived from the sale of properties in the name of HKJ as well as the rentals c ollec ted by HKJ. At the c onc lusion of the hearing, I dismissed the appeal with c osts fixed at $8,000. AKC has sinc e filed a notic e of appeal against the whole of my dec ision exc ept for the moneys in OCBC Bank, New York, whic h was affirmed as a matrimonial asset subjec t to division. 

**Background** 

2       AKC is a businessman residing in Hong Kong. HKJ is a homemaker residing in Singapore. At the time of the anc illary hearing, AKC was aged 60 and HKJ was aged 62. There are two c hildren to the marriage, a son Au On Chin, Charles, aged 33, and a daughter Au On Yee, Abby, aged 31. The parties married in 1971, and the dec ree nisi was granted in 2003, based on four years of separation. This was a long marriage spanning over almost 32 years. 

3       The parties met in London. HKJ was then a state registered nurse and AKC was studying hotel management. AKC maintained that, at that time, he was a management trainee and was not, c ontrary to HKJ’s allegation, working as a night c ashier. Nothing turned on this differenc e in the storyline. After marriage, the parties returned to Singapore. AKC c ommenc ed work at the Goodwood Park Hotel as a Food and Beverage Manager and the last position he held was that of Corporate Exec utive Manager. In Singapore, HKJ first worked for an orthopaedic surgeon and than as a nurse with “Nestle Produc ts”, but moved on to private nursing (with its flexible sc hedule) to ac c ommodate the arrival of their son in 

1972\. In the early days, the parties stayed with HKJ’s father. Later on, they lived in a rented house in Sembawang Hills until they moved in 1973 to a two-bedroom apartment provided by the Goodwood 


Park Hotel. Their daughter was born in 1974 and two years later, in 1976, they bought a small apartment in Cairnhill Road. This was sold in 1979. The next property was No 37 Oei Tiong Ham Park (“37 OTH”), whic h was an old house requiring renovations. HKJ was a freelanc e property agent from 1978-1980. That stint as freelanc e property agent presumably set the stage for her subsequent personal interest and involvement in property investments, whic h c ontributed signific antly to the family wealth. Ac c ording to HKJ, 37 OTH was bought with the parties’ c ombined savings and a bank loan. In addition, about $75,000 was spent on renovations and another sum of $35,000 was for related expenses. AKC’s version was that the property was bought for $235,000 with his funds and a bank loan, and a further $110,000 was provided by him for renovations and other expenses. Ac c ording to HKJ, the purc hase of 37 OTH was a signific ant ac quisition as it provided the seed money for AKC’s ac quisition of the Cable Car Coffee Shops (“the Cable Car business”). Apart from the balanc e of the sale proc eeds of 37 OTH, HKJ said she gave to AKC a further sum of $50,000. Out of this $50,000, a sum of $30,000 was a loan from her sister and the balanc e sum of $20,000 was a gift from her father. Her c laims were strenuously c ontested by AKC. The judge found as a fac t that some of the proc eeds from the sale of 37 OTH in 1981 assisted with the ac quisition of the Cable Car business. The judge went on to rule that the Cable Car business was a matrimonial asset as it was ac quired during the c ourse of the marriage. The judge held that HKJ had made direc t financ ial c ontributions for its ac quisition through her share of the funds (from the sale of 37 OTH) remitted to AKC and by reason of her substantial non-financ ial c ontributions towards the marriage (see para 51 of the judge’s written grounds). 

4       Returning to the c hronology, AKC left his job at the Goodwood Park Hotel in 1980 and moved to Hong Kong. As he did not intend to work in Singapore any more, HKJ with the two young c hildren followed suit. Sometime thereafter, the property at 37 OTH was sold for $720,000 thereby making a profit of $375,000. Soon after, the family moved to London. The parties bought two London properties, namely, 52 Uxendon Hill and 6 Hatherly Grove. The c hildren were enrolled in private sc hools; HKJ worked part-time as a nurse, while AKC leased and managed a fast food take away business, whic h unfortunately did not do well and was eventually sold without a profit. In London, AKC oc c upied himself with some part-time c onsultanc y work. In 1981, AKC returned to Hong Kong. He found a job with the “Watson Group of Companies”, and he was assigned to manage a c hain of restaurants c alled the Cable Car Coffee Shops. HKJ and the c hildren again joined AKC in Hong Kong. However, soon thereafter, they all returned to Singapore with AKC staying bac k in Hong Kong to work. In Singapore, HKJ said she worked in her sister’s tailoring business. This was disputed by AKC who c ontended that HKJ operated a c lothing business from his shop unit in Orc hard Road and whenever she visited him in Hong Kong, she would make purc hases for her business in Singapore. There was something amiss in AKC’s version as the shop unit he mentioned was not purc hased until 1985 (see [6] below). 

5       As stated, sometime in 1983/1984, AKC purc hased the Cable Car business and expanded the c hain of restaurants extensively. AKC inc orporated four related c ompanies, amongst others, Multisec tors Ltd (“Multisec tors”). At or around this time, the parties purc hased an apartment in Hong Kong known as B3 Greenville Gardens (“Greenville property”) with two c ar park lots. This apartment was to serve as their residenc e. Subsequently, AKC with the c onsent of HKJ re-mortgaged the Greenville property to obtain more loans. In 1985, one of the properties in London, 52 Uxendon Hill, was sold. In that same year, their son went to study at a boarding sc hool in England. In 1985 alone, AKC in Hong Kong remitted approximately $250,000 for the family’s expenses. 

6       In 1987, the parties ac quired substantial assets; HKJ bought the property at 2775 Palmerston Avenue, Vanc ouver, Canada, while AKC ac quired properties in Hong Kong, namely two offic e units in Vinc ent Commerc ial Building as well as two fac tory units in Unison Building. The next year, 1988, was another signific ant year in that HKJ purc hased No 41 Oei Tiong Ham Park (“41 OTH”). It was not 


disputed that AKC had c ontributed $850,000 towards the purc hase of 41 OTH. In that same year, AKC sold part of the Cable Car business by selling 7000 shares in Multisec tors. In 1989, HKJ sold the shop unit in Midpoint Orc hard whic h was ac quired in the Marc h 1985. HKJ and her daughter moved into 41 OTH in 1989. At that time, the son was in boarding sc hool in England. The following year, the daughter was sent away to boarding sc hool in England and, not surprisingly, the family expenses were signific antly inc reased as a result. The overdraft sec ured on 41 OTH was inc reased to help meet the family’s expenses. Additionally HKJ wrote to AKC in November 1990 to help reduc e the overdraft and money for the family’s expenses. Pursuant to this request, AKC said he remitted a sum of HK$1 million to HKJ. HKJ denied that there was any suc h remittanc e. The judge, however, ac c epted AKC’s testimony that HK$1 million was sent to reduc e the overdraft of 41 OTH. At or around this time, HKJ sold the Canadian property. In 1989/1990, AKC also sold the two offic e units in Vinc ent Commerc ial Building, and shortly thereafter, ac quired the property in Westland Centre, Hong Kong. 

7       In 1991, AKC’s sec ond tranc he of 2998 shares in Multisec tors were sold. The c irc umstanc es surrounding the sale and, partic ularly, the sale proc eeds were c ontentious and this topic will be analysed in more detail below. Furthermore, from 1991 onwards, AKC stopped remitting money to HKJ for the family’s expenses. HKJ, in the meantime, vac ated 41 OTH in order to earn rental inc ome. In the same year, HKJ bought the property at No 24 Oei Tiong Ham Park (“24 OTH”) and c arried out renovations. AKC remitted $1 million to HKJ for this ac quisition. However, the judge ac c epted HKJ’s testimony that only $860,000 was remitted and not $ 1 million as alleged. The following year, HKJ purc hased the property at No 5 St Petersburg Mews, Bayswater, London (“The Mews”) and the c hildren oc c upied the property when they were studying in England from 1994 to 1999. AKC remitted a sum of $535, 557.54 to reimburse the purc hase pric e whic h HKJ had raised from her overdraft fac ilities in Singapore. In 1992, AKC ac quired a unit in Commerc ial Building, Kowloon whic h he resold in the same year. 

8       In 1994, HKJ found that AKC was having an affair with his sec retary and was c ohabiting with her openly. Realising that the marriage had soured, HKJ bought 11C Queen Astrid Gardens (“11C QAG”) as her permanent home. She has been living there ever sinc e by drawing on her own overdraft fac ilities. AKC did not remit any moneys for this ac quisition. Later that year, 24 OTH was sold as HKJ alleged that she was fac ing severe financ ial c onstraints as a result of the esc alating family expenses, interests on the overdraft fac ilities as well as maintenanc e and upkeep of the properties. HKJ admitted to using part of the proc eeds from the sale of 24 OTH to reduc e the overdraft in respec t of the purc hase of 11C QAG. 

9       In 1997, HKJ purc hased the property at No 80 Mount Sinai Drive, #11-05, (“The Sierra”). HKJ paid up 40% of the purc hase pric e in c ash and took out a bank loan for the remaining $500,000. In 1998, the National Bank of Asia threatened to forec lose the Greenville property as a result of AKC’s default. HKJ drew on her own overdraft fac ility and utilised the funds to redeem the Greenville property as well as the two c ar park lots. Soon after, the apartment and one of the c ar park lots were sold and HKJ remitted to AKC, his share of the sale proc eeds. In c ontrast, when AKC sold the remaining c ar park lot in July that year, he did not share the proc eeds with HKJ. 

10     Towards the end of 1998, HKJ sold the Hatherly Grove property and admitted that she did not share the proc eeds with AKC as she used the money for the family’s expenses and on the c hildren. Even though the c hildren had graduated, they c ontinued to rely on their mother to fund their privileged lifestyles and business ventures. In 1999 and 2001, AKC sold the fac tory units in Unison building. Again, as with sale of the other assets, he retained all the sale proc eeds for himself. In Marc h 2003, divorc e proc eedings were c ommenc ed on the ground of four years of separation. The dec ree nisi was granted in Oc tober 2003, and the anc illary matters were heard almost two years later in 2005. The judge delivered her judgment in November 2005. AKC appealed and the judge issued her 

 [note: 1] 

 [note: 2] 


written grounds of dec ision in Marc h 2006. 

11     In summary, at the time of the divorc e and to the extent of the parties’ disc losure, the existing matrimonial assets available for division were: (i) 41 OTH; (ii) 11C QAG; (iii) The Sierra; (iv) The Mews; (v) HKJ’s CDP Shares with an agreed value of $116,490; and (vi) all existing stoc ks and assets purc hased with the sum of US$155,200 whic h HKJ remitted to the son on 9 February 2004. 

**Issues on appeal** 

12     Two issues were addressed on appeal. The first main issue was on the judge’s division of the pool of matrimonial assets at 70% for HKJ and 30% for AKC. Before the judge and at the appeal before me, AKC had advoc ated an equal division of the matrimonial assets. The residential properties and shares in question were registered in HKJ’s name (see [11] above) and AKC sought to show that he provided part of the funds to ac quire the residential properties. AKC’s c hallenge was also direc ted at the extra share perc entage ( _ie_ 20%) awarded to HKJ (bringing her share to 70%) as being the best and most appropriate way to give effec t to the adverse inferenc e drawn against AKC for want of full and frank disc losure as to the assets in his name or where he had an interest. The sec ond main issue was on whether, for the purpose of division, the judge was right in exc luding from c omputation of the matrimonial assets, the profits derived from the sale proc eeds of properties disposed of during the marriage as well as the rental inc ome c ollec ted over the years. I propose to begin with the sec ond issue as it is a short point. 

**_Rentals and profits from the sale of properties_** 

13     It is trite law that the c ourt’s power to divide assets extends to those subsisting in the sole or joint names of the parties at the time of the hearing of anc illary matters. As suc h, assets bought but disposed of during the c ourse of the marriage, would not be inc luded in the pool of matrimonial assets for division. However, as the judge noted at [58] of her written grounds, “the Court would, in dividing the remaining matrimonial assets have regard to any sums or assets disposed of [during the marriage] and not properly ac c ounted for_._ ” This statement ec hoes the views of Judith Prakash J in _Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan_ (“ _Yow Mee Lan_ ”) <span class="citation">[2000] 4 SLR 466</span>. Prakash J at [69] said: 

 What the c ourt does is to divide the assets existing at the time of the divorc e and assets that were existing at any time prior thereto are not divisible as suc h. They are only relevant to assist the c ourt in determining whether there has been proper disc losure of the assets presently available for distribution. 

14     On the fac ts of the present c ase as found by the judge, AKC’s inability to ac c ount for, _inter alia_ , the sale proc eeds of the Cable Car business and the various Hong Kong properties were c ruc ial to and formed the basis of the judge’s dec ision to draw an adverse inferenc e against him. That is a separate issue for disc ussion elsewhere. Reverting to the issue under disc ussion, I agreed with the judge that there was no legal basis to notionally pool bac k moneys representing the profits from the sale of properties and rentals c ollec ted over the years. With the exc eption of moneys deposited with OCBC Bank, New York, c ounsel for AKC, Ms Susan Siaw, did not identify any other asset as representing the ac c umulated rental and net sale proc eeds. Apart from the properties disc losed (see [11] above), AKC had earlier asserted that HKJ also owned other properties in London, Singapore and Australia, an assertion she roundly rejec ted. It was plain that AKC was not able to substantiate his bare allegation, whic h appeared to have had its origin in rumours and gossip. 

15     In addition, the judge found that the sale proc eeds and rental inc ome were from time to time applied towards payment of existing mortgages, overdrafts and property-related expenses as well as 


the family’s expenses. Whilst AKC remitted funds over the years to HKJ, c ounsel for HKJ, Ms Ellen Lee who was assisted by Ms Bernic e Loo, explained (and this was ac c epted by the judge) that the bulk of the funds sent by AKC were mostly for property purc hases, leaving a total sum of $250,000 for the family’s expenses. AKC did not c ontrovert the explanation that the family’s expenses were substantial, partic ularly after 1985 when the son attended boarding sc hool in England, followed by the daughter in 

1990\. It was c ommon ground that the landed properties in Singapore were registered in HKJ’s name as she was a Singapore c itizen. Consequently, the loans and overdrafts for the properties were in HKJ’s sole name. She had to servic e the bank borrowings as well as pay for the upkeep, maintenanc e and repairs of the investment properties. Those obligations were disc harged utilising the rentals from the various properties and sale proc eeds. As the judge rightly observed: 

 [68] By and large after 1985, HKJ was left to manage the expenses of herself and the c hildren as well as the upkeep and the bank debts of the properties on her own. 

Besides, an equal division of net sale proc eeds and rental inc ome as argued for by AKC would result in double c ounting inasmuc h as the same funds were used to ac quire and maintain the properties that were already before the c ourt for division. 

16     Notably, AKC had never in the past c alled on HKJ to ac c ount for his share of the proc eeds or the sums she had spent on the family and the properties in her name. Having reviewed the evidenc e, I saw no reason to disturb the judge’s evaluation of the level of trust and c ooperation the spouses extended to eac h other, partic ularly, on money matters. The judge held: 

 [28] When the marriage was ongoing and the relationship was good, the parties remitted sums to help eac h other with their ac quisitions whenever the need arose. The happier years of their marriage up to at least 1994 was marked by this level of c o-operation and trust between them on money matters. Investments had been bought and sold for the c ommon good, sums ploughed bac k for other investments and living expenses, and the parties themselves had not distinguished whether the funds were his money or her money or asked eac h other to ac c ount for the sale proc eeds. 

17     AKC’s arid demand for his share of the past rentals spanning many years was rightly rejec ted by the judge who saw it as an afterthought just as the c ourt did in _BJ v BK_ <span class="citation">[2004] SGDC 87</span>. In that c ase, the distric t judge at [15] c ritic ised the husband’s attempts to do so in words that are equally applic able to the present c ase: 

 If the balanc e of the rentals c ollec ted was not intended as maintenanc e for the wife, the husband would have asked for his share at the time, or soon after, the rentals were c ollec ted. That is what anyone with a genuine c laim would have done in the ordinary c ourse. That the husband should seek an ac c ount of the rentals c ollec ted, dating bac k 10 years, after the parties are divorc ed and the apartment sold, appears to me to be in the vein of an afterthought. 

**_Division of assets in HKJ’s name_** 

_Equal division_ 

18     This c ase started off no different from the next as to how the matrimonial assets of the spouses should be divided. The problem was that AKC’s assets were not known. It was AKC’s c ase that he no longer had any assets in his name, had many unpaid debts and was without inc ome as he had yet to re-establish his business. He was not the suc c essful businessman he onc e was. AKC sought an equal division of matrimonial assets in HKJ’s name. It was AKC’s c ase that he provided the 

 [note: 3] 


funds for the property investments. He stated: 

 Virtually all of this wealth was ac quired by way of my money, money that I had earned by working overseas. The whole ac c umulation of wealth was based on the fac t that by working overseas, I c ould build a business to make money for property investment. My money would start the investments, and mortgages would be financ ed both by me and the rental inc ome. When the properties were sold, the profits would pay off the mortgages and financ e further purc hases. Where additional financ es were required, I supplied them. 

19     In the c ase of direc t financ ial c ontributions to the purc hase of the landed properties at 24 and 41 OTH and the Mews in London, the judge ac c epted AKC’s testimony that he remitted in perc entage terms, 36%, 53% and 100% respec tively of the purc hase pric e. As for the rest of his testimony, as between HKJ and AKC, the judge was less than impressed with the evidenc e of AKC. She remarked: 

 [45] ... I observed from the whole of [AKC’s] affidavits that he had a tendenc y to exaggerate and in c ertain instanc es his evidenc e was c alc ulated to mislead. 

The judge c ame to that c onc lusion in the first instanc e of an equal division of the matrimonial assets, but inc reased HKJ’s perc entage share of the matrimonial assets to 70% on ac c ount of AKC’s failure to give full and frank disc losure of his assets. An equal division of the matrimonial assets in HKJ’s name was based on the parties’ c ontributions (both financ ial and non-financ ial). The judge’s findings and c onc lusions based on authorities c ited in her written grounds were as follows: 

 [171] The fac ts of the present c ase bore some similarities to [ Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan <span class="citation">[2004] 4 SLR 466</span>]. Like Yow’s c ase, the parties here had built up the family wealth over the years. The Petitioner here, like the husband in Yow’s c ase, was the main inc ome-earner. His industry and enterprise enabled large sums to be paid for many of the property purc hases made after the Cable Car business bec ame suc c essful, whic h in turn financ ed the lifestyle of the family. The Respondent played a supporting role by looking after the family and managing their property portfolio. 

 ... 

 [173] Here, the Respondent’s c ontributions to the marriage were made c onsistently over a long period of time as well. She had contributed substantially towards the welfare of the family. She was the primary care-giver of the children in their earlier years. Despite their being sent to boarding school in their teens, the Respondent continued to visit them regularly and tend to them. 

 [174] In [ Wong Ser Wan v Ng Cheong Ling [2005] SCHC 218], the wife’s main c ontribution was in taking c are of the family, and she had been awarded 40% of the assets. Here [HKJ] had additionally played an active and direct part towards the enhancement of the family wealth. 

 ... 

 [177] This was a very long marriage of 32 years, a good number of years longer than the marriages in the three c ases c ited previously. HKJ had contributed in different ways from the Petitioner , but her contributions were no less significant ... Nonetheless, taking a broad brush approach , I would have awarded the respondent a 50% share of the assets she had been managing all these years and a smaller percentage of the other matrimonial assets built up by 

 [note: 3] 

 [note: 4] 


 the petitioner outside Singapore. 

 [Emphasis added]. 

20     The importanc e of the different c ontributions made by the spouses during their marriage has been rec ognised by the c ourts. The outc ome of the division ought to be as fair and equitable as possible in all the c irc umstanc es. Even if the judge had reac hed the opposite c onc lusion that HKJ did not use her savings to help ac quire 37 OTH, her efforts at c reating, enhanc ing and preserving the family fortune was no less signific ant. Suc h c ontributions have traditionally been given rec ognition as non-financ ial c ontributions in c ases like _Ryan v Berger_ <span class="citation">[2001] 1 SLR 419</span> and _Yow Mee Lan_. In the former c ase, an equal division of the matrimonial assets was ordered as the parties started off being “equal partners” both in the business and at home, and notwithstanding the arrival of their first c hild, the wife c ontinued to identify and work on property investments for the benefit of the family. The c ourt at [27] stated: 

 It was apparent that the parties had treated their relationship as both a domestic and a business partnership until the c irc umstanc es c hanged and the wife had to take on a more domestic role when she bec ame a mother. Even then, however, she c ontinued her efforts to c ontribute towards the maintenanc e and growth of the family assets by identifying and working on property investments for the benefit of the family. Some of these investments were undertaken by the c ompany (at the date of the hearing below, the c ompany owned some five real properties) while others were purc hased in the names of the parties or by the wife’s property investment c ompany. The wife’s position was that all profits as well as losses of her property investments were c redited or debited as the c ase may be to the parties’ joint ac c ounts and used to make further investments. It should be noted that up to the time of separation, the wife did not have her own bank ac c ount. 

21     In the same vein, Prakash J in _Yow Mee Lan_ at [42] to [44] observed: 

 To summarise, the marriage was a long one. The husband was the main inc ome earner. The wife looked after the home and c hildren and played a supporting role in the family business owned by the husband. It appears that she did not have either the knowledge or the talent whic h the husband did and c ould not herself have produc ed the substantial inc ome he was able to generate. In these c irc umstanc es, what would be a just and equitable division of the assets? The Distric t Judge plac ed great emphasis on the husband’s role as the inc ome generator and c onsidered that he should therefore have a major share of the assets. 

 With due respec t, that approac h no longer ac c ords with the legislation whic h takes a wider view. It rec ognises that a marriage is not a business where, generally, parties rec eive an ec onomic reward c ommensurate with their ec onomic input. It is a union in whic h the husband and wife work together for their c ommon good and the good of their c hildren. Eac h of them uses (or should use) his or her abilities and efforts for the welfare of the family and c ontributes whatever he or she is able to. The partners often have unequal abilities whether as parents or as inc ome earners but, as between them, this disparity of roles and talent should not result in unequal rewards where the c ontributions are made c onsistently and over a long period of time. 

 In the present c ase, the wife c ontributed to the best of her ability both to the maintenanc e of the family and to the business. She provided essential bac kup on whic h the husband c ould rely. He was able to travel for long periods safe in the knowledge that both his home and his business were in reliable hands. No doubt someone else c ould have done the administrative work in Plymat whic h the wife did (the husband was at pains to denigrate her work as being merely c leric al) but 


 with someone else in c harge, he would not have had the assuranc e that in the offic e his interests would not be undermined. 

Although the wife’s c ontributions to the business in _Yow Mee Lan_ were less direc t, the judge nevertheless took them into ac c ount (for the reasons stated), in awarding her an equal share of the matrimonial assets based on her indirec t c ontributions. 

22     Signific antly, the rec ent c ase dec ision of the Court of Appeal in _Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye_ <span class="citation">[2007] 3 SLR 520</span> went further. The appellate c ourt rec ognised as direc t financ ial c ontribution the efforts and ability of the homemaker in the ac c retion of the family wealth, and that tangible ac c retion, in turn, inc reased the value of the matrimonial assets available for division. In that c ase, the marriage was a long one lasting approximately 30 years. The appellant was a housewife and looked after the welfare of the home and the c hildren of the marriage. The parties did not dispute that the wife made little or no direc t financ ial c ontribution to the ac quisition of the matrimonial home and other assets. In fac t, the substantial investments in her name ( _ie_ exc eeding $500,000) were funded by the husband, in that she had used the moneys given to her for household expenditure and groc eries sparingly and proc eeded to invest the rest for the benefit of the family. In c ontrast, the husband, despite being a suc c essful banker and holding the position of Vic e President in a few regional banks, was noted to be a “poor investor or saver” and had only ac c umulated a mere $230,000 “after almost a lifetime of work” (ac c ording to his disc losed assets). The Court of Appeal in reversing the trial judge’s award of 60% for the husband and 40% for the wife had c onsidered the wife’s savvy investment ac umen as a direc t financ ial c ontribution to the ac c umulation of the family wealth, whic h entitled her to a half share of the matrimonial assets. The appellate c ourt noted at [41]: 

 Furthermore, in addition to the non-financ ial c ontributions of a spouse (more often than not, the wife) attention must be given to his or her direc t financ ial c ontributions through his or her efforts in inc reasing the total value of the matrimonial assets. This c ontribution must be taken into ac c ount for the purpose of inc reasing the proportion of matrimonial assets to be awarded to that spouse. This is not only logic al but is also eminently fair. This is, in fac t, the situation in the present c ase, where the wife not only looked after the home and the c hildren for 30 years, but also by her own efforts and investment skills, inc reased the value of the family assets c onsiderably to an amount larger than that brought in by the husband. In the c irc umstanc es, she must be given due c redit for this direc t financ ial c ontribution in the division of matrimonial assets. 

23     Likewise, the matrimonial assets in HKJ’s name, the subjec t of division, were c reated and built up over the years through HKJ’s foray into the property market, her industry and astute management of the properties ac quired during the marriage and all that c onstituted her direc t financ ial c ontribution towards the c reation and ac c umulation of the family fortune. I must add that her role as investment manager of the properties in her name inc reased the value of the matrimonial assets available for distribution. Her ac umen in buying old houses at c hoic e loc ations and flair for renovation were pivotal to and did c ontribute substantially to the spouses’ suc c essful foray into the loc al property market and the profits made generally, and in partic ular, from the sale of 24 OTH, whic h were ploughed bac k to financ e further ac quisitions (reduc ing overdrafts in respec t of existing properties and ac quiring one further property suc h as The Sierra in 1997). HKJ also appeared to have been suc c essful with her investments in London and Canada whic h had over time apprec iated in value. The properties were purc hased in her sole name and the loans and overdraft were in her name, suc h that she assumed the financ ial exposure in relation to the funding of the investments. 

24     Whilst, staking his c laim to the assets in HKJ’s name on the basis that the properties existed only bec ause he paid the down payments, AKC, nonetheless, ac knowledged HKJ’s c ontributions to the 

 [note: 5] 


family and family fortune. He said: 

 She of c ourse played a signific ant role in bringing up the c hildren, investing our money and maintaining our properties, but I started it, I financ ed it and determined the direc tion in whic h the investments should go. At a later date it seems she sold some of the properties without my knowledge and made other investments, but it c ould only have been with our joint assets. 

25     Continuing, AKC maintained: 

 It was the profits on 24 and 37 [OTH] that c reated the investment possibilities to c reate our wealth and the rental inc ome on 41 and 24 [OTH] as well as overseas properties that sustained and inc reased the wealth. 

26     HKJ rejec ted AKC’s c laim as an exaggeration that he determined the direc tion of the investments. She maintained that she alone managed the investments. Furthermore, it was out of c harac ter for AKC to c onc ern himself with renovations and maintenanc e of the properties. In my judgment, HKJ was solely in c harge of managing the properties in her name, renovations and their upkeep inc luding the maintenanc e of the family from the rentals. When her financ es were tight, she moved out of 41 OTH in 1991 and rented it to generate rental inc ome. In my judgment, HKJ was a homemaker but she still played a markedly valuable part in the ac c retion and ac c umulation of the family fortune. HKJ was c learly entitled at the least to an equal division of the matrimonial assets even if, for the sake of argument, there were no findings by the judge (or the judge had erred in her findings) that HKJ had used her savings to help ac quire the landed properties and that the c ash portion of the ac quisitions had all c ame from AKC. The rec ent dec ision of the Court of Appeal in _Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye_ gave rec ognition to the homemaker who had c reated and enhanc ed the family wealth available for division through her ac umen and astute investments. In my judgment, through HKJ’s industry and ability, the investment properties inc reased in number and their value apprec iated over the years. In c ontrast, AKC said he had nothing to c ontribute to the pool of matrimonial assets as the assets in his name were allegedly all gone. He was a no longer the suc c essful businessman he onc e was and was living on borrowed money from family and friends. 

27     Separately, it was inc ontrovertible, and AKC ac c epted that HKJ had made non-financ ial c ontributions by looking after the welfare of the two c hildren, without the support of the husband as he had been working in Hong Kong for most of their growing years. There is evidenc e in 1990 that she even wrote out the text of the letter for AKC to send to their son. She also reminded AKC to send a birthday c ard to the daughter. AKC’s good opinion of his c hildren, their ac c omplishment and personalities as he saw them was an example of the value of HKJ’s work in c aring for the c hildren. 

28     HKJ had also been supportive of the husband. By way of illustration, she allowed the overdraft fac ilities sec ured on the Greenville property to be inc reased for the husband’s business ventures. When AKC defaulted on the payments on the overdraft and the bank threatened to forec lose, HKJ drew on her own overdraft fac ilities to stave off the forec losure and a mortgagee’s sale. 

29     In the light of all these fac tors taken in c ombination and drawing parallels with the c ases referred to above, even though AKC had c ontributed financ ing for some of the properties, the judge favoured an equal division of the existing matrimonial assets for her c ontributions to both the welfare and wealth ac c umulation of the family. I saw no reason to disturb the judge’s assessment even though I might have awarded HKJ a 60% share of the matrimonial assets based on her direc t financ ial c ontributions and non-financ ial c ontributions. Oftentimes, it has been said that the division of matrimonial property is not based on any mathematic al exerc ise (see _Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye_ at [33]), but rather an applic ation of disc retion having regard to all the c irc umstanc es of the 

 [note: 5] 

 [note: 6] 

 [note: 7] 


c ase to arrive at a just and equitable outc ome. In any c ase, no adjustment was needed in the light of the approac h taken by the judge in awarding HKJ a higher perc entage share on ac c ount of AKC’s withholding information on his assets. 

**_Adverse inference and its impact on the proportion to be awarded to parties_** 

30     Having reac hed the point of an equal division of the matrimonial assets in HKJ’s name, the judge nevertheless inc reased her share by another 20%. The judge found that AKC had withheld information on his assets and her reasons for awarding HKJ a larger perc entage share of the matrimonial assets were as follows: 

 [181] ... I was of the view that as the Petitioner had not disc losed his assets and that these assets were substantial, it would not be equitable for him to share equally in the Respondent’s disc losed assets while he kept his undisc losed assets for himself. In the c irc umstanc es I awarded the Respondent a 70% share of her disc losed and asc ertainable assets. 

31     On AKC’s withholding information on his assets, the judge set out in extended form her findings: 

 [178] I drew adverse inferenc e against the Petitioner. He had not made full and frank disc losure of his assets, and he had among other things failed to satisfac torily ac c ount for the bulk of the sale proc eeds of the Cable Car business. He had also made c rafty attempts to paint a misleading pic ture of his financ ial position. I was of the view that he was stonewalling the Respondent by c laiming to be living on borrowed monies. 

 [179] The Petitioner’s non-disc losure stood on a different footing and sc ale from the Respondent’s. Whatever assets the Respondent had not disc losed or ac c ounted for c ould be trac ed to their property investments as she did not have any independent sourc e of substantial inc ome apart from the properties. 

 [180] The Petitioner on the other hand was a businessman, and he had business dealings in Hong Kong, China and Vietnam. It was not possible to put a figure on how muc h his assets were, but even taking into ac c ount any business set-bac ks he may have had, I believed that his undisc losed assets were substantial. He had not satisfac torily explained what happened to the large c apital sums he rec eived from the sale of the Multi Sec tors shares and the disposal of his other assets, aside from any other undisc losed assets or inc ome he ac quired through his other dealings in those many years after the Cable Car business was disposed of. He had been based in Hong Kong all these years engaged in business. He had family and friends there, and he c ould easily have parked his assets with them or arranged his financ ial affairs to avoid disc overy. 

32     The nub of the issue before me was whether the evidenc e, on analysis, supported the judge’s reasons for drawing an adverse inferenc e. I should state that it was open to the judge to draw adverse inferenc es if there had been withholding of information as was the c ase here. That is a material c onsideration in the c ontext of the exerc ise of disc retion under s 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed). The c ourt’s power to divide matrimonial assets embodied in s 112 is premised on the parties’ duty to provide full and frank disc losure of the assets ac quired throughout the c ourse of the marriage. Without proper disc losure of all matters relevant to the assessment of the financ ial position of the parties, the c ourt will have diffic ulty arriving at a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets. This paramount duty was desc ribed by Karthigesu J (as he then was) in the c ase of _Wee Ah Lian v Teo Siak Weng_ <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 688</span> at 698-699 in the following terms: 

 [T]he position in law is that full and frank disc losure is important and in its absenc e, the c ourt is 


 entitled to draw adverse inferenc es to the husband (in this c ase) as to his c apac ity or fac ulties and to treat him as a man in a position to c ommand a very substantial inc ome. 

33     I also fully adopt the observations of Otton LJ in _Baker v Baker_ [1996] 1 FCR 567 at 576 on the importanc e of disc losure for a proper division of matrimonial assets: 

 [T]here is a duty upon a party in proc eedings suc h as these to make a full and frank disc losure of all matters relevant to the assessment of the financ ial position of the parties and the relief to whic h a spouse is entitled. The integrity of the legal proc ess would be severely undermined if a party were permitted (and seen to be permitted) to evade that duty by a deliberate and stubborn refusal to make suc h disc losure to the other party and, more important, to the c ourt. 

34     The non-disc losure, and any inferenc e drawn, has to be a matter whic h c an properly be taken into ac c ount in arriving at a fair and equitable division. Needless to say, before drawing any inferenc e, adverse or otherwise, there had to be some evidenc e pointing towards the inferenc e to be drawn. What weight was to be attac hed to these fac tors is entirely for the c ourt to dec ide. The standard of proof of non-disc losure in anc illary matters is the normal c ivil standard of proof on a balanc e of probabilities (see _Al Khatib v Masry and others_ [2002] FCR 539). 

35     Although there is no blanket rule in relation to the c ourts’ powers upon drawing an adverse inferenc e (see _NK v NL_ <span class="citation">[2007] SGCA 35</span>), as the c ases illustrate, there are two possible ways of giving effec t to an adverse inferenc e drawn against a party to the proc eedings. The first approac h is for the c ourt, pursuant to the adverse inferenc e, to go on to determine the value of the undec lared asset. In _Tay Sin Tor v Tan Chay Eng_ <span class="citation">[2000] 2 SLR 225</span>, Kan Ting Chiu J at [18] held: 

 An adverse inferenc e was drawn against the husband that he has not disc losed all his assets. The Distric t Judge should not stop after drawing the inferenc e and should have gone on to determine the value of the undec lared assets. This c annot be done with prec ision bec ause it springs from a lac k of information, but nevertheless, a value should be inferred from the information available and it is for the party who is dissatisfied with it to show that it is unreasonable. This has to be done so that a value for the undisc losed assets c an be inc luded in the division. As matters stand, it is not known how muc h unac c ounted assets the husband was deemed to have, and how that influenc ed the eventual dec ision. 

36     The other approac h to giving effec t to the adverse inferenc e drawn against a spouse is to order a higher proportion of the known assets to be given to the other spouse. In _NK v NL_ , there was no explanation proffered by the husband as to what happened to the partic ular amount in question (a c onsiderable sum of $2.7 million) warranting an adverse inferenc e against him. In the c irc umstanc es, the Court of Appeal held that it was more just and equitable (and prac tic al) to order a higher proportion of the known assets to be given to the wife. 

37     Moving on to Ms Siaw’s arguments, her first point was that AKC was not hiding any assets and that the findings of fac t against him, whic h eventually led to the drawing of the adverse inferenc e, were misc onc eived. This was an argument that was premised purely on AKC’s assertion that he did not have any assets or own any property in Hong Kong or elsewhere. I would only be minded to disturb the judge’s findings, if AKC managed to persuade me that the said findings were manifestly wrong. Sec ond, Ms Siaw submitted that in any event (notwithstanding AKC’s alleged non-disc losures), the judge had failed to give due c onsideration to HKJ’s non-disc losures of all assets and sale proc eeds in her name and argued that as a result of this, the adverse inferenc es against both parties neutralised eac h other. 

 [note: 8] 


38     The approac h whic h the judge had taken by awarding a higher perc entage share of the matrimonial assets to HKJ on ac c ount of AKC’s withholding of information was not flawed. For division, all matrimonial assets were to be pooled but this was diffic ult as the judge found that there was nondisc losure of AKC’s assets. The judge c onsidered the fac tors set out in s 112 in so far as they were relevant. As stated, the question before me was whether the adverse inferenc e drawn against AKC was justified on the fac ts. In relation to the sale of the shares of the Cable Car business (effec ted via sale of the shares in Multisec tors), the judge held: 

 [109] I was of the view that the petitioner had deliberately made selec tive disc losure of the sale and purc hase agreement to bolster his c laim that the entire Cable Car group was only sold for $20.3 million. 

39     On his part, AKC merely noted that the first tranc he of shares was sold for HK$20.3 million. The remaining 2998 shares were retained by him, until the c ompany was wound up subsequently in 2001. Henc e, he c laimed to have rec eived a total of HK$20.3 million (and not the HK$33-35 million figure supplied by HKJ and relied upon by the judge) for all his shares in Multisec tors. Out of the HK$20. million, AKC said that his entitlement was HK$10 million as the other half went to his family members who had loaned him money to buy over the Cable Car business in the early days. AKC’s arguments at the c ourt below (whic h the judge helpfully summarised from [99] to [111] of the written grounds) displayed his tendenc y to vac illate between inc onsistent positions. To illustrate, AKC, at the outset, c ontended that all the shares were sold (in one tranc he). He then c hanged tac k, when HKJ disc overed that he had retained 2998 shares, saying that he held some shares bac k after 1989 and Luc ky Chain (the buyer of the first tranc he) asked him to sign the shares over to them, pending a sale on a third party. Thereafter, he submitted that no buyer was found until 1991, when the c ompany was wound up and ac c ordingly, he did not rec eive any c onsideration for these shares. As the judge observed at [107] of the written grounds, the notes (for the transfer of shares) that AKC had enc losed in his affidavit did not lend c redenc e to his version of the fac ts. First, the note was unsigned and the sale c onsideration left blank. Sec ond, the named purc haser was “Multi-ways Investments” and not Luc ky Chain as AKC had sought to argue. Third, the c ompany searc hes indic ated that when Multisec tors was wound up, Multi-ways was the registered owner of 3001 Multisec tors shares, whic h was c ontrary to and inc onsistent with AKC’s allegation that (i) Luc ky Chain had never found a buyer for his remaining 2998 shares, and (ii) the sale and transfer of the aforesaid shares had not been c ompleted prior to the winding up of Multisec tors and thus rendered his remaining shares worthless. 

40     There were other material inc onsistenc ies in his testimony whic h AKC did not explain away and they stemmed from the want of full and frank disc losure. For instanc e, AKC c laimed that he was not the sole shareholder of Multisec tors and that his family members as in his mother and siblings were shareholders of Multisec tors. Instead of produc ing a c ompany searc h on Multisec tors, he exhibited a c ompany searc h on Amber Development Limited. Eventually, HKJ c aused searc hes to be made in Hong Kong on the shareholders of Multisec tors. As at 31 Dec ember 1988, AKC was the major shareholder of Multisec tors with 9998 shares and two other individuals, Ronald Ho Woon Ching and Au Kin Wai held one share eac h. On 16 Marc h 1989, Au Kin Wai transferred his one share to Au Kin Yau. On 6 April 1989, AKC transferred 7,000 shares to Luc ky Chain Investment Limited. In addition, in the extrac t of the Agreement for the Sale and Purc hase of Shares in Multisec tors, AKC as vendor was identified as the benefic ial owner of the shares to be sold. AKC did not explain this important disc repanc y and his c laim that half of the sale proc eeds of HK$10 million belonged to his family members must be disc redited. Naturally, he had not ac c ounted for this HK$10 million of the sale proc eeds. He also c laimed that he sold the two units in Vinc ent Commerc ial Building for a profit of HK$500,000 and bought with a mortgage one fac tory unit in Westland Centre. He did not provide details of the purc hase pric e of the Westland Centre property and the amount of the mortgage and what was left 


vague was the question of whether the profit of HK$500,000 was used to pay for the Westland Centre property. He subsequently disc losed that the Westland Centre property was owned by Multisec tors and this property was sold along with the shares in Multisec tors to Luc ky Chain. However, that was not the c ase on an examination of the Hong Kong Land Register whic h showed that Multisec tors sold the property to Man Shing Development Enterprises on 23 January 1995 for HK$6.2 million. Notably, this 1995 sale took plac e more than five years after the sale of the Cable Car business to Luc ky Chain in 1989. As for AKC’s assertion that the property was not vested in him but registered in the name of Multisec tors, his disc laimer was fac ile. The c ourt c an pierc e the c orporate veil and disregard c orporate ownership. The c ourt c an and will adopt this approac h even where there are minority interests (and in this c ase there were two shareholders with one share eac h) involved if they are suc h that they c an for prac tic al purposes be disregarded. Another instanc e 

of non-disc losure c onc erned his c laim that Flat D, 18th Floor, Sung Fung Mansion, Harbour Heights, Fook Yim Street, North Point, Hong Kong was rented ac c ommodation. This c laim was not substantiated despite repeated c alls for AKC to produc e the tenanc y agreement but he c hose not to do so. 

41     As for AKC’s allegations that he was c urrently unemployed and living on borrowings, the judge had this to say: 

 [118] He gave a hollow ac c ount of what happened to the fortune he made from the sale of Cable Car business. He said that aside from his living expenses over the years, he had some business ventures that failed. He also c ited the 1998 ec onomic c risis to support his c laim that he had lost everything. 

 [120] The 1998 ec onomic c risis seemed to be a c onvenient exc use. When the Cable Car business was sold, the petitioner was barely in his mid-40s and until 1998, when the ec onomic c risis hit, he would have had some nine good years in Hong Kong. He had c hosen to remain based in Hong Kong all these years after the Cable Car business was sold, presumably bec ause there was business to be done. 

42     The judge did not believe AKC’s unsubstantiated assertion that “ _he had barely enough success to make ends meet and as time progressed, it got worse_ .” AKC’s attempt to raise identic al arguments before me, did little to advanc e his c ase. I agreed with the judge’s findings on AKC’s financ es at the time of the divorc e and her disbelief that AKC was living on c redit lines. The judge held: 

 [146] I observed that from 1998 when the petitioner said the marriage broke down irretrievably until the time he filed the divorc e petition in 2003, there was a good 5 years for the Petitioner to plan and arrange his financ ial affairs if divorc e had been on his c ards. The petitioner had been generally reluc tant in his disc losures, and when he did disc lose, they were selec tive disc losures that would bolster his c laims. The numerous c ash advanc es he obtained seemed to be selfserving and c ontrived to support his c laim that he was living on borrowed monies. The alleged loans from his family and friends were a c onvenient tool to explain away any sums that c ould be attributed to his means or disposal. There was a c ertain c alc ulated deliberateness in the amounts and the dates in whic h he supposedly obtained loans and he had not explained why he needed those partic ular amounts at those times. 

 ... 

 [153] I rejec ted the Petitioner’s c laim that he had used up all these sale proc eeds [rec eived for the two fac tories] for his living and other expenses as well. Looking at the bac kground of what 

 [note: 9] 


 had taken plac e at that time and quite aside from his failure to ac c ount satisfac torily for what he did with all the Cable Car sale proc eeds, I observed that just prior to the sale of the 1st fac tory unit in 1999, the Respondent had in 1998 remitted the Petitioner HK$1,150,000 as his share of the Greenville [sale] proc eeds. Additionally, he had kept HK$500,000 from the sale of the 2nd c ar park lot for himself. There were also the large unexplained withdrawals from his bank ac c ounts. 

 [154] In fac t looking at the totality of all the c apital sums he had rec eived from the sale of the MultiSec tor shares, the disposal of his assets and the remittanc es rec eived from HKJ and the sums run up against the Greenville overdraft, the Petitioner had sizeable monies at his disposal. The c apital sums alone would have earned him a reasonable return if they were left in passive investments. It was hardly c redible that he would have the need to eat into the c apital sums to fund his living expenses as he c laimed. 

43     AKC c hallenged the findings on the basis that he had produc ed all doc uments in his possession that were relevant to the present c ase. As with the above findings, I saw no basis to disagree with the findings in light of the analysis undertaken by the judge. It was said that the doc uments produc ed were selec tive and, in turn, the information disc losed was also selec tive. It is useful, for present purposes, to refer to the Statements of Ac c ounts purportedly for the sale of the two fac tory units in Unison Building, Hong Kong. The judge had examined the Statements of Ac c ounts and had found the information there misleading. In addition to the judge’s reasons, the Statement of 

Ac c ounts for the sale of the unit on the 13th Floor did not disc lose the purc hase pric e. It merely revealed the balanc e of the purc hase pric e payable. The Statement of Ac c ount for the sale of the 

unit on the 10th floor is more interesting for it disc losed an unusual feature of the sale in that HK$700,000 of the balanc e purc hase pric e was to be paid by instalments after c ompletion. This raised questions about the sale suc h as who was the buyer and whether it was a genuine arm’s length transac tion to an unrelated party. In addition, no details as to the number of instalments were given. AKC was no doubt an intelligent person and shrewd businessman who had in the anc illary hearing sought to perpetuate the impression that his financ ial c upboard was bare. If that was indeed the truth, he would have had no diffic ulty providing c omplete doc umentation, but the c onverse appeared to have oc c urred. 

44     As regards the c ontention that the judge failed to c onsider HKJ’s non-disc losure of some assets/profits derived from the sale of properties in her name, I dismissed it as wholly unmeritorious. In subsequent affidavits, HKJ made good her initial non-disc losures whic h were trac eable to the properties in her name as she had no separate independent sourc e of inc ome in c ontrast to AKC’s situation. 

45     The judge’s approac h of awarding a higher proportion of the existing assets to HKJ was not only in ac c ordanc e with princ iple and a proper exerc ise of disc retion it also served to ac hieve a just and equitable division of the assets. The fac t that AKC was resident in Hong Kong and his assets were situated outside Singapore also weighed on the judge’s mind in dec iding to award a higher proportion of the existing assets to HKJ. The judge observed at [179] of the written grounds (referred to in [31] above) that having friends and family there, “ _he could have easily parked his assets with them or arranged his financial affairs to avoid discovery._ ” She drew the c onc lusion that AKC did not want the c ourt to know his true financ ial position. In my view, there was suffic ient evidenc e before the judge whic h c learly entitled her to c ome to that c onc lusion. I heard nothing to persuade me to take a different view. Ms Siaw did not at the appeal show that the adverse inferenc es were unreasonable in that no judge fac ed with the evidenc e c ould have drawn the inferenc es or awarded the extra 20%. In short, AKC had not suc c eeded in demonstrating that the 20% uplift was unreasonable or unjustified.
