**Introduction** 

1       Summons No 76 of 2010 was an applic ation by the sec ond, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth defendant (the “relevant defendants”) under s 14 of the Supreme Court of Judic ature Ac t (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) and O 45 r 8 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) for the c ourt to direc t that any Assistant Registrar and/or the Registrar of the Supreme Court may sign the share transfer forms that give effec t to the c ompletion of the sale and purc hase of the plaintiff’s shares in the first defendant to the sec ond, third and/or the fourth defendant and/or their respec tive nominees. 

**Background** 

2       By c onsent of the parties, this c ourt earlier ordered on 27 April 2009 (the “Consent Order”) that t he sec ond, third and/or fourth defendant and/or their respec tive nominees purc hase the plaintiff’s shares in the first defendant at a fair value to be determined by an independent valuer, of whose valuation report setting out the fair value of the plaintiff’s share would be final and binding on all parties. The valuer was appointed on 27 May 2009. Whilst the original timeline for the issuanc e of the valuation report was 24 June 2009, it was finally issued on 8 Dec ember 2009. 

3       The Consent Order presc ribed that the c ompletion of the sale and purc hase of the plaintiff’ shares take plac e within three weeks after the valuation report is furnished, in this c ase, on 29 Dec ember 2009. However, this had not taken plac e even though the relevant defendants’ solic itors had on 11 Dec ember 2009 and 22 Dec ember 2009 written to the plaintiff’s solic itors to request c ompletion of the sale and purc hase and offered to tender a c ashier’s order as payment for the shares at the relevant defendants’ solic itors’ offic e. Due to the plaintiff’s previous solic itor being away and the subsequent c hange of solic itors, the plaintiff did not respond to the relevant defendants’ request for c ompletion direc tly and his new solic itors on 30 Dec ember 2009 requested for more time. 

4       Spec ific ally on 30 Dec ember 2009, the plaintiff’s newly appointed solic itors wrote to the relevant defendants’ solic itors requesting that the relevant defendants refrain from taking any ac tion 


against the plaintiff and that they would respond to the relevant defendants’ solic itors’ 22 Dec ember 2009 letter by the end of the following week. The relevant defendants agreed to give the plaintiff more time and a fresh request was sent to the plaintiff’s newly appointed solic itors by the relevant defendants’ solic itors for the c ompletion of the sale and purc hase of the shares by 5 January 2010. 

5       However, when 5 January 2010 arrived, the plaintiff’s solic itors requested, onc e again, for more time and the c ompletion of the sale and purc hase did not take plac e. The relevant defendants then made this applic ation to effec t c ompletion of the sale and purc hase of the shares ordered under the Consent Order. 

**The Arguments** 

6       The plaintiff’s c ounsel first raised what he c onsidered to be an obstac le to this applic ation. He submitted that a summons c annot be filed on Suit No 53 of 2008 as the applic ant was obliged to file a fresh originating summons or writ ac c ording to _Indian Overseas Bank v Motorcycle Industries_ ( _1973_ ) _Pte Ltd & Ors_ <span class="citation">[1992] 3 SLR(R) 841</span> (“ _IOB v Motorcycle Industries_ ”). Having read this c ase c losely, I did not think it had any direc t bearing to this applic ation to enforc e a c onsent judgment in ac c ordanc e with O 45 r 8 of the ROC and indic ated this to both c ounsel. _IOB v Motorcycle Industries_ supported the proposition that a Consent Order’s effec ts are to put an end to the proc eedings, prec lude the parties from taking further steps in the ac tion and to supersede the original c ause of ac tion altogether (at [12] and [13]). What is sought in this applic ation by summons is the performanc e of the Consent Order and not the original c ause of ac tion. I therefore find the plaintiff’s submission to be unmeritorious. 

7       The plaintiff’s solic itors informed the c ourt, that the plaintiff wished to c hallenge the valuation report and was thus anxious to resist this applic ation under O 45 r 8 of the ROC. They disc losed that they were ac tively engaged with experts to c ommenc e legal ac tion to c hallenge the valuation report. There is no obstac le to the plaintiff c hallenging the valuation report in a separate legal ac tion. The defendant’s c ounsel pointed out to the c ourt that no legal ac tion had been filed by the plaintiff to date. Plaintiff’s c ounsel then replied that that they would file their originating summons immediately, _ie_ , on 19 January 2010. In the light of this, I indic ated to c ounsel that I would c onsider both summonses together before finalizing my dec isions. However, it transpired the next day, on 20 January 2010, that the plaintiff’s applic ation to file the originating summons on 19 January 2010 was rejec ted by the Registrar and the subsequent originating summons filed was fixed to be heard on 23 February 2010. In light of this, I dec ided to issue my dec ision on the present summons granting an order in terms in favour of the relevant defendants. The plaintiff’s c ounsel applied for further arguments and I heard both c ounsel again on 26 February 2010. 

8       On 26 February 2010, the plaintiff’s c ounsel raised the argument for the first time that where an order for spec ific performanc e of a c ontrac t is sought, a separate applic ation for spec ific performanc e is required under O 45 r 8 of the ROC. Plaintiff’s c ounsel argued that the relevant defendants’ applic ation here was not available under O 45 r 8 of the ROC. Plaintiff’s c ounsel c ited _P J Holdings Inc v Ariel Singapore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2009] 3 SLR(R) 582</span> in support of his argument but when invited to explain whether there was any proposition of law in that c ase whic h assisted him, he was obliged to c onc ede that there were none. 

9       O 45 r 8 of the ROC reads: 

 If a Mandatory Order, an injunc tion or a judgment or order for the spec ific performanc e of a c ontrac t is not c omplied with, then without prejudic e to its power under sec tion 14 of the Supreme Court of Judic ature Ac t (Chapter 322), where applic able, and its power to punish the 


 (a) 

 (b) 

 disobedient party for c ontempt, the Court may direc t that the ac t required to be done may, so far as prac tic able, be done by the party by whom the order or judgment was obtained or some other person appointed by the Court, at the c ost of the disobedient party, and upon the ac t being done the expenses inc urred may be asc ertained in suc h manner as the Court may direc t and exec ution may issue against the disobedient party for the amount so asc ertained and for c osts. 

The plain reading of O 45 r 8 of the ROC, in partic ular, the disjunc tive “or” in the first line of the rule, whic h inc ludes “judgments” and presumably c onsent orders of c ourt, were pointed out to him as being c ontrary to his c onstruc tion. He had no response. When asked whether he was submitting that a Consent Order c an only be enforc ed under O 45 r 8 of the ROC by a further ac tion and another c ourt order and to provide any other authorities in support of this, he was obliged to c onc ede that he c ould find none. 

10     Seeing no merit in any of the arguments run by the plaintiff’s c ounsel and having formed a c onc lusion from the c hronology of events and nature of his submissions and replies, I c onc luded that t he plaintiff’s attempts to resist the applic ation pursuant to O 45 r 8 of the ROC was a strategy to buy time for his separate legal ac tions to c hallenge the valuation report. The plaintiff is at all times at liberty to file these ac tions and make appropriate applic ations. There were no substantive legal grounds for me not to grant the applic ation. 

11     For the foregoing reasons, I allowed the relevant defendants’ applic ation and granted order in terms their prayers 1 and 2, namely that: 

 any Assistant Registrar and/or Registrar of the Supreme Court may sign the share transfer forms to give effec t to the c ompletion of the sale and purc hase of the plaintiff’s shares in the first defendant as provided for under the terms of the Consent Order; and 

 the plaintiff file a c onsent to entry of satisfac tion within three days of c ompletion of the sale and purc hase of the plaintiff’s shares in the first defendant. 

12     Costs of this applic ation and this hearing of further arguments of S$2,000 exc lusive of disbursements awarded to the relevant defendants. The relevant defendants be at liberty to apply.
