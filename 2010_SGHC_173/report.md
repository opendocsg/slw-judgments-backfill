**Philip Pillai J:** 

**Introduction** 

1       The plaintiffs have filed this originating summons for an order that winding up petitions, CWU 168 of 2009 and CWU 169 of 2009, brought by the defendant against the first and sec ond plaintiffs respec tively be stayed or struc k out. 

2       On or about 26 Oc tober 2007, the first plaintiff c hartered a vessel from the defendant. Pursuant to a guarantee dated 12 Oc tober 2007, the sec ond plaintiff stood as the first plaintiff’s guarantor against the first plaintiff’s obligations to the defendant. On 12 August 2009, the defendant sent the plaintiffs statutory notic es of demand for a sum of US$3,986,157.16 as the outstanding sum owing as c harter hire under a c harter agreement. US$1,326,625.04 of this demand represented an arbitration award issued by the London Tribunal dated 18 Dec ember 2008 (then entitled “Interim” but whic h is now final in its effec t) (the “Award”). The first plaintiff has paid US$350,000 of the arbitration award debt under a settlement agreement that has expired and to date US$976,625. remains due and outstanding. When the plaintiffs failed to respond satisfac torily to the defendant after three weeks, the defendant proc eeded to file winding up petitions CWU 168 of 2009 and CWU 169 of 2009 pursuant to s 254(2)( _a_ ) read with s 254(1)( _e_ ) of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Ac t”). 

3       The plaintiffs aver that the winding up petitions are an abuse of proc ess bec ause there is a _bona fide_ dispute on substantial grounds. The grounds as submitted by the plaintiffs are as follows: 

 The Award is not enforc eable against the first plaintiff save by rec ognition or enforc ement under the International Arbitration Ac t (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”). The interim award would not have been rec ognised or enforc ed under the IAA bec ause it c ontravenes s 31(2) ( c ) of the IAA in that it was obtained in c irc umstanc es where the first plaintiff was denied an opportunity to and was thereby unable to present its c ase. I shall refer to these as the “IAA 


 (b) 

 (c ) 

 issue”. 

 The first plaintiff has a c ross-c laim equal to or exc eeding the debt allegedly due under the Award. I shall refer to this as the “Cross-c laim issue”. 

 The Award is unenforc eable against the sec ond plaintiff as it is against the first plaintiff and in any c ase the guarantor is not bound by the Award. I shall refer to the last as the “Guarantor’s Liability issue”. 

**Threshold Issue** 

4       A winding up petition is not the appropriate means of c ollec ting a disputed debt nor is it to be abused as a means of pressure. The issue before me is whether there is a _bona fide_ and substantial dispute of the alleged debt on any of the grounds raised by the plaintiffs. This is the threshold whic h the plaintiffs must meet in support of their applic ation to stay or strike out the winding up petitions. 

**Whether there is a** **_bona fide_** **and substantial dispute over the debt** 

5       In _BNP Paribas v Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 949</span> at [15], the Court of Appeal held that the “general rule is that, where a c ompany is unable or deemed to be unable to pay its debts, the c reditor is _prima facie_ entitled to a winding-up order _e x debito justitiae_ ”. However, the c ourt nonetheless retains the disc retion not to grant a winding up order in exc eptional c ases. One instanc e when a c ourt may refuse to grant a winding up order, but may instead stay or strike out the winding up petition, is where the debtor-c ompany establishes that there is a _bona fide_ dispute of the statutory debt. To obtain the stay or striking out, the debtor c ompany must show that the dispute is _bona fide_ in both a subjec tive and objec tive sense. _Palmer’s Company Law_ vol 3 at pp 15068-15069, as quoted approvingly in _LKM Investment Holdings Pte Ltd v Cathay Theatres Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2000] 1 SLR(R) 135</span> at [20], eluc idates: 

 ... the dispute must be bona fide in both a subjec tive and an objec tive sense. Thus the reason for not paying the debt must be honestly believed to exist and must be based on substantial or reasonable grounds. 'Substantial' means having substanc e and not frivolous, whic h disputes the c ourt should ignore. There must be so muc h doubt and question about the liability to pay the debt that the c ourt sees that there is a question to be dec ided. The onus is on the c ompany 'to bring forward a prima fac ie c ase whic h satisfies the c ourt that there is something whic h ought to be tried either before the c ourt itself or in an ac tion, or by some other proc eedings.' 

Nonetheless, the debtor-c ompany does not need to show that the debt does not exist – it merely needs to raise a triable issue. In _Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2008] 2 SLR(R) 491</span> at [23], the Court of Appeal held that the applic able standard for determining the existenc e of a substantial and _bona fide_ dispute was “no more than that for resisting a summary judgment applic ation”. 

6       With the applic able princ iples in mind, I now turn to examining the IAA issue, the Cross-c laim issue and the Guarantor’s Liability issue respec tively. 

**_The IAA issue_** 


 (a) 

 (b) 

7       The plaintiffs dispute the debt that is founded on the interim arbitration award as being improperly obtained by reason of the alleged failure to observe the rules of natural justic e. The defendant, in response, points out that the regularity of the award had been unc hallenged at the arbitration and at the c ourts of the seat of the arbitration. The defendant c ited the following authorities: 

 Minmetals Germany GmbH v Ferco Steel Ltd [1999] CLC 647 at 661where it was stated that: 

 In international c ommerc e a party who c ontrac ts into an agreement to arbitrate in a foreign jurisdic tion is bound not only by the loc al arbitration proc edure but also by the supervisory jurisdic tion of the c ourts of the seat of the arbitration. If the award is defec tive or the arbitration is defec tively c onduc ted the party who c omplains of the defec t must in the first instanc e pursue suc h remedies as exist under that supervisory jurisdic tion. That is bec ause by his agreement to the plac e in question as the seat of the arbitration he has agreed not only to refer all disputes to arbitration but that the c onduc t of the arbitration should be subjec t to that partic ular supervisory jurisdic tion. Adherenc e to that part of the agreement must, in my judgment, be a c ardinal polic y c onsideration by an English c ourt c onsidering enforc ement of a foreign award. 

 Aloe Vera of America, Inc v Asianic Food (S) Pte Ltd and another <span class="citation">[2006] 3 SLR(R) 174</span> where it was stated at [56]: 

 ... a party may be prec luded by his failure to raise a point before the c ourt of supervisory jurisdic tion from raising that point before the c ourt of enforc ement. This is bec ause failure to raise suc h a point may amount to an estoppel or a want of bona fides suc h as to justify the c ourt of enforc ement in enforc ing an award. 

 and further at [76]: 

 There was nothing thereafter to stop him from c hallenging the Arbitrator’s preliminary holding in the c ourts of Arizona or from taking part in the arbitration itself or from c hallenging the Arbitrator’s final holding in the c ourts of Arizona. Having c hosen not to partic ipate in the proc eedings, it really does not lie in Mr Chiew’s mouth to say that he has been deprived of na t ura l justic e bec ause the Arbitrator made one finding in his interim award and supplemented that with an additional finding in the final award. Mr Chiew had the benefit of legal advic e in Arizona at all material times and his dec ision not to have rec ourse to the supervisory c ourt was a c alc ulated one. If his c hoic e has proved to be a misc alc ulation, p u b lic polic y does not require that I relieve him from the c onsequenc es of suc h misc alc ulation. 

8       The law set out in the above c ases is unc ontroversial. However, the above c ases deal with the position of a c hallenge of the arbitration awards made before the enforc ement c ourt, where the relevant awards are alleged to be defec tive but had been unc hallenged at the arbitration or at the c ourts in the seat of arbitration. They do not address the issue that is before me here, whic h is not a proc eeding for the enforc ement of an arbitration award under the IAA, but a winding up applic ation. The defendant in this c ase, has issued a statutory demand of a debt under s 254(2)( _a_ ) read with s 254(1)( _e_ ) of the Companies Ac t, the debt having arisen by reason of a final international arbitration 


award. While the plaintiffs alleged that this Award is defec tive, it was unc hallenged in the arbitration forum and before the c ourts of the seat of arbitration. The Award therefore remains effec tive on the fac e of it. 

9       The real question before me is whether the defendant is prec luded from issuing a statutory demand under s 254(2)( _a_ ) read with s 254(1)( _e_ ) of the Companies Ac t based on a debt that is founded on an arbitration award bec ause suc h an award c an only and exc lusively be enforc ed under the IAA. 

10     The plaintiffs assert that the defendant is obliged to enforc e the Award under s 27(2) of the IAA. They argue that had the defendant sought to enforc e its arbitration award in Singapore under the IAA, this would have been resisted pursuant to s 31(2)( _c_ ) of the IAA on the ground that the rules of natural justic e were not adhered to in obtaining that award (see _Kanoria v Guinness_ [2006] EWCA Civ 222). In any c ase, to permit the defendant to rely on its statutory demand debt founded on the Award whic h was not enforc ed under the IAA, would be, they argue, in effec t enforc ing the interim award under s 27(2) of the IAA. As suc h the enforc ement remains susc eptible to the c hallenge of alleged breac h of natural justic e whic h would be available under s 31(2)( _c_ ) of the IAA and there therefore exists a _prima facie bona fide_ dispute of the debt on substantial grounds. The plaintiffs further attac k the validity of the interim award on the ground that the tribunal issued the award on a basis whic h had not been raised or c ontemplated by the parties (see _Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another_ <span class="citation">[2008] 2 SLR(R) 491</span> at [30]). Against this, the defendant argues that it is free to elec t either to enforc e the Award in Singapore under the IAA or to use the debt arising therefrom as the foundation of its statutory demand for the purposes of a winding up petition. 

11     Sec tion 27(2) of the IAA reads: 

 In this Part, where the c ontext so admits, “enforc ement” in relation to a foreign award, inc ludes the rec ognition of the award as binding for any purpose, and “enforc e” and “enforc ed” have c orresponding meanings. 

I am unable to ac c ept the plaintiffs’ argument that the defendant must enforc e the Award under this provision of the IAA before it c an bring the winding up proc eedings against the plaintiffs. No authority is c ited to me for the proposition that a suc c essful party of a foreign arbitration award is obliged and c onfined to enforc e the award only by way of enforc ement proc eedings under the IAA and is thereby prec luded from issuing a statutory demand based on a foreign arbitration award followed, if unsatisfied, by a winding up applic ation on grounds of a presumption of insolvenc y. 

12     Furthermore, the IAA was by the terms of its Preamble, enac ted to make provision for the c onduc t of international c ommerc ial arbitrations based on the UNCITRAL Model Law and to give effec t to the New York Convention on the Rec ognition and Enforc ement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (“New York Convention”). Part III of the IAA governs foreign awards under the New York Convention of 

1958\. Sec tion 29( _a_ ) whic h is in Part III of the IAA, provides that a foreign award may be enforc ed in a c ourt either under s 19, by ac tion or in the same manner as a judgment or order, with leave of the c ourt. Signific antly, s 33 whic h is also within Part III of the statute, provides that nothing in that Part shall affec t the right of any person to enforc e an arbitral award otherwise than as is provided for in this Part. In other words, the IAA provides a platform whic h a party may have an award in its favour rec ognised and enforc ed, but it is not the only means by whic h a party may seek to utilise the award it has obtained. Quite apart from the summary registration proc ess available under the IAA, a foreign arbitration award may be enforc ed and rec ognised at c ommon law (see Rule 59 and 60 of _Dicey, Morris & Collins, The Conflict of Laws_ , Vol 1 (Sweet & Maxwell, 14th edition 2006) at p 751-762). 


13     In any event, with respec t to the alleged breac h of natural justic e, I note the approac h of the c ourts to be c irc umspec t in upholding the integrity of the arbitration proc ess. In _Soh Beng Tee & Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 86</span>, V K Rajah JA opined at [65(f)]: 

 Eac h c ase should be dec ided within its own fac tual matrix. It must always be borne in mind that it is not the func tion of the c ourt to assiduously c omb an arbitral award mic rosc opic ally in attempting to determine if there was any blame or fault in the arbitral proc ess; rather, an award should be read generously suc h that only meaningful breac hes of the rules of natural justic e that have ac tually c aused prejudic e are ultimately remedied. 

Robert Merkin, in Singapore Arbitration Legislation Annotated (Informa, 2009) at p 76 observes: 

 ... something far removed from what is required of the arbitral proc ess is required and bec ause the losing party will normally have a right to seek to have the award overturned by the c ourts of the jurisdic tion in whic h the award was given, and if the losing party has sought but failed to obtain relief from the c urial c ourts, or has unreasonably not invoked the jurisdic tion of the c urial c ourts, the award will generally be enforc ed by the c ourts. A party c an either apply for the setting aside of the award to the c ourts of the c ountry where the award was made, or oppose enforc ement in the c ourts of the c ountry of enforc ement; a dec ision made by the c ourt of the c ountry of the award is binding, so that the options are in prac tic al terms alternative not c umulative; ... 

14     It is not disputed that the Award in favour of the defendant for the sum of US$ 1,326,625. with interest and c osts, is final and binding under the relevant arbitration rules and was not c hallenged before the c ourts of the seat of the arbitration. Neither is it disputed that the remaining arbitration proc eedings that c ontinue relate to other hire statements between the parties, whic h do not affec t the Award on whic h the statutory demand is founded. Quite apart from the c irc umstanc es surrounding the tribunal’s issue of the Award, that the first plaintiff had taken no further available ac tion in the arbitration and in the seat of arbitration and c ontinued to partic ipate before the same tribunal in other c laims, c onfirms my c onc lusion that there are not existent, substantial grounds establishing a _bona fide_ dispute relating to the debt on this point. 

15     With regard to the plaintiffs’ attac k on the validity of the interim award on the ground that the tribunal issued the interim award on a basis that had not been raised or c ontemplated by the parties, I would observe that suc h objec tions ought also to have been raised in the arbitration. The winding up proc eeding, whic h is separate from enforc ement proc eedings (see _Re International Tin Council_ [1987] Ch 419 (“ _International Tin Council_ ”)), is not a proper arena for ventilating suc h objec tions espec ially when these objec tions have not been raised before the arbitration tribunal. 

16     The plaintiffs also submit that the issue as to the enforc eability of the Award is c omplex and would, in all likelihood, involve many legal and fac tual arguments and should not be determined by a c ourt exerc ising its winding up jurisdic tion. In _International Tin Council_ , Millet J addressed the question, in another c ontext, whether a petition for the winding up of International Tin Counc il on the ground that it was insolvent and presented by a c reditor with the benefit of an arbitration award in its favour, was a proc eeding in respec t of the enforc ement of an arbitration award. To that, he observed at 455–456 as follows: 

 I am not satisfied that, in this c ontext, the presentation and hearing of a winding up petition, as distinc t from the proof of debt in the winding up, are properly to be c lassified as falling within the enforc ement jurisdic tion at all. It is fallac ious to suppose that, bec ause the petitioner is not seeking to establish his debt, the c ourt is exerc ising its enforc ement jurisdic tion. Even if the petitioner has previously resorted to litigation to establish his debt, the presentation of a petition 


 marks the c ommenc ement of an entirely new lis. The issue at the hearing is not whether the petitioning and other c reditors, some of whom will not yet have established their c laims, should be paid, but whether the c ompany is insolvent and, if so, whether it should be wound up or allowed to try to trade out of its diffic ulties. There is muc h to be said for the view that, in dec iding whether or not the c ompany should be wound up, the c ourt is engaged in a new proc ess of adjudic ation, separate and different from any that may previously have been involved in establishing the petitioning c reditor’s debt. 

 But it is not nec essary to dec ide this, for in my judgment the winding up proc ess is plainly not a method of enforc ing a judgment or arbitration award. ... Far from enabling any judgment or award to be enforc ed, the making of a winding up order prevents it. ... Whether the petition is presented by a c reditor or by the debtor, its purpose is to obtain an order whic h will prec lude the c reditors from enforc ing any judgments or awards whic h they may have obtained, and substitute the right to partic ipate in a pari passu distribution out of an insuffic ient fund in full satisfac tion of their c laims. That is not the enforc ement of their judgments or awards, but the opposite. 

17     The _International Tin Council_ c ase squarely addresses this issue and c onc ludes that the winding up applic ation is not regarded as an enforc ement of arbitration awards. I am not required to c onsider enforc eability issues in these proc eedings. There is further tangentially the same broad approac h reflec ted in relation to s 11 of the Rec iproc al Enforc ement of Foreign Judgments Ac t (Cap 265, 2001 Rev Ed), whic h gives general effec t to registered foreign judgments. Sec tion 7 of this statute expressly c onfines the enforc ement of sums payable under registrable foreign judgments to being enforc ed by registration and to no other Singapore c ourt proc eedings. In Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore, Vol 2 (Butterworths Asia, 1998), at para 20.152, it is stated: 

 Foreign judgments whic h are not registered for enforc ement or are not registrable for enforc ement may however be ‘rec ognised’ (as opposed to being enforc ed by way of exec ution) as c onc lusive of findings of fac t and law in proc eedings whic h may be c ommenc ed in the Singapore c ourts based on the original c ause of ac tion or related proc eedings. 

18     In the premises there is, in my view, no obstac le to a statutory demand being made for the purposes of s 254(2)( _a_ ) read with s 254(1)( _e_ ) of the Companies Ac t, whic h is founded on a binding arbitration award whether or not suc h arbitration award has been otherwise enforc ed by registration under the International Arbitration Ac t. I find also that the submission that there is c ontinuing arbitration between the parties relating to other c laims whic h have no direc t bearing on this partic ular interim award not to c onstitute a _bona fide_ dispute on substantial grounds of this debt c onstituted by the binding arbitration award. 

19     At this junc ture, I would add that it should be noted that the statutory demand is quite distinc t from enforc ing the award. All it establishes is that the unsatisfied demand results in a presumption of insolvenc y being a ground for winding up. Upon an order for winding up being made, the liquidator would be responsible for the orderly determination and disc harge of the c ompany’s liabilities against is assets. The liquidator remains at liberty to dispute any proof of debt by the defendant based on the arbitration award. Should a liquidator dispute suc h debt, notwithstanding the obstac les set out in [13], the defendant may then be obliged to either register or enforc e the award under the IAA. In suc h event, it is not inc onc eivable that a registration or enforc ement c ourt may refuse registration under s 31(2)( _c_ ) of the IAA. Would suc h a possibility, however remote, give pause for thought about suc h an award being the basis of a statutory demand presumption of insolvenc y? I think not bec ause the primary c onsiderations arising in the c ontext of insolvenc y relate to the protec tion of all c reditors and not the debtor whose unsatisfied c laim whic h a later c ourt may dec ide to be unenforc eable. 

**_The Cross-claim issue_** 


**_The Cross-claim issue_** 

20     The next question is whether I should stay the winding up applic ation by reason that the first plaintiff’s c ross-c laim under the remaining arbitration proc eedings may exc eed the debt. In addition to the c ross-c laim in the arbitration proc eedings, as indic ated in the affidavit of Huang Yingjun, a direc tor of the first plaintiff, dated 11 Dec ember 2009, the defendant had also arrested the plaintiffs’ assoc iated vessel in South Afric a. While the plaintiffs are c urrently c ontesting the arrest, in the event that they fail and arrest not be lifted and the vessel sold, it is submitted that the sale proc eeds will exc eed the sum payable to the defendant under the statutory demand. 

21     There is, in princ iple no distinc tion between a c ross-c laim of substanc e and a serious dispute regarding the indebtedness imputed against a c ompany, whic h has long been held to c onstitute a proper ground upon whic h to rejec t a winding-up petition (see _Malayan Plant (Pte) Ltd v Moscow Narodny Bank Ltd_ [1979 – 1980] SLR(R) 511 at [18]). A debtor-c ompany may rely on a c ross-c laim against its c reditor to seek a striking out or stay of winding up proc eeding, although it has to satisfy the c ourt that on the evidenc e there is a distinc t possibility that the c ross-c laim may exc eed the undisputed debt (see _Metalform Asia Pte Ltd v Holland Leedon Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 268</span> (“ _Metalform_ ”) at [82]). In _Re L_. _H_. _F_. _Wools Ltd_ [1970] 1 Ch 27, a c reditor petitioned for the winding up of a debtor-c ompany whose sole asset was a c ross-c laim against the c reditor. The debtor-c ompany sought an adjournment or dismissal of the petition on the basis of the c ross-c laim. The Court of Appeal held that when a debtor-c ompany had a genuine and serious c ross-c laim against the petitioning c reditor whic h it had not reasonably been able to litigate, the petition should be usually dismissed or stayed. The Court of Appeal stayed the winding up petition pending the trial of the c ross-c laim on the basis that (a) there was a genuine and serious c ross-c laim against the petitioner, (b) the debtor-c ompany’s direc tors would be better able than a liquidator to prosec ute its c laim against the petitioner and (c ) the delay in winding up would not in any event prejudic e the petitioner as the debtor-c ompany had no assets save for the c laim. 

22     The dec ision whether or not to stay or dismiss a winding up petition on the basis of the existenc e of a c ross-c laim against the petitioning c reditor involves two c ompeting c onc erns. The first is artic ulated i n _Paganelli Sdn Bhd v Care-Me Direct Sales Sdn Bhd_ [1999] 2 MLJ 464 where the Malaysian High Court c onsidered the implic ations of a stay against a winding up petition: 

 ... the respondent should not have to suffer a petition of winding up a day longer than nec essary and neither should they have reimposed upon them the unc ertainty and hardship whic h a reinstatement of the winding-up petition will bring. 

The sec ond is eluc idated in _Metalform_ at [82]: 

 ... the c ommerc ial viability of a c ompany should not be put in jeopardy by the premature presentation of a winding-up petition against it where it has a serious c ross-c laim based on substantial grounds. Suc h a petition may adversely affec t the reputation and the business of the c ompany and may also set in motion a proc ess that may c reate c ross-defaults or c ut the c ompany off from further sourc es of financ ing, thereby exac erbating its financ ial c ondition. ... Businesses that have a c hanc e of rec overy should not be pushed into a state that makes it diffic ult for them to rec over. 

23     If the first plaintiff has a genuine and serious c ross-c laim against the defendant, the _locus standi_ of the defendant to present a winding-up petition against the plaintiffs would be c alled into question and a stay or striking out of the winding-up petition would be justified by the c onc ern that the c ommerc ial viability of the plaintiffs ought not to be put in jeopardy by the premature presentation of the petition. 


24     The first plaintiff asserts that it has a c ross-c laim against the defendant, whic h arises from an implied term of the c harterparty that the vessel be c ommerc ially ac c eptable or marketable in the market for sub-c harters. The alternative basis for its c laim is that there was a c ollateral c ontrac t that the vessel be c ommerc ially ac c eptable or marketable in the market for sub-c harters. The breac h of this term, it is averred, is a repudiatory breac h whic h entitles the first plaintiff to terminate the c harterparty and seek damages whic h would exc eed or be equivalent to the defendant’s arbitration c laim. 

25     The defendant, on the other hand, points out that the first plaintiff has not filed any c ounterc laim against the defendant in the ongoing London arbitration and ac c ordingly whatever the outc ome of the arbitration, it would have no bearing on the debt c omprised in the award. 

26     I find little merit in the plaintiffs’ c ase for a c ross-c laim as quite apart from it not having been hitherto raised in the arbitration proc eedings there is further absent in these proc eedings, any substantiated quantific ation of the c ross-c laim as would reveal that it is likely to approximate or exc eed the statutory demand debt. I am not satisfied that the plaintiffs have made their c ase that the statutory demand debt has not been properly established and/or that there is a _bona fide_ dispute of the debt on substantial grounds. The presumption of insolvenc y under s 254(2)( _a_ ) of the Companies Ac t operates so long as the debtor does not pay a sum whic h is not in dispute and that sum exc eeds the minimum presc ribed therein (see _Re Makin Nominees Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1994] 2 SLR(R) 848</span>). 

**_Guarantor’s Liability issue_** 

27     The sec ond plaintiff first relied on the first plaintiff’s submission that there is a _bona fide_ dispute as to the debt whic h arises from the allegedly defec tive award. I have addressed this above in [7] – [18] and find no merit in this submission. The sec ond plaintiff next relied also on the first plaintiff’s disputes relating to the debt whic h I have found unmeritorious. 

28     The sec ond plaintiff independently disputes the debt founded on its guarantee, on the ground that it is was not a party to the arbitration. The sec ond plaintiff c ites _PT Jaya Sumpiles Indonesia and another v Kristle Trading Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">[2009] 3 SLR(R) 689</span> for the proposition that an award against a princ ipal debtor is not binding on a guarantor in an ac tion by the c reditor against the guarantor based on the award. The guarantor not being a party to the arbitration _qua_ guarantor, that princ iple is c lear. The dec ision, however, goes muc h further to elaborate at [42]: 

 Instead, should the c reditor sue the guarantor, it must prove the guarantor’s liability in the same way as it must prove the princ ipal debtor’s liability if it were to bring an ac tion against the princ ipal debtor. 

29     Under its guarantee dated 12 Oc tober 2007, it unc onditionally guaranteed the defendant in the following terms: 

 ... due, full and c omplete performanc e in every respec t by the said c harterers of all terms and c onditions of the c harterparty inc luding payment of any amounts due by the Charterers whether by way of hire, freight, damages or otherwise. [emphasis added] 

30     It is not disputed here that the defendant has issued a letter of demand on the guarantor. Onc e the first plaintiff’s debt to the defendant remains outstanding this unpaid debt bec omes the basis of the guarantor’s liability under the terms of the guarantee. A statutory demand against the sec ond plaintiff in these c irc umstanc es is not enforc ing an arbitration award against a third party
