**Introduction** 

1       Sports Connec tion Pte Ltd (“the Applic ant”) applied by Originating Summons (“OS”) to tax various invoic es raised by two law firms, in respec t of professional fees for their c onduc t of Suit No 630 of 1999 (“the Suit”). The two law firms are Asia Law Corporation (“the first Respondent”) and Samuel Seow Law Corporation (“the sec ond Respondent”). 

2       All the invoic es relate to work done for the Applic ant in c onnec tion with the Suit. The invoic es rendered by the first Respondent were c overed by the following four proforma invoic es: 

3       In respec t of work done by the sec ond Respondent, the fees c harged were c overed by the following invoic es: 


## 4 21.8.08 $3,508. 

## 5 22.9.08 $3,317. 

## 6 16.1.09 $28,884. 

## 7 16.1.09 $135,715. 

## 8 05.2.09 $2,141. 

4       As a number of the above invoic es have been paid and/or were delivered more than 12 months prior to the OS, an order for taxation c an only be justified if “spec ial c irc umstanc es” c an be shown to exist. In this c ontext, in dec iding whether to order taxation of suc h invoic es, I was mindful to strike a balanc e “between the need, on the one hand, to protec t the c lient and... on the other hand, to protec t the solic itor against late ambush being laid on a tec hnic al point by a c lient who seeks only to evade paying his debt.” ‒ per Ward LJ in _Ralph Hume Garry (a firm) v Gwillim_ [2003] 1 WLR 510 at [32(4)] (“ _Ralph Hume Garry”)_ , whic h was c ited with approval in _Ho Cheng Lay v Low Yong Sen_ <span class="citation">[2009] 3 SLR(R) 206</span> at [16]. 

**Conduct of Suit No 630 of 1999** 

5       In April 1999, the Applic ant c ommenc ed the Suit against its former solic itors, M/s Swami & Narayan, for failing to properly register a trademark in Malaysia. The original solic itors instruc ted by the Applic ant to c ommenc e the Suit were M/s Harry Elias & Partners. Subsequently, c onduc t of the Suit was taken over by M/s Netto & Magin LLC. The Suit was then stayed pending determination of the litigation against the parties who had infringed the Applic ant’s trademark in Malaysia. In January 2005, the Applic ant suc c eeded in its various ac tions in Malaysia. Thereafter the Applic ant restored the Suit and subsequently obtained interloc utory judgement against M/s Swami & Narayan by c onsent on or about 26 August 2005. 

6       In August 2006, the c onduc t of the Suit was yet again transferred, this time to the first Respondent. The solic itor who had c onduc t of the Suit was one Anis Shahiran B Md Ibrahim (“Mr Shahiran”) 

7       In January 2008, Mr Shahiran left the first Respondent and joined the sec ond Respondent. The Applic ant then transferred the c onduc t of the Suit to the sec ond Respondent, and Mr Shahiran c ontinued to have c harge of the matter. 

8       In January 2009, Mr Shahiran left the sec ond Respondent and rejoined the first Respondent. The Applic ant then transferred the c onduc t of the Suit bac k to the first Respondent, and Mr Shahiran c ontinued to be the lawyer in c harge. It was c lear that the Applic ant followed Mr Shahiran to whic hever firm he joined sinc e he remained in c ontinuous c onduc t of the Suit from August 2006 until 12 August 2009 when the Applic ant transferred the c onduc t of the Suit to M/s Legis Point LLC. By the time Legis Point LLC took over, the proc eedings were c ompleted with the Applic ant rec overing only a frac tion of the amount it had originally c laimed in the assessment hearing. The present OS was filed by Legis Point LLC. 

**The Decision** 

9       I heard the OS over two days on 29 Dec ember 2009 and 29 Marc h 2010. On 1 April 2010, I delivered my brief oral grounds and made the following orders: 


 (a) The first Respondent to deliver a bill of c osts for taxation c overing work done under the fourth proforma invoic e. 

 (b) The sec ond Respondent to deliver a bill of c osts for taxation c overing work done under the seventh and eighth invoic es. 

 (c ) That there be no order of taxation for the bill of c osts c overing work done under the first three proforma invoic es of the first Respondent and the first six invoic es of the sec ond Respondent. 

 (d) Costs of this OS to be paid by the Applic ant to the first and sec ond Respondents fixed at $150 eac h inc lusive of disbursements. 

10     The Applic ant being dissatisfied with my orders has sinc e filed an appeal against my dec ision. I now provide the grounds for my dec ision. 

**The Issues** 

11     Before me, the Respondents made the following submissions to oppose the OS: 

 (a) There was a written agreement on c osts between the Applic ant and the first and sec ond Respondents respec tively. 

 (b) More than one year had elapsed sinc e delivery of some of the invoic es to the Applic ant, and furthermore, some of them had already been paid by the Applic ant. 

 (c ) The Applic ant was estopped from applying for taxation of the invoic es bec ause it had negotiated for payment by instalment and had paid most of the invoic es. 

**_Were there any written agreements on costs between the Applicant and the first and second Respondents_** 

12     Sec tion 111 of the Legal Profession Ac t (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“LPA”) provides as follows: 

 Agreement as to costs for contentious business 

**111. —(1** ) Subjec t to the provisions of any other written law, a solic itor or a law c orporation or a limited liability law partnership may make an agreement in writing with any c lient respec ting the amount and manner of payment for the whole or any part of its c osts in respec t of c ontentious business done or to be done by the solic itor or the law c orporation or the limited liability law partnership, either by a gross sum or otherwise, and at either the same rate as or a greater or a lesser rate than that at whic h he or the law c orporation or the limited liability law partnership would otherwise be entitled to be remunerated. 

 (2) Every suc h agreement shall be signed by the c lient and shall be subjec t to the provisions and c onditions c ontained in this Part. 

13     Under s 111 of the LPA, a solic itor is entitled to enter into an agreement on c osts with the c lient at a higher rate than what he would normally c harge, _ie_ at a premium. The enforc eability of suc h agreements on c osts is governed by s 113(3) of the LPA whic h provides that an agreement on c osts may be enforc ed “if it appears to the c ourt or Judge that the agreement is in all respec ts fair 


 (a) 

 (b) 

 (c ) 

 (d) 

and reasonable”. Agreements on c osts are therefore not subjec t to taxation if they are “fair and reasonable”. This is a different threshold for taxation of fees that are billed in the absenc e of an agreement on c osts. 

14     The sec ond Respondent relied on two doc uments as evidenc e of a written agreement on c osts. The first is a doc ument titled “Repayment Agreement” dated on 10 February 2009 where Yee Kok Che w (“Mr Yee”), a direc tor of the Applic ant, was required to ac knowledge _personal_ liability for arrears of fees in the sum of $309,688.60 payable to the sec ond Respondent. This agreement was not signed bec ause the liability for the invoic es was the Applic ant’s and not Mr Yee’s. It was then redrafted for Mr Yee to ac knowledge on behalf of the Applic ant but it was not signed either. 

15     In my view, the sec ond Respondent’s submission that there existed a written agreement on c osts was a non-starter sinc e neither of the two repayment agreements was ac tually signed by the Applic ant as required under s 111 of the LPA. The fac t that the repayment agreements were prepared and sent to the Applic ant for signature c oupled with the Applic ant’s refusal to sign the draft repayment agreements would in itself suggest the absenc e of an agreement on c osts. 

16     Separately, the first Respondent’s c laim that an agreement on c osts existed between the parties was, as admitted in its affidavit, based on an agreement that is “partly oral, partly by c onduc t, and partly in writing”. The c laim was premised on a letter from the first Respondent to the Applic ant dated 3 August 2006 whic h c ontained an estimate of the legal c osts and disbursements. The first Respondent argued that in ac c ordanc e with this letter: 

 the first Respondent had sent invoic es to the Applic ant detailing the work done; 

 the Applic ant had negotiated with the first Respondent to pay the invoic es in instalments; 

 the Applic ant had c ontinued paying the invoic es over a period of two and a half years without any c omplaints; 

 the above therefore evidenc ed an agreement between the parties on c osts. 

17     However, even taking the first Respondent’s c ase at its highest that there was an agreement (eit her orally or by c onduc t) between the parties on c osts, it nonetheless did not satisfy the requirements under s 111 of the LPA. Sec tion 111 of the LPA requires a written agreement on c osts that is signed by the c lient before taxation of the bill of c osts c an be exc luded. Any failure or omission by the law firm in satisfying these mandatory requirements would prec lude it from enforc ing the agreement on c osts. 

18     In the present c ase, the letter doc umenting the first Respondent’s estimate of fees was admittedly not signed by the Applic ant. Even if the Applic ant had by its c onduc t agreed to the est imat e provided by the first Respondent, this does not c hange the fac t that the formal requirements of s 111 of the LPA have not been satisfied. 

19     In _Chamberlain v Boodle & King_ [1982] 1 WLR 1443 (“ _Chamberlain_ ”), the English Court of Appeal held that an agreement c ould only amount to a c ontentious business agreement under s 59 of the 


Solic itors Ac t 1974 (Cap 47) (UK) (whic h is in _pari materia_ with s 111 of the Legal Profession Ac t) if it was spec ific in terms and signed by the c lient. In that c ase, the defendants had proposed to the plaintiff an hourly rate of £60 to £80 for lawyers of partner status and £30 to £45 per hour for assoc iat es. Lord Denning MR held that this proposal was not spec ific enough to qualify as a c ontentious business agreement. He stated at 1445: 

 It seems to me that an agreement in writing c an be c ontained in letters. But the letters ought at least to be signed by the client if he is to be deprived by the agreement of his right to tax. Further the agreement must be sufficiently specific, so as to tell the client what he is letting himself in by way of costs. It seems to me that the letters in this c ase do not give the c lient the least idea of what he is letting himself in for. As c ounsel for Mr Chamberlain said to us, there is a broad band of many unc ertainties. Take, for instanc e, the rate. It c ertainly seems high enough to me. It is 60 to 80 an hour. What rate is to be c harged? And for what partner? Of what standard? Then 30 to 45 an hour for assoc iates who may be involved. Whic h legal exec utives? Of what standard? Whic h assoc iates? Does it inc lude the typists? That is one of the broad bands whic h is left c ompletely unc ertain by this agreement. Then there is the hourly rate. That must depend on the skill and expertise of the individual partner or assoc iate. A skilled partner c an do the work in half the time of a slow partner. Is the c lient to be c harged double the rate bec ause a slow partner has been put on the c ase? These rates per hour are over a pound a minute. It would seem that there must be a very good system of timing, almost by stopwatc h, if that is to be the rate of payment. 

 [emphasis added] 

20     The above passage in _Chamberlain_ was c ited with approval by Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) in _Shamsudin bin Embun v PT Seah & Co_ [1985–1986] SLR(R) 1108, at [20]. 

21     As there was no agreement in writing between the Applic ant and the first and/or sec ond Respondent in respec t of fees for the c onduc t of the Suit within the meaning of s 111 the LPA, I found that the Applic ant was not prec luded from obtaining an order for taxation on this ground. 

**_Special circumstances justifying taxation after the 12-month period_** 

22     In the absenc e of any written agreement on c osts within s 111 of the LPA, the issue of whether an order for taxation should be made would be governed by s 120(1) and s 122 of the LPA, whic h read as follows: 

 Order for taxation of delivered bill of costs 

**120. —(1** ) An order for the taxation of a bill of c osts delivered by any solic itor may be obtained on an applic ation made by originating summons or, where there is a pending ac tion, by summons by the party c hargeable therewith, or by any person liable to pay the bill either to the party c hargeable or to the solic itor, at any time within 12 months from the delivery of the bill, or, by the solic itor, after the expiry of one c alendar month and within 12 months from the delivery of the bill. 

 Time limit for taxation of bills of cost 

 122. After the expiration of 12 months from the delivery of a bill of c osts, or after payment of the bill, no order shall be made for taxation of a solic itor’s bill of c osts, exc ept upon notic e to the solic itor and under spec ial c irc umstanc es to be proved to the satisfac tion of the c ourt. 


23     Under s 120(1) of the LPA, an order for taxation may be obtained on an applic ation made by Originating Summons at any time within 12 months from the date of the delivery of the bill. Sec tion 122 of the LPA c reates a partial bar on an applic ant’s entitlement to obtain taxation in two c irc umstanc es, namely, after the expiration of 12 months from the delivery of a bill of c osts, or after payment of the bill. If any of these two c irc umstanc es exist, an order of taxation will only be made if the applic ant is able to prove the existenc e of spec ial c irc umstanc es to the satisfac tion of the c ourt. 

24     The Applic ant filed the OS for an order for taxation on 17 September 2009. Ac c ordingly, out of the four invoic es raised by first Respondent, the first three were already out of time. As for the sec ond Respondent, the first four of his eight invoic es were already out of time. 

25     Further, it was c ommon ground between the parties that the first three proforma invoic es rendered by the first Respondent have already been paid by the Applic ant. As for the eight invoic es rendered by the sec ond Respondent, the Applic ant has paid the first six in full. The seventh invoic e has partially been paid, while the eighth invoic e remains unpaid. 

26     In light of s 122 of the LPA, the Applic ant c an only obtain an order for taxation in respec t of the first three invoic es rendered by the first Respondent, and first six invoic es rendered by the sec ond Respondent (sinc e they have either been paid or were delivered outside the 12-month period), if he c an satisfy the c ourt that there are spec ial c irc umstanc es to warrant an order for taxation. 

**_Do the invoices rendered by the first and second Respondent constitute running accounts_** 

27     The Applic ant submitted that s 122 of the LPA did not apply bec ause the OS was filed well within 12 months from the date of the last invoic es issued by the first and sec ond Respondents dated 4 May 2009 and 5 February 2009 respec tively. The basis for this submission was grounded on the proposition that in a c ase where a law firm issues its bill not in a single invoic e but by way of suc c essive bills, the 12-month period should start to run only from the date of the last-issued invoic e. In support of this proposition, the Applic ant relied on _Chamberlain_ , where the English Court of Appeal held that a series of four invoic es issued by the defendant law firm were ac tually in relation to a single bill, and henc e the time period for obtaining an order for taxation started to run only from the time the final invoic e was rec eived. In that c ase, Lord Denning held at 1446: 

 The next point in the c ase is whether the bills were four separate bills or whether they were one. If they were four separate bills, the c lient would have to demand taxation of eac h within a month of rec eipt. If they were one bill, divided into separate parts, as long as he demands taxation within a month of the final ac c ount, then he has a right to taxation. 

 We were referred to one or two c ases on this point. First. In re Romer & Haslam [1893] 2 Q.B. 286: and the latest was a c ase in this c ourt on Marc h 6, 1980, of Davidsons v. JonesFenleigh, The Times, Marc h 11, 1980. Putting it quite shortly, as Bowen L.J. said [1893] 2 Q.B. 286, 298, it is a question of fact whether there are natural breaks in the work done by a solicitor so that each portion of it can and should be treated as a separate and distinct part in itself, capable of and rightly being charged separately and taxed separately. Applying that simple test, it seems to me that over this short time — the end of November 1978 to the beginning of May 1979 — this was one c ontinuous dealing and work done by a solic itor, not dividing itself naturally or otherwise into any breaks at all. When the bills were delivered, they were delivered eac h time as part of the running ac c ount — “ac c ount rendered” being c arried on in eac h to the next. I agree with the judge on this point too that this should be regarded as one bill in respec t of one c omplete piec e of work, although divided into parts. As this is one bill, and the c lient demanded taxation within the month, he is entitled to have the whole of it taxed. 


 [emphasis added] 

28     In my judgment, the princ iple of “running ac c ount” in _Chamberlain_ had no applic ation to the present c ase. In _Chamberlain_ , all the bills were expressly stated to be part of a running ac c ount, and eac h suc c essive bill referred to the prec eding bill. That was the reason the English Court of Appeal regarded the four bills as ac tually one single bill. Furthermore, the four bills were raised over a relatively short period of about six months. In c ontrast, here, eac h invoic e issued by the first and sec ond Respondents reflec ted work done for a spec ific period. None of the invoic es referred to the prec eding invoic es. In other words, eac h invoic e was independent of the previous invoic es. Finally, the invoic es were raised over a period of 28 months in the c ase of the first Respondent and 11 months in the c ase of the sec ond Respondent. I therefore found that time began to run from the date of eac h suc c essive invoic e and not from the last invoic e. 

29     It was therefore imperative for the Applic ant to show the existenc e of spec ial c irc umstanc es before it c an obtain an order for taxation for the first three invoic es rendered by the first Respondent, and the first six invoic es rendered by the sec ond Respondent. 

**_What constitutes special circumstances_** 

30     The question of what c onstitutes “spec ial c irc umstanc es” under s 122 of the LPA was c anvassed by the Court of Appeal in _Wee Harry Lee v Haw Par Brothers International Ltd_ [19791980] SLR(R) 603 (“ _Wee Harry Lee_ ”). The plaintiff in that c ase had retained the defendant firm as solic itors for their group of c ompanies for the period from November 1975 to August 1976. During that period, the plaintiff paid $119,500 to ac c ount of c osts exc luding disbursements. The defendant firm then submitted 27 bills amounting to $610,000 exc lusive of disbursements of whic h 24 of them were dated the same day. The plaintiff made no further payment of the bills as it was of the view that the amounts were exc essive. Subsequently the plaintiff applied for an order for the bills to be referred to the Registrar for taxation. There was no dispute that s 122 applied and that the plaintiff c ould only obtain the order for taxation if it c ould prove the existenc e of spec ial c irc umstanc es. 

31     The Court of Appeal in _Wee Harry Lee_ observed that it would not be expedient to provide an exhaustive list of what c ould c onstitute spec ial c irc umstanc es under s 122 of the LPA. It referred (at [15]) to the dec ision in _In Re Cheeseman_ [1891] 2 Ch 289 for the proposition that: 

 There is no rigid rule as to what kind of c irc umstanc es will justify the taxation of a solic itor's bill after payment, but the judge has in eac h c ase to determine whether there are spec ial c irc umstanc es whic h make it right to refer the bill for taxation, and if there are spec ial c irc umstanc es in the c ase, the Court of Appeal will not readily interfere with the dec ision of the Court below that they are suffic ient to justify taxation. 

32     The Court of Appeal held that there were two aspec ts of the c ase that c onstituted spec ial c irc umstanc es under s 122 of the LPA. The first was that the parties had engaged in prolonged negotiations over the size of the bill, and it was only when these negotiations failed that the plaintiff dec ided to file the applic ation to obtain an order for taxation. The Court of Appeal stated that this fac t alone was suffic ient to c onstitute spec ial c irc umstanc es “whic h c ould have justified the c ourt in exerc ising its disc retion to order taxation” ( _Wee Harry Lee_ at [14]). The fac t that negotiation took plac e demonstrated that the plaintiff was at all material times dissatisfied with the quantum of the fees c harged. 

33     Sec ond, the Court of Appeal found that the defendants’ failure to attribute the individual c osts to eac h partic ular item in the bill of c osts also c onstituted spec ial c irc umstanc es under s 122 of the 


LPA. It stated at [13]: 

 We did not agree that there are no spec ial c irc umstanc es justifying the learned Chief Justic e to exerc ise his disc retion to order taxation. To begin with the quantum and the size of the main bill number 67/77 with its detailed itemisation and narration of the work done without any sum being shown against eac h suc h item but a final lump sum figure shown to represent the c osts of all the items are in themselves, in our view, spec ial c irc umstanc es for the exerc ise of the c ourt's disc retion here. 

34     Before me, Mr Axel Chan (“Mr Chan”), c ounsel for the first Respondent, submitted that for overc harging to c onstitute spec ial c irc umstanc es, the exc essive fees must amount to either fraud or tainted by misc onduc t or pressure from the solic itor. In support, he relied on _Supreme Court Practice 2009_ (Jeffrey Pinsler Gen Ed) (Lexis Nexis, 2009) at para 59/28/12 whic h in turn referred to _Re Boycott_ (1885) 29 Ch D 571 (“ _Re Boycott_ ”). On c lose sc rutiny of the dec ision in _Re Boycott_ , it was c lear that it did not support Mr Chan’s submission. Cotton LJ’s remark that the phrase “spec ial c irc umstanc es” should be restric ted to “pressure and overc harge, or overc harge amounting to fraud” (at 576) was rejec ted by the other two members of the Court of Appeal, who held that suc h a narrow interpretation was neither desirable nor nec essary. Fry LJ held at 582 that: 

 That misc onduc t or fraud on the part of solic itors, or pressure ac c ompanied by overc harge or overc harges so gross as to amount to fraud, are spec ial c irc umstanc es within the Ac t has been firmly established. I do not desire to prec lude myself from saying that there may be other spec ial c irc umstanc es whic h would justify taxation 

In a similar vein, Bowen LJ stated at 579 that: 

 Now Judges who sit in Courts of first instanc e find it no doubt very c onvenient to let the public know the lines upon whic h they mean to exerc ise their disc retion, and I think it very well that they should do so, and they have in many c ases proc eeded on the princ iple that pressure and overc harge c ombined c onstitute the spec ial c irc umstanc es mentioned in the Ac t. The rule, though not exhaustive, is probably a good working rule, suffic ient for most c ases; but if you press that rule too far and lay down as a definition that spec ial c irc umstanc es are not to be c onsidered to exist unless there be pressure and overc harge, it seems to me you are making an Ac t of Parliament. If the Legislature had meant that only these things should c onstitute spec ial c irc umstanc es it c ould have said so. Spec ial c irc umstanc es, I think, are those whic h appear to the Judge so spec ial and exc eptional as to justify taxation. 

35     The non-exhaustive list of “spec ial c irc umstanc es” has repeatedly been emphasized in several subsequent English c ases. In _Norman, Re_ (1885–86) LR 16 QBD 673 (“ _Re Norman_ ”), the defendant law firm raised the point that “spec ial c irc umstanc es” justifying an order for taxation c ould not be found in the absenc e of pressure and overc harge, or overc harge amounting to fraud. This argument was firmly rejec ted by the English Court of Appeal whic h adopted the reasoning of Bowen LJ in _Re Boycott_ , and held at 677 that it was not for judges to “impose upon Courts greater fetters than the legislature has thought fit to impose on them” by “limit[ing] the expression “spec ial c irc umstanc es,” as to exc lude from it unforeseen c ombinations of fac ts.” Finally, in _Hirst & Capes v Fox_ [1908] 1 KB 982, the English Court of Appeal agreed at 996 that: 

 [S]pec ial c irc umstanc es are not c onfined to duress, pressure, overc harge, or fraud; and the disc retion of a judge as to what fac ts c onstitute “spec ial c irc umstanc es” ought not to be overruled exc ept where he has not exerc ised his disc retion judic ially. 


From my review of the authorities inc luding _Re Boycott_ , fraud and pressure _can_ amount to spec ial c irc umstanc es. However c ontrary to Mr Chan’s submission, the existenc e of “spec ial c irc umstanc es” is not restric ted _only_ to c ases involving fraud, duress or pressure. 

**_Are there special circumstances_** 

_Overcharging_ 

36     The main argument raised by the Applic ant that there were spec ial c irc umstanc es justifying taxation was that it had been grossly overc harged by the first and sec ond Respondents. In support, the Applic ant pointed out that the total fees c harged by both the first and sec ond Respondents for a three-day assessment hearing and an aborted appeal c ame up to a total of $448,056.38. This, ac c ording to the Applic ant, had to be c ontrasted with the first Respondent’s indic ation of fees for a three day trial (albeit for a different c ase) of about $155,000. On the fac e of this c omparison, the Applic ant submitted that overc harging was manifest. 

37     In my view, an allegation of overc harging by referenc e to the quantum of the total fees is generally not suffic ient to amount to spec ial c irc umstanc es _per se_. Typic ally a c lient seeks an order for taxation of the solic itor’s fees bec ause he is dissatisfied with the quantum c harged, _ie_ he believes he has been overc harged. The law allows suc h a c lient the right to tax any bill raised within 12 months from the delivery of the bill provided it has not been paid. Outside the 12-month window or after payment, the law requires the c lient to demonstrate spec ial c irc umstanc es. It seems to me that to treat a general allegation as opposed to a spec ific allegation of overc harging as spec ial c irc umstanc es would almost invariably lead to an order for taxation even if it is applied for outside the 12-month period or after payment. Suc h an approac h would have the effec t of rendering the restric tion to tax suc h bills outside the 12-month window or after payment otiose. Clearly the objec tive behind s 122 of the LPA is to c ut down the c lient’s entitlement to tax the bill as of right. 

38     As stated above at [35], there is no exhaustive list of what c an c onstitute “spec ial c irc umstanc es”. Where an applic ant relies on overc harging as “spec ial c irc umstanc es”, it is inc umbent for suc h an applic ant to adduc e evidenc e to enable the c ourt to draw the inferenc e of overc harging. Suc h evidenc e may inc lude, in a non exhaustive manner: 

 (a) Failure to itemise a bill of c osts, or failure to properly alloc ate the c osts to the various items on the bill ( Wee Harry Lee). 

 (b) Evidenc e that partic ular items on an itemised bill have been overc harged ( Re Boycott ). 

 (c ) Charges for items that are non-existent (In Re Norman , the bill of c osts inc luded a c harge for shorthand notes of the proc eedings at a referenc e where no professional shorthand writer had been employed, but the c lerk to the solic itor had taken the notes, and it did not appear that the solic itor had given his c lerk any part of the amount c harged). 

 (d) Charges for items already paid by the c lient (In Re Norman , the bill of c osts inc luded a c harge for witnesses' expenses whic h had been paid by the c lient). 

39     It would be neither produc tive nor appropriate for the c ourt hearing the applic ation to determine whether the bill taken as a whole is exc essive. Otherwise, every applic ation for taxation under s 122 of the LPA, on the basis that there has been overc harging, would effec tively and nec essarily require the c ourt to c onduc t a taxation of the bill. That is the role of taxation and not the c ourt hearing the applic ation on whether to grant the order for taxation. Mr Samuel Chac ko 


(“Mr Chac ko”), c ounsel for the Applic ant, referred to Bowen LJ’s dissenting judgment in _Re Boycott_ for the proposition that there was no need for the Applic ant to point out any spec ific items of overc harge as long as the bill itself was “redolent of overc harge”. The learned judge in that c ase observed (at 582): 

 As to the overc harges, it is said that spec ial items of overc harge must be shewn before taxation c an be ordered. This is a good general rule from whic h I should be loth to depart, but if I find a bill whic h is redolent of overc harge, I do not think that I ought to require proof of partic ular items of overc harge. 

40     I did not think that Bowen LJ’s statement in _Re Boycott_ should be taken to stand for the proposition that the mere size of a bill of c osts is suffic ient to c onstitute “spec ial c irc umstanc es” justifying an order for taxation under s 122 of the LPA. Every c ase differs in c omplexity, and the amount of preparation required for eac h c ase c an vary widely. Similarly, the number of days whic h a trial takes may not always be indic ative of the effort and time spent by the lawyers on the c ase, sinc e they may have spent c onsiderable time on the getting up, disc overy, and legal researc h. In the final analysis, the size of a bill _per se_ c an rarely be indic ative of overc harging, exc ept for truly routine c ases of whic h there is some form of ac c epted industry benc hmark for the fees. 

41     In the present c ase, the first Respondent’s indic ation of $155,000 for a three day trial related to a c ompletely different matter from the Suit. As suc h, I did not ac c ept that it would be a useful or fair benc hmark to c ompare the indic ative fees of a separate matter with the total fees c harged by the first and sec ond Respondents for their c onduc t of the Suit. While the total fees of $448,056. for a three-day assessment and an aborted appeal may appear exc essive at first blush, I took note that the work was done over a two and a half year period from August 2006 to January 2009. I had also taken note that when Mr Shahiran left the first Respondent to join the sec ond Respondent, the matter followed him even though by that time the first Respondent had already c harged the Applic ant a sum of about $187,000. If the Applic ant genuinely believed that the total fees for the c onduc t of the Suit was in the ballpark figure of $155,000, then it was indeed c urious, to say the least, that he would have agreed to transfer the matter to the sec ond Respondent so that Mr Shahiran c ould c ontinue to have c onduc t of the Suit given that by that time, the total fees c harged, _ie_ about $187,000, had already exc eeded the indic ative fees. It was apparent that the Applic ant did not regard the fees as exorbitant, otherwise the matter would not have moved with Mr Shahiran. Furthermore, eac h invoic e issued by the first and sec ond Respondents c arried suffic ient detail of the work done and how muc h the Applic ant was c harged for eac h piec e of work. Indeed, the Applic ant admitted through the affidavit of Mr Yee that the invoic es issued by the first Respondent “listed out in some detail the work that was undertaken” (paragraph 41 of Yee Kok Chew’s affidavit dated 17 September 2009). It was telling that the first indic ation from the Applic ant that it wished to tax the Respondents’ invoic es was through a letter from the Applic ant’s present solic itors dated 24 July 2009. At no point in time (prior to the filing of the OS) did the Applic ant dispute the c harges, or c laim that the details of the invoic es were defic ient in any respec t. In fac t, the Applic ant was happy to make payment, and it even negotiated payment of some of the invoic es by instalments. The first three invoic es of the first Respondent have been paid while the first six invoic es of the sec ond Respondents have also been paid. The fac t of payment, c oupled with the lac k of any prior protest on the fees, suggested to me that the Applic ant did not believe that it had been overc harged. This was to be c ontrasted with _Wee Harry Lee_ where there was prolonged negotiation over the quantum of the bills. Here, the only “ _negotiation_ ” was to permit the Applic ant to pay the fees c harged under the various invoic es by instalments whic h the Respondents had agreed to. 

42     Ultimately as aptly observed in _Ralph Hume Garry_ at [32(3)], the test is “not whether the bill on its fac e is objec tively suffic ient, but whether the information in the bill supplemented by what is 


subjec tively known to the c lient enables the c lient with advic e to take an informed dec ision whether or not to exerc ise the only right _then_ open to him, _viz_ , to seek taxation reasonably free from the risk of having to pay for the c osts of that taxation.” Evidently there was suffic ient information to enable the Applic ant to make an informed dec ision to pay the bulk of the invoic es raised by the Respondents. In fac t from the evidenc e before me, in partic ular the c onduc t of the Applic ant, it was c lear that it did not believe that there was overc harging by the first and sec ond Respondents as and when eac h of the suc c essive invoic es was raised. It was not without signific anc e that the dispute over the fees only emerged after the outc ome of the assessment. Obviously the Applic ant was not entirely pleased with the end result but this, in my view, does not amount to spec ial c irc umstanc es. 

43     It did not esc ape my attention that the Applic ant similarly applied to tax the c osts of its Malaysian solic itors in respec t of work done for the litigation against the parties who had infringed the Applic ant’s trademark in Malaysia long after the bills were paid or, in any event, outside the presc ribed period (in Malaysia, the period is six months). It was no c oinc idenc e that alleged overc harging by the solic itors was the princ ipal ground relied on by the Applic ant for leave to tax the bills. The applic ation was dismissed by the Malaysian c ourt in Marc h 2008 more than 18 months prior to the filing of the present OS. Although this dismissal is stric tly irrelevant as to whether there was overc harging by the first and/or sec ond Respondents for their c onduc t of the Suit, it served to highlight the fac t that the Applic ant was, on all ac c ounts, a sophistic ated litigant who is adequately familiar with solic itors’ c osts and ac c ess to taxation. The fac t that five sets of solic itors were altogether instruc ted in relation to the Suit merely reinforc ed the point. 

44     In the c irc umstanc es, I found that the Applic ant had failed to adduc e any evidenc e that would permit me to draw the inferenc e that there had been overc harging by the first and sec ond Respondents. 

_Confusion over the proforma/tax invoices_ 

45     In relation to the invoic es issued by the first Respondent, the Applic ant raised a further argument that there were spec ial c irc umstanc es justifying taxation bec ause the manner in whic h the invoic es were issued c aused the Applic ant c onfusion in determining how muc h it was being c harged. The root c ause of this alleged c onfusion was that apart from the four proforma invoic es, the first Respondent also issued a number of tax invoic es to the Applic ant. The Applic ant thus c laimed that it had no idea whic h of the invoic es it was paying for. 

46     I did not agree with the Applic ant that the first Respondent’s prac tic e of issuing proforma and tax invoic es c aused it any c onfusion. Mr Shahiran had explained in his affidavit that the proforma invoic es were issued to inform the Applic ant of the outstanding c harges, and the tax invoic es were only issued after payment has been rec eived. In the present c ase, the tax invoic es issued by the first Respondent did not c orrespond exac tly with the proforma invoic es bec ause the Applic ant had requested to pay the sums stated on the Proforma invoic es by instalments. While there may be some issue as to the propriety of the issuanc e of the first Respondent’s tax invoic es against eac h instalment payment by the Applic ant, it was c lear to me that the Applic ant was not at all c onfused by this mode of invoic ing. If indeed the Applic ant was labouring under some c onfusion between the proforma and tax invoic es, it was hard to believe that it would have c ontinued making payments over two and a half years without raising any question or c omplaint. 

_Potential missing funds_ 

47     The Applic ant further c laimed that there were spec ial c irc umstanc es to justify an order for taxation bec ause some funds may not have been ac c ounted for by the first Respondent. In short, the 


Applic ant c laimed that M/s Rajah & Tann (who ac ted for the defendant in the Suit) had made two payments to the first Respondent of $9,074.67 and $1,073.91 on 20 July 2007 and 10 January 2008 respec tively, as payment for photoc opies of doc uments. The Applic ant alleged that although the photoc opying c harges have been paid by Rajah & Tann on behalf of the defendant in the Suit, the first Respondent nonetheless c harged the Applic ant for the same or have not ac c ounted for them. This point was raised in the Applic ant’s affidavits but was not pursued. This allegation was spec ific ally 

denied by the first Respondent (see paras 43‒45 of Mr Shahiran’s 1st Affidavit filed on 21 Oc tober 2009). During the appeal before me, other than stating that this was one of the grounds suffic ient to give rise to spec ial c irc umstanc es, no submission was made by Mr Chac ko. Consequently no submission was made by Mr Chan to address this point either. 

48     For the above reasons, I found that the Applic ant had failed to adduc e any evidenc e to c ross the threshold in proving the existenc e of spec ial c irc umstanc es under s 122 of the LPA. 

**_Estoppel_** 

49     In light of my findings above, it was not nec essary for me to deal with the alternative estoppel argument raised by the Respondents. Suffic e to say that the Respondents’ c laim on estoppel was entirely grounded on the fac t that the Applic ant had negotiated for payment by instalments and had paid most of the invoic es. However, under s 122 of the LPA, an order for taxation c an be made even after payment provided that spec ial c irc umstanc es exist. If the Respondents were right that payment through negotiated instalments is suffic ient to c reate an estoppel to prec lude an order for taxation, this will render the sec ond limb of s 122 of the LPA inoperative sinc e the fac t of payment will by their submission _ipso facto_ prec lude a taxation order. Therefore, even if there are fac ts that would amount to an estoppel at c ommon law, this would not nec essarily displac e the c ourt’s disc retion to order taxation under s 122 of the LPA if spec ial c irc umstanc es c an otherwise be shown to exist. Muc h will depend on the fac ts giving rise to the estoppel. In the present c ase, the fac t of payment through instalments would not be suffic ient. 

**Conclusion** 

50     In the absenc e of spec ial c irc umstanc es, I only ordered taxation of the invoic es whic h were raised by the Respondents within the 12-month period and whic h remained outstanding when the OS was filed. Ac c ordingly I ordered the first Respondent to deliver a bill of c osts for taxation c overing work done under the fourth proforma invoic e and for the sec ond Respondent to deliver a bill of c osts for taxation c overing work done under the seventh and eighth invoic es sinc e these invoic es were raised within the 12-month period and remained unpaid.
