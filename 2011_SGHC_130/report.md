**Woo Bih Li J:** 

**Introduction** 

1       This is an ac tion by five plaintiffs against the defendant (“Mr Ashloc k”). The first to fourth plaintiffs are part of a group referred to as the CLSA Group. The fifth plaintiff is benefic ially owned by the sec ond plaintiff. 

2       Between 3 Marc h 2006 and 28 February 2009, Mr Ashloc k was employed by different c ompanies in the CLSA Group as follows: 

 (a) by the fifth plaintiff pursuant to its letter of appointment dated 3 Marc h 2006 and c ountersigned by Mr Ashloc k on 8 Marc h 2006; and 

 (b) by the first plaintiff pursuant to its letter dated 10 May 2007 and c ounter-signed by Mr Ashloc k on 13 May 2007. 

3       By a termination agreement dated 17 July 2008 (“the TA”) between the first plaintiff and Mr Ashloc k, Mr Ashloc k’s employment with the first plaintiff was terminated. 

4       Clause 14 of the TA states: 

14\. **Final Settlement** 

 By signing this letter and ac c epting the abovementioned payments, this represents full and final settlement of all and any c laims against SetClear Pte Ltd and its affiliated c ompanies. Additionally, it c onfirms that you agree not to pursue any future c laim against SetClear Pte. Ltd and its affiliated c ompanies. 


5       The plaintiffs said that the terms of the TA were subsequently reaffirmed in two letters dated 9 Oc tober 2008 and 28 February 2009 whic h were c ounter-signed by Mr Ashloc k. 

6       On 20 January 2010, Mr Ashloc k c ommenc ed proc eedings against the five plaintiffs and one Jonathan Slone (“Mr Slone”) in Civil Ac tion No 10CV-0453(GBD) in the United States Distric t Court, Southern Distric t of New York (“the Americ an Ac tion”) based on various c auses of ac tion in respec t of equity whic h has been referred to as “founder benefits” or “Founder’s Equity”. I will adopt the referenc e “founder’s benefits” for c onvenienc e. 

7       The position of the five plaintiffs in the present ac tion in Singapore (“the Singapore Ac tion”) is t hat Mr Ashloc k is prec luded from c ommenc ing and c ontinuing the Americ an Ac tion against them in view of the TA and, in partic ular, c l 14 thereof, whic h was subsequently reaffirmed by the two letters stated above. They sought the following primary reliefs in the Singapore Ac tion: 

1\. A dec laration that the Defendant is not entitled, under a severanc e agreement dated 17 July 2008 entered into between the 1st Plaintiff and the Defendant and reaffirmed by way of two let t ers from the 1st Plaintiff to the Defendant dated 9 Oc tober 2008 and 28 February 2009 (c ollec tively the “Severanc e Agreement”), to bring any c laim against the 1st Plaintiff and/or its affiliated c ompanies, inc luding but not limited to the 2nd to 5th Plaintiffs, in c onnec tion with and/or in relation to the Defendant’s employment and/or assoc iation with the 1st Plaintiff and its affiliated c ompanies, suc h c laims inc luding but not limited to a c laim for “founder” benefits whic h the Defendant alleges were c onferred upon him by the 1st Plaintiff and/or its affiliated c ompanies. 

2\. A dec laration that the Defendant breac hed the Severanc e Agreement by c ommenc ing and maintaining Civil Ac tion No. 10- CV-0453(GBD) against the 1st to 5th Plaintiffs in the United     St at es Distric t Court, Southern Distric t of New York (“US Proc eedings”) in respec t of the Defendant’s alleged “founder” benefits. 

3\. An order that the Defendant do pay the Plaintiffs damages to be assessed in respec t of all c osts, expenses and losses inc urred by the Plaintiffs arising out of or in c onnec tion with the Defendant’s breac h of the Severanc e Agreement. 

4\. An order restraining the Defendant from c ontinuing the US Proc eedings or c ommenc ing any further or other proc eedings in the United States of Americ a or elsewhere against the Plaintiffs in respec t of his alleged “founder” benefits. 

 ... 

8       Mr Ashloc k’s position was that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the dec larations sought in prayers 1 and 2 or the order in prayer 3 or the anti-suit injunc tion sought in prayer 4 of the Singapore Ac tion. 

**The court’s conclusion and reasons** 

9       Mr Ashloc k sought to show that the Americ an Ac tion was in an advanc ed stage. The Americ an Ac tion was c ommenc ed on 20 January 2010. The third and fourth plaintiffs had already relied on the TA in their Answers filed in that ac tion. The sec ond plaintiff had been served with the papers in the Americ an Ac tion although it was c ontesting the jurisdic tion of the US Distric t Court over it. Mr Slone had been served and had filed an Answer in the Americ an Ac tion. Mr Ashloc k had been advised by his US attorney that a substantial part of the pre-trial proc ess had been c onc luded and all that remained was for depositions to be c onduc ted. Thereafter the matter would proc eed to trial. 


10     Mr Ashloc k said that the plaintiffs had delayed filing the Singapore Ac tion until 17 February 

2011\. He suggested that the Singapore Ac tion was filed bec ause the sec ond plaintiff was afraid that the outc ome of its applic ation to c ontest the jurisdic tion of the US Distric t Court might be unfavourable to it from a tax perspec tive. 

11     The plaintiffs said that the Americ an Ac tion was at a preliminary stage. In addition to the sec ond plaintiff’s c ontest of jurisdic tion, the first and fifth plaintiffs had not even been served with the Americ an Ac tion although I should mention that this was bec ause they refused to c o-operate with Mr Ashloc k on the issue of servic e. 

12     It seemed to me that the Americ an Ac tion was not at the advanc ed stage that Mr Ashloc k was saying. As mentioned above, the first and fifth plaintiffs had not yet been served and the sec ond plaintiff was c ontesting the jurisdic tion of the US Distric t Court over it. 

13     More importantly, it was irrelevant whether the Americ an Ac tion was at an advanc ed stage or not. Mr Ashloc k did not apply to stay the Singapore Ac tion or for an anti-suit injunc tion to stop the plaintiffs from c ontinuing with the Singapore Ac tion. In the c irc umstanc es, it was also irrelevant that the plaintiffs had filed the Singapore ac tion only rec ently. 

14     Ac c ordingly, I had only to dec ide whether I c ould hear the ac tion immediately or whether it should proc eed to trial in Singapore at the same time as the proc eedings in Americ a were c ontinuing. 

15     Mr Kelvin Tan, c ounsel for Mr Ashloc k, submitted that I had to c onsider a matrix of fac ts leading up to and subsequent to the signing of the TA in order to interpret c l 14 thereof: 

 (a) Mr Ashloc k’s willingness to partic ipate in the fifth plaintiff’s start-up in exc hange for an equitable share in the business. 

 (b) The sc ope of disc ussions between Mr Ashloc k and Mr Slone in respec t of the founder’s benefits whic h purportedly led to an agreement thereon. 

 (c ) The c irc umstanc es under whic h Mr Ashloc k signed the TA. 

 (d) Email c orrespondenc e between Mr Ashloc k and Mr Laurie James Young (the Managing Direc tor – Organizational Development of the CLSA Group) after the signing of the TA. 

 (e) The c onduc t of the plaintiffs in the Americ an Ac tion. 

16     In my view, sub-paras (a) and (b) of [15] above would not assist the c ourt in interpreting c l 14. They would be relevant only if the c ourt were to c onc lude that c l 14 does not prec lude Mr Ashloc k from pursuing his c laims in respec t of founder’s benefits against the five plaintiffs. 

17     As for the c irc umstanc es under whic h Mr Ashloc k signed the TA, he suggested that the c ourt take into ac c ount two matters. 

18     Firstly, sinc e April 2008, he had been suffering from intense dizzy spells, loss of balanc e and severe loss of hearing in his right ear. In early August 2008, he was diagnosed with a brain tumour whic h was eventually found to be benign. 

19     Sec ondly, he rec eived a telephone c all from Mr Young on 17 July 2008 to meet him at the lobby of the Fullerton Hotel for a disc ussion. However, instead of a disc ussion, Mr Young presented him with 


a c opy of the TA and told him that he would either agree to it or be fired. Mr Ashloc k had no other inc ome to support his family and he was c onc erned that if a diagnosis revealed a serious medic al c ondition, the medic al bills would impose a tremendous financ ial burden on his family. In the c irc umstanc es, he said he had no c hoic e but to sign the TA. 

20     He also said he thought that the TA resolved issues pertaining to his employment only and not to the founder’s benefits. It was only about three hours after the meeting that he sought to c larify with Mr Young that c l 14 did not prevent him from making a c laim in respec t of the founder’s benefits. I will elaborate on this purported c larific ation later. 

21     Mr Young did not agree with Mr Ashloc k’s suggestion that he had been c ompelled to sign the TA. 

22     In any event, Mr Ashloc k was not seeking to set aside the TA on any ground, _eg_ , mistake, duress or undue influenc e. Ac c ordingly, the two matters he raised were irrelevant. I would add that he learned about the diagnosis of his brain tumour in August 2008 whic h was after the TA was signed on 17 July 2008. 

23     As for the c larific ation whic h Mr Ashloc k had purportedly sought from Mr Young, Mr Ashloc k had sent an email dated 17 July 2008 to Mr Young whic h stated: 

 Laurie, 

 I want to go on rec ord with you that it is my understanding that by signing the resignation agreement today that I am ac ting in good faith that a subsequent agreement will be reac hed in terms of my relationship with CLSA and insuranc e for 2009 as well as my founder status. I signed the agreement believing that sec tion 14 does not prec lude an agreement or possible ac tions should we not be able to reac h an agreement. Please let me know if this undersanding [ sic ] differs from yours. 

 Regards, 

 Bill 

24     The material part of Mr Young’s email reply dated 18 July 2008 stated: 

 I believe our c onversations over the last few days have been c onduc ted in a very c onstruc tive and c ordial manner. I will c ontinue to searc h for a mutually ac c eptable agreement c overing a future relationship with CLSA and medic al c overage in the US. 

 Clause 14 of the separation agreement must stand on its merits Bill as was the intention of the doc ument you signed. 

 Laurie 

25     Mr Ashloc k ac c epted that Mr Young did not agree with him that he c ould still pursue a c laim on the founder’s benefits. However, he disingenuously suggested that Mr Young did not disagree. 

26     It was c lear to me that Mr Young did disagree although he did so politely and that Mr Ashloc k knew that Mr Young was disagreeing. I was of the view that Mr Ashloc k’s email dated 17 July 2008 was a self-serving one and did not assist me in the interpretation of c l 14. 


27     As for the plaintiffs, they sought to rely on two letters whic h Mr Ashloc k c ounter-signed to argue that he had ac c epted Mr Young’s stand on c l 14. 

28     The first is a letter dated 9 Oc tober 2008 from the first plaintiff to Mr Ashloc k. It states: 

 Dear Bill, 

 Further to our letter dated 17 July 2008, I am writing to c onfirm the following: 

- You will remain on the SetClear Pte. Ltd. payroll through until 30 June 2009; 

- The Company will c ontinue to reimburse you the c ost of maintaining your Cobra medic al insuranc e up to and inc luding 30 June 2009 as per Cobra Sc heme rules. 

 These additional arrangements are provided to you in good faith by the Company to assist you as you work through this diffic ult period. 

 We are proposing this stric tly on c ondition that you c onfirm that the terms and c onditions whic h have been previously agreed by you, per your separation agreement dated 17 July 2008, remain in full forc e and effec t and are re-c onfirmed by you. 

 Yours sinc erely, 

 Toni Carroll 

 For and on behalf of 

 SetClear Pte. Ltd. 

 I hereby agree and ac c ept the terms and c onditions as set out above: 

## ____________________ 

 Name: Mr Bill Ashloc k 

 Date: 

29     The sec ond is a letter dated 28 February 2009 from the first plaintiff to Mr Ashloc k. It states: 

 Dear Bill, 


 Signed: _____________ Bill Ashloc k 

 Date: 28/02/ 

 Following your rec ent c onversation with Laurie Young I am writing to c onfirm that your final day of employment with SetClear Pte Ltd will be 28 February 2009. 

 As agreed, your salary and benefits have been c alc ulated and paid up to 31 Dec ember 2008 and you have been on unpaid leave up to and inc luding 28 February 2009. 

 All other terms agreed with you and c onfirmed in our letters dated 17 July 2008 and 9 Oc tober 2008 remain unc hanged. 

 Yours sinc erely, 

 Toni Carroll 

 For and on behalf of 

 SetClear Pte. Ltd 

 I hereby understand and agree to the terms and c onditions that are set out above. 

30     The referenc e to a 17 July 2008 letter was in fac t to the TA dated 17 July 2008. 

31     As mentioned above, Mr Ashloc k had c ounter-signed these two letters. I was of the view that by c ounter-signing these two letters, Mr Ashloc k had affirmed the TA and it was too late for him to resile from it. This was an additional reason why his allegations about his health and about being c ompelled to sign the TA were irrelevant. However, the c ounter-signing of the two letters did not nec essarily mean that he had agreed with Mr Young’s view on c l 14. 

32     The above disc ussion c overs sub-paras (c ) and (d) of [15] above. As for sub-para (e) of [15] above, I did not see how the c onduc t of the plaintiffs in the Americ an Ac tion would affec t the interpretation of c l 14. Indeed, Mr Tan did not substantiate his argument that suc h c onduc t would affec t the said interpretation. 

33     As regards the governing law of the TA, the plaintiffs c ontended that the governing law was Singapore law. Mr Ashloc k apparently did not agree but he did not say what the governing law was. The employment whic h was terminated by the TA was the subjec t of a letter from the first plaintiff to Mr Ashloc k dated 10 May 2007 and c ounter-signed by him on 13 May 2007 (see [2] above). The terms thereof expressly stated that the governing law was Singapore law. The first plaintiff is a c ompany inc orporated in Singapore and Mr Ashloc k was stationed in Singapore while he was employed by the first plaintiff. The TA was signed in Singapore. In the c irc umstanc es, I c onc luded that Singapore law was the governing law of the TA. 


34     I would also mention that although the TA was entered into between the first plaintiff and Mr Ashloc k, the sec ond to fourth plaintiffs were also seeking to enforc e it by relying on s 2(1)( _b_ ) and 2(3) of the Contrac ts (Rights of Third Parties) Ac t (Cap 53B, 2002 Rev Ed). Mr Alvin Yeo, SC, c ounsel for the plaintiffs, submitted that the sec ond to fourth plaintiffs were affiliated c ompanies of the first plaintiff for the purpose of c l 14. Mr Tan did not c ontest these submissions. In any event, even if the sec ond to fourth plaintiffs were not entitled to enforc e the TA, it was ac c epted that the first plaintiff c ertainly was. 

35     Mr Ashloc k c ontended that the TA only resolved issues relating to his employment and c l 14 did not prec lude him from c laiming the founder’s benefits against any of the plaintiffs. His c ontention ignored the obvious point that the resolution was on c ertain terms, one of whic h was c l 14, and that it was open to the parties to agree that he was not to make any c laim against the plaintiffs as part of the terms of the resolution. 

36     In my view, the terms of c l 14 were simple and c lear (see [4] above). The TA was in full and final settlement of all c laims by Mr Ashloc k against the plaintiffs. The sentenc e that Mr Ashloc k agrees not to pursue any future c laim against the plaintiffs was really a c onsequenc e of the full and final settlement. Therefore, Mr Ashloc k was not entitled to c ommenc e or c ontinue with the Americ an Ac tion against the plaintiffs. 

37     I would add that Mr Ashloc k sought to rely on some c onversations between him and Mr Young subsequent to the TA and an email dated 13 January 2009 from him to Mr Young to show that the issue of the founder’s benefits was still kept alive after the TA was signed. However, Mr Young said that he had only agreed to speak to Mr Slone about suc h benefits and that that was a matter between the two individuals. I would add that an earlier email from Mr Young dated 11 January 2009 supported Mr Young’s version whic h I ac c epted. 

38     In any event, subsequent statements do not, generally speaking, affec t the interpretation of a provision unless they c onstitute an estoppel. Mr Ashloc k was not relying on estoppel. Neither was he relying on a waiver or a variation. 

39     In the c irc umstanc es, I was of the view that the plaintiffs were entitled to the dec larations sought in prayers 1 and 2. 

40     As for prayer 4 about an anti-suit injunc tion, Mr Tan referred to various authorities and in partic ular, _John Reginald Stott Kirkham and others v Trane US Inc and others_ [2009] 4 SLR(R) 428 to support Mr Ashloc k’s position that an anti-suit injunc tion ought not to be granted against Mr Ashloc k even if I were to rule on the interpretation of c l 14 in the plaintiffs’ favour. He stressed that the Americ an Ac tion was not vexatious or oppressive to the plaintiffs. In that c ase, the Court of Appeal stated at [28] and [29]: 

 28 In Evergreen International SA v Volkswagen Group Singapore Pte Ltd [2004] 2 SLR(R) 457 (" Evergreen International SA "), Belinda Ang Saw Ean J ("Ang J") stated that she had to c onsider t he following elements in determining whether an anti-suit injunc tion ought to be granted in the c ase (at [16]): 

 (a) whether the defendants are amenable to the jurisdic tion of the Singapore c ourt; 

 (b) the natural forum for resolution of the dispute between the parties; 

 (c ) the alleged vexation or oppression to the plaintiffs if the foreign proc eedings are to 


 c ontinue; and 

 (d) the alleged injustic e to the defendants as an injunc tion would deprive the defendants of the advantages sought in the foreign proc eedings. 

 29 In our view, this is as good a list as any with only one qualific ation, whic h would c onstitute a fifth element whether the institution of the foreign proc eedings is in breac h of any agreement between the parties (see South Carolina Insurance Co v Assurantie Maatschappij "De Zeven Provincien" NV [1987] AC 24). Where there is suc h an agreement, the c ourt may not feel diffident about granting an anti-suit injunc tion as it would only be enforc ing a c ontrac tual promise and the question of international c omity is not as relevant (see The Angelic Grace [1995] 1 Lloyd's Rep 87 at 96 and WSG Nimbus Pte Ltd v Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka [2002] 1 SLR(R) 1088 at [91]). However, as far as the present c ase was c onc erned, this element did not c ome into play as there was no suc h agreement between the parties. That said, we will now examined eac h of these elements in relation to the fac ts and c irc umstanc es of the present c ase, although one c ould say that the third and fourth elements are really quite c losely related, being two sides of the same c oin. 

41     In the present c ase, Mr Ashloc k had agreed under c l 14 not to pursue any future c laim against the first defendant and its affiliated c ompanies. This was a c onsequenc e of the full and final settlement of all his c laims (see [36] above). Moreover, the c ases whic h Mr Tan relied on were c ases in whic h the c ourt was asked to grant an interloc utory anti-suit injunc tion to restrain a party from proc eeding with a foreign ac tion pending the outc ome of the proc eedings in the jurisdic tion from whic h the injunc tion was sought. In the c ase before me, the plaintiffs were not seeking an interloc utory anti-suit injunc tion but a permanent one on the premise that the c ourt would be able to and would make a finding in their favour on the interpretation of c l 14. 

42     I agreed with Mr Yeo that if I were to interpret c l 14 in the plaintiffs’ favour, then an anti-suit injunc tion ought, generally speaking, to be granted to enforc e my ruling sinc e Mr Ashloc k had submitted to the jurisdic tion of the Singapore c ourts. Indeed he is c urrently working in Singapore. The general rule is subjec t to Mr Ashloc k showing a spec ial or exc eptional reason why the injunc tion should not be granted. No suc h reason was shown. All Mr Tan c ould say was that the Americ an Ac tion was at an advanc ed stage but that was no reason to allow Mr Ashloc k to c ontinue with it onc e a final ruling was given by a c ompetent c ourt whose jurisdic tion he had submitted to. In the light of my ruling on the interpretation of c l 14, the Americ an Ac tion against the plaintiffs was both in breac h of c l 14 and vexatious and oppressive. 

43     In the c irc umstanc es, I made the dec larations sought in prayers 1 and 2 and granted the antisuit injunc tion sought in prayer 4. I did not grant prayer 3 for Mr Ashloc k to pay damages to be assessed bec ause the Americ an Ac tion had not c aused any damage to the plaintiffs, leaving aside the question of c osts. I was also of the view that any c osts inc urred by the sec ond, third or fourth plaintiffs (or by any other plaintiff ) in respec t of the Americ an Ac tion ought to be dealt with by the US Distric t Court and so I did not deal with suc h c osts. However, I did order Mr Ashloc k to pay the c osts of the plaintiffs in respec t of the Singapore Ac tion whic h I fixed at $15,000. I also made it c lear that my dec ision did not prec lude Mr Ashloc k from c ontinuing with the Americ an Ac tion against Mr Slone.
