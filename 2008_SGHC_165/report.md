Belinda Ang Saw Ean J: 

1       The substanc e of the plaintiffs’ c laim in this ac tion against the defendants is on unlawful c onspirac y against the plaintiffs, Wing Hak Man (“Wing”) and Yiu Ching (“Yiu”). The first defendant, Bio-Treat Tec hnology Limited (“Bio-Treat”), applied for a stay of the present proc eedings on the basis of _forum non conveniens_. On 9 January 2008, the Assistant Registrar allowed Bio-Treat’s applic ation, and c onsequently ordered a stay of all further proc eedings in this ac tion against Bio-Treat. The plaintiffs appealed against the stay order. The appeal was later dismissed for the reasons published in this Grounds of Dec ision. 

2       Separately, the sec ond and fourth defendants also applied to stay the proc eedings by way of: (a) Summons No 94 of 2008 whic h was filed on 9 January 2008 on behalf of the sec ond defendant, Jerry Yip Wai Leung (“D2”), an independent direc tor of Bio-Treat, and (b) Summons No 280 of 2008 whic h was filed on 21 January 2008 on behalf of the fourth defendant, Kwok ChiShing (“D4”), an independent direc tor of Bio-Treat. In these Summonses, D2 and D4 also applied for time extensions to file and serve their respec tive defenc es. For c onvenienc e, both Summonses are hereinafter referred to c ollec tively as “the stay applic ations”. On 9 January 2008, Bio-Treat’s lawyers, Drew & Napier LLC (“Drew & Napier”) c alled upon D2 to file his defenc e within 48 hours failing whic h default judgment would be obtained against him. D2 filed his Defenc e on 11 January 2008. 

3       Both stay applic ations were listed for hearing on the same morning as the plaintiffs’ appeal in RA 11 of 2008. Summons No 94 of 2008 was filed late in c ontravention of O 12 r 7 (2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”). After taking into c onsideration the overall fac ts and c irc umstanc es of the c ase, in exerc ise of the c ourt’s disc retion, leave was granted to file Summons No 94 of 2008 out of time (see [53] to [57] below). I allowed the stay applic ations and ordered a stay of all further proc eedings in the ac tion against D2 and D4. Costs orders were made in favour of Bio-Treat, D2 and D4 respec tively. 


**Background facts** 

4       Wing is the founder of Bio-Treat. Wing was the Exec utive Chairman, the NonExec utive Chairman as well as the Exec utive Direc tor of Bio-Treat until Oc tober 2006. Wing was also the sole owner of Fullway Group Limited (“Fullway”), a c ompany inc orporated in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”). Fullway was the c orporate vehic le used by Wing to hold 289,050,000 (37.39%) ordinary shares in Bio-Treat. Yiu is Wing’s wife. She was the sole owner of Star Choic e International Limited (“Star Choic e”), a c ompany inc orporated in the BVI whic h Yiu used to hold 39,808,000 (5.15%) ordinary shares in Bio-Treat. 

5       Bio Treat is a c ompany inc orporated in Bermuda on 22 August 2003. On 16 February 2004, the c ompany was listed on the Main Board of the Singapore Stoc k Exc hange Sec urities Trading Limited and its shares were and are still traded in Singapore. The business and operations of the c ompany, however, are wholly in People’s Republic of China. Bio-Treat has desc ribed itself as one of China’s leading c ompanies in the development and applic ation of biotec hnology for the treatment of waste and wastewater. Ac c ording to the Statement of Claim, Bio-Treat is managed from its offic e in Hong Kong Spec ial Administrative Region (“Hong Kong”) by the other three defendants. At all material times, Wing was based in Bio-Treat’s Shanghai offic e. D2 was an independent direc tor of Bio-Treat. He was a member of the Nominating Committee as well as the Remuneration Committee of Bio-Treat until his resignation on 31 July 2007. He is a lawyer by profession. D4 is an independent direc tor of Bio-Treat. Kwok, who is an ac c ountant, is the present Chairman of the Audit Committee of Bio-Treat. He is also a member of the Nominating and Remuneration Committees of Bio-Treat. For c ompleteness, I should mention that at the time of the hearing of the plaintiffs’ appeal and the stay applic ations, the third defendant, Dennis Chan Kong (“D3”), had not been served with legal proc ess. D3 is the Chief Exec utive Offic er and Exec utive Direc tor of Bio-Treat. He was appointed a member of the Remuneration Committee on or about June 2006. 

**The claim in conspiracy by unlawful means against the defendants** 

6       This c ase is quite c learly pleaded as an unlawful means c onspirac y. The foundation of the c onspirac y c laim is that the defendants c onspired to injure the plaintiffs by the unlawful means of fraudulent misrepresentations and those misrepresentations c aused them damage. It was alleged that Wing was fraudulently misled and induc ed into signing doc uments purportedly to set up the Wing Family Trust. Relianc e was also plac ed on other spec ific c ategories of unlawful ac ts pleaded in paragraphs 12 and 21 of the Statement of Claim. They inc lude: (i) the inc orporation of a web of BVI c ompanies as the means and c onduit for the fraudulent transfer and/or divestments of the plaintiffs’ shares in Bio-Treat held through Fullway and Star Choic e; (ii) the allegation that the defendants wrongfully and dishonestly wrested c ontrol of the plaintiffs’ shares in Bio-Treat by fraudulently transferring them to other BVI c ompanies and then selling them and/or fraudulently transferring the shares first in the open market on or about 19 September 2007 and then to Dongguan Baosheng Environmental Investment Co Ltd (“Dongguan Baosheng”) through Prec ious Wise Group Limited on or about 28 September 2007; (iii) the allegation that the defendants c onspired to and did lodge false and/or misleading announc ements on the Singapore Stoc k Exc hange (“SGX”) to mislead the general public as to the state of affairs of Bio-Treat; (iv) the allegation that the defendants fraudulently induc ed Wing to “sell” some of his shares in Bio-Treat to pay c ompensation to key employees affec ted by the c anc elled option programme; and (v) the allegation that the defendants fabric ated and/or orc hestrated Wing’s resignation as Exec utive Chairman, NonExec utive Chairman and Exec utive Direc tor of Bio-Treat to hamper or impede his ability to investigate the fraudulent share transfers. 

7       The aforementioned c ategories of unlawful ac ts are set out one by one in detail below (see [8] to [15]). Notably, the wrongdoings were pleaded as an ongoing overall c onspirac y that was joined by 


the various defendants at unspec ified times ranging between May 2005 and September 2007. Pausing at the alleged wrongdoings, by way of c omment, even though the plaintiffs may in a proper c ase sue, for example, Bio-Treat in its own c apac ity, the ac t in question will not serve as “unlawful means” for the tort of c onspirac y unless the plaintiffs c an demonstrate that the individual ac t was performed in c onc ert. In other words, whilst a party may join in the exec ution of the c onspirac y at a different time and may not be exac tly aware of what the other c onspirators have ac tually agreed to do, to be liable for the tort of c onspirac y, the party in question, nonetheless, must be suffic iently aware of the surrounding c irc umstanc es and share the same objec tive as the others (see _OCM Opportunities Fund II, LP and others v Burhan Uray (alias Wong Ming Kong) and Others_ <span class="citation">[2004] SGHC 115</span> at [49] (“ _OCM Opportunities_ ”)). In the present c ase, the shared objec tive was to deprive the plaintiffs of their shares in Bio-Treat and the proc eeds from any related sale of the shares. The loss to the plaintiffs was stated to be in exc ess of S$400 million. 

8       I begin with the misrepresentations made by D2. The c laim against the defendants stemmed from the setting up of a trust known as the Wing Family Trust. The trustee of the Wing Family Trust is a New Zealand c ompany c alled Wing Enterprise Trustee Company Limited. It was alleged that the defendants fraudulently inc orporated the trustee c ompany without the plaintiffs’ c onsent or agreement. The unlawful means was the making of false representations to Wing in the following c irc umstanc es. On or about May 2005, D2 raised to Wing the idea of setting up a family trust whic h would hold the plaintiffs’ shares in Bio-Treat for Wing and his family. On or about 7 May 2005, at the Dynasty Club in Wanc hai, Hong Kong, Wing signed the doc uments required to set up the trust relying on D2, and one Tan Siok Chin, who was then Bio-Treat’s c ompany sec retary, to translate and interpret the relevant doc uments. He did as he was told and signed at the plac es indic ated in the doc uments. On or about 27 Oc tober 2006, Wing apparently learned that the Wing Family Trust was set up from an SGX announc ement dated 9 May 2005. The news must have been shoc king as D2 had allegedly represented to Wing that Yiu’s signature was required for the exec ution of the doc uments setting up the trust and Wing had not informed Yiu about the trust as he knew she would be against the idea. On her part, Yiu c laimed that she did not sign any doc uments relating to the Wing Family Trust. 

9       Pursuant to the Wing Family Trust, Wing purportedly gave up the entire issued c apital of Fullway, c omprising one ordinary share, to Energy Castle Limited, a BVI c ompany. Similarly, Yiu purportedly gave up the entire share c apital of Star Choic e, c omprising one ordinary share, to Herofaith Limited. However, the shares in Bio-Treat remained registered in the names of Fullway and Star Choic e. Pausing here at the transfers, it is the plaintiffs’ c ase that Yiu’s signature on the doc uments were forged or tampered with, and/or alternatively, the defendants had fraudulently misled Wing into believing that both his and his wife’s signatures were required for the trust to be set up. Wing c laimed that his signature on the Notic e of a Substantial Shareholder’s Interests/Change in Interests/Cessation of Interests dated 7 May 2005 (“the Notic e of 7 May 2005”) was forged and/or tampered with. Returning to the ownership c hange, this c hange c oupled with the setting up of the Wing Family Trust led to the following results. Wing Enterprise Trustee Company Limited holds 100% of all the shares in Key Advanc e Limited, a BVI c ompany, whic h in turn now holds 100% of the shares in the c apital of Energy Castle Limited and Herofaith Limited. Energy Castle Limited holds 100% of all shares in the c apital of Fullway while Herofaith Limited holds 100% of all shares in the c apital of Star Choic e. To reiterate, it is the plaintiffs’ c ase that the Wing Family Trust and the BVI c orporate entities like Energy Castle Limited, Herofaith Limited and Key Advanc e Limited were used to fac ilitate the fraudulent transfer of the plaintiffs’ shares in Bio-Treat, and to take c ontrol of the plaintiffs’ shares and finally to dishonestly benefit from the proc eeds of any sale and/or divestment of the shares at will. 

10     Moving on to D4’s role in the alleged c onspirac y, it is the plaintiffs’ pleaded c ase that “due to 

 [note: 1] 

 [note: 2] 

 [note: 3] 

 [note: 4] 


[Kwok’s] involvement in the web of c ompanies, [Kwok] plays a major role in the Conspirac y.” Of signific anc e is his c onnec tion with the c orporate direc tors of Fullway and Star Choic e who are Intersmart Profits Limited and Winning Faith Limited. The plaintiffs’ plea against D4 is that he is a direc tor and shareholder of Lam, Kwok, Kwan & Cheng CPA Limited whic h is the holding c ompany of the c orporate direc tors. It is also their pleaded c ase that D2’s firm J Chan, Yip, So & Partners ac ted as c ompany sec retary to some of the BVI entities inc luding Fullway and Star Choic e “in order to fac ilitate the fraudulent transfers”. 

11     This leads me to the SGX announc ements. The plaintiffs’ plea in the Statement of Claim is that D3 was responsible for the SGX’s public announc ements (inc luding the false and misleading ones) and it was D3 who partic ipated in the c onspirac y by lodging the inac c urate and misleading SGX announc ements on the fraudulent share transfers. Spec ific ally against Bio-Treat, the plaintiffs’ c ontention is that the announc ements and notic es submitted by the c ompany were fraudulent bec ause the alleged share transfers never took plac e. The SGX announc ement of 9 May 2005 to announc e the plaintiffs’ purported transfers of shares in Bio-Treat from Fullway and Star Choic e to Energy Castle Limited and Herofaith Limited respec tively was “a guise to mask the transfer of shares with c redibility”. 

12     The next unlawful ac t in the c onspirac y to defraud the plaintiffs was the sale of the shares in September and Oc tober 2007. On 19 September 2007, Fullway sold 10,451,754 shares in Bio-Treat in the open market at an average pric e of SGD 0.8685. Notic e of the sale was given by the c orporate direc tors of Fullway in a letter dated 20 September 2007 to Bio-Treat at its offic e in Hong Kong. Notably, Fullway’s letter of 20 September 2007 was signed by two direc tors of Intersmart Profits Limited, Tang Ming and Cheng Dong Long who are based in China. With the sale, Fullway’s shareholding dropped to 29.6% of the share c apital in Bio-Treat. That led to the issuanc e of the Notic e of Change in Substantial Shareholding Interest dated 20 September 2007 whic h was signed by Tang Ming on behalf of Intersmart Profits Limited and Cheng Dong Long on behalf of Winning Faith Limited. The SGX announc ement of 21 September 2007 was lodged by D3 on behalf of Bio-Treat. 

13     A further sale of 262,523,436 shares in Bio-Treat (representing 29.6%) was made by Key Advanc e Limited to Prec ious Wise Group Limited through its ac quisition of all the shares in Energy Castle Limited. This ac quisition by Prec ious Wise Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dongguan Baosheng gave the latter an indirec t interest in the 262,523,426 shares. The SGX announc ement relating to this ac quisition was lodged by D3 in Oc tober 2007. 

14     In relation to Wing’s sale of 50 million shares to purportedly c ompensate the key employees affec ted by the c anc elled option programme whic h was announc ed on 22 Dec ember 2005, the pleaded c ase is that as part of the c onspirac y, the defendants induc ed Wing to “sell” 50 million shares in BioTreat by falsely representing to Wing that he would rec eive part of the sale proc eeds from the sale of the shares. The c onspirac y as alleged was to defraud Wing of the proc eeds of the sale of the shares. On 16 January 2006, D3 made an SGX announc ement and issued a press release whic h announc ed Wing’s sale of 50 million shares and the distribution of part of the proc eeds to c ompensate key employees. Wing c laimed that he did not rec eive any part of the sale proc eeds, and the key employees had also denied rec eiving any c ompensation. It was alleged that D2 and D4 were or must have been the intended benefic iaries of the alleged c ompensation from the sale proc eeds. 

15     Finally, as for Wing’s purported resignations, Wing c laimed that he did not agree to relinquish his positions and maintained that his purported resignations as Exec utive Chairman, NonExec utive Chairman and Exec utive Direc tor of Bio-Treat were fabric ated and/or orc hestrated to impede his ability to detec t and/or investigate the fraud and/or c onspirac y perpetrated against him. There were two SGX announc ements on these matters. The first was dated 10 February 2006 and it 

 [note: 4] 

 [note: 5] 

 [note: 6] 

 [note: 7] 

 [note: 8] 


stated that Wing had relinquished his positions as Exec utive Chairman and Exec utive Direc tor with effec t from 10 February 2006. A further SGX announc ement on 11 Oc tober 2006 related to Wing’s retirement as NonExec utive Chairman. Wing said that his letter of resignation as direc tor of Bio-Treat was a forgery. He saw that letter on 27 Oc tober 2006 at the offic e of FMG Corporate Servic es Pte Ltd (“FMG”), the c ompany sec retary of Bio-Treat. 

**Stay Applications** 

16     I begin with some general observations. First, the parties named two jurisdic tions, Singapore or Hong Kong, as the _forum conveniens_ for the resolution of the plaintiffs’ c laims against the defendants. Sec ond, the relevant substantive law is in all likelihood the same in both jurisdic tions. There was no meaningful debate to the c ontrary. Third, the arguments mainly foc used on Stage One of the test in _Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd_ [1987] AC 460 (“ _Spiliada_ ”). The plaintiffs had not by way of affidavit evidenc e sought or identified some proc edural or other legitimate advantage to be found in one jurisdic tion but not the other. For c ompleteness, I should mention that after the hearing on 7 Marc h 2008, c ounsel for the plaintiffs, Mr Adrian Tan, in his letter dated 17 Marc h 2008 sought to introduc e fac tors to satisfy Stage Two of the _Spiliada_ test. Princ ipally, Mr Tan c ontended that the dispute c entres on the partic ular proc edures and regulations governing the Singapore investment market and for that reason, he submitted, the ends of justic e require that the c ourt dismisses the stay applic ations. Elaborating, he argued that the fraudulent notic es and announc ements targeted the Singapore investor. Shareholders and investors would have been affec ted by those fraudulent notic es and announc ements as a false market was c reated. Mr Tan also surmised that Bio-Treat’s reason for resisting proc eedings in Singapore was to avoid prosec ution under the Sec urities and Futures Ac t (Cap 289, Rev Ed 2006), if the plaintiffs’ c ase was proved. Mr Tan’s arguments are tenuous and unc onvinc ing. Counsel for Bio-Treat, Mr Edwin Tong, rightly submitted that none of the points advanc ed in Mr Tan’s letter are supported by affidavit evidenc e. Not only are the provisions of the legislation referred to separate and distinc t from the c ivil c laims here, it is hard to imagine how the defendants would be able to avoid prosec ution under the Sec urities and Futures Ac t by simply moving the litigation to Hong Kong. Lastly, in relation to the stay applic ations, it is also not disputed that the legal burden is on the defendants to satisfy the c ourt that Singapore is not the natural or appropriate forum and that Hong Kong is the more appropriate forum for the trial of the ac tion. 

**_Applying the Spiliada test Stage One_** 

17     The main fac tors that are relevant to this c ase at the first stage of the _Spiliada_ test inc lude the following (see _Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull_ <span class="citation">[2007] 1 SLR 377</span> at 15 (“ _Rickshaw Investments_ ”) : 

 (i) general c onnec ting fac tors; 

 (ii) the jurisdic tion in whic h the tort oc c urred; 

 (iii) the c hoic e of law; and 

 (iv) c onc urrent proc eedings in another forum. 

_(i) General connecting factors_ 

18     Bio-Treat is a c ompany inc orporated in Bermuda but its registered offic e is in Hong Kong. Although the shares of Bio-Treat are listed in Singapore, it has no offic e or operations in Singapore. 

[note: 9] 


As stated, its business and operations are in China. It is ac c epted that at all material times, D2 to D were in c harge of the Hong Kong offic e whic h is responsible for the day-to-day management of BioTreat. Lau Cheuk Lun (“Lau”), the Chief Financ ial Offic er and Company Sec retary of Bio-treat deposed in his affidavit that, at all material times, all meetings of the Broad of Direc tors of Bio-Treat, Audit Committee, the Nominating Committee and the Remuneration Committee were held in Hong Kong and, oc c asionally, in China. 

19     For the defendants, it was further pointed out that the plaintiffs are holders of Hong Kong passports and are resident in Shanghai. D2 to D4 are also holders of Hong Kong passports and are based in Hong Kong. Lau rec onfirmed two things: First, the two Singaporean independent direc tors of Bio-Treat, Mr Lim Yu Neng and Ms Cheng Fong Yee, were appointed muc h later on 31 July 2007 after the alleged c onspirac y. Sec ond, the share transfer agent of Bio-Treat’s share registrar, the Bank of Bermuda Limited in Bermuda, had no management responsibilities whic h remained with D2 to D4 in Hong Kong. The share transfer agent was Boardroom Corporate & Advisory Servic es Pte Ltd (formerly known as Lim Assoc iates (Pte) Ltd) (“Boardroom”). Ac c ording to Lau, Boardroom ac ts on the instruc tions of Bio-Treat and its administrative responsibilities are princ ipally: 

 (i) Keeping rec ord of the ownership of the shares of Bio-Treat; 

 (ii) Issuing and c anc elling share c ertific ates of Bio-Treat to reflec t c hanges in ownership; and 

 (iii) Proc essing lost, destroyed or stolen c ertific ates. 

20     In addition, the c orporate c ompany sec retaries appointed from time to time by Bio-Treat, namely FMG and Tric or Singapore Pte Ltd (“Tric or”), assisted the c ompany in relation to c orporate matters suc h as filing Bio-Treat’s audited ac c ounts; preparing and fac ilitating Bio-Treat’s Annual General Meeting; maintaining and updating Bio-Treat’s statutory rec ords and fac ilitating Bio-Treat’s announc ements in relation to, _inter alia_ , c hange of direc tors, auditors and c ompany sec retaries. Lau deposed that notic es of substantial shareholder’s and/or direc tors’ interests in Bio-Treat’s sec urities or c hanges of interests were rec eived in the Hong Kong offic e. This makes sense as BioTreat has no offic es in Singapore. Ac c ording to Lau, after rec eipt of the notic es, Bio-Treat would make the SGX announc ements whic h were either prepared by the Hong Kong offic e or the share transfer agents. The announc ements made by Bio-Treat on SGXNET inc luded the announc ements made on 9 May 2005, 16 January 2006, 21 September 2007, 1 Oc tober 2007 and 10 Oc tober 2007. Attac hed to the SGX announc ements were press releases issued under Bio-Treat’s letterhead with its address in Dongguan City, Guangdong Provinc e, China. 

21     It is also noteworthy that Fullway and Star Choic e are BVI c ompanies with a c are of address in Hong Kong, namely 1502, Wing On House, 71 Des Voeux Road, Central, Hong Kong. The c orporate direc tors of Fullway and Star Choic e are Intersmart Profits Limited and Winning Faith Limited. The holding c ompany of the c orporate direc tors is Lam, Kwok, Kwan & Cheng CPA Limited and it is loc ated in Hong Kong. D2’s law firm in Hong Kong is J Chan, Yip So & Partners and it allegedly ac ted as c ompany sec retary to Fullway, Star Choic e and some BVI c ompanies. 

22     On the opposite end of the sc ale, are other fac tors whic h Mr Tan drew attention to in support of his submissions that Singapore is the forum with whic h this ac tion has the most natural c onnec tion. They are: 

 (a) Bio-Treat’s disc losure obligations are governed by Singapore law and regulated by the SGX. 

 (b) All the ac c ounts and rec ords relating to the shareholding of Bio-Treat are kept in Singapore 

 [note: 10] 

[note: 11] 

 [note: 12] 

 [note: 13] 


 as its c ompany sec retaries, share transfer agent and branc h register are in Singapore. Doc uments divesting Wing of his c ontrol of Bio-Treat were filed in Singapore. 

 (c ) All Annual General Meetings were c onvened in Singapore. At the Annual General Meeting held on 30 Oc tober 2006, D2 and D3 as direc tors of Bio-Treat announc ed that Wing was no longer the c ompany’s c hairman as he had not attended any c ompany meetings in 2006. 

 (d) Singapore law governs the transfer of the shares. 

23     In my judgment, the Singapore c onnec tions highlighted by Mr Tan are not c ompelling given the nature of the dispute. I will deal with the governing law of the transfer separately (see [36] to [37] below). As I see it, the only fac tor of any relevant c onnec tion to Singapore is that the shares in BioTreat are listed in Singapore and the regulatory paper work to c omply with the Listing Manual is done in Singapore. Signific antly, the fac tors with a Hong Kong c onnec tion outweigh the Singapore fac tors on c onvenienc e. Amongst the c onnec ting fac tors in favour of Hong Kong is the loc ation of witnesses whic h I will c ome to shortly (see [39] to [43] below). 

_(ii) Natural forum: Singapore or Hong Kong_ 

24     The main foc us under Stage One was the issue of the loc ation of the c onspirac y. It is c ommon ground that the plac e of the tort is _prima facie_ the natural forum for determining the c laim. Goff LJ in _The Albaforth_ [1984] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 91 at [96] observed: 

 Now it follows from those dec isions that, where it is held that a c ourt has jurisdic tion on the basis that an alleged tort has been c ommitted within the jurisdic tion of the c ourt, the test whic h has been satisfied in order to reac h that c onc lusion is one founded on the basis that the c ourt, so having jurisdic tion, is the most appropriate c ourt to try the c laim where it is manifestly just and reasonable that the defendant should answer for his wrongdoing. This being so, it must usually be diffic ult in any partic ular c ase to resist the c onc lusion that a c ourt whic h has jurisdic tion on that basis must also be the natural forum for the trial of the ac tion. If the substanc e of an alleged tort is c ommitted within a c ertain jurisdic tion, it is not easy to imagine what other fac ts c ould displac e the c onc lusion that the c ourts of that jurisdic tion are the natural forum. 

25     The _Albaforth_ princ iple is well established and was rec ently approved and followed by the Court of Appeal in _Rickshaw Investments_. From the point of view of Stage One, Andrew Phang JA at [40] observed: 

 However, we must emphasise that the result that is arrived at through the applic ation of the Albaforth princ iple is only the prima fac ie position and/or a weighty fac tor pointing in favour of that jurisdic tion....[B]ut this is only one of the fac tors to be taken into ac c ount in the overall analysis, albeit a signific ant one. 

26     It must be remembered that this is a multi-party and multi-jurisdic tion c ase. From the point of view of _forum conveniens_ in relation to the question of whether the unlawful transac tions pleaded involved, a c onspirac y, the task at hand is to find the one single plac e where the whole c onspirac y c ould be regarded as having been c ommitted in substanc e. This is known as the “substanc e of the tort” test and, as to how this test is to be applied in the light of the plaintiffs’ pleaded c ase, Mr Tong referred to the c ase of _Metall und Rohstoff AG v Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Inc_ [1990] 1 QB 391 (whic h was overruled in _Lonrho Plc v Fayed_ [1992] 1 AC 448 on other aspec ts). The test requires the c ourt, in dec iding where the alleged c onspirac y took plac e, to “look bac k over the series of events” c onstituting the elements of the tort and ask where in substanc e did the c ause of ac tion arise. 


Mr Tong submitted that applying the “substanc e of the tort” test, the alleged tort of c onspirac y oc c urred in Hong Kong based on the plaintiffs’ pleaded c ase. 

27     It seems to me that the question in eac h c ase must be to asc ertain what the true objec t of the agreement entered into by the c onspirators was. In that c onnec tion, one must look to the ac tual c onduc t whic h was c ontemplated by the c onspirators. Manc e J in _Grupo Torras SA & Anor v Al-Sabah & Ors_ [1999] CLC 1469 at 169 helpfully identified some of the fac tors the c ourt takes into c onsideration in the substanc e of the tort test. They inc lude the identity, importanc e and loc ation of the c onspirators, the plac e(s) of any agreement or c ombination, the nature and plac e(s) of the c onc erted ac tion, the nature and plac e(s) of any unlawful ac t or means, the plaintiff(s)’ loc ation and the plac e(s) where he or it suffered loss. 

28     Mr Tong approac hed Stage One by drawing out the likely issues in the plaintiffs’ own pleaded c ase whic h he argued pointed to a c onspirac y in Hong Kong. Counsel for D2, Mr Devinder K Rai, and c ounsel for D4, Mr Rajendran Kumaresan agreed and adopted the reasons advanc ed by Mr Tong in support of the c ontention that the natural forum for determination of the dispute with the plaintiffs is Hong Kong and not Singapore. The main reasons are as follows. First, the disc ussions to set up the Wing Family trust were held and the doc uments purportedly for that purpose were exec uted in Hong Kong. Both events took plac e on or about 7 May 2005. Sec ond, the evidenc e in relation to the c onspirac y, if there was a c onspirac y at all, would be mainly ac quired from individuals and entities in Hong Kong. Mr Tong explained that the various announc ements on the SGX were lodged by Bio-Treat in c omplianc e with the Listing Manual and they were not overt ac ts pursuant to the c onspirac y as alleged by the plaintiffs. As suc h, Bio-Treat’s SGX announc ements in Singapore had nothing to do with its role as a c onspirator. In support of his submissions, Mr Tong explained that based on the plaintiffs’ pleaded c ase, the alleged c onspirac y took plac e on or about 7 May 2005. Like everything else that happened after that date, the SGX announc ement of 9 May 2005 was a c onsequenc e or outc ome of the alleged c onspirac y. It related to the c hange in the shareholder’s interest in Fullway and Star Choic e. 

29     In response, Mr Tan submitted that there is no way for the c ourt to establish when the c onspirac y was hatc hed. The various transac tions identified in [8] to [15] were advanc ed as overt ac ts c arrying out the c onspirac y and from whic h the c ourt is invited to infer agreement. He relied upon the following matters that took plac e in Singapore: 

 (a) Share sc rips had to be physic ally delivered to the Central Depository Pte Ltd (“CDP”) in Singapore ac c ording to the CDP rules; 

 (b) Notic e(s) of c hange in shareholding were lodged with SGX in Singapore; and 

 (c ) Fraudulent announc ements were made with SGX in Singapore. 

30     The entire c onspirac y, Mr Tan argued, was made up of a series of ac ts whic h inc luded the c ontinuing ac ts involving the SGX announc ements. The princ ipal ac ts c ommitted by the defendants were at various times, namely on or around 7 May 2005, 19 September 2007 and 28 September 2007. The SGX announc ements in Singapore were part of the c onspirac y that inc luded the making of false announc ements on the SGX to mislead the general public as to the state of affairs of Bio-Treat. Wing c laimed that muc h of the c onspirac y in Singapore was “unc overed in Singapore vide the SGX announc ements” that were lodged on behalf of Bio-Treat. Mr Tan c onc luded that the tort was c ommitted in Singapore as the bulk of the overt ac ts of c onspirac y whic h c aused the harm took plac e in Singapore. 

[note: 14] 


31     Mr Tan’s arguments are, on balanc e, not persuasive having regard to other matters. First and signific antly, Mr Tan’s c onc lusion that Singapore was the plac e where the bulk of the overt ac ts whic h c aused the harm took plac e c ontradic ted Wing’s first affidavit filed on 20 January 2007 in support of the plaintiffs’ applic ation to serve the Writ of Summons on D2 in Hong Kong. In his affidavit, Wing ac knowledged that only a part of the c onspirac y was c ommitted in Singapore, that is to say “the false and/or misleading announc ements on SGX in Singapore to mislead the general public 

as to the state of affairs of the 1st Defendant”. Mr Tong reminded the c ourt that the plaintiffs’ own c ase asserts that their shareholding in Fullway and Star Choic e were allegedly misappropriated at the time the relevant share transfers were effec ted on or about 7 May 2005 pursuant to the Wing Family Trust arrangements. Logic ally, the c hange of shareholders of the BVI c ompanies, ( _ie_ Fullway to Energy Castle Limited and Star Choic e to Herofaith Limited), would have oc c urred before the Notic e of May 2005. If that was the c ase (and the c ourt adjudic ating the tort has to resolve it), the SGX announc ement of 9 May 2005 would have no part in proc uring an event whic h was already in the past. As it was argued, the SGX announc ements would be in c omplianc e with the SGX regulations and were not overt ac ts from whic h the c ourt is invited to infer agreement. 

32     Sec ond, as Mr Tong rightly c ontended, the allegation of fraud on the CDP ac c ount must be disc ounted as it was not an averment in the Statement of Claim. The pleadings made no referenc e to the CDP, and there was no plea of fraud on the CDP during the delivery of the physic al share sc rip. 

33     With the fac tors referred to by Manc e J in _Grupo Torras SA & Anor v Al-Sabah & Ors_ at 169 ( see [27] above) in mind, the one single plac e where the whole c onspirac y c ould be regarded as having been c ommitted in substanc e, in my view, is Hong Kong. The heart of the alleged dec eption of the plaintiffs, if dec eption there was, must have taken plac e in Hong Kong. It was the plac e where D to D4 were all resident and is where for the most part they c arried out their duties in c onnec tion with Bio-Treat’s Hong Kong offic e. It was the plac e where D2 through his law firm and D4 through his ac c ounting firm had apparently enabled the shareholding of the BVI c ompanies to c hange. 

34     The objec tive of the c onspirac y (if there was a c onspirac y at all) was to unlawfully deprive the plaintiffs of their benefic ial ownership of the shares in Bio-Treat. This c ould only be ac c omplished by means of misrepresentations to Wing as to the purpose of the Wing Family Trust and the requirements for setting up the trust. Suc h misrepresentations induc ed Wing and his wife to set up the trust in c irc umstanc es where no suc h trust would otherwise have been set up. Relianc e, being the most signific ant element of the misrepresentation, was plac ed on the misrepresentations in Hong Kong. It was said that Wing would not have signed the papers had the truth been told. If anything, the c ommon objec tive was pursued by providing doc uments to sign in Hong Kong. That had to be the mec hanism for afflic ting harm bec ause the establishment of the Wing Family Trust had enabled Wing’s shareholding in Fullway to c hange to the ownership of Energy Castle Limited. I understand that Wing has alleged that his signature on the Notic e of 7 May 2005 that advised the c hange of interest in relation to Fullway and Star Choic e to Energy Castle Limited and Herofaith Limited pursuant to the Wing Family Trust was a forgery as he did not sign it 

35     The desirability of a single trial taking plac e in Hong Kong is that the c ase of c onspirac y against Bio-Treat, if suc h it was, c an be fully determined there together with D2 and D4, bearing in mind the pleaded c ase that D2 to D4 were the operating minds in the management of Bio-Treat through their designations, involvement and/or c ontrol of various key c ommittees in Bio-Treat. 

_(iii) Choice of Law_ 

36     Mr Tan relied upon _International Credit & Investment Co (Overseas) Ltd and Another v Adham and others_ [1994] 1 BCLC 66 for the proposition that where shares are c onc erned, the plac e in whic h 


the shares are situated will determine the applic able law. He argued that Singapore law is the applic able law as the shares that were taken away from the plaintiffs were the shares of a c ompany listed and traded in Singapore. Mr Tan also c ited _Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern_ <span class="citation">[1995] 3 SLR 97</span> in support of the stay appeal. That c ase c onc erned an applic ation for stay of proc eedings on the ground that c laims relating to shares in the Malaysian c ompanies and land were situated in Malaysia. The plaintiffs relied on this c ase for the proposition that the Court of Appeal had said that the question whether the appellant would have c ommitted a breac h of Malaysian c ompany law and also breac h of the listing requirements of the Kuala Lumpur Stoc k Exc hange was for the Malaysian c ourts to dec ide. Likewise, Mr Tan argued that should the plaintiffs suc c eed in their c laims, an issue that would arise is whether Bio-Treat has c ommitted any breac h of the Singapore regulations and the listing requirements of the SGX, and this should be left to the Singapore c ourt to dec ide. 

37     As explained, this c ase is about false representations made in Hong Kong. Relianc e was plac ed on the representations in Hong Kong and loss was c aused there when Wing signed some doc uments that c hanged the shareholding in Fullway and Star Choic e. The applic able law in relation to the tort in question is the law of Hong Kong. The issues of c ompensation will be governed by the law of Hong Kong. I agreed with Mr Tong that _Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern_ is distinguishable on the fac ts. Mr Tong rightly pointed out that the relief that is sought in the Statement of Claim is to restore to the plaintiffs’ ownership of the shares in Fullway and Star Choic e, and that has to do with the BVI share registers of the respec tive BVI c ompanies and probably the c orporation laws of BVI, rather than Singapore law. As for the sale of the shares in September and Oc tober 2007, there is little information on the transac tions before the c ourt. Suffic e it to say that a c laim for damages is the only remedy by virtue of s 130J of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). The buyer’s title is unaffec ted and the 

party perpetrating the fraud has to pay damages (see _Walter Woon on Company Law_ , 3rd Edition, Sweet & Maxwell 2006 at para 15.41). On the pleaded fac ts as examined earlier, I did not c onsider the sale of the shares in September and Oc tober 2007 as c ompelling c onnec ting fac tors that dic tated a different c onc lusion in favour of Hong Kong. 

38     Another point advanc ed as a c hoic e of law question by Mr Tan in his written submissions was this: Would the Hong Kong Courts be able to rule and dec ide on issues relating to the Singapore Statutes and regulations and/or the Company’s obligations under Singapore laws and regulations? Mr Tong rightly submitted that Bio-Treat’s disc losure obligations are governed by Singapore law and regulated by the SGX but the disc losure obligations and SGX regulations are not the substantive issues in dispute. Besides, Mr Tong has not c hallenged any of the announc ements as the SGX announc ements were lodged in c omplianc e with the SGX listing obligations. 

_(iv) Witnesses and documents_ 

39     The list of potential witnesses was inc luded in Mr Tong’s written submissions. The witnesses for Bio-Treat, D2 and D4 are loc ated in Hong Kong and China. The plaintiffs themselves are holders of Hong Kong passports and resident in Shanghai. D2 to D4 are resident in Hong Kong. D2’s law firm J Chan, Yip So & Partners is in Hong Kong and it was c ompany sec retary to the BVI c ompanies. D4’s ac c ounting prac tic e of Lam Kwok Kwan & Cheng CPA Limited is based in Hong Kong. The two direc tors of Intersmart Profits Limited and Winning Faith Limited are Tang Ming and Chen Dong Long who are resident in China. Besides, the key employees involved in the c anc elled option programme are resident in China. Key Advanc e Limited, Energy Castle Limited and Herofaith Limited are BVI c ompanies. Prec ious Wise Group Limited and Dongguan Baosheng are based in China. On the issue of Wing’s resignations, Mr Tong explained that they were raised in the meetings of the board of direc tors and relevant c ommittees of the c ompany held mostly in Hong Kong or oc c asionally in China. Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of the attendees at the meetings of the board and c ommittee members and who are likely to give evidenc e on the disc ussions regarding Wing’s resignations are resident 


either in Hong Kong or China. 

40     Of the Singaporean witnesses, the plaintiffs have named Tan Siok Chin and Maureen Low. The plaintiffs ac knowledged that Tan Siok Chin has been c ooperative thus far and it was not suggested that she would c ease to be c ooperative. Tan Siok Chin’s name also appeared in Bio-Treat’s list of witnesses. As for c ompellability of a witness, this fac tor was c onsidered in Good Earth Agric ultural Co Ltd v Novus International Pte Ltd <span class="citation">[2008] 2 SLR 711</span> under Stage One. The c ompellability of Tan Siok Chin as a witness was raised by Mr Tan but it is a fac tor that affec ts both sides if the proc eedings are in Hong Kong. Maureen Low is from FMG and it was she who showed Wing his purported resignation letter as direc tor of Bio-Treat. That letter was faxed to Maureen Low on 27 Oc tober 2006 from Bio-Treat’s Hong Kong offic e. On the plaintiffs’ own c ase, the resignation letter and the forgery must have been done in Hong Kong. In any c ase, Wing’s resignation is not disputed by the defendants. The plaintiffs have not identified the members of the Inquiry Committee (“IC”) and the Independent Review Task Forc e (“IRTF”) and it is unc lear how their evidenc e would have a bearing on the pleaded c ase. Mr Tong said that, at the time the IC and the IRTF were c onvened to investigate the plaintiffs’ c laims, the shares of Fullway, Star Choic e and the shares of Bio-Treat were already transferred to third parties, and Wing was no longer a direc tor of the c ompany. Wing’s explanation was that the evidenc e of the IC was relevant as it c entres on Bio-Treat’s position, namely the IC had investigated Wing’s c laims and had dismissed them. Rightly or wrongly, their findings are separate and do not bind the c ourts. 

41     In the c irc umstanc es, in terms of expense and c onvenienc e for the purposes of c alling witnesses, Hong Kong is obviously the more c onvenient forum sinc e only two witnesses from Singapore need to travel to Hong Kong as c ompared to the larger number of people (inc luding the plaintiffs and Hong Kong defendants) that have to travel to Singapore. There is one other c onsideration whic h supports a stay and it is this. D2 and D4 as the direc tors of Bio-Treat are ac c ountable to the shareholders and it is likely that they will be testifying on behalf of Bio-Treat as well as in their own personal c apac ity. The presenc e of Bio-Treat in Singapore is a neutral fac tor. 

42     In relation to doc umentary evidenc e, the plaintiffs argued that most of the doc umentary evidenc e on the transfer of shares in Bio-Treat was in Singapore. The share transfer forms and the Notic es of Change in a Shareholders’ Interest are loc ated in Singapore bec ause the c orporate c ompany sec retaries appointed by Bio-Treat, namely FMG and Tric or, and share transfer agent are in Singapore and they will have rec ords of these doc uments. I did not attac h muc h weight to the plaintiffs’ c laim about Singapore being the more appropriate forum in terms of loc ation of doc uments. On the c ontrary, the material paper trail is most likely to be loc ated in Hong Kong. I ac c epted Mr Tong’s submissions that any information and/or doc uments in the possession of the Singapore c ompany sec retaries and the share transfer agent would be available from Bio-Treat’s offic e in Hong Kong. In the c ase of D2 to D4, doc uments in their possession are likely to be loc ated in Hong Kong. The doc umentary evidenc e inc luded doc uments signed and exec uted in Hong Kong in relation to the setting up of the Wing Family Trust; doc uments relating to the appointment of Intersmart Profits Limited and Winning Faith Limited as direc tors of Fullway and Star Choic e; doc uments relating to the relationship between J Chan, Yip, So & Partners and the BVI c orporate entities; and doc uments relating to the relationship between Lam, Kwok, Kwan & Cheng CPA Limited, Intersmart Profits Limited, Winning Faith Limited and/or any other relevant BVI c orporate entities. 

43     The plaintiffs in their further submissions dated 20 Marc h 2008 made referenc e to a report dated 7 Marc h 2009 whic h was prepared by the Health Sc ienc es Authority (“HSA”). In that report, HSA opined that the signature in a letter to Lim & Assoc iates sent by Star Choic e to arrange a share split of its shares in Bio-Treat was a forgery. That letter is dated 12 January 2005 and not 12 May 2005 as advised by Drew & Napier. How this January letter whic h is several months before the alleged 


fraudulent misrepresentation is relevant has not been explained nor has it been made an issue in the pleadings. 

_(v) Proceedings in China_ 

44     Bio-Treat referred to proc eedings in China against Wing whic h they said was another fac tor that pointed the dispute away from Singapore. The proc eedings in China related to the c essation of Wing’s duties and responsibilities as the direc tor and legal representative of one of Bio-Treat’s subsidiaries in China. Both sides have filed c onflic ting affidavits as to the c urrent status of the proc eedings in China. The disagreement c entred on whether the proc eedings c ommenc ed by BioTreat’s subsidiary against Wing have been withdrawn. I did not think the proc eedings in China c ounted as a fac tor under Stage One. The subjec t matter of the ac tion in Singapore is different save for one overlapping issue Wing’s resignations but then again his purported resignations were peripheral to and did not relate to the c ore of the alleged c onspirac y. 

45     In c onc lusion, the defendants’ submissions are muc h stronger, and upon an objec tive appraisal of the c onnec ting fac tors under Stage One, the balanc e c omes down firmly on the side of the defendants in favour of Hong Kong as the more appropriate forum for the determination of the plaintiffs’ c laim against the defendants. 

**_Stage Two_** 

46     As explained in [16] above, under Stage Two of the _Spiliada_ test, there are no c ompelling grounds for asserting that notwithstanding that Hong Kong is the _forum conveniens_ the interests of justic e require that the Singapore ac tion should not be stayed. 

**Defence filed by second defendant** 

47     The plaintiffs’ Writ of Summons was served out of jurisdic tion on D2 on 31 November 2007. D entered an appearanc e on 19 Dec ember 2007 and his defenc e was due on 8 January 2008. Before the due date, D2’s solic itors, Ac ies Law Corporation (“Ac ies”) wrote on 4 January 2008 requesting an extension of time of one week to file and serve D2’s defenc e. Drew & Napier replied on 7 January 2008 agreeing to the extension requested but stated that the indulgenc e did not extend to any interloc utory applic ation(s). Ac ies did not reply to Drew & Napier. D2 did not file his defenc e on the due date, _i.e._ 8 January 2008. 

48     However, the next day, D2 applied for a stay of all further proc eedings in Singapore on the ground of _forum non conveniens_. In the same applic ation, D2 asked that the time to file and serve D2’s defenc e be extended pending the final disposal of the stay applic ation. D2’s applic ation was fixed for hearing on 23 January 2008. 

49     On 9 January 2008, the Assistant Registrar allowed Bio-Treat’s applic ation and ordered a stay of further proc eedings against Bio-Treat. On the same day, Drew & Napier sent a 48-hour notic e to file and serve D2’s defenc e failing whic h the plaintiffs would obtain judgment against D2. On the same evening, Ac ies wrote to Drew & Napier as follows: 

1\. We refer to your fax of today’s date. 

2\. As you are aware, we have filed an applic ation for stay of proc eedings on the basis of _forum non conveniens_. In addition, we have filed an applic ation for extension of time to file the Defenc e pending the determination of the forum issue. 


3\. Further, you are also aware that the learned Assistant Registrar, Mr Teo Guan Siew today has ruled that Singapore is not the appropriate forum for the determination of the issue in this Suit. 

4\. In the light of our applic ation whic h is sc heduled for hearing on 23 Janaury 2008 and in the light of the learned Assistant Registrar Teo Guan Siew’s ruling, we would be grateful if you c ould c onfirm that we withhold filing our c lient’s Defenc e pending the disposal of our said applic ation. 

5\. In this regard, we would be grateful if you c ould c onfirm the same by 4.00pm on 10 January 2008. 

50     Drew & Napier replied on 10 January 2008 as follows: 

 ... 

2\. We are in the midst of getting c lients’ instruc tions and will revert as soon as possible. 

3\. All our c lients’ rights are expressly reserved. 

51     Before expiry of the 48-hour notic e, Ac ies on 11 January 2008 filed and served D2’s Defenc e. It was intended to operate as a holding defenc e pending the hearing of Summons No 94 of 2008 on 23 January 2008. 

52     It is with these bac kground fac ts in mind that I turn to the three issues before me. The first c onc erns the late filing of Summons 94 of 2008. Sec ond, the 48-hour notic e to file D2’s defenc e. Third, the Defenc e and how it impac ts the stay applic ation, if at all. 

**_Breach of O 12 r 7 (2) and extension of time under O 3 r 4 of the ROC_** 

53     On the first issue, Mr Tan pointed out that the Summons No 94 of 2008 was filed out of time c ontrary to O 12 r 7(2) whic h reads as follows: 

 A defendant who wishes to c ontend that the Court should not assume jurisdic tion over the ac tion on the ground that Singapore is not the proper forum for the dispute shall enter an appearanc e and, within the time limited for serving a defenc e, apply to Court for an order staying the proc eedings. 

54     At the hearing, Mr Rai ac c epted that the applic ation was late. However, he pointed out that the delay was not inordinate as it was late by 12 hours. Mr Tan took issue, not with the duration of the delay but with the lac k of explanation for the lateness. In my view, the reason for the delay is found in the affidavit filed on behalf of D2 in support of the stay applic ation. Apparently, when Mr Rai wrote on 4 January 2008 for time to file D2’s defenc e, he did not have instruc tions to apply for a stay of proc eedings. Mr Rai’s request was expressly made without prejudic e to any interloc utory applic ation that D2 might take out. Later on as paragraph 6 of his affidavit made c lear, Mr Rai rec eived instruc tions to apply for a stay of the proc eedings in Singapore. That explained his applic ation to extend the time to file and serve the defenc e pending final disposal of the stay applic ation as D seemingly had only sec ured a week’s extension from the plaintiffs. Paragraph 7 of the affidavit states: 

 On 7 January 2008, the plaintiffs’ solic itors wrote to us granting us a one week’s extension of time to file the 2nd Defendant’s Defenc e. 

55     D2 and his lawyers were mistaken that they had an extra week to file the Defenc e. The 


misimpression was evident at the time the affidavit was affirmed. Summons No 94 of 2008 and the supporting affidavit were filed on 9 January 2008 at 12.39 pm. Ac c ording to Mr Rai, Summons No 94 of 2008 was served on the same day but he did not indic ate the time of servic e. Drew & Napier’s 48hour notic e was faxed on 9 January 2008 at 2.18pm. Certainly, by the time Mr Rai rec eived the 48hour notic e, he must have realised the mistake for he immediately wrote to Drew & Napier. I have set out the text of the letter above (see [49]). 

56     Drew & Napier’s reply of 10 January 2008 was unhelpful. It left Mr Rai in a dilemma. The letter stated: 

1\. We refer to your letter dated 9 January 2008. 

2\. We are in the midst of getting c lients’ instruc tions and will revert as soon as possible. 

3\. All our c lients’ rights are expressly reserved. 

57     Mr Rai waited as long as he c ould to hear further from Drew & Napier and when he c ould wait no longer, he proc eeded to file the holding defenc e two hours before expiry of the 48-hour notic e. Having regard to the overall fac ts and c irc umstanc es, there being no prejudic e to the plaintiffs, I allowed Mr Rai’s oral applic ation to extend time for filing Summons No 94 of 2008. 

**_48-hour notice to file defence_** 

58     In my judgment, the 48-hour notic e to file and serve D2’s defenc e was inappropriate and unjustified in the c irc umstanc es of the pending stay applic ation. Rec ently, V K Rajah JA in _Carona Holdings Pte Ltd and others v Go Go Delicacy Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2008] SGCA 34</span> (“ _Carona Holdings_ ”) at [33] and [34] approving the c omments of Woo Bih Li JC (as he then was) in _Yeoh Poh Seng v Won Siok Wan_ <span class="citation">[2002] 4 SLR 91</span> at [21] (whic h is a _forum non conveniens_ c ase) on the very same point said that ordinarily a defendant should not be asked or c ompelled to file his defenc e whilst the stay applic ation was pending in that a defendant should not be made to adopt two c ontrary c ourses of ac tion simultaneously. I have not been told whether the 48-hour notic e was given before or after Drew & Napier was served with the stay applic ation. Be that as it may, in the present c ase, Drew & Napier’s letter of 10 January 2008 c learly inc luded the reservation of the right to obtain judgment in default of defenc e. By then Drew & Napier were already aware of the pending stay applic ation, and the reservation meant that the c ountdown of the 48-hour notic e period was to c ontinue until c ontrary instruc tions were obtained. It must be remembered that D2 was sued as a c o-c onspirator with BioTreat and the latter had just suc c eeded in staying the Singapore proc eedings. Drew & Napier’s stanc e on 10 January 2008 in the light of the Assistant Registrar’s stay order in favour of the Bio-Treat and D2’s pending stay applic ation whic h was the same as Bio-Treat’s was patently unreasonable and unwarranted. 

**_Effect of filing the Defence on the stay application_** 

59     This leads me to the Defenc e filed by D2. Was the filing of the Defenc e a step in the proc eedings that answered the substantial c laim and impliedly affirmed D2’s willingness to go along with the determination of the dispute by the Singapore c ourts? 

60     It was c ontended by Mr Tan that D2, by filing his Defenc e, had submitted to the jurisdic tion of the Singapore c ourt, and as suc h his stay applic ation should be dismissed. In addition, the averment in the Defenc e that expressly reserved D2’s right to take out any applic ation to strike out the plaintiffs’ c laim was tantamount to his submission to this jurisdic tion. In support of his c ontention, 


Mr Tan c ited _PP Persero Sdn Bhd v Bimacom Property & Development Sdn Bhd_ [1999] 6 MLJ 1 for the proposition that the inc lusion of a striking out applic ation in the stay applic ation would c onstitute a step in the proc eedings to bar the stay applic ation. 

61     In response, Mr Rai submitted that the Defenc e was a holding defenc e filed to pre-empt a default judgment. As suc h it was not filed with the intention of abandoning D2’s stay applic ation in favour of allowing the ac tion to proc eed against him in Singapore. It was as Mr Rai c alled it, an ac t of self-defenc e for by that late stage, there was insuffic ient time before the expiry of the 48-hour notic e to seek an extension of time from the c ourt. In filing the Defenc e, he made it c lear in the Defenc e itself that it was without prejudic e to the stay applic ation. Paragraph 1 of the Defenc e expressly reserves the sec ond defendant’s position in the following terms: 

 This Defenc e is filed without prejudic e to the applic ation made on behalf of the 2nd Defendant to stay all proc eedings in Singapore and/or any other applic ation whic h the 2nd defendant may make to strike out the Plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim. 

62     In my judgment, the question whic h arises from the debate is whether the terms of the reservation inc orporated in the Defenc e was proper and valid. I make two points. The first c onc erns inc orporation of the reservation in the Defenc e. In princ iple, a reservation of rights may be inc orporated in the Defenc e as was the c ase in _Chong Long Hak Kee Construction Trading Co v IEC Global Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2003] 4 SLR 499</span> (“ _Chong Long Hak Kee Construction_ ”). Rajah JA in _Carona Holdings_ at [101] agreed with Tay Yong Kwang J’s views expressed in _Chong Long Hak Kee Construction_ that it is possible to preserve the right to stay the proc eedings with a properly worded reservation in the pleadings. However, as Rajah JA at [101] alerted, “it is of c ourse c onc eptually possible for an earlier reservation [in the Defenc e] to be subsequently waived by c learly inc onsistent c onduc t”. That was what happened in _Chong Long Hak Kee Construction._ In that c ase, the reservation of the defendant’s right to apply for a stay was inc orporated in the Defenc e and Counterc laim. Unfortunately, the defendant later on undermined itself by giving its own 48-hour notic e to the plaintiff in respec t of this Counterc laim. Tay J held that the servic e of the 48-hour notic e by the defendant was c learly a step in the proc eedings within the meaning of s 6 of the Arbitration Ac t (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed). In the present c ase, paragraph 1 of the Defenc e is a properly worded reservation that the Defenc e is filed without prejudic e to the stay applic ation. 

63     I now c ome to the next query: Did the filing of a holding Defenc e in the c irc umstanc es of this c ase exhibit an unequivoc al, c lear and c onsistent intention to have the dispute determined by the Singapore c ourts as opposed to another foreign forum? In the c ontext of the arbitration regime, the filing of a defenc e would affec t the c ourt’s statutory jurisdic tion to grant a stay of proc eedings under s 6 of the Arbitration Ac t. This statement is to be read in the light of _Chong Long Hak Kee Construction_. In c ontrast, a stay of proc eedings on grounds of _forum non conveniens_ or an exc lusive jurisdic tion c lause, as the c ase may be, is about the Singapore c ourt dec lining jurisdic tion in favour of another more appropriate jurisdic tion. Ultimately, under either regime (as the analysis of various authorities by the Court of Appeal in _Carona Holdings_ demonstrates), the relevant inquiry is whether the filing of a defenc e demonstrates the party’s unequivoc al, c lear and c onsistent intention to have the dispute determined by this c ourt (per V K Rajah JA in _Corona Holdings_ at [99], referring to _Republic of Philippines v Maler Foundation_ <span class="citation">[2008] 2 SLR 857</span> at [80] as an illustration of suc h an intention). 

64     In the present c ase, the filing of the holding Defenc e viewed against the bac kground fac ts of the c ase did not demonstrate ac quiesc enc e or an ac knowledgment that the dispute should be determined in Singapore as it was the proper forum. D2’s c onduc t was not inc onsistent with an earlier reservation of rights in his pleadings. Consistent with the reservations made in paragraph 1, the 


Defenc e as filed was not a substantive defenc e on the merits of the plaintiffs’ pleadings. It was a holding Defenc e of three paragraphs. I have already mentioned the first paragraph. Paragraph 2 is a bare denial of the allegations in the Statement of Claim. The next and last paragraph is a general traverse denying eac h and every allegation in the statement of c laim. On the fac ts, nothing inc onsistent happened after the Defenc e was filed to undermine the reservation in paragraph 1 of the Defenc e. In any c ase, there is no suggestion that paragraph 1 was a disingenuous reservation thereby undermining the pending stay applic ation. There was no elec tion to abandon D2’s pending applic ation for a stay of the proc eedings in favour of allowing the ac tion to proc eed against him in Singapore. 

65     I turn to Mr Tan’s c ontention that referenc e to an applic ation to strike out the plaintiffs’ statement of c laim is fatal to the stay applic ation. I agreed with Mr Rai that paragraph 1 of the Defenc e c ontemplates a possible prospec tive striking out applic ation whic h is not the same thing and is distinguishable from the fac ts in _PP Persero Sdn Bhd v Bimacom Property & Development Sdn Bhd_ where a prayer to strike out the writ was also inc luded in the stay applic ation. In this c ase, there was no prayer in the stay applic ation filed by D2 to strike out the plaintiffs’ writ or pleadings. 

66     For these reasons, I rejec ted Mr Tan’s c ontention that by his Defenc e, D2 had c ompromised his stay applic ation and ac c epted Singapore as the appropriate forum to determine the dispute. 

**Result** 

67     The orders whic h I made on the matters before me were: 

 (i) The plaintiffs’ appeal in RA No 11 of 2008 be dismissed with c osts fixed at $8,000. 

 (ii) Time for filing Summons No 94 of 2008 be extended. Prayer 1 of Summons No 94 of 2008 be allowed with c osts fixed at $3000. 

 (iii) Prayer 1 of Summons No 280 of 2008 be allowed with c osts fixed at $2000.
