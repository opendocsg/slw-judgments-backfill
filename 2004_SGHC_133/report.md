1       This was an appeal by the debtor, Johanes Budisutrisno Kotjo (“Kotjo”), against the order of the assistant registrar made on 9 February 2004 granting the petitioning c reditors, International Fac tors Leasing Pte Ltd, leave to amend the bankruptc y petition filed on 9 Oc tober 2003. The short point of the appeal, whic h I dismissed with c osts fixed at $700 on 10 Marc h 2004, was whether this petition c ould be amended. On 6 April 2004, Kotjo appealed against my dec ision. 

2       The statement in para 1 of the petition in its original form was presented on the basis that: 

 The Debtor has within the period of one year immediately prec eding the date of the presentation of this Petition been domic iled and/or ordinarily resident in Singapore within the jurisdic tion of this Court. 

3       The assistant registrar granted leave to amend para 1 of the petition in the following manner: 

 The Debtor is domic iled in Singapore and/or has property in Singapore and/or has, within the period of one year immediately prec eding the date of the presentation of the Petition (i) been ordinarily resident or has had a plac e of residenc e in Singapore; or (ii) c arried on business in Singapore. The Debtor is a Singapore permanent resident and is the owner of and resides at the property No 10 Cusc aden Walk #23-01, Singapore 249694. He is also the direc tor and/or shareholder in various c ompanies and businesses in Singapore. 

4       On 12 November 2003, an applic ation was filed on Kotjo’s behalf to set aside the petition for several reasons. One of the reasons was that he was not ordinarily resident within the jurisdic tion. Neither was he domic iled in Singapore. Moreover, sinc e 2000, he had c eased all his business ac tivities in Singapore. The petitioning c reditors then applied to amend para 1 of the petition on 12 January 

2004\. In support of the applic ation to amend, Doreen Chia Lee Yoon, Assistant Vic e President of the petitioning c reditors, filed an affidavit on 12 January 2004. She deposed that Kotjo has property in Singapore in that he is the owner of 10 Cusc aden Walk #23-01, Singapore 249694. In addition, he has had, within the period of one year prec eding the date of presentation of the petition, a plac e of residenc e in Singapore or c arried on business in Singapore. Various searc hes were exhibited to her affidavit to show ownership of the property and his direc torship and shareholdings in various 


c ompanies. Kotjo, on 8 February 2004, filed an affidavit in reply refuting the allegations as untrue. As stated, leave was granted by the assistant registrar to amend para 1 of the petition in the manner set out in [3]. 

5       Kotjo opposed the grant of leave to amend. His c ounsel, Mr Intekhab Khan, argued that the c ourt has no jurisdic tion to grant leave to amend the petition as the applic ation to amend was made after expiry of the four months presc ribed by r 102(2) of the Bankruptc y Rules (Cap 20, R 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) for presenting a petition. However, if the c ourt has jurisdic tion to entertain the applic ation, no leave to amend should be granted, as the amendment was to add new fac ts and grounds after expiry of the presc ribed four months. By analogy with the princ iple that leave should not be given to a plaintiff to amend his writ or statement of c laim to add a new c ause of ac tion whic h is already time barred by the time of the applic ation to amend, it was argued that leave should not be given to amend the petition to introduc e new fac ts or grounds after the presc ribed period of four months had lapsed. 

6       In support of his argument, c ounsel referred me to _ABC Co v XYZ Co Ltd_ [2003] 3 SLR 546. In that c ase, the applic ant sought leave to amend the originating motion to set aside an arbitration award. Under Art 34 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commerc ial Arbitration, whic h is found in the First Sc hedule to the International Arbitration Ac t (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed), an applic ation to set aside an arbitral award may not be made after the lapse of three months from the date on whic h the applic ant had rec eived the award. The originating motion set out two grounds as bases for setting aside the award. The applic ant sought leave, after expiry of the statutory period of three months, to amend the originating motion to add six new grounds. Judith Prakash J held that the applic ation to amend an originating motion should be governed by O 20 r 5(2) and O 20 r 5(5) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 1997 Rev Ed). Suc h an amendment will be allowed only if the proposed new grounds arise out of the same fac ts or substantially the same fac ts as the grounds originally spec ified. 

7       In my view, Mr Khan’s argument is unmeritorious and c ounsel’s relianc e on _ABC Co v XYZ Co Ltd_ is misplac ed. The dec ision is of no assistanc e even though c ited as an analogy. 

8       The presc ribed period in r 102(2) of the Rules is for presentation of a petition based on a statutory demand. Rule 102(2) provides that “[t]he petition shall not be presented if the statutory demand was served more than 4 months before the date of presentation of the petition”. It does not c ontemplate that a statutory demand should be available as the foundation or basis for a petition more than four months after servic e of that partic ular statutory demand. The present applic ation for leave to amend the petition was not c onc erned with introduc ing a different statutory demand into this petition after the presc ribed period. Simply put, r 102(2) of the Rules is not meant to operate as a time frame within whic h to make an applic ation for leave to amend a petition to c over the requirements of s 60 of the Bankruptc y Ac t (Cap 20, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”), whic h is a different provision c onferring jurisdic tion on the c ourt to make a bankruptc y order. 

9       My view is reinforc ed by s 13 of the Ac t. Sec tion 13 provides that “[t]he c ourt may _at any time_ amend any written proc ess or proc eedings upon suc h terms, if any, as it may think fit” [emphasis added]. The language is in plain and unfettered terms and the power is expressly exerc isable at any time. 

10     Counsel for the petitioning c reditors, Mr Sean Lim, argued that the amendment to para 1 of the petition was to ensure that the petition c omplied with r 104 of the Rules by stating the grounds on whic h the petitioning c reditors believed that s 60(i)(c ) of the Ac t had been satisfied so as to 


c onfer jurisdic tion on the c ourt to make the bankruptc y order. In addition, the amendment was to inc lude additional grounds like the debtor’s property in Singapore, his plac e of residenc e and that the debtor had c arried on business in Singapore within the relevant period. I agree with Mr Lim that the dec ision of _Medical Equipment Credit Pte Ltd v Sim Kiok Lan Alice_ [1999] 1 SLR 70 referred by Mr Khan is distinguishable. The position here is quite different and it is about seeking an amendment to c ure defec ts before the ac tual hearing of the applic ation to set aside the petition. The Court of Appeal in _Medical Equipment Credit Pte Ltd v Sim Kiok Lan Alice_ did not deal with the question of amendment. The defec ts there c onc erned non-c omplianc e with s 61 of the Ac t. The petition stated that the debtor was unable to pay the debt without stating the prec ise amount of the debt owed by the debtor and without showing what was prec isely the debt. The c ritic isms and ruling of the Court of Appeal was in respec t of s 61 and not s 60 of the Ac t. The appellants had merely reproduc ed in the petition, in abbreviated form, ss 60 and 61 of the Ac t. L P Thean JA at [18] and [19] said: 

 While it may be said that this paragraph c omplies with s 60 of the Ac t in that it says that the debtor is domic iled in Singapore and/or has within the period of one year immediately prec eding the date of presentation of the petition been ordinarily resident or has had a plac e of residenc e in Singapore or has c arried on business in Singapore, it c ertainly does not c omply with s 61 of the Ac t. ... 

 ... Sec ondly and more importantly, r 104 of the Rules requires the appellants to explain how the c onditions and grounds spec ified in ss 60 and 61 respec tively have been satisfied. That c learly the appellants had not done, in so far as s 61 is c onc erned. 

11     As stated, the c ourt is given wide powers under s 13 of the Ac t to amend any written proc ess or proc eedings. There is also r 278 of the Rules, whic h provides: 

 Non-c omplianc e with any of these Rules or with any rule of prac tic e shall not render any proc eeding void unless the c ourt so direc ts, but suc h proc eeding may be set aside wholly or in part, amended or otherwise dealt with in suc h manner and upon suc h terms as the c ourt thinks fit. 

The importanc e of c omplianc e with r 104 of the Rules where s 60 of the Ac t is c onc erned c annot be denied. However, it does not lead automatic ally to the c onc lusion that a bankruptc y petition that c ontravenes r 104 of the Rules c annot be c ured by amendment. Neither the language of s 13 nor r 278 c ompels that result. In appropriate c ases, the c ourt should allow an amendment of the petition rather than dismissing it as Judith Prakash J did in _Re Wong Kin Heng, ex parte Imperial Steel Drum Manufacturers Sdn Bhd_ [1998] SGHC 237. 

12     To illustrate, in _Re Wong Kin Heng, ex parte Imperial Steel Drum Manufacturers Sdn Bhd_ , Prakash J initially heard arguments on an appeal against the issue of a bankruptc y order. The arguments were whether the c reditors had established the basis of the c ourt’s jurisdic tion in that the debtor had been resident in or c arrying on business on Singapore within the period of one year prior to the filing of the petition. The debtor there filed a notic e of intention to oppose the petition c ontesting the jurisdic tion of the c ourt on the aforementioned basis. Prakash J allowed the appeal but did not dismiss the petition, preferring an intermediate position. Leave was granted to the petitioning c reditors to amend the petition to state the grounds on whic h they believed that s 60(1)© of the Ac t had been satisfied so that the petition after amendment might in due c ourse be reheard. The petitioning c reditors amended the petition. The debtor filed a fresh notic e of intention to oppose the petition. The notic e was heard and dismissed. On appeal, the matter was before Prakash J and this time around, the appeal c entred on the status of the statutory demand, whic h does not c onc ern me here. 


13     The c ourt will naturally not permit any amendment, nor will the c ourt validate invalid proc eedings, unless it is satisfied that by so doing no injustic e is done to other parties: _per_ Farwell J i n _In re Small; Westminster Bank v Trustee_ [1934] Ch 541 at 545. Those words remain relevant today. I had to c onsider whether it was possible in a c ase of this kind for the c ourt to permit the amendment of the petition. The petitioning c reditors wished to amend the petition to c orrec t the petition so as not to c ontravene r 104 of the Rules and to further rely on other grounds in s 60 of the Ac t to c onfer jurisdic tion on the c ourt to make the bankruptc y order. It was implic it from Mr Khan’s arguments that the petitioning c reditors c ould amend if leave to amend was sought before the expiry of the four months’ period, _ie_ on or before 9 Oc tober 2003. He was not suggesting, and quite rightly, that the c ourt has no power to allow suc h an amendment. The opposition was not due to the introduc tion of new grounds and c omplianc e with r 104 of the Rules but in the amendments not taking plac e within the presc ribed four months. Be that as it may, having dec ided that the four months in r 102(2) of the Rules did not apply, there was nothing to the argument that the petition was not c apable of being made good by amendment on the analogy that it amounted to adding a new c ause of ac tion after a time bar. 

14     It was also not Kotjo’s c ase that he would be prejudic ed by the amendments. There was no injustic e to Kotjo in allowing the amendments to para 1 of the petition. It was still open to him to take the point at the hearing of his applic ation to set aside the bankruptc y petition that s 60 of the Ac t was not satisfied. Kotjo’s applic ation to set aside the petition was adjourned to 12 April 2004 to be heard by the Registrar. Besides, the affidavits filed on both sides already c anvassed the possible grounds on whic h jurisdic tion on the bankruptc y might be founded. The amendments did no more than to state, in para 1 of the petition, matters whic h were already in dispute between the parties. It was sensible that the petition reflec ted the full sc ope of the jurisdic tional dispute. The amendment was also to c omply with r 104 of the Rules. 

15     Under those c irc umstanc es, in my judgment, there was jurisdic tion to ac c ede to the applic ation to amend the petition and this was a proper c ase to do so.
