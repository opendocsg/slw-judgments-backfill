**The complainant’s version of events that occurred before the day of the alleged incidents** 

4       The ac c used and c omplainant were c olleagues at Giant and bec ame ac quainted in May or June 2005. They c hatted while working and eventually exc hanged text messages and had c onversations on the telephone. Sometime in June 2005, the ac c used and the c omplainant went to Mustafa Centre together. Whilst there, the ac c used suggested c hec king into a hotel as he was not feeling well. The c omplainant guessed that the ac c used wanted to have sexual interc ourse with her and proc eeded to the hotel nonetheless, and there had sexual interc ourse with him. After this inc ident, they went to the same hotel almost every week to have sexual interc ourse. They usually did so after the c omplainant finished work at Giant. 

5       In August 2005, the c omplainant initiated divorc e proc eedings against her husband. She testified that she had done so bec ause her husband did not have a proper job and was avoiding his responsibility as breadwinner of the family. The ac c used and the c omplainant made plans to marry onc e her divorc e had been finalised. Ac c ording the c omplainant, her relationship with the ac c used had nothing to do with her dec ision to divorc e her husband. When asked under c ross-examination whether she was in love with her husband, her answer was “I don’t know” and “I’m still struggling to go through what I’m going through right now”. 

6       In Oc tober 2005, the ac c used’s work permit in Singapore expired. He returned to Bangladesh on the evening of 12 Oc tober 2005. Both the ac c used and the c omplainant c onfirmed that on the morning of 12 Oc tober 2005, before the ac c used flew bac k to Bangladesh, the c omplainant had visited him at the flat and they had sexual interc ourse there. Ac c ording to the c omplainant, that was the last time that they had sexual interc ourse (although the ac c used testified that they had sexual interc ourse again on 6 Dec ember 2005: see [14] below). While the ac c used was in Bangladesh, he and the c omplainant kept in touc h regularly by phone and text messages. 

7       The c omplainant c ould not return to Bangladesh with the ac c used on 12 Oc tober 2005 bec ause her divorc e proc eedings were still ongoing. In partic ular, she and her husband had a c ounselling session on 14 November 2005 relating to the divorc e proc eedings that she had to attend. Before the ac c used left for Bangladesh, he purc hased a return air tic ket for the c omplainant so that she c ould join him there. The c omplainant had also applied for the requisite Bangladeshi visa so that she c ould travel to the c ountry. The departure date, as stated on the air tic ket, was 18 November 2005, and the return date was 25 November 2005. 

8       In the event, the c omplainant never made the trip. The c omplainant testified that she had told her mother of her intention to travel to Bangladesh to meet a friend. Her mother did not like the idea and threatened to prevent the c omplainant from ever seeing her c hildren again if she went. The c omplainant told the ac c used about this, and he tried in vain to make her resolute about going to Bangladesh. 

9       About the same time, on 14 November 2005, the c omplainant attended the c ounselling 


session with her husband. During this session, the c omplainant’s husband pleaded with her to give him a sec ond c hanc e. She agreed to do so, and resolved from that point on to put an end to her relationship with the ac c used. The c omplainant made a long-distanc e c all to the ac c used to tell him of her dec ision. Ac c ording to her, the ac c used was angry and told her that she should not c hange her mind about marrying him. 

10     Despite the c omplainant’s resolution to end the relationship with the ac c used, she still helped him to get a visa to return to Singapore. This was to fulfil the promise that she had made to him before he left for Bangladesh. Consequently, the ac c used returned to Singapore on 12 Dec ember 

2005\. The c omplainant arrived at Changi Airport at 6.00am to pic k him up, and then dropped him off at the hotel at whic h they used to have sexual interc ourse, and after that, she went to work, arriving at Giant at 8.10am. During the period from 12 Dec ember 2005 to 23 Dec ember 2005, the ac c used visited the work plac e of the c omplainant almost every day, mostly during her lunc h time. The c omplainant testified that she was not happy that he did so bec ause she did not want her c olleagues to know that he was visiting her. The ac c used also followed the c omplainant home after work. Ac c ording to the c omplainant, the ac c used was pestering her bec ause he wanted her to c anc el the Bangladeshi visa that she had applied for. The ac c used was of the view that he would be penalised if the c omplainant did not do so. However, the c omplainant did not have her passport with her bec ause her mother had hidden it. The c omplainant also testified that the ac c used wanted her to sign some doc uments that would enable him to get employment in Singapore. 

11     The c omplainant c onfirmed that on the oc c asions that the ac c used visited her at Giant during her lunc h time, they would go to a nearby bloc k of flats to c hat. They hugged and kissed during these sessions, but did not have sex. However, the c omplainant testified that there was one oc c asion where they went to a park near Bedok bus interc hange during whic h she masturbated the ac c used. The c omplainant stated that she had only done so bec ause the ac c used had insisted. The c omplainant also testified that the ac c used had at some point shown her a large sum of money, whic h he obtained by selling off his plantation in Bangladesh, but she maintained that she did not know what the money was for and had assumed that it was for the ac c used to support himself while he looked for a job. 

12     The c omplainant also testified that on 14 or 15 Dec ember 2005, she went with the ac c used to a neighbourhood polic e post to ask whether a polic e report needed to be made in order for a new passport to be made. The polic e offic er informed them that a polic e report did not need to be made, and instead gave the c omplainant an applic ation form to fill in. The c omplainant then submitted the form to the Immigration Chec kpoint Authority (“ICA”). A few days after the form was submitted (the ac c used testified that this inc ident oc c urred on 20 Dec ember 2005, but the c omplainant c ould not remember the exac t date), the c omplainant and the ac c used went to the ICA in order to c ollec t the c omplainant’s new passport. While there, the c omplainant was informed that she needed to pay a sum of $100 bec ause she had not made a polic e report. She had only expec ted to pay $50 for the new passport. As a result, the c omplainant did not c ollec t her new passport, instead, the ac c used quarrelled with her over the inc ident, whic h ended with a sc uffle at the Lavender MRT station. 

13     The c omplainant testified that the ac c used had c ontac ted her on 22 Dec ember 2005 to ask her to go to the flat to meet the ac c used’s prospec tive employer in order to sign some forms. The c omplainant said that she would try to make the trip during her lunc h hour, but in the end, she was unable to do so on that day and went the next day instead. 

**The accused’s version of events that occurred before the day of the alleged incidents** 

14     The ac c used’s version of events leading up to 23 Dec ember 2005 differed from the 


c omplainant’s ac c ount in some respec ts. The most essential differenc e in their respec tive testimonies was that while the c omplainant stated that she had ended their relationship while the ac c used still in Bangladesh and that he had returned to Singapore on 6 Dec ember 2005 only to find work, the ac c used testified that their relationship was still ongoing when he returned to Singapore. Ac c ording to the ac c used, he had returned to Singapore on 6 Dec ember 2005 bec ause the c omplainant had asked him to c ome bac k to marry her. She also asked him to bring money for the marriage, upon whic h he sold his c ultivatable land in Bangladesh in exc hange for $5000. The c omplainant pic ked him up from the airport on 6 Dec ember 2005 and then went with him to their regular hotel. He and the c omplainant had c onsensual sexual interc ourse there before she left the hotel to go to work. The ac c used stated that this was the only time they had sexual interc ourse between 6 Dec ember and 22 Dec ember 2005 bec ause the c omplainant did not have time to spare and her mother was always c ontrolling her. 

15     The ac c used also testified that upon his return to Singapore after 6 Dec ember 2005, he stayed at the flat, and sometimes at his boss’s offic e at Boon Lay. The original plan of the ac c used and the c omplainant was for her to introduc e him to her mother, and for him to stay at her mother’s flat. However, upon his arrival, the c omplainant informed him that she had diffic ulties doing so bec ause her divorc e proc eedings had not been finalised. Between 6 and 23 Dec ember 2005, the c omplainant and the ac c used met almost everyday, exc ept on her off days when she was not at work. The c omplainant never told the ac c used not to look for her in Giant. The ac c used also testified that when he and the c omplainant went to the park near Bedok interc hange sometime around 19 Dec ember 2005, the c omplainant was happy, and she had masturbated and performed fellatio on him. 

16     Ac c ording to the ac c used, the c omplainant c alled him on the evening of 22 Dec ember 2005 to inform him that she would go to the flat the next day to fill up visa forms and have sexual interc ourse with him. The ac c used had not informed the c omplainant that his potential employer was going to be at the flat and that she should therefore c ome over to fill in a form. 

**The complainant’s version of events on 23 December 2005** 

17     On 23 Dec ember 2005, the c omplainant left for the flat at around 1.00pm, and arrived at around 1.40pm. As she assumed that she c ould finish whatever it was that had to be done at the flat within her lunc h break, she had not informed any of her c olleagues that she would not be bac k at work on time. On that day, the c omplainant was wearing a brown blouse with a polo T-shirt from Giant (“the Giant T-shirt”) over it. She was wearing a blac k jac ket over the Giant T-shirt. She was also wearing a pair of pants, soc ks and shoes. 

18     The ac c used met her at the ground floor of the apartment bloc k in whic h the flat was loc ated. When she asked the ac c used where his potential employer was, he pointed towards the flat. The c omplainant then followed the ac c used up the stairs. When they arrived at the flat, the ac c used informed the c omplainant that his potential employer c ould not wait for the c omplainant and had left. The c omplainant sat on the floor and started filling in the forms that the ac c used had produc ed. As the c omplainant was in a hurry, she tried to fill in the forms as quic kly as possible. The ac c used was not satisfied with her signature and bec ame angry. This led to a quarrel between them. At around this point, the ac c used took the c omplainant’s mobile phone and wallet (c ontaining her identity c ard and bank c ard) and threw it aside. 

19     The ac c used then pulled out a knife, and said “You think I Bangla man, I c ome empty hand?” The c omplainant was sc ared, and went towards the main door of the flat upon filling up the forms. The ac c used ran after and grabbed the c omplainant, pushed her bac k into the room and forc ed her to sit on the floor. At some point during this alterc ation, the c omplainant tried to take the knife, but was 


unable to do so. The ac c used then dec ided to tie the c omplainant’s hands behind her bac k with a piec e of red c loth, and then used another piec e of c loth to gag her. After tying up the c omplainant, the ac c used asked the c omplainant to lie on her bac k and proc eeded to remove her pants, shoes and soc ks. He then raped her, while telling her that he wanted to ejac ulate within her so that she would bec ome pregnant and her husband would rejec t her. However, the c omplainant managed to move her leg so that the ac c used ejac ulated on her stomac h instead. At around this time, the ac c used told her that “today ..., you and I finish” and asked her to c hant an Arabic phrase that is usually used where someone has passed away. The c omplainant was frightened as she believed that the ac c used wanted to kill her. The ac c used also tried to kiss the c omplainant at some point during the rape, but was unable to do so as the c omplainant was gagged. He thus removed the gag, and she let him kiss her. The c omplainant then heard the ac c used saying “bac kside”. He turned her around and sodomised her. Ac c ording to the c omplainant, the ac c used and her had never had anal sex before, although he had requested it. The c omplainant stated that she felt a sharp pain and the sodomy c ontinued for about a minute. The ac c used ejac ulated on the c omplainant’s body, upon whic h he used a piec e of tissue to wipe off his semen and her anus. The c omplainant observed that there was blood on the tissue. 

20     Having raped and sodomised the c omplainant, the ac c used then took a knife to make a c ut in her brown blouse, whic h he ac c essed from the top of the Giant T-shirt. He then tore open the brown blouse but there was no damage to the Giant T-shirt. He also made c uts in the c omplainant’s bra. The ac c used removed the c loth that was being used to tie up the c omplainant’s hands and he then removed all her c lothes in order to take pic tures of her with the c amera in his mobile telephone. The ac c used told the c omplainant that he wanted to take photographs of her so that he c ould show the photographs to all the Malay men at the c omplainant’s work plac e. 

21     Although the c omplainant’s hands were free, she was still sc ared, and c omplied when the ac c used made her lie down and put his hands on her throat so that she c ould not talk. The ac c used raped the c omplainant a sec ond time, and then sodomised her onc e again. At some point, the ac c used asked the c omplainant why the sex was not as good as usual. The c omplainant testified that her answer to him was, “maybe it’s bec ause I was sc ared and [you are] angry”. The c omplainant also revealed for the first time in c ross-examination that she had had c onsensual sex with the ac c used after the two inc idents of rape and the two inc idents of sodomy. She had done so bec ause she thought that if she gave him sexual interc ourse willingly, he would let her go. He also pulled her hair to indic ate that he wanted her to perform fellatio on him, whic h she did. 

22     Following the episodes of rape and sodomy, the ac c used watc hed a pornographic video on the television, and then took the c omplainant’s gold earring studs from her. He told the c omplainant that if his sister, who lived in Bangladesh, c ould not use gold, she too c ould not use gold. The ac c used also told her that she c ould not think of going bac k to work. At around this time, the c omplainant began to feel nauseous. The ac c used went to the kitc hen in the flat to prepare some food, whic h he tried to feed the c omplainant. The c omplainant c ould not eat, and spat the food out. The ac c used then asked her if she wanted to make a telephone c all to anybody bec ause he was going to kill her. When the c omplainant turned on her mobile phone, she rec eived c alls and text messages from her c olleagues, inc luding a message from one P P Jayaprabu a/l Palakastin (“Jayaprabu”). The ac c used asked the c omplainant to inform Jayaprabu that she would not be returning to work. The c omplainant sent the following text message in the Malay language instead: 

 Tolong aku jaya. Suruh tukang sapu panggil sembilan sembilan dtg umah tukang sapu. Aku kene culik. Tolon. 

Ac c ording to the c omplainant, “ _Tolong aku jaya_ ” c ould be translated into “Help me, Jaya”, while “ _suruh tukang sapu_ ” meant “the c leaner to c all polic e to c ome to the c leaner’s house.” “ _Aku kene_ 


_culik_ ” meant “I was taken hostage”, while the last word “ _Tolon_ ” meant “help”. Jayaprabu c onfirmed in c ourt that he had rec eived this text message, whic h has also been retrieved from his mobile phone. Forensic examination revealed that Jayaprabu had rec eived the message at 6.05pm on 23 Dec ember 

2005\. The c omplainant testified that Jayaprabu had sent her a text message to c onfirm that she had been referring to the c leaner’s house. Jayaprabu c onfirmed in c ourt that he had sent a text message to the c omplainant with the following Malay text: 

 Panggil 77 to panggil polis kepeda 77 house 

This c an be translated into “c all 77 to c all polic e to 77 house”. The vic tim replied with the word “ye”, whic h Jayaprabu understood to mean “yes”. 

23     The ac c used saw the text message sent by Jayaprabu, and realised that the c omplainant had c alled for help. He asked her to get dressed, telling her that he wanted to take her to Boon Lay. She c omplied, putting on her panties, blac k jac ket and pants. Although the c omplainant had her mobile phone with her, she c ould not find her wallet and gold earring studs. The ac c used threw the torn blouse and bra into the rubbish bin in the kitc hen, and he had the c omplainant’s Giant T-shirt in his hand. They left the flat together. The c omplainant had the impression that this was at about 4.00 or 5.00pm, as it was already getting darker. Upon reac hing the ground level, the c omplainant ran away from the ac c used and sought help from passers by. The passers by offered to bring her to the nearest polic e station, but she c hose to wait for Jayaprabu instead. By this time, the ac c used had fled. Subsequently, the c omplainant’s c olleagues arrived, as did the polic e. The c omplainant was then taken to a hospital for a medic al c hec k-up. 

24     While the c omplainant was being interviewed by the polic e, the ac c used c ontac ted the c omplainant to tell her not to c anc el his visa so that he c ould return to Bangladesh. The c omplainant told the ac c used that she needed her identity c ard and bank c ard. She informed the investigation offic er, Amos Tang (“IO Tang”), who then instruc ted the c omplainant to arrange a meeting with the ac c used on the pretext of getting her identity c ard and bank c ard bac k from the ac c used. This meeting was arranged to take plac e on 25 Dec ember 2005 at Mustafa Centre. On the morning of 25 Dec ember 2005, before the meeting at Mustafa Centre, the c omplainant had rec eived several text messages from the ac c used asking for forgiveness and pleading with the c omplainant not to go to the polic e. Later on the same day, the ac c used was arrested when he arrived at the appointed plac e and time. 

**The accused’s version of events on 23 December 2005** 

25     Ac c ording to the ac c used, when the c omplainant arrived at the flat on 23 Dec ember 2005, she gave the ac c used her identity c ard, bank c ard and her earrings. He kept these items in his wallet. The c omplainant was feeling very hot inside the flat and therefore took off her jac ket and Giant Tshirt. She plac ed these artic les of c lothing on the bed. She then sat c ross-legged on the floor, and the ac c used took out the visa applic ation forms from his bag and gave them to her. At that time, the c omplainant had her mobile phone with her, but it was switc hed off. While the c omplainant was filling up the applic ation forms, the pair had an argument. The ac c used asked the c omplainant if she was really going to Bangladesh with him. He wanted to make sure that she would make the trip this time. Upon hearing this, the c omplainant slapped the ac c used on his fac e, and told him that she had not c heated or lied to him. It was her mother who had taken her passport away. The ac c used then told her: 

 You don’t know my problem bec ause last time, you know my problem, now you don’t know problem bec ause your heart inside rubbish jam already. 


The c omplainant replied that it was the ac c used who did not understand her problems, and that his heart was also full of “rubbish jam”. She said that he should wash his heart. She then grabbed a knife whic h was nearby and wanted to c ut the shirt that he was wearing. The ac c used did not allow her to do so, and snatc hed the knife away from her hand. The ac c used then c ut open the c omplainant’s brown blouse so that she c ould wash her heart. He made the c ut from top to bottom, and ac c identally c ut her bra in the proc ess. 

26     Ac c ording to the ac c used, the c omplainant then tried to take the knife from him. He resisted by grabbing her hands with his, and then tying her hands behind her bac k. When the c omplainant agreed that she would not take the knife, the ac c used untied her. After this inc ident, the c omplainant watc hed some television. She told the ac c used that “I got to go home early. It is late. So please c ome and have our interc ourse.” The ac c used and the c omplainant then had sexual interc ourse on the c arpeted floor, with him on top, and he ejac ulated on her belly, as had been their prac tic e. The c omplainant c omplained that the c arpet surfac e was very rough. The ac c used laid a towel on the floor and the pair had sexual interc ourse two further times that afternoon. The c omplainant also performed fellatio on the ac c used. The ac c used testified that the entire sexual enc ounter lasted about two hours. 

27     The c omplainant then wanted to leave the flat, and put on her jac ket, pants, soc ks and shoes. She threw the c ut blouse and bra into the rubbish bin in the kitc hen of the flat and c arried the Giant T-shirt in her hand. The ac c used and the c omplainant left the flat together. When they reac hed the ground floor, the c omplainant told the ac c used that she had to leave quic kly. The ac c used thus left the c omplainant and hailed a taxi from the nearby c offee shop as he wanted to go to Mustafa Centre. That evening, the c omplainant lodged her report to the polic e. The ac c used testified that on 25 Dec ember 2005, he went to meet the c omplainant at Mustafa Centre bec ause the c omplainant wanted her identity c ard, bank c ard and earrings to be returned to her. He was arrested there. He also testified in c ross-examination that he had been informed by his friend on the night of 23 Dec ember 2005 that the c omplainant had made a polic e report against him and that the polic e had gone to the flat. 

28     Other than the c omplainant and the ac c used, the only other material witness was Jayaprabu, who worked as a c ashier at Giant and was the c omplainant’s c olleague. Other than the evidenc e from Jayaprabu already noted above, Jayaprabu also testified that upon rec eiving the c omplainant’s text message asking for help, he went to his store manager, Tan Wee Boon, to disc uss the matter. Jayaprabu, Tan Wee Boon and two other c olleagues then took a taxi to the flat. Jayaprabu testified that the c omplainant was c rying and looked very lost. 

**The trial within a trial** 

29     The ac c used gave two investigative statements under s 121 of the Criminal Proc edure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) to the polic e. The first (“P73”) was rec orded from the ac c used on 25 Dec ember 2005 at approximately 3.45pm at Polic e Cantonment Complex. The admissibility of P was c hallenged by the ac c used. The ac c used c laimed that the statement was involuntary as it had been made under threat of physic al harm. Ac c ording to the ac c used, he had been roughly treated by IO Tang and Station Inspec tor Govindharajoo Ramalingam (“SI Govindharajoo”) at the time of his arrest on 25 Dec ember 2005 at 11.15am. SI Govindharajoo told the ac c used on the way to the flat that “You are going to go to jail, you are going to go to jail.” Whilst at the flat, IO Tang told him to shut up and verbally abused him. The ac c used testified that he was then brought to Polic e Cantonment Complex, whereupon IO Tang c onduc ted a pre-statement interview for about 15 to 20 minutes. During this interview, the ac c used was physic ally assaulted and verbally threatened by SI Govindharajoo (in the presenc e of IO Tang), who held the ac c used’s nec k, pushed him to the c orner 


of the room and kneed him. 

30     The ac c used was taken to Alexander Hospital for a pre-statement medic al c hec k-up before returning to Polic e Cantonment Complex at around 3.25pm. Both IO Tang and the ac c used c onfirmed that the ac c used had been offered food, whic h he either dec lined to eat or barely ate bec ause he had no appetite. The rec ording of P73 began at around 3.45pm, nearly four hours after the ac c used was first arrested. It was c arried out by IO Tang and one Mdm Nandani Devi d/o Durga Singh (“Mdm Nandani”), who was the interpreter for the ac c used. The ac c used testified that by the time of the taking of the statement, he was already in fear bec ause of the treatment that he had rec eived. IO Tang told the ac c used that he had to agree with everything that he and Mdm Nandani said. They would beat him again if he deserved it. IO Tang also pushed the ac c used against a c upboard, held him by the nec k and kneed him in the stomac h. Mdm Nandani was asked to leave the room while this assault oc c urred. When Mdm Nandani returned, IO Tang showed her the nude photographs of the c omplainant that were c ontained in the ac c used’s handphone, upon whic h Mdm Nandani started sc olding the ac c used and slapping him on the shoulders. IO Tang also threatened to “injec t [the ac c used] to die” if he did not c onfess. The ac c used stated that he was very sc ared and was c rying. At around this time, the ac c used broke down and told IO Tang that “Whatever you are telling me, just I sign for it”. The ac c used testified that this was the reason that he had signed P73. The rec ording ended at 7.40pm, nearly four hours after it had begun. 

31     The ac c used was brought for a post-statement medic al c hec k-up, where he c omplained about having rashes and some pain in his right foot. The ac c used testified that he had not told the doc tors who had c onduc ted the pre and post-statement medic al c hec k-ups of the assaults as he did not know whether he c ould disc lose what had happened and there were polic e offic ers present at the time. On 10 May 2006, while the ac c used was in remand, he made a c omplaint to the High Commission for the People’s Republic of Bangladesh (“the High Commission”) regarding ac ts of assault by IO Tang and Mdm Nandani that had oc c urred during the rec ording of P73. A representative from the High Commission interviewed him and then wrote to the prison authorities on 24 May 2006. Neither the Prosec ution nor defenc e c ounsel tendered c opies of the letter from the High Commission to the c ourt, although it was c lear from the Prosec ution’s submissions that they did have a c opy of this letter. Defenc e c ounsel relied on this c orrespondenc e as being c orroborative of the ac c used’s c laim that he had been assaulted and threatened during the rec ording of P73. 

32     In a _voir dire_ , the burden of proof lies on the Prosec ution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was voluntarily given: _Koh Aik Siew v PP_ <span class="citation">[1993] 2 SLR 599</span>. At the end of the _voir dire_ in the present c ase, I was not satisfied that the Prosec ution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the statement was a voluntary one. I c ame to this dec ision based on the overall c irc umstanc es, and in partic ular, the long hours before and during the rec ording of the statement, the failure to introduc e the letter from the ac c used to the High Commission and its reply to the polic e. The burden was on the Prosec ution to satisfy the c ourt of the voluntary nature of the statement, and, therefore, it fell on the Prosec ution to produc e the relevant doc uments and evidenc e in its possession. My dec ision to exc lude the statement was, of c ourse, not a finding of fac t of misc onduc t on the part of any polic e offic er or the interpreter. 

33     Reverting to the main trial, it was obvious that the evidenc e in this c ase in respec t of the c harges of sexual assault depended largely on the evidenc e of the two main protagonists, the c omplainant and the ac c used. The evidenc e c onc erning the taking of nude photographs of the c omplainant and the theft of her c ards and earrings had been physic ally proven, and the evidenc e of that was substantially independent evidenc e. Four nude photographs of the c omplainant were extrac ted from the mobile telephone of the ac c used, and at trial he admitted to taking those photographs. Similarly, the ac c used was arrested and found to have in his possession at the time of 


his arrest, the two c ards of the c omplainant as well as her earrings. The question of intention in relation to those c harges, however, remained to be c onsidered. But this being an unusual c ase, I shall first make some general findings. 

34     The unusual aspec t of this c ase is that the c omplainant and the ac c used were lovers not long before the offenc es were alleged against the ac c used. For the avoidanc e of doubt, I should state that they were lovers in the full sense of that term, and not merely two persons who were in love – they were c onsummated lovers who had sexual interc ourse with eac h other on a regular basis. The only disagreement was in regard to how often they had sexual interc ourse, and not as to the existenc e of a pattern of regularity. The c omplainant said that they had sexual relations onc e a week whereas the ac c used said that it was two or three times a week. However, the numbers in this c ase were not all that important; it was the fac t of a regular prac tic e between two persons seemingly deep in love at the time. I think that this would be a fair c onc lusion bec ause both of them admitted in c ourt that they had c ontemplated marrying eac h other. The c omplainant had also prepared to visit the ac c used in Bangladesh in November 2005. But love outside c onventions, it seems, has its obstac les. In this c ase, a loc al Malay girl went out of c onvention to love a Bangladeshi foreigner and, further, she fell in love with him when she was already married to someone else. We were not told what sort of relationship the c omplainant was having with her husband at the time save that at one point, at least, it was not strong enough to keep the c omplainant from falling in love with the ac c used, c ausing her marriage to head for divorc e. It had its moment of redemption when the c omplainant and her husband agreed to rec onc iliation, ironic ally, four days before the c omplainant was meant to meet the ac c used in Bangladesh. A not insignific ant twist was added at trial when the c omplainant hesitated in proc laiming a happy rec onc iliation. Instead, she voic ed doubt. This c hange at trial was not insignific ant for reasons to whic h I shall shortly revert. In addition to the rec onc iliation between the c omplainant and her husband, the c omplainant’s mother, too, was against the illic it relationship that she suspec ted the c omplainant was c arrying on with the ac c used. She went to the extent of hiding the c omplainant’s passport and the air tic kets sent to her by the ac c used. 

35     From the point of view of the c omplainant, the romanc e between the ac c used and her was over by 23 Dec ember 2005. The ac c used did not quite think so. They might have disagreed as to the c harac terisation of that fight, but from a disinterested third party’s perspec tive, the c irc umstanc es of the c ouple that day had the features of a lovers’ quarrel. In suc h quarrels even when one (or even both) of them had dec lared the relationship as having ended, he or she (or both of them) may still have lingering feelings for the other that may not have entirely vanished. Although that is not a matter of c onc ern to the c ourt, it serves as a reminder that finding fac ts under suc h c irc umstanc es is a diffic ult and c omplic ated exerc ise. One of the ironies of a falling out between lovers is that their memories of the past relationship bec ome enc rusted with a warped interpretation. The c irc umstanc es of the c omplainant and the ac c used seemed to me a c lassic example of this phenomenon, and their testimonies in c ourt fortified my views as suc h. The fine mixture of exaggeration and truth, honesty and dec eit made it diffic ult to determine what had been proved and what had not. 

36     However, from the testimonies, and given the small measure of c orroboration in the c autioned statements of the ac c used, I am satisfied that, in so far as the sexual offenc es were c onc erned, the Prosec ution has proved that the ac c used had raped the c omplainant and also sodomised her. There were two c harges of rape bec ause the Prosec ution’s c ase was based on two c lose but separate inc idents of penetration during the afternoon of 23 Dec ember 2005. One of the two c harges was based on s 376(2) of the Penal Code and was a c harge for aggravated rape bec ause of the allegation that the c omplainant was threatened with harm and thereby c aused to suffer fear. There were also two c harges of sodomy under s 377 of the Penal Code. In the thic k of the respec tive testimonies, I am only c onvinc ed that there was one instanc e of rape and one instanc e of sodomy. I am not 


c onvinc ed that there were two separate penetrations on eac h of those c harges, and I therefore give the benefit of the doubt to the ac c used. In respec t of the two rape c harges, I am not suffic iently persuaded that the c omplainant was put in fear in the c ourse of the sexual ac t, and, ac c ordingly, I am of the view that the offenc e c ommitted was one of rape under s 376(1). I would add that it was not easy to disc ern with prec ision the order of events in the ac c used’s room that afternoon, and on that basis, I would lean in favour of the version given by the ac c used. What I was able to asc ertain beyond reasonable doubt was that when the sexual interc ourse took plac e, she was not a willing party. I am satisfied that her initial reluc tanc e firmed into refusal, and that is the c ritic al ingredient in the offenc e of rape, all else relates to sentenc e instead. It may be that the ac c used thought, although he had not said as muc h, that the c omplainant’s reluc tanc e weakened into c onsent, but on the question of c onsent, or rather, the lac k of it, I have no doubt. In so far as the sodomy c harge was c onc erned, c onsent is not a defenc e. 

37     In respec t of the c harge of c riminal intimidation through the use of the knife, I am not fully c onvinc ed that a knife was used for the purposes as alleged or that it had the effec t as alleged or intended. The only fear that I was able to asc ertain from the evidenc e was that of the forc e of the ac c used’s anger that day. The evidenc e showed that the c omplainant and the ac c used had previously fought (over the inc ident of the payment of fees for the c omplainant’s passport renewal) but that was largely the sort of anger and frustration from a lovers’ quarrel and for whic h it is diffic ult to apportion blame. The anger of the ac c used on 23 Dec ember 2005 erupted under different c irc umstanc es. It was more unilateral in that by that time, so far as the c omplainant was c onc erned, the romantic relationship between the ac c used and her was over. She thus expec ted him to behave differently, but, of c ourse, given their history, that might be easier said than done. This is not an exoneration of the ac c used’s c onduc t but merely an expression of how people c an reac t when they are emotionally troubled. The rights and wrongs of their c onsequential ac tions are a separate matter. 

38     In respec t of the fourth c harge of outraging modesty in the taking of nude photographs of the c omplainant, the evidenc e was beyond doubt. Indeed, the ac c used admitted that he had taken her photographs although his defenc e was one of c onsent. In an offenc e of this nature – taking nude photographs (outraging modesty is a wide desc ription) – if c onsent is put forward as a defenc e, there must be c lear c onsent. I had thus to determine whether the c omplainant c onsented. In my view, she did not. I should add that in ac c epting her evidenc e on this point, I noted too that her unhappy expression on the photographs was not that of a willing model. I had also taken into ac c ount and noted that in at least one of the photographs the c omplainant made little attempt to avoid the shot or to c over herself. The next question, whic h related to the fifth c harge of c riminal intimidation in threatening to distribute the photographs, was whether there was suffic ient evidenc e that the ac c used had threatened to publish the photographs to the c omplainant’s husband, so that he would divorc e her, and to her friends at work. The only evidenc e of this was the testimony of the c omplainant. I am not suffic iently satisfied that this c harge was proved beyond reasonable doubt. The evidenc e from both parties was sparse. The ac c used had maintained that he had taken nude photographs of the c omplainant twic e before with her c onsent. The issue of whether he had threatened to use the present set of photographs was not pressed suffic iently and I thus find it unsafe to c onvic t him on the fifth c harge. 

39     Finally, there is the c harge for theft. The items c onsisted of the c omplainant’s identity c ard and bank c ard, and a pair of earrings. They were not items of any great value, with the exc eption of the bank c ard, but it was not known how muc h the c omplainant had in that ac c ount or whether the ac c used knew her personal identific ation and user identific ation numbers to withdraw money with that c ard. It was not disputed that the ac c used immediately agreed to return the items to the c omplainant when she asked for them. The c omplainant testified that when she asked for them she had not told him that she had gone to the polic e. The ac c used’s evidenc e was that the c omplainant left the items 


in the room and forgot to take them when she left. Theft is an offenc e c ommitted with the intention of depriving the owner of the property. I do not think that that intention was satisfac torily proved in this c ase. The ac c used might have been liable for trespass, c onversion or detinue under the law of tort, but that was not in issue before this c ourt. 

40     Finally, I should mention the evidenc e obtained direc tly from the testimony of the c omplainant herself regarding her voluntary sexual ac ts with the ac c used a few days before 23 Dec ember 2005 (masturbation), as well as on 23 Dec ember itself (fellatio and c oitus) after all the ac ts c onstituting the offenc es had been c ommitted. In respec t of the former, she explained that she performed them to avoid having to have c oitus, and in the c ase of the latter, so that he might release her. In one sense, if that was interpreted as duress, it would have vitiated any c onsent, but her own evidenc e and attitude at the time and during trial was not c learly or firmly one of duress. This made the assessment of the fac ts all the more diffic ult. Henc e, I was only c onvinc ed that there was one instanc e of c oitus and one instanc e of sodomy that that c omplainant had withheld her c onsent to on 23 Dec ember 2005 itself. The c irc umstanc es of that may also be relevant for mitigation but I shall c onsider that after I hear c ounsel. 

41     Consequently, for the reasons above, I find the ac c used guilty of the fourth, sixth and seventh c harges and c onvic t him ac c ordingly. I disc harge and ac quit him of the first, sec ond, third, fifth, and eighth c harges.
