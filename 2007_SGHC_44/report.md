**Sundaresh Menon JC** 

1       The petitioner, Lee Nyuk Lian, and the respondent, Lim Nia Yong, were married on 20 July 

1990\. They have two c hildren now aged 16 and 17 years old. The marriage broke down in 2003 and the petitioner left the matrimonial home on 16 Dec ember 2003. The c hildren have been with the respondent sinc e then.. 

2       A dec ree nisi to dissolve the marriage was granted on 29 April 2005 on the basis that the respondent had behaved in suc h a manner that the petitioner c ould not reasonably be expec ted to live with him. The anc illary matters were adjourned to be heard in c hambers and the question of c osts was also reserved to be dealt with in c hambers. 

3       The anc illary matters took on a life of their own when the respondent raised allegations that the petitioner had misappropriated substantial sums of money out of the family nest-egg. Taking this into ac c ount the respondent asserted that the gross value of the matrimonial assets exc eeded $1.5m. The matter then c ame before me on 5 July 2006. 

4       The c entral allegation made by the respondent was that a sum of around RM5 million had been ac c umulated over a period of time. He maintained that this was to have been their retirement fund. He further alleged that this sum had been siphoned off by the petitioner over a period of time prior to her leaving the respondent. On the authority of the dec ision of Judith Prakash J in _Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan_ <span class="citation">[2000] 4 SLR 466</span> (“ _Yow Mee Lan_ ”), the respondent submitted that these amounts should be restored to the pool of matrimonial assets and be taken into ac c ount in the distribution. 

5       At the hearing before me on 5 July 2006, the respondent was represented by Mr Goh Aik Chew who as it turns out was c ounsel for the petitioner in _Yow Mee Lan_. During the c ourse of the hearing, Mr Goh went through various payments and transac tions involving the petitioner, in some c ases with referenc e to the doc uments. In partic ular, Mr Goh submitted that a number of c heques had been signed by the petitioner and were either made out in her favour or to c ash and these appeared to have been enc ashed or paid into bank ac c ounts some of whic h had not been disc losed by the petitioner. On the basis of Mr Goh’s submissions, it seemed to me that some of the 


transac tions raised questions whic h warranted a response from the petitioner. 

6       Mr Leslie Foong who appeared for the petitioner responded by informing me that his c lient had not addressed these issues in her affidavits in a way that would have enabled him to respond in detail and with suffic ient spec ific ity to the respondent’s allegations. He maintained that these allegations were untrue and he c ontended that they were made by a person used to making suc h allegations. In my view, this was not a satisfac tory or suffic ient response. Mr Goh had raised some questions that seemed to be legitimate in relation to funds that appeared to have been banked by the petitioner into ac c ounts not yet disc losed. If the petitioner c hose not to respond, then it seemed to me that it would leave it open for me to draw adverse inferenc es against her. 

7       Mr Foong eventually ac c epted that it was appropriate for his c lient to respond. However, he maintained that his c lient was not in possession of the relevant doc uments. I therefore direc ted that the respondent was to prepare a sc hedule of the impugned payments with c ross-referenc es to the doc uments that he relied on. This was to be done within 3 weeks and it was then to be served on the petitioner for her to see the doc uments and to respond and c omment on the respondent’s allegations. 

8       Two weeks later, the respondent c hanged solic itors and appointed Mr Winston Low in plac e of Mr Goh. Mr Low subsequently appeared before me on behalf of the respondent. The respondent filed his sc hedule and affidavit as direc ted. However, this led to further requests for doc uments and c larific ations as a result of whic h the petitioner only filed her response on 28 September 2006. The respondent in turn took until 29 November 2006 to file his final affidavit in response. The matter was then fixed for hearing before me on 19 and 20 Marc h 2007. 

9       In relation to the impugned payments, following disc ussions with both c ounsel and after I reviewed with c ounsel the sc hedules together with the allegations and responses on eac h side, it bec ame apparent that the petitioner did take issue with the respondent’s allegations and that there were very substantial disputes of fac t in relation to the allegations by the respondent that the petitioner had embezzled substantial sums of money. The payments in question were made out of the bank ac c ounts of IDA Consultants Sdn Bhd, whic h was a Malaysian c ompany owned in equal shares by the petitioner and the respondent. The respondent alleged that the c ompany was treated as a family c ompany and that the funds in the ac c ounts were treated as the family’s assets. 

10     Leaving that to one side it was apparent that the c irc umstanc es surrounding these payments were hotly c ontested. The petitioner and the respondent eac h had their own version as to how or why these payments had been made. By way of example, where the petitioner alleged that c ertain payments had been approved by the respondent, his response was that his initials signifying suc h approval had been forged. 

11     It was patently not possible or appropriate for me to make a finding in respec t of these transac tions based only on the affidavits. The burden is on the respondent who asserts that the money in the bank ac c ounts of IDA Consultants Sdn Bhd was an asset of the marriage and that it had been diverted by the petitioner to her own use without the authority of the respondent. On the basis of the hotly c ontested fac ts, it c ould not be said that the respondent had disc harged this burden. This distinguished the present c ase from _Yow Mee Lan_ ([4] _supra_ ) where there was no dispute as to the existenc e of the partic ular sum of money that was held in a joint ac c ount or that it had been withdrawn by the wife and plac ed in her own ac c ount after she bec ame aware that the husband was having an extra-marital affair. 

12     On those fac ts, the c ourt in _Yow Mee Lan_ was satisfied that the sum in question should be treated as part of the pool of assets to be dealt with in the c ourse of distributing the matrimonial 


assets. In the present c ase, it bec ame evident after the affidavits had been filed that the payments took plac e over an extended period going bac k several years before the marriage had broken down and under c irc umstanc es that were hotly c ontested on both sides. 

13     It seemed to me in these c irc umstanc es that this issue was best left to the respondent and/or the c ompany, IDA Consultants Sdn Bhd to pursue the matter separately through c ivil proc eedings if either or both of them wished to do so. Both c ounsel ac c epted that this was the sensible c ourse to take in the c irc umstanc es. They also agreed that as far as the parties are c onc erned, any suc h c laims would be c onc lusively dealt with in any suc h c ivil proc eedings as might be c ommenc ed and so c ould be disregarded for the purposes of the present proc eedings. Ac c ordingly, these monies are not in any event to be treated as part of the matrimonial assets whic h are dealt with in these proc eedings. My dec ision here would not forec lose or prevent the respondent or IDA Consultants Sdn Bhd from attempting to pursue their c laims elsewhere if they so wished. 

14     It was also agreed that I should make no order for the distribution of the shares c urrently held by eac h party in IDA Consultants Sdn Bhd. Ac c ordingly, if any separate c ivil proc eedings are brought and if there is any rec overy, that will be resolved on the basis of the respec tive shareholdings of the parties in that c ompany. 

15     It then fell upon me to address the remaining anc illary matters. Mr Low argued that aside from the foregoing issues, there had been a failure by the petitioner to disc lose her assets fully and ac c urately. He relied on some bank ac c ounts and an insuranc e polic y that had not been disc losed. Mr Foong produc ed some letters from the bank to show that the ac c ounts in question were the same as those disc losed save that these had been renumbered following a c orporate re-organisation. As to the insuranc e polic y, Mr Foong informed me that as far as the petitioner c ould rec all, this had been terminated but she was trying to c onfirm this. 

16     It did not appear to me that there was anything sinister in the alleged non-disc losures and I gave leave to the petitioner to file a short affidavit to exhibit the letters and to put her explanation on the rec ord. 

17     This left the following issues: 

 (a) maintenanc e of the wife; 

 (b) c ustody and ac c ess arrangements; 

 (c ) distribution of the remaining matrimonial assets, in partic ular two properties; and 

 (d) c osts. 

**Maintenance** 

18     The petitioner is c urrently employed and residing in a rented flat. She sought an order for nominal maintenanc e of $1 per month. The respondent initially agreed to this but later resiled from this position on the basis of the allegation that the petitioner had c onverted a substantial sum of family money to her own use. As it was eventually c onc luded that this allegation should be left to be pursued elsewhere and should be ignored as far as the matrimonial proc eedings are c onc erned, I see no basis not to make an order for maintenanc e in the amount sought and I do so ac c ordingly. 

**Custody and access** 


19     The respondent sought sole c ustody of the c hildren whereas the petitioner sought joint c ustody. The c hildren are both boys, now aged 16 and 17. There was no dispute that the respondent should retain c are and c ontrol of the c hildren. 

20     In my judgment, as far as possible, both parents should be enc ouraged to remain involved in the upbringing of the c hildren. Mr Low ac c epted this as a sound premise. I ac c ordingly order that both parties are to have joint c ustody with c are and c ontrol to the respondent. 

21     The petitioner is to have liberal ac c ess to the c hildren. Mr Foong initially wanted me to fix the hours when ac c ess c ould take plac e. I did not think it appropriate to do this in the c ontext of c hildren of the age of these boys. In my judgment, it is preferable that the petitioner make the nec essary efforts to reac h out to her c hildren and to enc ourage them to see her as often as she and they are willing and able. Both c ounsel eventually agreed with this approac h. 

**Distribution of the matrimonial assets** 

22     The following were the only assets that I was asked to deal with in my order for distribution: 

 (a) HDB flat at Bloc k 105, Bishan Street 12 #02-248, Singapore 570105 (“the HDB flat”); and 

 (b) House at No 32 Jalan Bukit Kempas 3, Taman Bukit Kempas, 81299, Johor Bahru, Malaysia (“the JB house”). This property is registered in the name of a c ompany known as IDA Resourc es Sdn Bhd in whic h the petitioner and the respondent are the only shareholders. 

23     The petitioner sought an order that she be entitled to a 50% interest in eac h of these properties. Although she initially wanted an order that the properties be sold and half the net proc eeds be paid to her, Mr Foong made it c lear that she was not pressing for an order that the properties be sold as long as she c ould realise her interest in them. 

24     The respondent on the other hand initially maintained that the petitioner should get no share. Subsequently, after it was dec ided that the allegations c onc erning the payments made out of IDA Consultants Sdn Bhd would be disregarded for the purposes of these proc eedings, Mr Low suggested that the fair and equitable share that the petitioner should be allowed, was between 10% and 20%. 

**_The facts_** 

25     The relevant fac ts were these. The parties had been married for a period of almost 14 years when the marriage broke down. If the relevant date is taken to be the date of the dec ree nisi, then the parties were married for around 15 years. The petitioner is aged 40 and the respondent, 49. Insofar as the HDB flat is c onc erned, this was ac quired by the respondent during a previous marriage. There was no dispute that the HDB flat was ac quired entirely through the respondent’s resourc es. Mr Foong c onfirmed that the petitioner did not make any direc t or indirec t financ ial c ontributions towards the ac quisition of the flat. 

26     At the material times, the petitioner was a housewife although for a period of time in the later part of the marriage, she provided administrative servic es to the c ompany through whic h the respondent provided his professional servic es. The petitioner was the primary c aregiver at home. She was also the primary housekeeper. The petitioner also c ontended that the respondent had travelled on work from time to time and when he did, she had been solely responsible for maintaining the home and c aring for the c hildren. At one stage, Mr Foong suggested that the petitioner was the sole 


c aregiver and the only person doing housekeeping work to the exc lusion of the respondent. He based this on the statement that she was “the _one_ who took c are of our 2 sons’ daily needs” in her affidavit of means. I found this diffic ult to ac c ept in the sense that the petitioner had felt able to leave the respondent with the c hildren and must therefore have felt that the respondent was a c apable parent. Indeed, in one of her affidavits, she said as follows: 

 If I c ould, I would want to have c are and c ontrol of them. But I c annot afford to. I know that the respondent loves them too. So I believe he c an take c are of them well. 

27     In this light, it seemed unlikely to me that she c ould in all seriousness maintain that the respondent had no role whatsoever in c aring for the family and providing welfare in the home. In any event, it c ould not be denied that sinc e Dec ember 2003 when the petitioner left the matrimonial home, the husband had been the sole c aregiver to the c hildren as well as the sole person looking after and providing for the home. 

28     As for the JB property, Mr Foong submitted that the petitioner had made some indirec t financ ial c ontribution to that. The purc hase was financ ed by a downpayment made by the respondent and by a mortgage he servic ed. However, the parties had pulled down the house that had been there and had built a new home. A c ontrac tor was engaged and from the photographs exhibited, it was evident that this had been a major undertaking. The petitioner c laimed that despite this, she had sourc ed workers; sourc ed and purc hased materials; arranged deliveries; supervised and c o-ordinated the building work; and c arried out arduous labour. The respondent did not deny that the petitioner had been involved in this venture as had the respondent himself. However, he c ontended that she had exaggerated her c ontribution. 

29     This was a projec t undertaken in the years of the marriage when they had dreams of building a home for their retirement and I have no reason to think that either of the parties exerted apprec iably more or less efforts than the other. 

30     The wife also c ontended that for a period of four years or so, she had done administration and ac c ounts in the respondent’s business. It was evident that she had been involved in the administrative and ac c ounting aspec ts of the c ompanies through whic h the respondent did his work sinc e this had led to his allegation that she had diverted some assets to her own use. 

31     Lastly, both parties stated that they were making no c laim in relation to the amounts in their CPF ac c ounts. Indeed, Mr Foong said that I c ould ignore this for present purposes. I do note however that the respondent has dec lared that there is an amount of around $125,000 in his CPF ac c ount distributed among his ordinary, medisave and spec ial ac c ounts. 

**_The applicable legal principles_** 

32     The starting point of the analysis is S 112(2) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed) whic h provides as follows: 

 112(2) It shall be the duty of the c ourt in dec iding whether to exerc ise its powers under subsec tion (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, inc luding the following matters: 

 (a) the extent of the c ontributions made by eac h party in money, property or work towards ac quiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets; 


 (b) any debt owing or obligation inc urred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any c hild of the marriage; 

 (c ) the needs of the c hildren (if any) of the marriage; 

 (d) the extent of the c ontributions made by eac h party to the welfare of the family, inc luding looking after the home or c aring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party; 

 (e) any agreement between the parties with respec t to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in c ontemplation of divorc e; 

 (f ) any period of rent-free oc c upation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exc lusion of the other party; 

 (g) the giving of assistanc e or support by one party to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), inc luding the giving of assistanc e or support whic h aids the other party in the c arrying on of his or her oc c upation or business; and 

 (h) the matters referred to in sec tion 114(1) so far as they are relevant. 

33     It is evident that the sec tion c onfers a very wide disc retion upon the c ourt to have regard to all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase inc luding the spec ific matters enumerated in the sec tion. 

34     Sec tion 112(2) was the subjec t of c areful analysis and explic ation by Prakash J in _Yow Mee Lan_ at [29] to [34] and the following princ iples flow from that dec ision: 

 (a) In dec iding what is a just and equitable distribution the c ourt should have regard to all relevant c irc umstanc es inc luding those listed in the c ase and this inc ludes financ ial as well as non-financ ial c ontributions to the ac quisition of assets and to the c are of the family and the home; 

 (b) The c ourt adopts a broad brush approac h in determining what a just and equitable distribution would be. A party’s financ ial c ontributions to the ac quisition of any partic ular matrimonial asset would not be princ ipally determinative of how the asset is to be divided. The c ourt is free to give as muc h or even more weight to other non-financ ial fac tors; and 

 (c ) The c ourt should establish the relevant fac tors and then determine what would be just and equitable and in this regard, the c ourt should approac h the issue without any predisposition towards an assumption that both parties have c ontributed equally towards the ac quisition of assets. 

35     Prakash J in _Yow Mee Lan_ also noted that a marriage is not a business but a union where the spouses work together for a c ommon goal. In this c ontext even if they eac h have unequal abilities, this should not result in unequal rewards where they have c onsistently and over a long period made their respec tive c ontributions as best they c ould. 

36     This approac h was subsequently approved by the Court of Appeal in _Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim Heng_ <span class="citation">[2001] 3 SLR 225</span>. (“ _Lim Choon Lai_ ”). 

37     Beyond these princ iples, it is useful to have regard to how the c ourts have applied the 


foregoing princ iples to arrive at a just and equitable distribution. In _Yow Mee Lan_ , Prakash J noted that the wife, though not as c apable professionally and ac ademic ally as the husband, had done her utmost to support him at home and in the business. She had worked almost throughout the c ourse of a marriage lasting 26 years. She had also looked after the home and the c hildren alone during the extensive periods the husband was travelling. Her c ommitment to the family and marriage was desc ribed as “total and unstinting”. The learned judge then c onc luded as follows at [42] – [46]: 

 42 To summarise, the marriage was a long one. The husband was the main inc ome earner. The wife looked after the home and c hildren and played a supporting role in the family business owned by the husband. It appears that she did not have either the knowledge or the talent whic h the husband did and c ould not herself have produc ed the substantial inc ome he was able to generate. In these c irc umstanc es, what would be a just and equitable division of the assets? The Distric t Judge plac ed great emphasis on the husband’s role as the inc ome generator and c onsidered that he should therefore have a major share of the assets. 

 43 With due respec t, that approac h no longer ac c ords with the legislation whic h takes a wider view. It rec ognises that a marriage is not a business where, generally, parties rec eive an ec onomic reward c ommensurate with their ec onomic input. It is a union in whic h the husband and wife work together for their c ommon good and the good of their c hildren. Eac h of them uses (or should use) his or her abilities and efforts for the welfare of the family and c ontributes whatever he or she is able to. The partners often have unequal abilities whether as parents or as inc ome earners but, as between them, this disparity of roles and talent should not result in unequal rewards where the c ontributions are made c onsistently and over a longer period of time. 

 44 In the present c ase, the wife c ontributed to the best of her ability both to the maintenanc e of the family and to the business. She provided essential bac kup on whic h the husband c ould rely. He was able to travel for long periods safe in the knowledge that both his home and his business were in reliable hands. No doubt someone else c ould have done the administrative work in Plymat whic h the wife did (the husband was at pains to denigrate her work as being merely c leric al) but with someone else in c harge, he would not have had the assuranc e that in the offic e his interests would not be undermined. 

 45 It is also relevant to my c onsideration that the wife’s c laims to share in the husband’s assets do not extend to his CPF c ontributions, two of his c lub memberships and to his interest in Plymat itself whic h would otherwise be regarded as a matrimonial asset. This renunc iation is of value to the husband. No doubt, as far as Plymat is c onc erned, its main assets are the skill and c ontac ts of the husband and those obviously c ould not be divided between the husband and the wife. Notwithstanding that, it would still be possible to do a valuation of Plymat’s business and to award the wife a share of that value. 

 46 In all the c irc umstanc es of this c ase, I c onsider that the equitable division would be an equal division of those assets whic h the parties have asked to share in. ... 

38     In _Lim Choon Lai_ , the Court of Appeal c onsidered that in the absenc e of reliable evidenc e on the exac t monetary c ontributions made by eac h party to the purc hase of the matrimonial home, the fairer view to take was that they had made substantially equal c ontributions. The Court of Appeal also c onc luded that the wife earned more and bore the main burden of supporting the family and providing for its welfare. Taking this into ac c ount, the Court of Appeal c onc luded the wife deserved the larger share and therefore awarded her a 60% share. 

**_My decision_** 


39     In the light of these authorities, I turn to the present c ase. This was a c ase involving a fairly long marriage of around 15 years. It is c lear that the respondent had been the main sourc e of the family’s inc ome and so bore the substantial burden of paying for the two properties. Although the petitioner made some indirec t c ontributions towards the JB property as they set about improving it, this was matc hed by the indirec t efforts of the respondent who apparently undertook muc h of the design of that property quite apart from the direc t financ ial c ontributions that he alone made. 

40     The petitioner was the primary c aregiver to the c hildren and the home until she left in 2003. The respondent himself stated that he was preoc c upied for years with his work and his efforts in designing and seeing to the c onstruc tion of the JB property. Further, he did travel from time to time. But the wife’s c ontributions as the primary c aregiver to the c hildren are to be balanc ed against the fac t that the husband has been playing this role exc lusively sinc e she left and will c ontinue to do so for the foreseeable future. Indeed, the respondent has been having sole c are and c ontrol of the c hildren sinc e Dec ember 2003 when they were aged 12 and 13 respec tively and he will c ontinue to have c are and c ontrol under the present order. 

41     It is also true that the petitioner did support the respondent in his business for some years. Further, the petitioner was not seeking any part of the respondent’s CPF c ontributions. 

42     Taking all these fac tors into ac c ount and having weighed the monetary as well as the nonmonetary c ontributions made by eac h party, I c onsider that the respondent deserved a larger apportionment of the matrimonial assets than the petitioner, but not to the extent suggested by the respondent. Rather, in my judgment, taking a broad brush approac h, the fair and equitable distribution would be to grant the respondent 60% of the interest in these properties and to grant the petitioner 40% of the interest in these properties. 

43     Both c ounsel had informed me that they were agreeable to my not making an order for sale. I therefore make the following orders in relation to these properties: 

 (a) Eac h of the properties is to be valued by a valuer ac c eptable to both parties (or in the c ase of the HDB flat, to the HDB) within 6 weeks from the date of this judgment; 

 (b) Within 12 weeks of the date of the valuation, the respondent is to pay the petitioner 40% of the net value of the two properties; 

 (c ) Within 1 week of suc h payment, the petitioner is to deliver signed blank transfers and all the share c ertific ates registered in her name in IDA Resourc es Sdn Bhd to the respondent at no c ost; 

 (d) There shall be liberty to apply. 

**Costs** 

44     This brings me finally to the question of c osts. Mr Foong submitted that his c lient was entitled to c osts bec ause the divorc e had been granted on the basis of the respondent’s unreasonable behaviour. Further, he submitted on the authority of _Tham Khai Meng v Nam Wen Jet Bernadette_ <span class="citation">[1997] 2 SLR 27</span> at [49]-[50] that the anc illary matters are part of the hearing of the petition and the same order should follow on the hearing of the anc illaries. Finally, he submitted that muc h time and effort had been expended on the anc illaries by reason of the respondent’s allegations as to the diversion of funds by the petitioner. 


45     Mr Low on the other hand, submitted that eac h party should bear their own c osts. 

46     In my judgment seen in the whole, the petitioner has been substantially suc c essful and should get her c osts. It is also true that the proc eedings were prolonged by virtue of the allegations of embezzlement made by the respondent. Further, the anc illaries c ame to be tried in the High Court only for that reason. 

47     Both parties agreed I should fix the c osts if I were minded to make an order for c osts. Mr Foong submitted a figure of $50,000. In my view, this was exc essive having regard to the work reasonably required to be done on behalf of the petitioner. The petitioner filed 5 affidavits against 9 that the respondent filed. The hearing took more than 2 days inc luding the first appearanc e. There were also several attendanc es for direc tions. Taking all this into ac c ount, I fix the c osts to the petitioner at the sum of $20,000 with reasonable disbursements to be taxed if not agreed.
