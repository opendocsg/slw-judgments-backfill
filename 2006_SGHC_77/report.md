**Kan Ting Chiu J:** 

1       This ac tion arose from a road traffic ac c ident involving a motorc yc le and a bus at the intersec tion of two roads. 

2       The ac c ident took plac e in the evening of 12 January 2002 at about 8.09pm. A Harley Davidson motorc yc le ridden by Anthony John Stafford (“the dec eased”) was proc eeding along the left-most lane of Clementi Road, going straight at the intersec tion with Commonwealth Avenue West, heading towards Upper Bukit Timah Road. The bus, driven by Goo Tong Sing (“the bus driver”), had c ome from the opposite direc tion along Clementi Road, and was making a right turn into Commonwealth Avenue West, ac ross the path the dec eased was taking. 

3       Clementi Road and Commonwealth Avenue West meet at almost right angles. As one approac hes the intersec tion of Clementi Road from the direc tion of Upper Bukit Timah Road (the direc tion the bus was taking), there are five lanes in that direc tion. The right-most lane is exc lusively for vehic les turning right. The lane next to it is for vehic les to turn right or go straight. There are right-turn poc kets marked for these two lanes. The next two lanes are for vehic les going straight, and the left-most lane is for vehic les going straight or turning left. 

4       When one approac hes the intersec tion along Clementi Road from the opposite direc tion, _ie_ , from the direc tion of the Ayer Rajah Expressway (the direc tion the dec eased was taking), there are four lanes. The right-most lane is for vehic les turning right. The lane next to it is for vehic les turning right or going straight, and the next lane is for vehic les going straight and the last lane is for vehic les going straight or turning left. There are no turning poc kets for any of these lanes. 

5       The dec eased died from the injuries suffered in the ac c ident. The plaintiff in this ac tion is the administratrix of the estate of the dec eased. The bus driver was sued as the first defendant, and his 


employer, SBS Transit Ltd, was sued as the sec ond defendant. The bus driver was not injured in the ac c ident, but died before the hearing of the ac tion, whic h then proc eeded against the sec ond defendant. 

6       During the hearing, I did not have the benefit of the evidenc e of the dec eased or the bus driver. There was, however, the evidenc e of an eye witness, Low Chong Eng (“Low”), whic h I shall refer to. 

7       The plaintiff’s c laim was that the ac c ident was c aused by the negligenc e of the bus driver, whic h was partic ularised as: 

 (a) failing to keep any or any proper lookout; 

 (b) driving at an exc essive speed in the c irc umstanc es; 

 (c ) failing to observe the presenc e of the dec eased on his motorc yc le proc eeding straight along Clementi Road; 

 (d) failing to have any or any proper c ontrol over bus No SBS 7248 H; 

 (e) failing to give way to the dec eased; 

 (f) failing to give any or any suffic ient warning of his approac h; 

 (g) enc roac hing into the path of the dec eased when it was unsafe and dangerous so to do; 

 (h) c olliding into the dec eased; 

 (i) failing to exerc ise reasonable c are, skill and prudenc e in the driving, use and management of bus No SBS 7248 H; and 

 (j) failing to stop, swerve, slow down or otherwise avoid the said c ollision. 

8       The polic e investigations led to the bus driver being c harged in c ourt, where he pleaded guilty to a c harge under s 304A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) for c ausing the death of the dec eased by a negligent ac t not amounting to homic ide by failing to give way to the dec eased’s motorc yc le when turning right. 

9       The bus driver admitted without qualific ation the fac ts presented by the Prosec ution, _inter alia_ , that: 

 On 12 Jan 2002 at about 8:09 p.m., the [bus driver] was travelling on the extreme right lane of the 3-lane dual c arriageway of Clementi Road towards the signalised c ross-junc tion of Commonwealth Avenue West and Clementi Road. At the said junc tion, the [bus driver] c ommitted a negligent ac t when exec uting a right turn into Commonwealth Avenue West as he failed to give way to the dec eased who was c oming from the opposite side of the road. This resulted in a head-to-side c ollision between the said motor-bus and the motorc yc le ridden by the dec eased. 

10     Upon his c onvic tion the c ourt imposed on the bus driver a fine of $10,000 or five months’ imprisonment in default thereof, and disqualified him from holding a driving lic enc e of all c lasses for ten years. 


11     The plea of guilt and c onvic tion were relied on by the plaintiff as part of her c ase. The evidenc e in those proc eedings were admissible evidenc e in this ac tion under s 45A(1) of the Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) whic h provides that: 

 [T]he fac t that a person has been c onvic ted or ac quitted of an offenc e by or before any c ourt in Singapore shall be admissible in evidenc e for the purpose of proving, where relevant to any issue in the proc eedings, that he c ommitted (or, as the c ase may be, did not c ommit) that offic e, whether or not he is a party to the proc eedings; and where he was c onvic ted, whether he was so c onvic ted upon a plea of guilty or otherwise. 

12     The sec ond defendant however denied liability and alleged negligenc e against the dec eased, pleading that: 

 (a) the bus driver had turned right when the right-turn green arrow lights were in his favour; 

 (b) the dec eased had beaten the traffic lights whic h were red against him when he entered into the junc tion; 

 (c ) the dec eased had failed to keep a proper lookout, was riding too fast, and had failed to exerc ise reasonable c are and c ontrol over his motorc yc le in c olliding into the bus; and 

 (d) the dec eased had c onsumed alc ohol immediately prior to the ac c ident and his judgment on the road was thereby affec ted. 

It was also pleaded that the dec eased was riding while on medic ation. This allegation was based on the presenc e of quinine in the dec eased’s urine, but was not pursued as there was no evidenc e that the dec eased was under any medic al treatment. 

13     Some of the polic e investigation papers were admitted in evidenc e at the trial. They inc luded photographs of the vehic les and the sc ene of the ac c ident, the sketc h plan and key of the sc ene of the ac c ident and the damage noted on the motorc yc le and the bus. 

14     The sketc h plan showed the bus at a position two metres from the edge of the yellow box intersec tion. To put that in c ontext, the bus had bloc ked all but two metres of the left-most lane of Clementi Road on whic h the dec eased was travelling. There were glass and other fragments on the road at the front right c orner of the bus but there were no skid marks, sc ratc h marks or brake marks. 

15     The polic e investigation offic er c onfirmed that a person travelling in the direc tion taken by the dec eased would have seen the intersec tion c learly from 150m, and that there was a slight downward slope along that stretc h of the road. 

16     The damage to the vehic les was as follows: 

 (a) The motorc yc le: 

 (i) front left signal broken; 

 (ii) front left wing mirror broken; 

 (iii) left c rash bar damaged; 

 (iv) fuel tank damaged; and 


 (v) sc ratc h marks on the exhaust pipe. 

 (b) The bus: 

 (i) front right windsc reen mirror webbed; 

 (ii) front right bumper damaged; and 

 (iii) front right part damaged. 

17     Although the bus driver had died before this ac tion c ame on for hearing, his polic e report was admitted in evidenc e, and he had filed his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief in the proc eedings. 

18     The polic e report was inc luded amongst the agreed doc uments whic h authentic ity was not disputed. The affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief was admissible in evidenc e as an admission under ss 17(1) and 18(1) of the Evidenc e Ac t. 

19     In his polic e report the bus driver stated: 

 On 12/1/02 @ 2010 hrs, I was driving Bus Servic e Number 165 vehic le No: SBS7248E along Clementi Rd towards Commonwealth Ave West. At the junc tion of Clementi Rd and Commonwealth Ave West, I stopped my bus inside the “Turn Right” Box while waiting to turn right into Commonwealth Ave West. When the traffic light turned red and the green arrow showed, I proceed to move my vehicle. As I was about to turn into Commonwealth Ave West, I saw a motorc yc le travelling from the opposite direc tion of Clementi Rd (towards Sunset Way). I immediately jammed brake but the m/c yc le (2600J) c ollided into the right front of my bus. My bus suffered slight damage but the rider of the m/c yc le is killed on the spot. [emphasis added] 

and in his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief, he stated: 

3\. On the day of ac c ident, 12 January 2002, at about 8.00 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., I was driving the 2nd Defendants’ motor bus bearing registration no. SBS 7248H (“my motor bus”) along the right most lane of Clementi Road. The road was a 2-way traffic road with 4 lanes on either side divided by a c onc rete c entre divider. 

4\. The flow of traffic was moderate at that time. The weather was fine and the road surfac e was dry. Visibility was c lear. 

5\. As I reac hed near the sc ene of ac c ident, my motor bus was about 3 to 4 motor vehic les behind the first motor vehic le that had stopped at the junc tion of Clementi Road and     Commonwealth Avenue West (“the said junc tion”) as the traffic lights at the said junc tion were red. We were waiting to turn right into Commonwealth Avenue West. When the traffic lights turned green, the motor vehic les in front of my motor bus started turning right into     Commonwealth Avenue West one by one when the opposite traffic allowed for it. By the time my motor bus proc eeded to the front of the queue, the traffic lights were still green. I therefore waited at the right-turning poc ket for the green arrow to appear. Almost immediately after I reac hed the front of the queue, the traffic lights at the said junc tion turned red but _I am not sure whether the green arrow had appeared_. Onc e the traffic lights turned red, I proc eeded to right. I lifted my foot off the brake pedal and my motor bus, being an automatic bus, inc hed forward. Just when I was about to step on the ac c elerator, I suddenly saw a motorc yc le bearing 


 registration no. FS 2600J (whic h I subsequently found out was ridden by one Anthony John Stafford, the Dec eased herein) travelling straight at a fast speed from the opposite direc tion. I immediately jammed the brakes of my motor bus to avoid c olliding into the Dec eased’s motorc yc le. I must add that as my motor bus is a heavy vehic le, it did not move very fast ac ross the junc tion. I doubt that the speed of my motor bus was more than 10 km/h when my motor bus inc hed forward after I lifted my foot from the brake pedal to turn right into Commonwealth Avenue West. However, as the Deceased’s motorcycle was already very near my motor bus by the time I noticed its presence , it c ollided into the right front side of my motor bus. The Deceased did not swerve his motorcycle at all. 

 [emphasis added] 

20     Low was a witness for the plaintiff. He had c ontac ted the traffic polic e after the ac c ident and had given a statement on the ac c ident. He rec ounted in his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief that: 

6\. On 12 January 2002, I was driving along Clementi Road heading towards the direc tion of the Ayer Rajah Expressway (“AYE”), sometime between 8.00pm and 8.30pm. The weather was fine at that time and visibility was c lear. 

7\. At the material time, I was driving towards Clementi Central to buy dinner. As I intended to make a right turn, I stayed on the 2nd lane from the right. There were 2 right turning lanes on Clementi Road for vehic les turning right into Commonwealth Avenue West (in the direc tion of Boon Lay). As I approac hed the Said Junc tion, the lights were red, so I stopped my vehic le, SDG 2661U at the lights. My vehic le was the first vehic le on the sec ond lane from the right. The Double- Dec ker Bus was next to me as it was also the first vehic le on the right-most lane. 

8\. When the traffic lights turned green, I moved my vehic le forward into the “right-turn poc kets” marked on the road while observing the on-c oming traffic. I rec all that the Double-     Dec ker Bus was also in the right turn poc ket on my right. _We were both waiting to turn right_ to into Commonwealth Avenue West towards the direc tion of Boon Lay. 

9\. While waiting at the right turn poc ket, I notic ed that Double- Dec ker Bus inc hing forward out of the right turning poc ket. I was about to follow suit when I dec ided to take another look at the traffic lights before I proc eed to exec ute my right turn. _I saw that the traffic lights were still showing green_ and it was at this instanc e that I also notic ed _the Motorcycle travelling on the leftmost lane_ c oming from the opposite direc tion towards the Said Junc tion. _The Double-Decker_     _Bus proceeded to move forward into the Said Junction in an attempt to execute its right turn_ and I heard a loud bang and I heard the dec eased sc ream. I then realized that the Double- Dec ker Bus had c ollided into the dec eased. 

 [emphasis added] 

and his evidenc e upon c ross-examination by c ounsel for the sec ond defendant was: 

 Q: When the bus inc hed forward the right most and middle lane, the opposite direc tion was c lear of traffic? 

 A: Yes. 

 Q: The bus was somewhere in the middle of the junc tion? 


 A: Yes. 

 Q: When you saw the motorc yc le did the bus move forward some more? 

 A: Yes. 

 Q: How far more? 

 A: It was going forward at a c onstant speed. 

 Q: How far more? 

 A: I c annot really estimate, it is still moving forward. 

 Q: Then the ac c ident happened? 

 A: Yes. 

 Q: The bus inc hed forward till the ac c ident happened? 

 A: At a c ertain point of time, I saw the bus hesitated, it slowed down, then it dec ided to c omplete the right turn. 

 Q: Between the time you double-c hec ked the traffic light to the time the ac c ident happened, did you c hec ked the traffic light again? 

 A: It was still green. 

 Q: My instruc tions are the traffic lights have turned red? 

 A: That was not what I saw. 

 Q: The ac c ident happened quite quic kly? 

 A: Yes. 

 Q: Did you notic e whether the motorc yc list slowed down? 

 A: No. 

Counsel did not dispute Low’s evidenc e that the dec eased was travelling along the left-most lane of the road. 

21     Low’s evidenc e was c orroborated by a report on the traffic light system at the intersec tion. Counsel for both parties agreed and c onfirmed that: 

 (a) Low’s desc ription in para 7 of his affidavit of stopping his c ar at the red lights c orresponded to the phase of the traffic lights when the lights for all lanes along Clementi Road in both direc tions showed red. 

 (b) Low’s desc ription in para 8 of his c ar and the bus moving into the right-turn poc kets c orresponded to the phase of the traffic lights, when the traffic lights turned green for traffic 


 along Clementi Road, but before the right-turn green arrow lights c ame on. 

 (c ) Low’s desc ription of the bus turning right while the traffic lights were still showing green c orresponded to the same phase of the traffic lights as in (b). 

It was c ommon ground that in the next phase, the traffic lights fac ing Clementi Road showed red, and the right-turn green arrows c ame on. Counsel for the sec ond defendant took c are to state that while he ac c epted that to be the effec t of Low’s evidenc e, he did not ac c ept Low’s ac c ount of the events. 

22     Counsel was c onstrained to take that position as the defenc e was that the dec eased had entered into the intersec tion against red traffic lights, when the green right-turn arrows had c ome on for the bus driver. As Low’s evidenc e was that the traffic lights were green, neither of that c ould have happened. 

23     Notwithstanding c ounsel’s reservation, there was little reason to doubt Low’s evidenc e. He was there at the intersec tion in his c ar, next to the bus, waiting to turn right, watc hing the traffic lights. He had c ome forward as an eye witness during the polic e investigations, and he struc k me as a c areful witness whose evidenc e c an be relied on. In c ontradistinc tion to that, the bus driver admitted in para 5 of his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief that he was not sure if the green arrow had appeared when he turned right, retrac ting the unqualified assertion in his polic e report that the green arrow was showing. 

24     On the evidenc e before me, I find that the bus driver had made the right turn whilst the traffic lights were green in the dec eased’s favour and before the green arrow c ame on. 

25     There was no direc t evidenc e of any of the allegations of negligent riding alleged against the dec eased. At the trial, eac h party had c alled a witness to give evidenc e on the speed whic h the motorc yc le was travelling at the time of impac t based on the formation derived from the positions that the vehic les were in after the ac c ident. However, it was apparent that there were shortc omings in the opinions rendered. When I brought that to the attention of c ounsel, they agreed that they would not rely on the evidenc e of the two witnesses. 

26     It was argued by c ounsel for the sec ond defendant that even if the bus had turned when the traffic lights were green in favour of the dec eased, the dec eased should still bear a portion of the liability for the ac c ident. This submission was founded on c ontributory negligenc e, where a party fails to take reasonable c are of himself and thereby c ontributes to his own injury through the ac ts or omissions of others. 

27     When one travels on the roads, one c annot assume perfec t road manners from the other road users. The reasonable road user must ac t on the basis that there may be negligenc e and inc ompetenc e on the part of others, and he has to make allowanc e for them. However, this duty c annot be overstated; he is not required to regard other road users as threats to him against whom he must protec t himself, and he must be allowed to go about with a degree of c alm and c onfidenc e nec essary for the orderly movement of traffic. With referenc e to a person in the position of the dec eased, I only need to quote and c onc ur with the statement that: 

 [T]here is – in the absenc e of c lear and c ompelling c irc umstanc es to the c ontrary – no legal duty on a driver to slow down automatically eac h time he or she approac hes a junc tion if there is no stop sign or (as is the c ase here) the lights are in his or her favour at a junc tion where traffic lights are present. [emphasis in original] 


_per_ Andrew Phang Boon Leong JC (as he then was) in _Ong Bee Nah v Wong Siew Wan_ <span class="citation">[2005] 2 SLR 455</span> at [95]. 

28     Was the dec eased guilty of c ontributory negligenc e? There are the photographs, the sketc h plan, the investigation offic er’s evidenc e and Low’s evidenc e to go on. Low’s evidenc e was that the bus had stopped in the turning poc ket, but when it moved further into the intersec tion when the lights were still in favour of the dec eased, the ac c ident happened. 

29     The dec eased had proc eeded into the intersec tion along the left-most lane. He was entitled to assume that the bus whic h had stopped in the turning poc ket will not move on again while the lights remained green in his favour. The photographs and sketc h plan showed that the bus had c ut into his path, and save for the unc orroborated and untested ac c ounts given by the bus driver, there was no indic ation that he was riding at an exc essive speed, or riding without due c are, or had failed to do anything to avoid the c ollision. Unless it c an be inferred from the fac t that a c ollision had taken plac e in suc h c irc umstanc es that the dec eased was somehow negligent, and there is no basis for that in law or on the fac ts, there was no evidenc e of negligenc e on the part of the dec eased. 

30     The sec ond defendant asserted that there was relevant evidenc e of that, in that the blood of the dec eased had a blood alc ohol c onc entration of 68mg/100ml. 

31     Dr Lim Yun Chin, c onsultant psyc hiatrist with the Raffles Hospital who was c alled by the sec ond defendant, was of the view that with a blood alc ohol c onc entration of 68mg/100ml, the dec eased would have suffered a signific ant impairment of his driving ability at the time of the ac c ident. He c ited as authority for his c onc lusion, a paper by Dr Danny Lo Siaw Tec k and Dr Rasiah Gunasegaram, “Alc ohol fac ts you should know before your first drink” (1991) Sc ientific Review 3(2): 1-3 published by the Institute of Sc ienc e and Forensic Medic ine, where the authors stated at 3: 

 It must be emphasized that different people may be affec ted differently at the same blood alc ohol level. As far as drinking and driving is c onc erned, two separate studies c onduc ted on experienc ed drivers seem to suggest that there was no ‘safe’ blood alc ohol level bec ause even at very low levels (below 50 mg per c ent), some impairment of judgment was noted. 

32     Three observations c an be made on this passage. Firstly, the authors have taken pains to emphasise that different people may reac t differently. Sec ondly, they were referring to “ _some_ impairment of judgment”, not suc h impairment that renders a person unfit to drive. Thirdly, they did not state the blood alc ohol c onc entration at whic h the impairment of judgment would be so severe as to render _all_ persons unfit to drive, probably bec ause different persons reac t differently. 

33     Prof Edmund Lee, a c linic al pharmac ologist with the Department of Pharmac ology of the National University of Singapore and witness for the plaintiff, was asked to explain the fac tors by whic h alc ohol affec ts the ability to drive. His position was more nuanc ed than Dr Lim’s: 

 A lot of these fac tors, I must say, are poorly defined or understood at this point in time. We do know that there is a lot of inter-individual variability, you know, in the response of spec ific individuals to --at a c ertain blood level of alc ohol. In general, there is a c onsensus that, within broad bands, there would be kind of broad bands of impairment of neurologic al skills and c oordination and things like that. But it is very diffic ult to be very prec ise as to what level of 68 milligrams per 100 ml ac tually represent in terms of spec ific degree of impairment in any given individual. 

and 


 I would say that any individual with a blood alc ohol c onc entration of 68 milligrams per 100 mls would have signific ant degree of impairment of c oordination and motor skills. But what prec ise level of impairment, I don’t think anybody c an ac tually measure spec ific ally or determine spec ific ally. So I would say that it’s probably fairly spec ulative to know ac tually how muc h impairment there is for this person. 

whic h was no more than Dr Lo and Dr Gunasegaram had explained in the first sentenc e of the passage of their artic le whic h I have set out. 

34     No authority was presented before me whic h states that a blood alc ohol c onc entration of 50mg/100ml, or 68mg/100ml will affec t all persons suc h that they would not be able to drive properly. 

35     It is safe to assume the question of a permissible blood alc ohol c onc entration was given c areful c onsideration when Parliament adopted 80mg/100ml as the presc ribed limit in s 67 of the Road Traffic Ac t (Cap 276, 1997 Rev Ed) for a person to drive a motor vehic le. Sec tion 67(1) provides: 

 Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehic le on a road or other public plac e — 

 ( a ) is unfit to drive in that he is under the influenc e of drink or of a drug or an intoxic ating substanc e to suc h an extent as to be inc apable of having proper c ontrol of suc h vehic le; or 

 ( b ) has so muc h alc ohol in his body that the proportion of it in his breath or blood exc eeds the presc ribed limit, 

 shall be guilty of an offenc e ... 

36     When a person drives with a blood alc ohol c onc entration in exc ess of 80mg/100ml, he is guilty of an offenc e under s 67(1)( _b_ ) and fac es the same punishment as he would if he was found to be unfit to drive from the influenc e of alc ohol. If his blood alc ohol c onc entration is below 80mg/100ml, however, he has c ommitted no offenc e unless he is unfit to drive. 

37     Dr Lim and the sec ond defendant have c ome to the c onc lusion they did on the basis that as a 50mg/100ml blood alc ohol c onc entration c an affec t the ability of some people to drive, a 68mg/100ml c onc entration must have affec ted the dec eased’s ability to drive. 

38     This is not justified. Statutes c an set standards where sc ientific c ertainty is lac king, and s 67 was enac ted to make it an offenc e to drive when one’s blood alc ohol c onc entration exc eeds 80mg/100ml. Where the blood alc ohol c onc entration is below 80mg/100ml, the Road Traffic Ac t has refrained from taking any position on the person’s right or ability to drive. There is no presumption that a person with a blood alc ohol c onc entration of 80mg/100ml or more is unfit to drive. If he is to be guilty of any offenc e, it would be for an offenc e under s 67(1)( _b_ ) for driving with an exc essive blood alc ohol c onc entration. A person who drives when he is under the influenc e of drink and is unfit to drive is guilty of an offenc e under s 67(1)( _a_ ), whether his blood alc ohol c onc entration is above or below the presc ribed limit. Against this bac kdrop, there is no basis for treating a blood alc ohol c onc entration of 68mg/100ml _per se_ as evidenc e of unfitness to drive. 

39     There was some evidenc e on the dec eased’s drinking and c ondition on that fateful day. This c ame from Mic hael Andrew Negus, his c olleague and friend of more than 20 years. Negus’ evidenc e was that the dec eased was with him and his wife at a bar known as Handlebar at Alexandra Road at 


about 7.15pm and that the dec eased had two glasses of beer before he left at about 8.00pm. Negus added that: 

 I have known the Dec eased for many years and I know the Dec eased c ould assimilate alc ohol very well. On many oc c asions, we were drinking together, both on soc ial and more formal business oc c asions. Soc ially we attended barbeques at our respec tive homes, rode together on trips to Malaysia and Thailand and generally c rossed paths at soc ial events on frequent oc c asions. The Dec eased is not someone who will be affec ted by 2 glasses of alc ohol. 

Counsel for the sec ond defendant did not raise any questions on the last sentenc e. 

40     What is the evidenc e on the dec eased’s fitness to ride his motorc yc le? There is evidenc e that the blood alc ohol c onc entration in his blood was at a level that c ould have affec ted some people’s ability to drive, but there is no evidenc e that the alc ohol had affec ted him so that he was unfit to ride, and no evidenc e that he was not riding properly when the ac c ident took plac e. 

41     I find that the bus driver was wholly to blame for the ac c ident and that the sec ond defendant had failed to make out any c ase of negligenc e against the dec eased. Interloc utory judgment will be entered against the sec ond defendant, with damages to be assessed by the Registrar. The plaintiff will have the c osts of the ac tion up to this stage.
