**Tay Yong Kwang J:** 

**Introduction** 

1       The plaintiff is the administratrix of the estate of the late Milakov Steven (“MS”). Dr Tong Ming Chuan (“Dr Tong”) is a c ardiothorac ic surgeon who performed a redo c oronary artery bypass graft surgery (“the redoCABG”) on MS on 12 Marc h 2007. On 23 April 2007, 6 weeks after the redoCABG, MS passed away from post-operative c omplic ations. The plaintiff brought a c laim in tort and c ontrac t against Dr Tong, alleging that Dr Tong was negligent and/or in breac h of c ontrac t in relation to the medic al advic e, c are and treatment that he rendered to MS between 9 Marc h 2007 and 23 April 2007. 

2       The trial before me was c onfined to the issue of liability. 

**The parties** 

3       The plaintiff and MS were married in 1989. Letters of Administration of the estate of MS were granted to the plaintiff on 22 Marc h 2010 and the grant was extrac ted on 15 April 2010. The plaintiff brought this ac tion against Dr Tong for damages for the benefit of the dependants of MS under ss 20 and 21 of the Civil Law Ac t (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Civil Law Ac t”) and for the benefit of the estate of MS under s 10 of the Civil Law Ac t. The dependants of MS are: 

 The plaintiff, the lawful widow and next-of-kin, born on 19 July 1951 and presently 60 years of age; 

 Stac ey Anne Moody, the lawful daughter and next-of-kin, a c itizen of USA, a married woman, born on 24 November 1972 and presently 39 years old; and 

 Tim Milakov, the lawful son and next-of-kin, c itizen of USA, a married man, born on 10 April 


 1976 and presently 35 years old. 

4       Dr Tong is a Consultant Cardiothorac ic Surgeon in private prac tic e with over 28 years of experienc e in c ardiothorac ic surgery. He prac tises at a c linic in Mount Elizabeth Medic al Centre. MS was referred to and first saw Dr Tong on 9 Marc h 2007. Dr Tong performed the redoCABG on MS on 12 Marc h 2007. From 12 Marc h 2007 to 23 April 2007 (“the post-surgery period”), MS was c ared for in the Coronary Care Unit at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. Dr Tong was MS’s primary physic ian during the post-surgery period. 

5       MS was 65 years of age at the time of his death. He was an Americ an c itizen and held Permanent Residenc e status in Singapore. Prior to his death, MS was engaged on a c ontrac tual basis by M/s Chevron Inc , a multinational c ompany based in the United States of Americ a (“USA”), as a c onsultant on matters relating to c ommunic ation skills, brand management and public relations. He was also an author of a number of books and artic les. His average monthly earnings were around $16,250 per month when he passed away. MS had a history of borderline diabetes and hypertension. Notwithstanding these c onditions, before suffering his first major adverse c ardiac event (“MACE”) on 17 January 2007, MS had been in good health. The plaintiff testified that MS led an ac tive lifestyle and was ac c ustomed to exerc ising five or six times a week regularly. 

**The background** 

6       For the purposes of determining liability, it is nec essary to understand the events leading up to this c laim. The key medic al terms will be defined where nec essary to fac ilitate understanding. The fac ts and definitions are undisputed unless the c ontrary is indic ated. 

**_The first MACE suffered by MS and the treatment he received at St Joseph Medical Centre, Houston (“SJMC”)_** 

7       On 17 January 2007, when MS was in Houston, USA, he experienc ed left-side bac k tightness ac c ompanied by some nausea while doing his normal routine physic al exerc ise. This exerc ise routine c omprised of a walk whic h usually lasted about 45 minutes to an hour. After MS felt unwell during the c ourse of the walk, the plaintiff, who was walking with him, ac c ompanied him home to rest. As MS c ontinued to feel unwell, the plaintiff brought him to SJMC on the same day to seek medic al attention. 

MS was diagnosed as suffering from isc haemia (insuffic ient blood supply to the heart musc les), [note: 1] and angina pec toris (c hest pain, a symptom of isc haemia). These c onditions are distinc t from an 

ac ute myoc ardial infarc tion (“AMI”) (more c ommonly known as a heart attac k). MS did not suffer an AMI on 17 January 2007. This was the first time he suffered a MACE. 

8       MS underwent a c oronary angiography on 18 January 2007. A c oronary angiography is a proc edure to visualise the c oronary arteries. To c onduc t an angiography, the c atheter is inserted into 

a large artery in the groin or the wrist (in MS’s c ase, the femoral artery was selec ted), [note: 2] then advanc ed to the heart and positioned at the mouths of the c oronary arteries before injec tion is performed. To see the c oronary arteries, a spec ial dye or c ontrast medium is injec ted through the c atheter. The dye will “opac ify” the vessels and thus makes them visible on the angiogram. Coronary angiography may be said to be an invasive proc edure. This proc edure is c arried out to determine whether there is any signific ant narrowing or bloc kage (“stenosis”) in the c oronary arteries. Stenosis of the vessels may be c aused by c oronary artery disease. Where there is stenosis, the blood flow to the heart musc les bec omes restric ted, whic h in turn may c ause isc haemia, angina pec toris and AMI. [note: 3]

9       The c oronary angiography revealed that MS had c oronary artery disease and that the following blood vessels had bec ome stenosed: 

 the left main c oronary artery (“LMCA”); 

 the left anterior desc ending arterial system (“LAD”); 

 the c irc umflex artery (“Cx”); and 

 the right c oronary arterial system (“RCA”). 

10     MS was advised by his doc tors in SJMC to undergo a c oronary artery bypass graft surgery (“CABG”). A CABG is a surgery whic h allows for c oronary revasc ularisation. Revasc ularisation refers to intervention to restore or improve blood supply to the heart. If c oronary revasc ularisation is desired, there are two proc edures that may be performed, namely, a CABG or a perc utaneous c oronary intervention (“PCI”). The suitability of eac h proc edure is dependent on the partic ular patient. The aim 

of a CABG is to insert one or more grafts to the c oronary arteries to bypass the stenosed areas. [note: 4] This revasc ularisation will help to ensure that an adequate supply of blood c ontinues to reac h the 

heart musc les. This is important as oxygen and nutrients, whic h are vital for musc le survival, are transported through the blood. To perform a CABG, the patient is first put under general anaesthesia. The surgeon then makes an inc ision down the middle of the patient’s c hest and saws through his breastbone. The blood vessels whic h are to be used as grafts will be harvested. The two types of vessels c ommonly used as grafts are saphenous veins and internal mammary arteries. The heart will then be stopped, and the patient plac ed on a c ardiopulmonary bypass mac hine. A c ross c lamp will be plac ed ac ross the aorta to prevent blood returning to the heart and a c ardioplegia solution administered to prevent c ell death within the heart. The grafts will then be inserted. Following this, the patient will be removed from the bypass mac hine. To c omplete the surgery, the surgeon will stop any bleeding, wire the breastbone together, and c lose the inc ision. As c an be seen from this brief desc ription of a CABG, the surgery is a major one. 

11     On his doc tors’ advic e, MS underwent a triple CABG on 19 January 2007 (“the initial CABG”). The initial CABG performed at SJMC involved the insertion of three grafts: 

 A saphenous vein graft (“SVG”) from the aorta to a marginal branc h of the Cx (“Graft 1”). There was a dispute at trial about the position of Graft 1, but both sides ac c epted that this was inc onsequential. 

 A SVG from the aorta to another marginal branc h of the Cx (“Graft 2”). 

 A left internal mammary artery (“LIMA”) graft to the LAD (“the LIMA-LAD graft”). 


**_Recovery after the initial CABG_** 

12     Following the initial CABG, MS made good rec overy, and returned to Singapore in February 2007. Upon his return to Singapore, MS c onsulted his regular general prac titioner, one Dr Mic hael Chua, as his doc tors in SJMC had suggested routine medic al reviews. Dr Mic hael Chua in turn opined that MS would benefit from regular c hec k-ups by a c ardiologist and rec ommended one Dr Christopher Chew, an interventional c ardiologist at Mount Elizabeth Medic al Centre. 

13     On 23 February 2007, MS c onsulted Dr Christopher Chew at his c linic. Dr Christopher Chew c onduc ted some tests on MS. MS performed within the ac c eptable range of results for the tests. Dr Christopher Chew thus advised MS that he was rec overing well and that he c ould c ontinue with his usual exerc ises and lifestyle. Even so, MS adopted a more sedentary lifestyle and rested at home as he was on medic al leave after the initial CABG. 

**_The second MACE suffered by MS and the treatment he received at Mount Elizabeth Hospital (“MEH”)_** 

14     At around 5.00am on 9 Marc h 2007, MS experienc ed some c hest pain. He presented himself at the Ac c ident and Emergenc y Department of MEH for a c onsultation at around 6.00am and requested to see Dr Christopher Chew. It is not disputed that on 9 Marc h 2007, MS suffered an AMI. This was the first AMI that MS suffered. 

15     Dr Christopher Chew examined MS and performed a c oronary angiography on him at or about 8.45am on 9 Marc h 2007. It is not disputed that the angiogram suggested that Graft 1 and Graft 2 w e re c ompletely oc c luded. The Cardiac Catheterization Report stated that a “total bloc k” had 

oc c urred in Graft 1 and Graft 2. [note: 5] The oc c lusion would mean that no blood c ould flow through those grafts, thus c utting off the supply of oxygen and nutrients to areas of heart musc le downstream of the grafts. Dr Christopher Chew opined that the AMI had been c aused by the oc c lusion of Graft 1 and Graft 2. With regard to the LIMALAD graft, there was a substantial dispute at trial as to its patenc y. The signific anc e of this dispute will be seen in the disc ussion on whether the redo-CABG was an indic ated and/or appropriate treatment. 

16     Dr Christopher Chew then rec ommended that MS obtain a surgic al opinion from a c ardiothorac ic surgeon. MS was agreeable to this and Dr Christopher Chew referred him to Dr Tong. At or about 12.00 noon on 9 Marc h 2007, Dr Tong examined MS. It is c lear that the option of a redoCABG was proposed by Dr Tong to MS at this first meeting. The suffic ienc y of the advic e given by Dr Tong to MS on the risks of the redo-CABG and on alternative treatment options is disputed. 

17     On 12 Marc h 2007, Dr Tong c arried out the redoCABG on MS. This was some 7 weeks after the initial CABG c onduc ted at SJMC. A redoCABG is essentially similar to an initial CABG. It is, however, a muc h riskier surgery, partic ularly when the redoCABG is performed within a short period of time from the initial surgery. The fac t that MS’s redoCABG involved a higher degree of risk than his initial CABG was not disputed by Dr Tong. After an initial CABG, the heart takes some time to rec over from the operation. There would be sc arring of the tissues in the c hest, with adhesions between the heart and peric ardium and between the peric ardium and the breastbone. The c loser the proximity in time to the initial CABG, the more highly vasc ularised the sc ar tissue and inc ision of suc h tissue would result in a high degree of blood loss. Therefore, a redoCABG performed shortly after an initial CABG would involve heavier blood loss than the initial CABG. A surgeon doing a redoCABG would need to proc eed slowly, c auterising the vessels to minimise blood loss and would also need to proc eed c autiously to avoid severing grafts from the initial CABG that remained patent. This would result in an inc reased entry time into the c hest whic h would c ause the redoCABG to take more time to c omplete than an

initial CABG. 

18     MS’s redoCABG started at 9.00am and ended at 6.55pm on 12 Marc h 2007, _ie_ , the surgery lasted c lose to 10 hours. During the surgery, MS was plac ed on the c ardiopulmonary bypass for 333 minutes, and the c ross c lamp time was 140 minutes. Three new grafts were inserted during the surgery: two SVG grafts to the marginal branc hes of the Cx and a right internal mammary artery (“RIMA”) graft to the diagonal branc h of the LAD. Following this, the bleeding had to be c ontrolled before the surgery was c ompleted. The usual methods of c ontrolling bleeding, _ie_ , an infusion of platelets and fresh frozen plasma were administered to MS. However, these failed to stop the bleeding, and 2.4 mg of Ac tivated Fac tor VII (a c lotting agent) was then administered. This ac hieved haemostasis (the stopping of bleeding). MS’s c hest was then c losed and the surgery c ompleted. 

19     After the surgery, MS was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit at MEH. While in the Coronary Care Unit during the post-surgery period, MS developed post-operative c omplic ations inc luding infec tion and sepsis whic h seriously c ompromised his health. On 23 April 2007, 42 days after the redoCABG, MS passed away from multi-organ failure. 

**The plaintiff’s claim** 

20     The plaintiff partic ularised her c laim in the tort of negligenc e c omprehensively under 17 subparagraphs. Broadly, her c laim fall under three headings. 

21     First, the plaintiff c laimed that Dr Tong was negligent in rec ommending that MS undergo the redoCABG. This c laim c entres on whether the redoCABG was an indic ated and/or appropriate treatment for MS. It is a distinc t and logic ally prior c laim to the sec ond group of issues on the duty to advise (at [22]), as the patient should only be advised about indic ated and/or appropriate treatments. The plaintiff c laimed that the urgent redoCABG in this c ase was not an appropriate treatment for the following reasons: 

 Dr Tong failed to adequately c onsider the proximity in time between MS’s initial CABG and the proposed redo-CABG; 

 Dr Tong failed to adequately c onsider MS’s improving health and stable c ondition between 9 and 11 Marc h 2007; 

 Dr Tong failed to c arry out further tests to assess the need for an urgent redo-CABG; and 

 The less risky alternative treatment options of optimal medic al treatment (“OMT”) and PCI were available. 

22     Sec ond, the plaintiff c laimed that Dr Tong failed in his duty of c are to advise MS on the redoCABG for the following reasons: 

 Dr Tong failed to provide suffic ient information regarding the mortality rate for redoCABGs and had underestimated the risk of the surgery to be at 3%;

 (iii) 

 (iv) 

 (v) 

 (i) 

 (ii) 

 (iii) 

 (iv) 

 Dr Tong failed to provide suffic ient information to MS about the morbidity risks assoc iated with redo-CABGs; 

 Dr Tong failed to inform MS about the risks assoc iated with the particular redoCABG he was about to undergo, given that it was to be c arried out only some 7 weeks after the initial CABG and only three days after his AMI; 

 Dr Tong failed to inform MS of the option to postpone the redo-CABG; and 

 Dr Tong failed to inform MS of the alternative treatment options of OMT and PCI. 

23     Third, the plaintiff c laimed that Dr Tong was negligent in the ac tual performanc e of the redoCABG for the following reasons: 

 Dr Tong failed to use retrograde c ardioplegia to protec t MS’s heart; 

 The surgery was prolonged with a c ardiopulmonary bypass time of 333 minutes; 

 The RIMA should not have been harvested and grafted onto the “diagonal system” of the LAD; and 

 Ac tivated Fac tor VII should not have been used. 

24     The plaintiff also made c orresponding parallel c laims based on the c ontrac tual duties whic h Dr Tong owed to MS. 

25     It is noted that the plaintiff made no c laim with regard to Dr Tong’s post-operative c are of MS. 

**The defence** 

26     Dr Tong denied the plaintiff’s c laims. I summarise the salient points of the defenc e here. Where possible, I have enumerated the defenc e to c orrespond to the plaintiff’s c laim. 

27     First, Dr Tong averred that a redoCABG was indic ated and appropriate for MS given his evolving infarc tion, poor c oronary c ondition and the c omplete oc c lusion of Graft 1 and Graft 2. He further averred that PCI was not a viable option for MS. MS’s c ondition and prognosis without the redo-CABG was very poor and it was more likely than not that he would die within three years without the redo-CABG. 

28     Sec ond, regarding his advic e to MS, Dr Tong stated he had fulfilled his duty of c are in advising MS for the following reasons: 


 (i) 

 (ii) 

 (iii) 

 (iv) 

 (i) 

 (ii) 

 (iii) 

 He had “warned MS that the mortality risk of a redoCABG was about 3% ( ie , higher than an initial CABG) and that there was also a small risk of stroke”. Dr Tong further averred that based on his knowledge and experienc e, it was reasonable to advise of a 3% mortality risk. (It must be noted that Dr Tong’s c ase at trial on this point diverged from his pleaded c ase); 

 He had provided MS with suffic ient information about the morbidity risks assoc iated with the redo-CABG; 

 He had informed MS on 10 Marc h 2007 of the option to postpone the redoCABG as MS’s angina pec toris had resolved bec ause of medic al treatment; and 

 He had informed MS of the alternative treatment option of OMT but also told MS that MS’s prognosis would be poor under that option. Dr Tong advised that given MS’s poor c oronary c ondition, MS c ould proc eed with the redoCABG or risk further angina pec toris and/or another AMI (whic h might lead to death). 

29     In addition, Dr Tong asserted that MS had disc ussed the redoCABG with Dr Christopher Chew and Dr Suelyn Chew (the anaesthetist involved in MS’s redoCABG) in separate c onsultations. This was on top of MS’s disc ussions with Dr Tong himself. 

30     Third, Dr Tong explained that the redoCABG was not c arried out negligently for the following reasons: 

 Adequate steps had been taken to protec t the func tionality of MS’s heart during surgery, inc luding the use of antegrade blood c ardioplegia; 

 The surgery was long as it was c omplic ated and tec hnic ally diffic ult. The sternum was densely adhered to the anterior surfac e of the heart, requiring extensive time to free it. The c oronary bypass time (333 minutes) was long bec ause the distal LAD was very heavily c alc ified and the Cx was “stony hard” and c ould not be grafted; and 

 Ac tivated Fac tor VII was required to stop the exc essive bleeding. 

**Issues** 

31     Muc h of the time at trial was spent c ross-examining the expert witnesses over the first thrust of the plaintiff’s c laim on whether the redoCABG should even have been rec ommended to MS as an option. However, the plaintiff’s written submissions dealt largely only with the sec ond thrust of her c laim, that is, whether Dr Tong was negligent in advising MS regarding the redoCABG. The plaintiff did not strenuously pursue the third thrust of her c laim (c onc erning the negligent c onduc t of the redo-CABG) during trial or in her written submissions. 


 (a) 

 (b) 

 (c ) 

32     Nevertheless, the three issues to be dec ided are as follows: 

 first, whether Dr Tong breac hed the tortious and c ontrac tual duties of c are he owed to MS in rec ommending that MS undergo the redo-CABG; 

 sec ond, whether Dr Tong breac hed the tortious and c ontrac tual duties of c are he owed to MS in advising MS regarding the redo-CABG; 

 third, whether Dr Tong breac hed the tortious and c ontrac tual duties of c are he owed to MS in c arrying out the redo-CABG surgery. 

I will deal with the issues in the order set out above. 

**The legal framework: the Bolam test, as supplemented by Bolitho** 

33     In Singapore, the legal framework for medic al negligenc e was set out by the Court of Appeal in _Khoo James v Gunapathy d/o Muniandy_ <span class="citation">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 1024</span> (“ _Gunapathy_ ”). I am guided by the approac h taken in _Gunapathy_ where the Court of Appeal opined at [4] that it was desirable to “set out the applic able law at the outset in order to keep a tight rein on the arguments” before the c ourt, as “the c art must be put before the horse to prevent it from galloping off on an erroneous tangent”. 

34     In _Gunapathy_ , the Court of Appeal c onduc ted a c omprehensive review of the jurisprudenc e following from the seminal c ase of _Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee_ [1957] 1 WLR 582 (“ _Bolam_ ”), and affirmed that the test laid down in _Bolam_ (“the _Bolam_ test”) and supplemented by _Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority_ [1998] AC 232 (“ _Bolitho_ ” ) was the applic able test in Singapore. 

35     The well-known _Bolam_ test c omprises two limbs. The first limb provides that when a situation involves some spec ial skill or c ompetenc e, the standard of c are the defendant will be held to is that of “the ordinary skilled man exerc ising and professing to have that spec ial skill” (at 586). Mc Nair J stated the sec ond limb as follows (at 587): 

 [A doc tor] is not guilty of negligenc e if he has ac ted in ac c ordanc e with a prac tic e ac c epted as proper by a responsible body of medic al men skilled in that partic ular art ... Putting it the other way round, a man is not negligent, if he is ac ting in ac c ordanc e with suc h a prac tic e, merely bec ause there is a body of opinion that takes a c ontrary view. 

36     Subsequent c ases whic h interpreted and applied t he _Bolam_ test had the unintended effec t of “[c onferring] near-immunity to the medic al profession from ac tions in negligenc e” ( _Gunapathy_ at [58]). 

37     In _Bolitho_ , the House of Lords did a timely review of the sec ond limb of the _Bolam_ test and c larified that the c ourt was not bound to find for a defendant doc tor simply bec ause a body of experts testified in his favour (at 241 – 242): 

 ... [T]he c ourt is not bound to hold that a defendant doc tor esc apes liability for negligent treatment or diagnosis just bec ause he leads evidenc e from a number of medic al experts who are 


 genuinely of opinion that the defendant’s treatment or diagnosis ac c orded with sound medic al prac tic e ... the c ourt has to be satisfied that the exponents of the body of opinion relied upon c an demonstrate that suc h opinion has a logic al basis. In partic ular in c ases involving, as they so often do, the weighing of risks against benefits, the judge before ac c epting a body of opinion as being responsible, reasonable or respec table, will need to be satisfied that, in forming their views, the experts have direc ted their minds to the question of c omparative risks and benefits and have reac hed a defensible c onc lusion on the matter. 

 [emphasis added] 

38     While the House of Lords was c onc erned to emphasise that not all expert opinions would be ac c epted, it was also quic k to emphasise that it would be a _rare_ c ase where the opinion did not meet the threshold test of logic (at 243): 

 In the vast majority of c ases the fac t that distinguished experts in the field are of a partic ular opinion will demonstrate the reasonableness of that opinion. In partic ular, where there are questions of assessment of the relative risks and benefits of adopting a partic ular medic al prac tic e, a reasonable view nec essarily presupposes that the relative risks and benefits have been weighed by the experts in forming their opinions. But if, in a rare c ase, it c an be demonstrated that the professional opinion is not c apable of withstanding logic al analysis, the judge is entitled to hold that the body of opinion is not reasonable or responsible. 

 I emphasise that in my view it will very seldom be right for a judge to reac h the c onc lusion that views genuinely held by a c ompetent medic al expert are unreasonable. The assessment of medic al risks and benefits is a matter of c linic al judgment whic h a judge would not normally be able to make without expert evidenc e ... it would be wrong to allow suc h assessment to deteriorate into seeking to persuade the judge to prefer one of two views both of whic h are c apable of being logic ally supported. It is only where a judge c an be satisfied that the body of expert opinion c annot be logic ally supported at all that suc h opinion will not provide the benc hmark by referenc e to whic h Dr Tong's c onduc t falls to be assessed. 

39     The Court of Appeal in _Gunapathy_ (at [63]) opined that “ _Bolitho_ presented a timely addendum to the _Bolam_ test”, as it “gave voic e to a c ommonsense understanding whic h was hitherto unexpressed – that the _Bolam_ test did not represent immunity from judic ial inquiry over the medic al proc ess”. The _Bolitho_ c aveat was that in order for an expert view to qualify as a “responsible” body of medic al opinion, it had to satisfy the threshold test of logic. Therefore, the question was what the threshold test of logic entailed and this was examined in _Gunapathy_ at [64]: 

 64 ... Lord BrowneWilkinson desc ribed it as an essentially two-stage inquiry and we would respec tfully adopt his analysis. The first inquiry , ac c ording to the learned Law Lord, is whether the expert directed his mind at all to the comparative risks and benefits relating to the matter. It is ac c ordingly the proc ess and not the result of the expert's reasoning that is material in the eyes of the c ourt. The c ourt must be satisfied that the expert had c onsidered and weighed all the c ountervailing fac tors relevant to the issue. Bare and unsupported assertions in this respec t would thus fail the test at this stage. 

 6 5 The second stage of inquiry relates to whether the medical expert had arrived at a 'defensible conclusion' as a result of the balancing process ... To our minds, a 'defensible c onc lusion' c onnotes the satisfac tion of two c onc epts. First, the medical opinion must be internally consistent on its face. It must make c ogent sense as a whole, suc h that no part of the opinion c ontradic ts with another. A doc tor c annot say, for example, that he supports a c ertain 


 approac h and attest that in that very situation, he would nevertheless have done quite the opposite. Second, the opinion should not fly in the face of proven extrinsic facts relevant to the matter. It should not ignore or c ontrovert known medic al fac ts or advanc es in medic al knowledge. 

 [emphasis added] 

40     The Court of Appeal also unequivoc ally stated that “judges and lawyers should not play at being doc tors” and thus should not enter the fray that is the arena of divided medic al opinion, as the “lawyer-judge, while eminently equipped to follow suc h arguments, finds himself quite out of his depth when c alled upon to adjudic ate over them” (at [3]). Therefore, _Bolitho_ c annot be understood to “herald invasive inquiry into the merits of medic al opinion”. 

**Issue 1: Whether Dr Tong breached the tortious and contractual duties of care he owed to MS in recommending that he undergo the redo-CABG** 

41     The question of whether a partic ular medic al intervention is justifiable is the starting point of the inquiry. If the proc edure in question is not justifiable, then a patient would not need to be advised of that proc edure and, in fac t, should not be advised of suc h a proc edure. The issue of whether the partic ular proc edure is justifiable at all must also be c onsidered before the issue of whether the performanc e of that proc edure was negligent. _Jackson & Powell on Professional Liability_ (Sweet and 

Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2007) (“Jac kson & Powell”) at paragraph 13-087 lists the following c onsiderations to be taken into ac c ount in determining this issue: 

 Whether or not the intervention undertaken c an be justified will be determined by the extent of investigation, c onsideration of less “invasive” regimes or management, and on expert opinion of the appropriateness of the treatment used. 

While it is undisputed in the instant c ase that MS signed a c onsent form on 11 Marc h 2007, prior to the redoCABG, a patient’s c onsent to a medic al proc edure is not a defenc e in c irc umstanc es where no reasonably c ompetent medic al prac titioner would have proc eeded at all. In _Doughty v North Straffordshire HA_ [1992] 3 Med LR 81, the patient in question c onsented to the treatment but the defendants were held liable under the _Bolam_ test as no body of reasonably c ompetent medic al opinion would have exposed the patient to suc h treatment. 

**_MS’ coronary anatomy_** 

_MS had a left dominant coronary anatomy_ 

42     Before going into the expert evidenc e, it is nec essary to have an apprec iation of MS’s c oronary anatomy. It was undisputed among the experts on both sides that while most people have right dominant c oronary anatomies, MS’s c oronary anatomy was left dominant. While a left dominant c oronary anatomy is not problematic in itself, it is a feature that was unequivoc ally ac c epted by the experts to have had implic ations for surgery. 

43     A right dominant person has arterial blood supplied to the left ventric le of the heart split proportionally among the three main c oronary arteries approximately as follows: RCA (25%), Cx (15%), LAD (60%). The supply from the RCA to the left ventric le c omes from the RCA’s supply of blood to the posterior desc ending artery (“the PDA”), an artery that reac hes the c rux of the heart and perfuses some of the left ventric le’s musc les along the way. On the other hand, a left dominant person’s PDA is supplied by the Cx and not the RCA. This means that the RCA supplies negligible blood 


 (a) 

to the left ventric le, whic h then depends entirely on the left c oronary arterial system (“the LCA”) for its supply of oxygenated blood. The LCA is the arterial system whic h inc ludes the LMCA, the Cx and the LAD (see [9] above). The Cx and the LAD are smaller (but still extremely vital) arteries whic h are supplied by the larger LMCA. 

44     The left ventric le of the heart pumps oxygenated blood from the heart into the aorta to be transported to the rest of the body. In the words of Dr Ric hard Cooke (“Dr Cooke”), one of the plaintiff’s experts, the left ventric le “is the most important c hamber” of the heart and also “the c hamber upon whic h life depends”. As MS was left dominant, his RCA c arried negligible amounts of blood to the left ventric le. His Cx, however, was dominant and larger than in most c ases, and c ompensated for negligible blood flow via the RCA by supplying oxygenated blood to the PDA (whic h would be supplied by the RCA in the more c ommon anatomy of the right dominant person). 

45     The upshot of all this is that while a right dominant person’s Cx is responsible for around 15% of the oxygenated blood supply to the left ventric le, MS’s Cx was responsible for almost 40% of the said supply. It was thus c lear that the c ontinued viability of MS’s Cx was vital. 

_The diseased state of MS’s coronary arterial system_ 

46     It was unc ontroversial that MS’s c oronary arterial system was severely diseased. We have already established that MS’s LAD and Cx were responsible for most (if not all) of the supply of oxygenated blood to his left ventric le. As explained above, both his LAD and his Cx were supplied by the LMCA. From a reading of the angiogram, the expert witnesses opined that MS’s LMCA suffered a 50% stenosis. 

47     I have explained above that c oronary angiography involves shooting dye through a patient’s c oronary arterial system in order to visualise it. An angiogram c omprises a series of videos (taken from different angles) of the dye passing through the patient’s blood vessels. The experts were allowed to give a running c ommentary on MS’s angiogram as they were being c ross-examined in c ourt. It was demonstrated to the c ourt that as the dye was shot through MS’s LMCA, the visible dye flow tapered to 50% of its width at the mid LMCA. This allowed the experts to determine that MS had a 50% stenosis at the mid LMCA. It was also explained to the c ourt (and this ac c ords with simple physic s) that a 50% stenosis ( _ie_ , a reduc tion of the diameter of the vessel by half ) would c orrespond to a reduc tion in the c ross-sec tional area to 25%. Therefore, the blood c arrying c apac ity of MS’s LMCA, whic h supplied most of the blood to MS’s left ventric le, had been reduc ed by disease to 25% of its normal c apac ity. 

48     The non-viability of MS’s c oronary system was c ompounded by further disease in MS’s Cx and LAD. Dr Tong stated that MS’s Cx was 99% stenosed at its ostium ( _ie_ where it originated from the LMCA). Dr Christopher Blauth (“Dr Blauth”), one of the plaintiff’s experts, was not prepared to ac c ept the 99% figure, but readily c onc eded that the stenosis was “definitely very tight”. As for MS’s LAD, while the experts disagreed on the patenc y of the LIMALAD graft, it was unc ontroversial that the LAD system was diffusedly stenosed. The supply of blood to MS’s left ventric le and the rest of his body was thus c ompromised. 

**_The evidence of the plaintiff’s experts_** 

49     The plaintiff c alled four experts, three of whom I have already mentioned above. They were: 

 Dr Blauth, a c onsultant c ardiac surgeon and c linic al head for c ardiac surgery at the Cardiothorac ic Centre at the Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust in London; 


 (b) 

 (c ) 

 (d) 

 Dr Cooke, a c onsultant c ardiologist at the Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Trust and South Kent NHS Trust; 

 Dr Sanjay Sharma (“Dr Sharma”), a c onsultant c ardiothorac ic surgeon at Fremantle Hospital in Western Australia; and 

 Dr Alan Patric k Whelan (“Dr Whelan”), an interventional c ardiologist at the Fremantle Hospital in Western Australia in private prac tic e. 

50     This is an appropriate junc ture to distinguish between the job sc opes of c ardiothorac ic surgeons and c ardiologists. Cardiothorac ic surgeons, suc h as Dr Tong, are qualified to do open heart surgeries suc h as CABGs and redoCABGs. Where the proc edure to be performed is non-surgic al, this will fall outside of the provinc e of c ardiothorac ic surgeons, _eg_ , c ardiothorac ic surgeons do not c arry o u t PCI as it is a non-surgic al proc edure. Proc edures suc h as PCI are more properly within the provinc e of interventional c ardiologists suc h as Dr Christopher Chew. Cardiologists do not perform surgic al proc edures. Cardiothorac ic surgeons and c ardiologists thus c omplement one another and often work together in teams. 

51     The plaintiff’s experts took the view that a redoCABG was not indic ated and that Dr Tong breac hed his duty of c are by referring MS for a redo-CABG. In their view, MS’s c ondition had stabilised in the days after his AMI. Dr Cooke stated in c ross-examination: 

 There was no reason to indic ate that that lesion [referring to the Cx ostial stenosis of 99% or so] was unstable. The heart attac k had been c aused by thrombosis in the vein grafts and not by thrombosis in the native c oronary artery. The patient had no further c hest pain after the heart attac k had been c ompleted, so there were no c linic al pointers to the fac t that that lesion in the native c oronary artery may have been unstable. 

52     In addition, the plaintiff’s experts were of the opinion that the LIMALAD graft was patent and demonstrated “brisk flow” into the distal LAD. The experts found that sinc e MS had no further angina onc e his heart attac k had settled, his prognosis would not be improved by an urgent redoCABG. As the plaintiff’s experts c onsidered revasc ularisation unnec essary (at least, unnec essary at that partic ular point in time so shortly after the AMI) they would have rec ommended that MS be put on OMT. OMT is the most c onservative treatment option for c oronary artery disease and does not ac hieve revasc ularisation, unlike PCI or CABG. OMT essentially c onsists of an intensive regimen of medic ation and lifestyle c hanges to try to reduc e the likelihood of a further MACE like an AMI. OMT may involve the administration of medic ation to c ontrol hypertension and/or thin the blood. 

53     Even if revasc ularisation was deemed nec essary, the plaintiff’s experts thought that it should have been done by way of PCI. PCI is a revasc ularisation proc edure whic h involves the use of balloons and stents to widen stenosed arteries and prevent them from subsequent narrowing for as long as possible. A balloon will be passed through the c oronary arteries to reac h the stenosed segments. The stenosed segment will then be dilated with the balloon under high pressure, and stents plac ed in the arteries to try to keep the artery open. 

54     It is unc ontroversial that it is preferable to c arry out PCI when the stenting proc edure is 


 (a) 

 (b) 

 (c ) 

 (a) 

 (b) 

“protec ted”, _ie_ , when the heart is protec ted by a good supply of blood from an additional artery while the stenting is being c arried out. The reason for this is that the patient is not plac ed on a bypass mac hine while PCI is being c arried out and, if in the c ourse of the proc edure, the artery being stented bec omes oc c luded, there will be no alternative supply of blood to the heart and the patient would go into an immediate AMI. In the view of the plaintiff’s experts, MS would be protec ted by the brisk flow through the LIMALAD graft and a PCI would thus be a low risk proc edure in his c ase. Dr Cooke went so far as to suggest that the stenting proc edure c arried an extremely low risk even if MS did not have a patent LIMALAD graft, stating that the aforementioned risk of c omplete oc c lusion would be less than 0.1%. 

55     Dr Sharma also pointed out that the redoCABG was a high risk surgery for several reasons, inc luding the possibility of heavy bleeding due to the adhesions of the heart resulting from the first CABG as well as the inc reased mortality risk arising from operating on a patient just following an AMI. The plaintiff’s experts c alc ulated the risk sc ore to be in the region of 14% from the EuroSCORE risk sc oring system and opined that Dr Tong’s risk estimate of 3% was a “c onsiderable underestimate”. [note: 6] The following exc erpt from Dr Sharma’s affidavit summarised the position of the plaintiff’s 

experts: 

 Henc e, I am of the opinion that advic e to [MS] to undergo RedoCABG surgery was below reasonably ac c eptable standards expec ted of a reasonably c ompetent c ardiothorac ic surgeon in the c irc umstanc es. In fac t the risks involved in undergoing a RedoCABG heavily outweighed the benefits the patient would have rec eived. [note: 7] 

**_The evidence of Dr Tong’s witnesses and experts_** 

56     Dr Tong took the stand himself. He also c alled the following fac tual witnesses: 

 Dr Christopher Chew, the c onsultant interventional c ardiologist at the Mount Elizabeth Medic al Centre, who was MS’s c ardiologist; 

 Dr Tan Yong Seng (“Dr Tan”), a c onsultant c ardiothorac ic surgeon at Gleneagles Medic al Centre, who was the assistant surgeon during MS’s redo-CABG; and 

 Dr Suelyn Chew, a c onsultant anaesthetist at SL Chew Anaesthesiology, who was the anaesthetist involved in MS’s redo-CABG. 

As for expert witnesses, Dr Tong c alled: 

 Professor Brian F Buxton (“Prof Buxton”), a professor at the Department of Cardiac Surgery, University of Melbourne, Austin Hospital; and 

 Dr Sin Yoong Kong (“Dr Sin”), the head and senior c onsultant c ardiothorac ic surgeon at the National Heart Centre, Singapore. 

57     One of the sub-issues that Dr Tong and his witnesses were c alled on to answer was whether 


 MR PALANIAPPAN:Conc entrating on the c linic al symptoms, Dr Chew -let's not go into this issue of anatomy as yet -you would agree with me that the late Mr Milakov, after the initial myoc ardial infarc t, the residual pain, and the treatment that you gave, did not have post-infarc tion angina -you would agree with that? 

 A. Because he was on treatment, yes. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 9] 

 Q. Dr Sin, my question to you is: the evidenc e here showed the pain was resolving and there was a c omplete remission of pain; would you agree with me? 

 A. I would agree that the pain appeared to get better with medical therapy. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 10] 

MS had suffered post-infarc tion angina after his AMI. This sub-issue c omes under the first heading of whether Dr Tong was negligent in rec ommending the redo-CABG and was the only sub-issue under the first heading that the plaintiff substantially pursued in her written submissions. It was unc ontroversial that post-infarc tion angina indic ated the need for revasc ularisation. Counsel for the plaintiff c onfronted Dr Tong and his witnesses with a pain flow sheet from the hospital whic h showed that MS 

had not suffered pain after 10 pm on 9 Marc h 2007, the day he suffered his AMI. [note: 8] Fac ed with this piec e of c ontemporaneous evidenc e, Dr Tong and his witnesses had to c onc ede that MS’s pain had been resolved but emphasised that the resolution of pain was _due to the medical treatment MS was receiving_. Dr Christopher Chew, for example, stated the following on c ross-examination: 

58     Dr Sin took a similar position: 

59     As for the LIMALAD graft, Dr Tong opined that MS did not have a good func tioning LAD and that there was 90% stenosis at the mid-segment of the LAD and a further 60% stenosis of the LAD distal to the anastomosis of the LIMALAD graft (“stenosis of the distal LAD”). This meant that the blood flow in the distal LAD was obstruc ted. When asked to c omment on this by Dr Tong’s c ounsel, Dr Christopher Chew stated: 

 while the LIMA graft is patent and there is some flow to the c irc umflex into the LAD system, that system itself was severely diseased and, in c onjunc tion with a dominant c irc umflex artery whose c ontinued patenc y -his survival depended on the c ontinued patenc y of this graft, I was of the opinion that if that circumflex artery occluded, the amount of flow in the anterior wall would not be enough to sustain life and, in fac t, my c onc ern from the very outset has been this c irc umflex c oronary artery, whic h was, in my opinion, the artery upon whic h he depended on, his survival. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 11] 

60     Further, Prof Buxton took the view that there was “really a very poor flow” in the distal LAD, going so far as to say that he would “regard that as almost non-func tional”. When asked whether MS had a protec ted LMCA, Prof Buxton’s reply was: 

 Effec tively, no, bec ause I think there's insuffic ient flow proximally and we c an't see anything going up there at all and, sec ondly, the c ollateral flow from that terminal distal LAD vessel to the 


 Q. Dr Chew, what were your views on had this patient had a protec ted left main due to the presenc e of the LIMA graft? 

 A. Well, I myself have c onduc ted left main stenting in protec ted left main c oronary arteries. Here, the situation, there are three c oronary arteries -a right func tioning c oronary artery that protec ts the inferior wall, another artery to protec t either the anterior part of the wall or the c irc umflex, so, in theory, the patient is protec ted bec ause there's -at least twothirds of the left ventric le is protec ted, so muc h so that if one c onduc ted left main stenting and it oc c luded, there is the possibility of survival. 

 On the other hand, this patient has a dominant circumflex artery, for which – upon which his survival depended on its patency. In the event of obstruction or occlusion of the left main, either during the procedure or during the natural history of the illness, where the circumflex artery is carrying at least 40 per cent of his blood flow, his chances of survival are extremely unlikely. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 13] 

 A. I think this is a very fair c omment. In my institution, we do 4,000 angiograms a year, 2, PCIs, and as a surgic al team, we are frequently called by our cardiologist to the cath lab with an anatomy that is fairly similar to this, and whenever the right is non-dominant , or if the right is diseased and deemed inc apable of protec ting the myoc ardium, and where there is significant left main disease and the patient deemed high risk, they will not do a PCI. And even when I say that, you know, surgically, this is very high risk, they say, "Sorry, can you please do the surgery?" 

 [emphasis added] [note: 14] 

 (a) 

 (b) 

 c irc umflex system would be insuffic ient to protec t the left main or the c irc umflex. [note: 12] 

61     This view that MS did not in fac t have a protec ted LMCA had implic ations on the viability of PCI as an alternative treatment. Dr Christopher Chew was asked to c omment on this by c ounsel for Dr Tong: 

62     When asked to c omment on Dr Christopher’s Chew’s response, Dr Sin said: 

63     As for whether Dr Tong’s risk estimate of 3% for the redoCABG was negligent, Dr Sin and Prof Buxton pointed out that when they used the alternative “Soc iety of Thorac ic Surgeons” (“STS”) risk sc oring system, they produc ed risk estimates of 2.3% and 1.7% respec tively. 

**_Sub-issues relating to Dr Tong’s recommendation of a redo-CABG to MS_** 

64     The following sub-issues have arisen for determination: 

 Whether the flow of blood to the distal LAD was adequate; 

 Whether PCI was the superior option for revasc ularisation as opposed to a redo-CABG; 


 (c ) 

 (d) 

 (e) 

 (f) 

 (g) 

 Whether Dr Tong’s risk estimate of 3% was suc h an underestimate as to amount to a breac h of his standard of c are; 

 Whether Dr Tong’s mistaken c onc lusion that MS had post-infarc tion angina or unstable angina was an irrelevant c onsideration that he should not have taken into ac c ount in c hoosing to rec ommend the redo-CABG; 

 The signific anc e of the possibility of a further AMI as a fac tor in Dr Tong’s dec ision to rec ommend the redo-CABG and the timing of the rec ommended redo-CABG; 

 The signific anc e of MS’s improvement after his AMI as a fac tor in Dr Tong’s dec ision to rec ommend the redo-CABG; and 

 The signific anc e of the rarity of MS’s medic al situation as a fac tor in Dr Tong’s dec ision to rec ommend the redo-CABG. 

**_Sub-issue 1a: Whether the flow of blood to the distal LAD was adequate_** 

65     One important area of dispute was the adequac y of blood flow provided to the distal LAD. As stated above, Dr Tong’s view was that blood flow to the distal LAD was inadequate. This diagnosis was arrived at on the basis of Dr Tong’s reading of the angiographic studies as well as MS’s c linic al history presentation. Under c ross-examination, Dr Tong agreed that the stenosis of the distal LAD would be a signific ant c linic al finding. However, c ounsel for the plaintiff pointed out that these findings were not mentioned by Dr Christopher Chew in doc uments prepared prior to the trial, though he had the opportunity to do so on three separate oc c asions. 

66     First, in Dr Christopher Chew’s affidavit, his only finding with regard to the LAD was that it was 

“relatively small and diffusely atherosc lerotic ”. [note: 15] Dr Tong then replied that Dr Christopher Chew had found diffused stenosis of the LAD and that the only differenc e between his view and Dr Christopher Chew’s view was that the perc entage of stenosis was not rec orded. 

67     Sec ond, in both of Dr Christopher Chew’s two entries in the Clinic ian’s Collaborative Progress Not es (“the Clinic ian’s Notes”) on 9 Marc h 2007, there was no mention of any finding of stenosis of the distal LAD. Dr Tong replied that suc h findings would not be rec orded, as they were not c linic al findings, but angiographic findings or investigative findings. He explained that c linic al notes were aimed mainly at noting the c linic al appearanc e of the patient and how the patient appeared in response to the treatment. 

68     Third, in the c onfidential medic al report, prepared about 10 days after MS’s death, [note: 16] Dr Christopher Chew did not disc uss the stenosis of the distal LAD. In fac t, Dr Tong himself did not mention the stenosis of the distal LAD in his letter to Dr Christopher Chew dated 29 April 2007, even though, at this time, he knew that the matter had been made a Coroner's c ase. 

69     I c onsidered these submissions but ultimately found that Dr Tong’s expert witness, Prof Buxton, 


 Q. So foc using on the c irc umflex, if PCI of those oc c luded SVG grafts were not an option, then the only other possibility would have been if you were to foc us on PCI -to do a PCI of the ostial loc ation of the c irc umflex? 

 A. That's c orrec t, yes. 

provided c onvinc ing support for the medic al view that blood flow to the distal LAD was inadequate. I have already referred to Prof Buxton’s evidenc e at [60] above. 

70     There was a dispute between the plaintiff’s and Dr Tong’s experts on the issue of whether the blood flow to the distal LAD was adequate. To put the matter at its simplest, the plaintiff’s experts said that it provided adequate flow while Dr Tong’s experts said otherwise. One of the reasons for disagreement was that the angiogram whic h was provided to the experts provided a “non-selec tive” view of the distal LAD. When Dr Christopher Chew c onduc ted the angiogram for MS on the morning of 9 Marc h 2007 when MS arrived in the hospital after his AMI, he was only able to ac hieve a “nonselec tive” shot of the LAD system in the angiogram. This was bec ause when Dr Christopher Chew injec ted the dye into MS’s c irc ulatory system, he was not able to plac e the c atheter in the prec ise loc ation ( _ie_ , the orific e of the LIMA) whic h would best engage the vessels leading to MS’s c oronary arterial system. The c atheter in this c ase had been plac ed past the LIMA and was sitting in the subc lavian artery. This meant that there was a less than satisfac tory amount of dye shooting through MS’s c oronary arterial system so as to opac ify it and make it visible in the angiogram. A non-selec tive shot thus provided a sub-optimal view of the c oronary vessels. 

71     Therefore, the angiogram gave only a very faint view of the dye c oursing through MS’s c oronary arterial system. I should say that the plaintiff did not take issue with Dr Christopher Chew’s performanc e of the angiography, partic ularly given the emergenc y c irc umstanc es in whic h the proc edure was undertaken, but was c onc erned about the implic ations of the non-selec tive shots. The lac k of c larity in the view provided by the angiogram was fertile breeding ground for legitimate disagreement among the medic al experts. The view that the blood flow to the distal LAD was inadequate c ould not be said to be illogic al. Ac c ordingly, I find in ac c ordanc e with the _Bolam_ test that Dr Tong was not negligent to have held the view that blood flow to the distal LAD was inadequate. 

72     The view that there was an inadequate flow of blood through MS’s distal LAD would lead a doc tor to two further c onc lusions. First, that the overall blood supply to MS’ heart would be very poor. As MS was left-dominant, his left ventric le depended almost solely on the Cx and LAD for its supply of oxygenated blood. However, his Cx suffered a “very tight" stenosis at the ostium whic h would mean that the blood flow through the Cx would be hampered. If the LAD also had an inadequate blood flow, this would mean that the total volume of blood to MS’s heart might be insuffic ient. The poorer the blood flow to MS’s heart, the greater the need for revasc ularisation. Sec ond, if MS’s distal LAD was rec eiving inadequate flow, then it c ould not serve as an alternative blood supply to the Cx to protec t MS’s heart during the stenting of the Cx in a PCI. This would thus c ast doubt on whether PCI was, as the plaintiff argued, the superior option for revasc ularisation and it is issue that I will now address. 

**_Sub-issue 1b: Whether PCI was the superior option for revascularisation_** 

73     There appeared again to be genuine disagreement between the experts on both sides regarding this point. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr Cooke, c learly thought that PCI would be safe even if it was c arried out unprotec ted. While he ac knowledged the nervousness that many interventional c ardiologists might have in c arrying out an unprotec ted PCI, he stated that medic al views were c hanging: 


## ... 

 Q. Dr Blauth c alled it an important c ontraindic ation, the fac t it's loc ated at the ostium. Would you agree? 

 A. It’s important to remember the c ontext. It's an important loc ation if the patient had no bypass grafts, bec ause there was always a c onc ern about plac ing stents and c arrying out an angioplasty to the left main stem. Obviously the left main stem provides the blood supply to 75 per c ent of the heart musc le or more, and if that were to oc c lude that would often be fatal, so for that reason always been a nervousness and hesitation about plac ing stents in the left main stem. With advances in technology and modern stenting techniques, views on that actually are changing quite a lot and there are now many cases where cardiologists would actually offer a patient the choice of bypass grafting or stenting to the left main stem. However, we're not talking about that situation in this c ase. In this c ase the patient had a patent func tioning LIMA bypass graft, so he had a protec ted left main stem. In that c ontext, reasonable c ardiologists would c onsider angioplasty and not c onsider it to be at high risk. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 17] 

 COURT:So do I take it, based on your evidenc e, that if you were Dr Tong on 9 Marc h, you would have made the same dec ision? 

 A. When I looked at the preliminary evidenc e I walked his steps -you know, I looked at t he angiogram, I looked at the presentation, I looked at what Dr Chew said, and it's pretty much the same what my cardiologist will tell me , and if he really has that angina and looking at the pain sc ore, whic h I wasn’t aware until I was shown the pain sc ore, and that is definite evidenc e that he had pain at the point of presentation, and if I had seen him and he is still having pain, and looking at his anatomy, I would – I think it would be my duty to offer him surgery as an option. I may not nec essarily say that you must take it, but it is my duty to give him as an option. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 18] 

74     On the other hand, Dr Christopher Chew’s view was that MS was an unsuitable c andidate for PCI. He stated in his affidavit at paragraph 18: 

 Subsequent PCI of MS’s own native ‘c ulprit” ostial Cx lesion was also not favorable. The L[M]CA was itself diseased. This would pose signific ant risks during passage of the balloon or stent towards the Cx. The lesion itself was loc ated at the ostium of a c ritic al c oronary artery and undertaking PCI in this situation would have been hazardous. 

75     I also noted his observation at paragraph 19: 

 I should also point out at this junc ture that when MS first saw the doc tors and surgeons at SJMC, they had also dec ided not to offer PCI. In fac t, MS’s surgeon seems to have written in his c linic al notes at SJMC on 19 January 2007 “DX1 Severe 3V CAD Not Suitable to PCI ” (emphasis added). ... 

76     Further, Dr Sin testified as follows: 


 Q. This was a patient who, prior to his AMI on9 Marc h, had for a period of seven weeks been c ontinuously on drugs designed spec ific ally to protec t the heart func tions and to ensure that a repeat isc haemia, angina or AMI would not oc c ur; c orrec t? A. Correc t. 

 Q. And then he had -despite those medic ations --suffered an AMI on 9 Marc h. 

 A. Correc t. 

77     It was also emphasised to me that PCI is a non-surgic al option. Therefore, the dec ision to offer PCI is within the domain of an interventional c ardiologist and not that of a c ardiothorac ic surgeon. Dr Christopher Chew, MS’s interventional c ardiologist, had dec ided, based on the angiogram, that the LIMALAD graft did not provide suffic ient blood supply as to protec t MS’s heart and dec ided not to rec ommend PCI. On c ross-examination, the plaintiff’s expert, Dr Blauth, ac c epted that it would not be unreasonable for a surgeon to ac c ept an interventional c ardiologist’s opinion that PCI was unsuitable if that ac c orded with the surgeon’s own judgment or if the surgeon took the view that the 

interventional c ardiologist had c onsidered the matter and arrived at a sound dec ision. [note: 19] 

78     Moreover, c ounsel for Dr Tong also urged the c ourt to keep in mind that that when MS originally presented at SJMC on 17 January 2007 with angina, the doc tors there found that CABG was indic ated and that PCI was unsuitable. At that stage, MS had only suffered angina but not an AMI. Further, this was a c ase of angina oc c urring after exerc ise, as opposed to angina oc c urring while at rest. The latter situation would have been greater c ause for c onc ern. On c ross-examination, the plaintiff gave evidenc e that although MS preferred to defer the bypass and return to Singapore for the proc edure, he was advised by the doc tors to undergo the initial CABG immediately in Houston. 

79     Turning now to 9 Marc h 2007, when MS presented himself at MEH, it was c lear that his medic al c ondition was worse than when he had presented at SJMC on 17 January 2007. First, he had suffered an AMI, a more serious c ardiac event than mere angina, as the AMI had c aused some of his heart musc le to die. Musc le nec rosis is irreversible and the musc le c annot be revived even on revasc ularisation. Sec ond, his Left Ventric ular Ejec tion Frac tion (“LVEF”) had reduc ed from 59% in SJMC to 49% at MEH. Third, he suffered the AMI despite being at rest, having adopted a fairly sedentary lifestyle generally and rigorously following the medic ation regime presc ribed to him. 

80     This was ac c epted by Dr Whelan, one of the plaintiff’s experts: [note: 20] 

81     Therefore, c ounsel for Dr Tong argued that if a CABG had been indic ated in preferenc e to a PCI when MS presented in SJMC, _a fortiori_ , a CABG would be indic ated when MS presented at MEH. I found this argument persuasive. 

82     On the evidenc e, I find that Dr Tong did not breac h his duty of c are under the _Bolam_ test in dec iding not to rec ommend PCI over the redoCABG option. I also ac c ept the defenc e’s c ase is that it would be unusual for a surgeon to oppose a c ompetent c ardiologist’s rec ommendation regarding the suitability of PCI. 

**_Sub-issue 1c: Whether Dr Tong’s risk estimate of 3% was such an underestimate as to amount to a breach of the standard of care_** 

83     I will now c onsider the question of whether Dr Tong’s estimated risk of 3% was made negligently. This is separate from the issue of whether the perc entage figure was in fac t c onveyed to 


MS, whic h will be examined later. On this sub-issue, the tenor of the plaintiff’s argument was that the estimate of 3% was suc h an underestimate as to show that Dr Tong did not properly address his mind to the issue of risk and thus breac hed the standard of c are to MS. The experts on both sides proposed risk sc ores ranging from the lowest of 2.3% (by Dr Sin) using the STS model to the highest of 14.34% (by Dr Sharma) using the EuroSCORE model. These models are international risk sc oring systems, c reated based on data generated from various c ardiac c entres. For example, the EuroSCORE model is generated from c ardiac c entres in Europe. Using one of these models is similar to filling up an online survey form. Various questions about the patients are asked and one c hooses from a set of pre-determined answers. After all the answers are entered, a risk sc ore is generated. 

84     The risk sc ores generated by the models differ on two c ounts. First, the questions in the STS model and the EuroSCORE model differ, as do the spec ific ity of the pre-determined answers available f or selec tion. Sec ond, even when using the same risk sc oring model, two different doc tors might selec t slightly different answers to the questions posed by the model. This is bec ause some degree of medic al assessment of the patient is required to selec t an option; and different doc tors might have slightly different views. I thus found that the EuroSCORE and STS risk models served only to provide a 

“sc oring guide” [note: 21] (in the words of Dr Sin) in helping doc tors to estimate risk sc ores for their patients. Risk sc ores responsibly produc ed by different doc tors for the same patient c ould legitimately differ to some extent. 

85     The arbitrariness of the risk models was also highlighted to me. The EuroSCORE model defines left ventric ular func tion as “moderate” if its level of func tion is at 30 to 50%. MS’s LVEF was 49%. By selec ting “moderate”, MS’s risk sc ore was 8.66%. However, if MS’s ventric ular func tion improved ever so slightly as to c ross the 50% threshold into “good”, his risk sc ore would be dramatic ally halved to 4%. 

86     In addition, it is noteworthy that these models are primarily used to assess c ardiac c entres, as opposed to assessing risks for individual patients. Dr Sin is also the direc tor of quality management at the National Heart Centre and he explained that he primarily used these models to benc hmark the quality of his institution against other institutions. The _primary_ use of these models is to tell hospital direc tors whether their c ardiac departments are up to sc ratc h. However, the data from the models also helps individual c ardiac patients to estimate the risks of medic al proc edures. 

87     I also noted that while the EuroSCORE model c onsistently produc ed risk sc ores in the region of 14%, the plaintiff’s experts readily c onc eded that a well-known c ritic ism of the EuroSCORE model is that it overestimates risk. This was supported by a medic al artic le from the Netherlands Heart Journal aptly titled “Evaluation of the EuroSCORE risk sc oring model for patients undergoing c oronary artery 

bypass graft surgery: a word of c aution.” [note: 22] 

88     Finally, it was also unc ontroversial among the experts that personal performanc e data for individual surgeons were highly relevant in estimating the risk for a patient. At the material time, Dr Tong had enc ountered two mortalities out of 115 redo CABGs, giving a mortality rate of 1.74%. When questioned about this, Dr Tong stated on c ross-examination that several of the patients in the 

“suc c essful” c ases were ac tually higher risk c ases than MS. [note: 23] This c ould not be easily c hallenged but Dr Tong’s above-par performanc e statistic s as a surgeon were undisputed and this stood him in good stead. Considering all the evidenc e, I find that the risk estimate of 3% was not negligently made. 

**_Sub-issue 1d: Whether Dr Tong’s mistaken conclusion that MS had post-infarction angina or unstable angina was an irrelevant consideration that he should not have taken into account in_** 


 Q. If we assume for a moment that that should reflec t 10 Marc h, would you not agree with me t h a t despite the reduc tion in GTN, here was a patient who was feeling c omfortable overnight and there is a note whic h says "No c hest pain" -is of some signific anc e? 

 A. Yes, I think that is -yes, but don't forget it wasn't just on GTN. This patient was on a number of pain relieving medications, and anti-platelet and so forth. So, I'd agree that it suggests that there is an improvement. Q. Dr Buxton, my question is: taking into ac c ount the fac t that he remained pain free the later part of the 9th, 10th and 11th, would it be fair to say that there is no evidenc e of postinfarc tion angina? 

 A. No clinical evidence. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 26] 

**_choosing to recommend the redo-CABG_** 

89     As stated above, the plaintiff alleged that one of the fac tors that Dr Tong took into c onsideration in rec ommending the redoCABG was the ongoing angina pec toris suffered by MS. 

However, as c learly evinc ed by the pain flow sheet, [note: 24] MS did not suffer any pain after 10 pm on 9 Marc h 2007 and remained pain-free until the time that he underwent surgery. Although Dr Tong 

c onc eded this point, [note: 25] he asserted, c onsistently with his other fac tual and expert witnesses, that MS’s pain-free state was only ac hieved by plac ing him under medic al treatment. On the basis of his witnesses’ evidenc e, I ac c epted Dr Tong’s opinion in this regard as reasonably and non-negligently held. 

90     It is apposite to note at this junc ture the plaintiff’s objec tion to Prof Buxton’s expert opinion t hat Dr Tong was reasonable in proc eeding with the redoCABG. The plaintiff’s objec tion was on the basis that Prof Buxton had been c onfused about wrongly entered dates in the Clinic ian’s Notes. A 7.30am entry whic h rec orded MS as being c omfortable overnight with no c hest pain was mistakenly dated 10 Marc h 2007 when it should have been 9 Marc h 2007. Prof Buxton did not apprec iate this until the trial. Reading this with the earlier 9 Marc h 2007 entries whic h indic ated MS suffered from angina, it might have c aused him to mistakenly believe that MS suffered unstable angina ( _ie_ , that MS progressed from not having angina to having angina again), when the reality was that MS’s angina had resolved gradually upon admission to Mount Elizabeth Hospital. 

91     However, on being c ross-examined subsequent to the c larific ation of his c onfusion about this, Prof Buxton c ontinued to emphasise the effec t of pain relieving medic ations and qualified his agreement that there was no evidenc e of post-infarc tion angina by saying that there was no _clinical_ evidenc e: 

Coupled with the evidenc e given by Dr Tong’s other witnesses, I found that Prof Buxton’s evidenc e c ontinued to be reliable despite his misapprehension regarding the dates of the medic al rec ords. 

**_Sub-issue 1e: The significance of the possibility of a further AMI as a factor in Dr Tong’s decision to recommend the redo-CABG and the timing of recommended redo-CABG_** 

92     This was Dr Tong’s explanation of his thought proc ess behind the rec ommendation of the redo

CABG: [note: 27] 


 Q. Would you agree with me that while we don't treat the ECG, it would have provided information that his c ondition was resolving? 

 A. His heart attac k was resolving. His c hest pain was resolving. But his anatomy was the one that was of great concern to all of us, and we were treating the anatomy rather than the chest pain at that time. 

 Q. Dr Chew, would you not agree with me that there was no evidenc e that the late Mr Milakov was suffering from post-infarc tion angina? 

 A. Well, he was under treatment and he didn't have any c hest pain, but he had a severe c ulprit lesion, okay? 

 [emphasis added] [note: 29] 

 The surgery is take -done with two views. One is to relieve his intermediate immediate danger, also -as well as in order to give him this relief of -relief of a severe c oronary artery disease in the long term, in other words, to prolong his life. 

Further, Dr Tong opined that _MS’s positive response to medical treatment while in hospital (ie, the resolution of angina) did not mean that MS’s underlying coronary disease had been cured_ , and there 

was “always a possibility of a relapse”. This relapse c ould oc c ur without warning, at any time. [note: 28] In other words, Dr Tong’s c ase was that even though the c linic al symptoms, spec ific ally the post

infarc tion angina here, had resolved, the issue of the c oronary disease had not been resolved and something had to be done to treat it. 

93     Dr Christopher Chew’s evidenc e was c onsistent with this, as he stated on c ross-examination that the doc tors were c onc erned to treat MS’s underlying c oronary disease: 

94     Even so, Dr Sharma, an expert witness for the plaintiff, testified that sc arring in the first six months would be very vasc ular and thus opined that the “worst time to re-operate or to perform a redo ... [was] c lose to the primary surgery”. I understand this to mean that even if a redoCABG was indic ated to treat MS’s underlying c oronary disease, Dr Tong ought not to have c arried it out on an urgent basis. 

95     However, it was c ommon ground between the expert witnesses that there was a risk of another AMI oc c urring and that this c ould happen out of the blue, without warning. Dr Tong’s position was that while the redoCABG was being performed a relatively short while after the initial CABG (45 days) and a short while after the AMI (three days), this had to be balanc ed against the need for the redoCABG and _the risk that MS might die from a further AMI if he waited a longer period before undergoing the redo-CABG_. As Dr Chew noted in his affidavit at paragraph 29, 

 “Essentially, [MS] had to take the risk of undergoing another major surgery [ ie the CABG] or take the higher risk of another heart attac k or sudden death if he did not go for the surgery.” 

96     Prof Buxton desc ribed the medic al situation as a “ _trade-off_ ” in his c ross-examination: 


## [3]. 

## 3.1 

 A. ... but, on the other hand, there's a trade-off here, and that is that if a patient has had a big infarc t, and we won't go into the symptoms of how long they took to settle, but had a big infarc t , one is careful not to wait too long and allow any further damage to occur, so one is keen to move along, if one can, without compromising the situation any further. So, in other words, if you wait for long enough in a situation, as you heard Dr Chew this morning say, that there's a 90 per c ent stenosis in the remaining c irc umflex and almost no blood flow through the distal LAD , you run the risk of the patient dying just by waiting, so it's a trade-off , and -c ertainly, that's the first thing, so death is a major c onc ern with a disc ussion with the patient. ... 

 [emphasis added] [note: 30] 

97     What was perhaps the most evoc ative turn of phrase c ame from Dr Sin on the stand: 

 I say " a ticking time bomb " to my patients. I think that's probably more apt -it's a time bomb. Any time it goes, it goes. Even if I list you for surgery a week, two weeks, three weeks, there's nothing to say that just a day before you get a massive heart attac k and don't make it in time. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 31] 

The phrase “a tic king time bomb” c learly c aptures the risk in delaying the redoCABG. However, as will be expanded on in greater detail later, this was a risk that c ould not be c alc ulated. 

98     I also found the following paragraph from Prof Buxton’s written expert opinion partic ularly illuminating: 

 Timing of Operation 

 A dilemma in planning surgery with an unstable patient is the timing of the CABG proc edure. In general, the risk of early operation is high and, the more unstable the patient’s c ondition the higher the risk. This was the situation with MS at the point of the [re]do-CABG bec ause of the AMI he suffered prior to the redo-CABG. Many surgeons would rather wait until the patient stabilises and the risk is lower. An extension of the time of rec overy before a redoCABG may enable more planning, suc h as the assessment of the c oagulation profile, the addition of anti-fibrinolytic agents suc h as tranexamic ac id, and the allowanc e of time for rec overy post infarc tion. On the other hand, the risks of infarct extension or re-infarction which can occur with little warning while waiting for the redo-CABG may be serious or even fatal. Waiting is also attended with a risk of ischaemia recurring during the critical time window. An intermediate c ourse is to observe the patient’s c ondition and c ontinue a c onservative polic y as long as there are no signs of deterioration. There is no correct answer to this dilemma. In MS’s case, he was managed aggressively by an offer of surgery because the risks of further ischaemia and infarction were estimated to be high. 

 [emphasis added] 

99     Prof Buxton went on in the same paragraph to note that MS was c onsidered a “late” c ase of intervention: 

 Dr Tong also waited till Day 3 (3 days after the initial AMI on 9 Marc h 2007) before performing the 


 Q. Dr Tong, if at all his improving health provided Mr Milakov with a window of opportunity to delay the surgery – 

 A. Also a window of opportunity to operate on him. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 33] 

 A. ... Sec ondly, it also goes to show that when you give a patient risk, when the patient is relatively well, say, paradoxic ally, you don't have c hest pain, and henc e in this sc ore your risk bec omes low, and henc e when you don't have symptoms -and I say "paradoxically", because when you don't have symptoms, I tell you you should have the operation because the risk is low. When you get symptoms, your risk goes up and then, paradoxically, I tell you, because you have symptoms, your risk has now gone up. 

 Do I then c onc lude should I do the operation or should I not do the operation based on risk or symptoms? You c an't base it on one single fac tor. You have to take the entirety and look at the patient as a whole. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 34] 

 redoCABG, allowing MS to stabilise through OMT. Generally, an operation between Day 0 to Day 2 places the patient in the “early” group of intervention, whereas an operation on Day 3 and beyond places the patient in the “late” group of intervention. In this c linic al situation Dr Tong’s dec ision to proc eed with the redo-CABG was reasonable. 

 [emphasis added] 

100    The c ourt was also referred to a Journal of Thorac ic and Cardiovasc ular Surgery artic le entitled "Optimal timing of c oronary artery bypass after ac ute myoc ardial infarc tion: A review of California 

disc harge data" [note: 32]. The artic le doc umented a study by John Hopkins Medic al Institution whic h suggested that mortality risk for CABGs dropped notably three days after an AMI. On the totality of the evidenc e, I find that the risk of a further AMI was a signific ant fac tor that Dr Tong rightly c onsidered in his dec ision to rec ommend the redo-CABG. 

**_Issue 1f: The significance of MS’s improvement after his AMI as a factor in Dr Tong’s decision to recommend the redo-CABG_** 

101    The plaintiff argued that the improvement of MS’s health c ondition subsequent to his AMI on 9 Marc h 2007 meant that the redoCABG c ould be delayed. However, the defenc e c ountered with the alternative perspec tive that the rec overy instead gave a window of opportunity to go ahead with the redoCABG and this advantage had to be weighed in the balanc e. Dr Tong stated in c rossexamination: 

In a similar vein, Dr Sin stated the following paradox in c ross-examination: 

102    Therefore, while the improvement whic h MS made after his AMI might be a reason to postpone the redoCABG, I ac c epted that it was reasonable to take the view that this might equally be a reason to proc eed with the surgery sinc e MS’s improved c ondition meant that he was more likely to survive the redoCABG operation. Dr Tong also submitted that even if MS did not suffer a subsequent 


 (i) 

 (ii) 

AMI whic h would kill him, he might suffer another MACE whic h would further reduc e c ardiac func tion 

and “c lose the window for a redoCABG”. [note: 35] I understood this to mean that if this opportunity afforded by MS’s improved health c ondition was not taken to proc eed with the redoCABG, there was no guarantee that it would still be available later. 

**_Issue 1g: The significance of the rarity of MS’s medical situation as a factor in Dr Tong’s decision to recommend the redo-CABG_** 

103    The plaintiff argued that a redoCABG in the nature of what MS underwent was extremely rare for two reasons, whic h I have termed “the two proximities in time”: 

 the proximity in time between the initial CABG and the redo-CABG (about 7 weeks); 

 the proximity in time between the AMI and the redo-CABG (three days). 

Indeed, Prof Buxton stated that in his 30 years of prac tic e, he had done only one redoCABG within six weeks of the initial CABG. He further stated that in this one c ase, the patient had not also just 

suffered an AMI, as was the situation in MS’s c ase. [note: 36] Dr Sin also c onc eded that he had never 

enc ountered a patient in MS’s situation. [note: 37] However, he elaborated that although it was unusual for a patient to have a redoCABG so soon after the initial CABG, it was not unusual to have re-do _operations_ within six weeks of open heart surgery and some operations were even deliberately staggered in that way bec ause the patients were deemed to be high risk c ases. 

104    It c an be seen that it is extremely rare for a patient to undergo a redoCABG where there is a c oinc idenc e of the two proximities. Even so, I find that the fac t of rarity of a redoCABG in suc h c irc umstanc es should not be given undue weight. The reason for suc h rarity might be due to the reluc tanc e of reasonable surgeons to proc eed in the fac e of the inc reased risks, whic h c ould support a finding of a breac h of duty, or might be due to the rarity of the c oinc idenc e of the two proximities in themselves, in whic h c ase it might be argued that a redoCABG in suc h c irc umstanc es amounted to a desperate measure to treat a desperate situation. 

105    As stated above, the plaintiff’s c ase essentially boiled down to the assertion that reasonable surgeons in Dr Tong’s position would have rec ognised that the risks involved in undergoing the redoCABG outweighed the benefits whic h MS would have rec eived. In 1921, Frank Hyneman Knight (“Knight”) published a book entitled “Risk, Unc ertainty and Profit”. He shared an insight whic h I find helpful to the present analysis. Knight drew a distinc tion between risks (outc omes with defined probability distributions) and unc ertainties (outc omes with undefined probability distributions). In other words, _w e know our odds when it comes to risks, but we do not when it comes to uncertainties_. To my mind, MS fac ed a risk when it c ame to proc eeding with the redoCABG, bec ause the doc tors c ould try to quantify the probabilities of things going wrong. However, when it c ame to dec lining the redoCABG, he fac ed an unc ertainty. As noted earlier, MS was akin to a “tic king time bomb” with an unknown detonation time. At the end of the trial, I asked Dr Sin what MS’s odds were if he were to dec line the redo-CABG: 


 COURT:I'm looking at it very simplistic ally. Assuming I'm a patient, you are telling me this is a risky operation, et c etera. My question to you is: what if I asked you the other part of the equation? Supposing I don't do it, what are my chances of survival? Is a surgeon able to answer that part of the question? 

 A. No, it is very difficult to answer, and a lot of patients ask that very same question and my standard answer is that I don't have a crystal ball. I c an't predic t your future, and in that sense I c an sympathise with the patient when he says, "I'm between a roc k and a hard plac e," bec ause as a surgeon I'm also feeling in that position. Whatever way I c hoose, there are equally bad potential outc omes, but I think at the end of the day, as long as that's explained to the patient, his options, and the potential outc omes in either option, and he dec ides on whic h c ourse of ac tion, being informed in that regard, that is my duty. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 38] 

 A. ... I think an aggressive group of surgeons, and there's quite a lot of surgeons who are aggressive, would do that. There's a group of surgeons who would perhaps go in relatively early, after three or four days, which is the major risk over , and, sec ondly, perhaps during that time maybe c onsider a further test -I think it's possible, yeah. 

 Q. Dr Buxton, do I understand from your evidenc e that if you were fac ed with suc h a patient, you would not have c arried out a surgery so soon? 

 A. That would be my view, but I'm not -I c an't speak for every surgeon. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 39] 

106    I find the question of MS’ c hanc es of survival without going ahead with the redoCABG simply an imponderable. The plaintiff’s experts who said that MS should not have gone ahead with the redoCABG c andidly ac c epted that a subsequent AMI might happen “out of the blue”. It was c ommon ground that MS had severe c oronary artery disease and it was thus not unc ontroversial that a subsequent AMI might well have killed him. The plaintiff’s experts did not put a figure to the c hanc es of that happening and I take it that they c ould not. If they c ould put forward suc h a figure and show it to be signific antly lower than the risk MS fac ed in undergoing the redoCABG, then Dr Tong would have breac hed his duty to MS. However, it is prec isely on medic al imponderables suc h as the present question that the medic al c ommunity is allowed to have legitimate disagreements without interferenc e by the judic iary. By definition, it is impossible to c alc ulate imponderables and as stated at _Gunapathy_ (at [3]), “We often enough tell doc tors not to play god; it seems only fair that, similarly, judges and lawyers should not play at being doc tors.” 

107    It must be emphasised that the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the view held by Dr Tong was illogic al. To this end, the plaintiff noted that one of Dr Tong’s own experts, Prof Buxton, stated that he would not have done the redo-CABG himself: 

However, it is c lear that Prof Buxton was of the opinion that there was a sizeable group of surgeons who would have operated as Dr Tong did, and while he c harac terised them as “aggressive”, that adjec tive is quite distinc t from “illogic al”. 


108    The plaintiff then relied on the following exc erpt from _Gunapathy_ (at [65]) and submitted that sinc e Prof Buxton would not have proc eeded with the redoCABG himself, his medic al opinion was not internally c onsistent and should be rejec ted: 

 ... To our minds, a "defensible c onc lusion" c onnotes the satisfac tion of two c onc epts. First, the medic al opinion must be internally c onsistent on its fac e. It must make c ogent sense as a whole, suc h that no part of the opinion c ontradic ts with another. A doctor cannot say, for example, that he supports a certain approach and attest that in that very situation, he would nevertheless have done quite the opposite. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

109    With respec t, I think that is a misreading of _Gunapathy_. The fac t that a doc tor ac knowledges the prac tic e of one group of doc tors while stating that he would have opted for a different c ourse does not of itself c ause his opinion to bec ome inc onsistent. The c orrec t position, in my view, is that an expert c an provide evidenc e of what prac tic es are ac c epted as proper by a responsible body of medic al men by stating his view of what he believes other doc tors would have done (even if he would n o t himself have adopted that c ourse). This is supported by the c ase of _Sharpe v Southend HA_ [1997] 8 Med LR in whic h Cresswell J stated at 303 (c ol 2): 

 An expert witness should make it c lear in his/her report (if it be the c ase) that although the expert would have adopted a different approac h/prac tic e, he/she ac c epts that the approac h/prac tic e adopted by the defendant was in ac c ordanc e with the approac h/prac tic e ac c epted as proper by a responsible body of prac titioners skilled in the relevant field. Had this guideline been followed in the present c ase it is likely that the allegations against Professor Souhami would not have been advanc ed in the first plac e (as opposed to being withdrawn in the plaintiff’s c ounsel’s final speec h). 

110    Therefore, applying the _Bolam_ test and after c onsidering the evidenc e and arguments presented by both sides, I find that Dr Tong was not negligent in rec ommending that MS undergo the redoCABG bec ause he had ac ted in ac c ordanc e with a prac tic e ac c epted as proper by a responsible body of medic al men skilled in that partic ular art. I also find that the medic al opinions supporting Dr Tong were held on a logic al basis and satisfy the _Bolitho_ test. In so finding, I find it apposite to rec all this passage from Lord Diploc k’s speec h in _Sidaway v Board of Governors of the Bethlem Royal Hospital and the Maudsley Hospital_ [1985] AC 871 (“ (“ _Sidaway_ ”) at 893: 

 Those members of the public who seek medic al or surgic al aid would be badly served by the adoption of any legal princ iple that would c onfine the doc tor to some long-established, well-tried method of treatment only, although its past rec ord of suc c ess might be small, if he wanted to be c onfident that he would not run the risk of being held liable in negligenc e simply bec ause he tried some more modern treatment, and by some unavoidable misc hanc e it failed to heal but did some harm to the patient. This would encourage "defensive medicine" with a vengeance. The merit of the Bolam test is that the c riterion of the duty of c are owed by a doc tor to his patient is whether he has ac ted in ac c ordanc e with a prac tic e ac c epted as proper by a body of responsible and skilled medic al opinion. There may be a number of different prac tic es whic h satisfy this c riterion at any partic ular time. These prac tic es are likely to alter with advanc es in medic al knowledge. ... 

Of c ourse, a redoCABG c ould not be c onsidered “more modern treatment” but the point is that the c ourt should not bind doc tors to c onservative approac hes in medic ine as this would ultimately be to the detriment of patients. Otherwise, there might be a c hilling effec t on the presc ription of more “aggressive” and/or interventional proc edures, even if these are reasonably thought to be in the best 


 Q. At what stage did Dr Chew inform you that he would seek the advic e of a c ardiothorac ic surgeon? 

 A. When we were ac tually in the [high dependenc y unit (“HDU”)], I ac tually c ame out of the HDU to meet -bec ause -I think other than family no-one is allowed really in the [HDU], apart from the medic al personnel, and Steve's c olleague Brent Fish had when he was informed that this had happened, so I c ame out of the HDU to meet him, and while we were talking outside of the HDU, bec ause he c ouldn't go in, Dr Chew c ame out of door and that's when we were standing kind of like in the c orridor, you know, so to speak, and at that point in time we asked him, you know, "What are the next steps?" I'm using this very loosely, of c ourse. He said, "There are two options. One is for c onservative medic al therapy and the other one is to refer a surgeon." At which time he also told me -well, he told us when a surgeon is introduced, a surgeon would usually like to operate, because that's how it is. Okay? So that's what he said to us, and he said, "Those are the two options." He said, With c onservative medic al therapy, obviously some of the possible c onsequenc es c ould be some more heart attac ks, myoc ardial infarc t, and at the same time it c ould be also fatal." ... 

 [emphasis added] [note: 40] 

interests of the patient. 

111    It remains for me to make an observation that the plaintiff appeared to have been given notic e that Dr Tong would adopt an aggressive medic al approac h before she c onsulted him. This surfac ed when the plaintiff was c ross-examined regarding the advic e given to her by Dr Christopher Chew: 

The answer in italic s c ould imply that, as a surgeon, Dr Tong was inc lined to operate whatever the c irc umstanc es and thus did not properly c onsider MS’s suitability for the redoCABG and did not properly c onsider the non-surgic al options of OMT and PCI, thus failing to meet the standard of c are expec ted of him. However, I find that if the plaintiff had indeed understood Dr Christopher Chew’s statement to mean that Dr Tong would perform the surgery, regardless of the c irc umstanc es and c onsequenc es, she would not have proc eeded to c onsult Dr Tong. I believe that the plaintiff went ahead to c onsult Dr Tong with MS knowing that Dr Tong’s approac h would be aggressive and surgeryoriented, yet believing that this was within ac c epted medic al prac tic e and a c ourse whic h MS should explore. 

112    Having gone through the foregoing sub-issues and making the findings that I have made, I ac c ordingly find that Dr Tong did not breac h the tortious and c ontrac tual duties of c are he owed to MS in his rec ommendation of the redo-CABG as a treatment option for MS. 

**Issue 2: Whether Dr Tong breached the tortious and contractual duties of care he owed to MS in advising MS regarding the redo-CABG** 

**_The applicability of Bolam to the issue of advice_** 

113    The Court of Appeal in _Gunapathy_ also c onsidered the issue of the applic ability of the _Bolam_ test to advic e, noting the different views taken on this issue in _Sidaway_. The _ratio_ of _Sidaway_ is not easy to determine, as eac h of the judges appeared to be taking slightly differing stanc es on the applic ability of _Bolam_. One c ommentator has thus stated that “muc h rests on the subsequent 

interpretation of the c ase” (Jonathan Herring, Medic al Law and Ethic s (OUPS, 2nd Ed) p 150). 


114    In _Gunapathy_ , the Court’s interpretation of _Sidaway_ was as follows. Yong CJ noted the dissenting view of Lord Sc arman that _Bolam_ only applied to diagnosis and treatment and not advic e. Yong CJ then pointed out that the majority of the House in _Sidaway_ parted c ompany with Lord Sc arman on this issue. Lord Diploc k, in the majority, stated (at 893) that the doc tor’s duty of c are was “not subjec t to dissec tion into a number of c omponent parts to whic h different c riteria of what satisfy the duty of c are apply, suc h as diagnosis, treatment and advic e”. A doc tor’s dec ision as to what risks a patient should be warned of was stated to be “as muc h an exerc ise of professional skill and judgment as any other part of the doc tor’s c omprehensive duty of c are” (at 895). Therefore, Lord Diploc k opined that “no c onvinc ing reason has ... been advanc ed ... that would justify treating the Bolam test as doing anything less than laying down a princ iple of English law that is c omprehensive and applic able to every aspec t of the duty of c are” (at 893). In _Gunapathy_ (at [137]), the c ourt noted that Lord Diploc k had “entrenc hed the applic ation of _Bolam_ to advic e in no unc ertain terms”. Lord Templeman was stated to have “effec tively supported the _Bolam_ test” even though he did not make spec ific referenc e to the test ( _Gunapathy_ at [138]). Yong CJ went on to state (at [141]) that “it was c lear that Lord Bridge [with whom Lord Keith agreed] did not agree with Lord Sc arman’s dissenting view that it was for the c ourt to determine what material risks a prudent patient was entitled to rec eive”. 

115    However, Yong CJ noted that Lord Bridge did c arve a qualific ation into the _Bolam_ test. The question of advic e and risk disc losure should not be abdic ated entirely to the medic al profession. Yong CJ observed (at [141]) that Lord Bridge took the view that: 

 if a risk was substantial and there was no c ogent c linic al reason why disc losure should not be made, the judge was at liberty to c onc lude that no respec table medic al expert would have failed to make it. 

This was seen by the Court of Appeal to be “a forerunner to the more general qualific ation made by _Bolitho_ ” ( _Gunapathy_ at [141]). 

116    The Court of Appeal made c lear that it rejec ted the trial judge’s “unwarranted” (at [134]) interpretation of _Sidaway_ as dec lining the view that the _Bolam_ test applied to the issue of medic al advic e (see [142]). However, the c ourt also c larified that it was not providing a c onc lusive ruling on the doc trine of informed c onsent sinc e that issue was not fully vented in that c ase: 

 142 We would emphasise that this is not the appropriate plac e to address a fully argued appeal on the merits of a doc trine of informed c onsent. The issue did not arise in the submissions before us and we would not pronounc e on it as suc h. We, however, feel c ompelled to address the judge's inexplic able assumption t hat Bolam had been unc eremoniously evic ted from the issue of medic al advic e, and to make the observation that were this argument ever to arise in our jurisdic tion, it would find Sidaway ([57] supra) to be somewhat shaky ground on whic h to stand. 

Nevertheless, what is important for the present purposes is that the Court of Appeal went on to affirm that the _Bolam_ test applied to the issue of advic e at [143]: 

 143 Ac c ordingly, in affirming that the Bolam test applied to the issue of advice in the present appeal , we found that the defendant doc tors’ disc losure of the relevant perc entage risks of radiosurgery was supported by a respectable body of medical opinion. They had not given negligent advic e to Gunapathy. 

 [emphasis added] 

_The plaintiff’s proposed test for the issue of advice_ 


_The plaintiff’s proposed test for the issue of advice_ 

117    While c ounsel for the plaintiff appears to ac c ept that _Bolam_ , subjec t to the _Bolitho_ c aveat, applied to advic e, his submission of what the _Bolitho_ threshold of logic entails might result in a departure from the _Bolam_ test in effec t. Ac c ording to the plaintiff, if the doc tor failed to c ommunic ate a signific ant risk to the patient before c arrying out the rec ommended treatment, this would fail to meet the _Bolitho_ threshold of logic and suc h a failure “would [be] tantamount to the c onduc t being illogic al, irresponsible or unreasonable” and thus amount to a breac h of the doc tor’s duty of c are. 

118    The plaintiff derived this argument from what she saw as the English approac h of using _Bolitho_ as “providing suffic ient ammunition to the c ourts to sc rutinise and find liability” even when Dr Tong attempted to adduc e evidenc e that his prac tic e c onforms to the prac tic e of a respec table body of prac titioners. To illustrate this, the plaintiff referred to the dec ision in _Pearce v United Bristol Healthcare NHS Trust_ [1999] ECC 167 (“ _Pearce_ ”) where Lord Woolf held (at [21]): 

 In a c ase where it is being alleged that a plaintiff has been deprived of the opportunity to make a proper dec ision as to what c ourse he or she should take in relation to treatment, it seems to me to be the law, as indic ated in the c ases to whic h I have just referred, that if there is a significant risk which would affect the judgment of a reasonable patient, then in the normal course it is the responsibility of a doctor to inform the patient of that significant risk , if the information is needed so that the patient c an determine for him or herself as to what c ourse he or she should adopt. 

 [emphasis added] 

119    The plaintiff noted that _Pearce_ was c harac terised by some c ommentators as being c loser to the “reasonable patient” test in the Australian c ase of _Rogers v Whitaker_ [1992] 175 CLR 479 ( _“Rogers_ ”) than to the traditional English approac h whic h foc uses on the “reasonable doc tor”, or more ac c urately, a “responsible body of medic al opinion” (Jac kson & Powell at paragraph 13-091). In _Rogers_ , the High Court of Australia departed from the _Bolam_ test (at least in respec t of the duty to advise) in favour of the approac h of the Supreme Court of Canada i n _Reibl v Hughes_ (1980) 114 DLR (3d) 1, holding (at 490) that a doc tor had a duty to warn his patient of the material risks inherent in the proposed medic al treatment. A risk was material if, in the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, (i) a reasonable person in the patient’s position, if warned of the risk, would be likely to attac h signific anc e to it; or (ii) if the medic al prac titioner is or should be reasonably aware that the partic ular patient, if warned of the risk, would be likely to attac h signific anc e to it. 

120    Later, in _Rosenberg v Percival_ [2001] 205 CLR 434, the High Court of Australia affirmed _Rogers_ and reiterated that Australian law had moved away from the _Bolam_ test in respec t of the issue of advic e. The plaintiff went on to note that the position adopted in Australia had found favour with the Malaysian c ourts, and referred to _Foo Fio Na v Dr Soo Fook Mun and Anor_ [2007] 1 MLJ 593 (“ _Foo Fio Na_ ”), where the Federal Court of Malaysia endorsed the _Rogers_ approac h in preferenc e to the _Bolam_ test. 

121    The defenc e submitted that the plaintiff’s relianc e on the c ases from other jurisdic tions whic h showed a movement away from _Bolam_ in respec t of the issue of advic e was misguided for the following reasons. First, some of the key authorities relied on by the plaintiff had already been expressly rejec ted by the Singapore High Court in _Surender Singh_ (per Lai Siu Chiu J) on ac c ount that it was bound by the Court of Appeal dec ision in _Gunapathy_ : 

 152 In rec ent times however, the Bolam approac h has c ome under fire in several jurisdic tions, most notably in Australia and Canada. In [ Rogers ], the High Court of Australia explic itly 


 rejec t ed Bolam (at least in relation to the duty of disc losure and advic e) in favour of the approac h of the Supreme Court of Canada i n Reibl v Hughes (1980) 114 DLR (3d) 1. Rec ent Malaysian dec isions have also followed the Australian approac h and in [ Foo Fio Na ], the Federal Court finally rejec ted Bolam , preferring Rogers as the applic able test for assessing all forms of medic al negligenc e. 

 1 5 3 However, the law as it stands in Singapore and that which will be applied in this judgment, is Gunapathy's case , [the Court then proc eeded to read key paragraphs of Gunapathy , whic h have been set out earlier in this judgment, emphasising that the applic able test is the Bolam test as qualified by the Bolitho test of logic ] 

 [emphasis added] 

122    Sec ond, the highest the plaintiff had put her c ase was that there appeared to be a reluc tanc e in the English c ourts in more rec ent years to apply _Bolam_ and the majority view in _Sidaway_. However, the defenc e noted that i n _Pearce_ , the c ourt had expressly applied _Sidaway_. In this regard, I also observed that notwithstanding his language whic h appeared to lean towards defining liability by referenc e to the reasonable patient, Lord Woolf expressly ac c epted as law (at [18]) a passage of Lord Templeman’s speec h in _Sidaway_ whic h emphasised the problems of providing a patient with too muc h information: 

 Lord Templeman did not adopt quite the same approac h as either Lord Sc arman or the majority, but his speec h is partic ularly relied upon by Mr Ric hardson. I bear that in mind, but I would merely refer to one short passage at page 904: 

 “If the doc tor making a balanc ed judgment advises the patient to submit to the operation, the patient is entitled to rejec t that advic e for reasons whic h are rational, or irrational, or for no reason. The duty of the doc tor in these c irc umstanc es, subjec t to his overriding duty to have regard to the best interests of the patient, is to provide the patient with information whic h will enable the patient to make a balanc ed judgment if the patient c hooses to make a balanc ed judgment. A patient may make an unbalanc ed judgment bec ause he is deprived of adequate information. A patient may also make an unbalanced judgment if he is provided with too much information and is made aware of possibilities which he is not capable of assessing because of his lack of medical training, his prejudices or his personality.” 

 While rec ognising that Lord Templeman's approac h is not prec isely that of the majority, it seems to me that that statement of Lord Templeman does reflect the law and does not involve taking a different view from the majority. 

 [emphasis added] 

123    Further, although c ases like _Chester v Afshar_ [2005] 1 AC 134 (“ _Chester_ ”) suggested that the perspec tive of a reasonable patient should be adopted, this c ase did not assist the plaintiff. _Chester_ was a c ase on c ausation and not the duty and standards of advic e and the c omments on the standard of c are were thus _obiter_. Even so, it must be remembered t hat _Bolitho_ was also a c ase on c ausation and the important _obiter_ remarks have been widely ac c epted as supplementing the _Bolam_ test on breac h of duty. More pertinently, the c omments in _Chester_ may not be applic able in Singapore, as the judgment’s emphasis on human rights and autonomy might be attributed to the binding effec t of the European Convention of Human Rights on the English c ourts pursuant to the Human Rights Ac t 1998, whic h Singapore is not bound by. 


 Nature of advice The plaintiff’s position 

 a Risk of mortality in percentage terms 

 This is a signific ant matter c onc erning risk assessment that ought to have been c ommunic ated to MS. No advic e was given to MS on this. Moreover, Dr Tong’s estimate of a 3% mortality risk was not a reasonable figure as it was too low. 

 b Risk of mortality The risk of mortality assoc iated with a redoCABG is a signific ant risk that ought to have been c ommunic ated to MS. No advic e was given to MS on mortality risk at all. 

124    The plaintiff’s c harac terisation of the threshold of logic looks like an attempt to abolish _Bolam’s_ applic ability to the issue of advic e. This is at odds with the Court of Appeal’s dec ision in _Gunapathy_ whic h makes it c lear that the _Bolam_ and _Bolitho_ jurisprudenc e applies to the issue of advic e. _Gunapathy_ is binding on me. I do agree with the plaintiff that if the medic al profession illogic ally omits to warn of c ertain risks whic h patients should undoubtedly be informed of, then the c ourt should interfere on the authority of _Bolitho_. In this regard, I turn to a passage from the speec h of Lord Bridge in _Sidaway_ (at 900), where he was one of the majority judges: 

 But even in a c ase where, as here, no expert witness in the relevant medic al field c ondemns the non-disc losure as being in c onflic t with ac c epted and responsible medic al prac tic e, I am of opinion that the judge might in certain circumstances come to the conclusion that disclosure of a particular risk was so obviously necessary to an informed choice on the part of the patient that no reasonably prudent medical man would fail to make it. The kind of c ase I have in mind would be an operation involving a substantial risk of grave adverse c onsequenc es, as, for example, the ten per c ent. risk of a stroke from the operation whic h was the subjec t of the Canadian c ase of Reibl v. Hughes, 114 D.L.R. (3d) 1. In such a case, in the absence of some cogent clinical reason why the patient should not be informed, a doctor, recognising and respecting his patient's right of decision, could hardly fail to appreciate the necessity for an appropriate warning. 

 [emphasis added] 

Lord Bridge went on to find for the defendant, ac c epting the evidenc e of the medic al experts. 

**_Sub-issues relating to the pre-operative advice given by Dr Tong to MS regarding the redoCABG_** 

125    As stated earlier, the doc tor’s duty of c are is c omprehensive, and all referenc es to the “duty to advise” are to be understood in light of the c omprehensive duty. It is trite law that before a doc tor performs proc edures on a patient, the patient should be advised on his medic al c ondition, alternative treatment options, the nature of the treatment options and the respec tive benefits, risks and possible c omplic ations of eac h treatment option. 

126    The plaintiff’s written submissions c onc entrate on the advic e given on (i) the mortality and morbidity risks of the redoCABG, and (ii) whether MS was informed that his improving health provided him with an option to postpone. The plaintiff has highlighted several spec ific issues whic h she argues should have been c ommunic ated to MS and these are tabulated as follows: 


 c Risk of morbidity The risk of all the serious morbidities ought to have been c ommunic ated to MS. Dr Tong only advised MS on the risk of bleeding, small risk of stroke, and possibility of the re-oc c lusion of grafts. 

 d Risk in undergoing a redoCABG so soon after an initial CABG; and in the immediate aftermath of an AMI 

 This risk ought to have been spec ific ally c ommunic ated to MS. No advic e was given to MS on this. The very rec ent AMI still posed a signific ant risk whic h ought to have been c ommunic ated to MS. No advic e was given to MS on this. 

 e The option to postpone the redoCABG on ac c ount of MS’s improving health 

 The redoCABG was very risky on the ac c ount of its timing, and MS ought to have been informed of the signific anc e of his improving health, and that it provided him with an opportunity to delay the surgery. No advic e was given to MS on this. 

 Q. I have to press this point with you, bec ause it appears from the notes that there were far more than your affidavit statement c ares go into. My suggestion to you is that at these disc ussions, at whic h many of them you were not present, options were given to Steve, risks were disc ussed, the proc edure of CABG was disc ussed in detail -not just onc e but several times -and he had the opportunity with several doc tors, not just Dr Tong, so my suggestion you is that Steve was well aware of the options, he was well aware of the risk that CABG entailed and he knew what he was signing up for when he decided to proceed with the surgery; isn't that correct? 

 A. Yes, that's a fair assumption. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 41] 

127    It is pertinent to make three preliminary points. First, as noted, it was not disputed that MS signed a c onsent form on 11 Marc h 2007, prior to the redoCABG. However, the mere signing of a form in itself did not show that Dr Tong had not breac hed his duty to advise MS. 

128    Sec ond, there is generally no requirement for doc tors to explain risks whic h an average person is ordinarily aware of or whic h the partic ular patient has knowledge of (“pre-existing knowledge”). (See the Saskatc hewan first instanc e dec ision of _Haughian v Paine_ 1986 CarswellSask 184, overruled but not on this point.) Onc e the patient understands c ertain information, there may be no further need for the doc tor to provide the self-same information. Therefore, the standard of advic e whic h the doc tor should provide to his patient differs ac c ording to the pre-existing knowledge of the patient. However, Dr Tong would have breac hed his duty if he had not given MS any advic e on the nature of a redo-CABG, its risks and alternatives but assumed that MS had this information simply bec ause he had rec ently undergone the initial CABG. In c ross-examination, the plaintiff ac c epted that it was a fair assumption that Dr Tong did take steps to asc ertain with MS that MS understood the risks and c omplic ations of a CABG: 

However, while a redoCABG and the initial CABG follow the same proc edure, the risks of a redoCABG are higher and this is not disputed by Dr Tong. The plaintiff c laims that Dr Tong had a duty to advise MS on the higher mortality and morbidity risks of the redo-CABG. 


129    The third issue also pertains to the pre-existing knowledge of the patient, in a situation where a patient is attended to by a team of medic al personnel. Onc e a member of the team advises the patient of c ertain information and the patient understands suc h information, the patient c an be said to have pre-existing knowledge of suc h information with the effec t that the other members of the team need not repeat the same information to the patient. In the instant c ase, Dr Tong was one of a t eam of doc tors attending to MS (“the Medic al Team”). Dr Tong testified that when he rec eived a referral from a c ardiologist, Dr Christopher Chew in this c ase, he would work as a team with the 

c ardiologist. [note: 42] The Medic al Team c omprised Dr Tong, a c ardiothorac ic surgeon, Dr Christopher Chew, a c ardiologist and Dr Suelyn Chew, an anaesthetist. The defenc e noted that there were at least 12 instanc es of c ommunic ation between MS and the Medic al Team, six of whic h were with Dr Tong and Dr Christopher Chew. 

130    The defenc e went on to c ontend that MS had ample opportunity to ask his doc tors for more information if he felt that suc h information was needed. While ac c epting that MS c ould indeed have requested more information, I must reiterate that the onus remains on the doc tor to provide advic e, regardless of whether the patient asks any questions. The onus is not, and c annot be, on the patient to obtain information by asking questions. The reason for this is self-evident: a patient who does not know what information he does not know will not be able to ask for suc h information. To require ot herwise would be to put the patient in an impossible position. Guideline 4.22 of the Singapore Medic al Counc il (“SMC”) Ethic al Code and Ethic al Guidelines affirms that this is the position in Singapore: 

 4.2.2 Informed c onsent 

 It is a doctor’s responsibility to ensure that a patient under his care is adequately informed about his medic al c ondition and options for treatment so that he is able to partic ipate in dec isions about his treatment. If a proc edure needs to be performed, the patient shall be made aware of the benefits, risks and possible c omplic ations of the proc edure and any alternatives available to him... 

 [emphasis added] 

131    While the SMC Guidelines do not impose c ivil liability on the doc tors, they provide evidenc e as to the position taken by a reasonable body of medic al opinion. 

**_Sub-issue 2a: Whether Dr Tong’s failure to advised MS of the mortality risks in percentage terms amounted to a breach of duty_** 

_A preliminary issue: prejudice_ 

132    Dr Tong’s pleaded c ase was that he had informed MS that the mortality risk of a redoCABG was about 3%. Further, Dr Tong c laimed that it was “reasonable to advise of a 3% mortality risk on 

the basis of [his] knowledge and experienc e”. [note: 43] Moreover, there was c ontemporaneous written evidenc e that MS had been advised of the 3% risk, _viz_ , the Clinic ian’s Notes, where Dr Tong rec orded that the “usual OP risk of 3% for redo CABG + small risk of stroke [was] disc ussed”. Therefore, the plaint iff’s and defendant’s experts prepared their reports on the basis that the figure of 3% was c onveyed to MS. 

133    However, during c ross-examination, Dr Tong stated that he had in fac t _not_ related the spec ific 

perc entage figure to MS. [note: 44] His explanation for the rec ord in the Clinic ian’s Notes was that the 


figure of 3% was his estimated risk, whic h he had rec orded for his own purposes. Dr Tong’s c ase during trial was that he informed MS that the risks of the redoCABG were “signific antly several times 

more, higher than first-time operation”. [note: 45] 

134    The plaintiff’s position is that this statement during the hearing was one that was made “to everyone’s surprise”. The plaintiff argues that Dr Tong’s new position at t rial, _viz_ , that what was c ommunic ated to MS was _not_ 3% mortality risk but that the redoCABG was many times riskier than primary CABG is a distinc t and new c ase. Thus, ac c ording to the plaintiff, Dr Tong should not be allowed to depart from his pleaded c ase that a 3% mortality risk had been c ommunic ated, as this would c ause her to be unfairly prejudic ed. 

135    Prior to the defendant’s evidenc e in c ourt that he had not c ommunic ated the 3% figure to MS, the issue of mortality risks had been framed as a question of whether the _quantum_ of 3% was a reasonable one. Following the revelation that no spec ific perc entage had been c ommunic ated to MS at all, the plaintiff’s argument turned to Dr Tong’s duty to advise MS whic h would require him to quantify for MS the redoCABG’s mortality risks in perc entage terms. The plaintiff’s experts were questioned on the basis that the 3% risk had been c ommunic ated. The issue of whether it was reasonable for the doc tor to c ommunic ate a spec ific perc entage figure at all had not been raised and the plaintiff’s experts thus had no opportunity to give their opinions on the matter. The plaintiff stated that had she been informed of Dr Tong’s c hange in position earlier, she would have asked her experts to file supplementary affidavits on this spec ific point and her preparation of the c ase would have been different. 

136    The plaintiff further asserted that this c hange in position c alled into question the verac ity of the medic al notes and Dr Tong’s c redibility. On the fac e of it, the wording rec orded in the Clinic ian’s Notes seems to suggest that MS was advised spec ific ally of the 3% risk and the statement that no suc h advic e was given deviates from the c ontemporaneous evidenc e. The fac t that the c ontemporaneous evidenc e was not an ac c urate rec ord on this one point might leave doubts as to its evidential value. 

137    The plaintiff also argued that Dr Tong had asserted the positive c ase that he had informed and reasonably advised the late MS that the risk of mortality was 3%. Therefore, the burden was on Dr Tong to prove his positive c ase and he had c learly failed to do so. 

138    In response, the defenc e c ountered that there were no grounds for the plaintiff to argue that Dr Tong had c hanged his position. Dr Tong’s c ase was framed in terms of advising MS of the higher risks of a redoCABG as opposed to an initial CABG, rather than giving MS the figure of a 3% mortality risk. While I ac c ept that Dr Tong’s pleaded c ase was that he informed MS of the higher risks of a redo-CABG, paragraph 11 of the defenc e c learly states that: 

 Dr Tong warned MS (Milakov) that the mortality risk of a redoCABG was about 3% (higher than initial CABG), and that there was also a small risk of stroke... 

Further, at paragraph 25(2) of the defenc e, Dr Tong averred: 

 (2) ... Dr Tong further avers it was reasonable to advise of a 3% mortality risk on the basis of Dr Tong’s knowledge and experienc e; 

It c an be seen c learly that Dr Tong’s pleaded c ase was that he warned MS that the risk of the redoCABG was higher _and_ that he had warned MS of the 3% mortality risk in a redoCABG. It is thus unsurprising that preparations for trial proc eeded on the c ommon ground that the figure of 3% was 


 Q. If you go over the page to page 30, paragraph 56, you say: " Steve and I were only informed that there a 3% risk that the operation might not be successful. Dr MC Tong did not disc lose about the inc reased mortality risks in c onnec tion with redo heart bypass surgery. He also did not disc lose anything about the inc reased risk of undergoing redo heart bypass surgery so soon after the first bypass surgery or about the risks assoc iated with undergoing surgery so soon after a heart attac k or while suffering from diabetes." Again the assumption here, if you ac c ept what I said earlier about the c ase notes and what Dr Tong is rec orded as having said to Steve, partic ularly that risk in a redo is higher, and what Dr Chew said to Steve, whic h is that there is a c hanc e of serious risk of dying, and what Dr Suelyn Chew said to Steve, whic h is there's a greater risk of perioperative bleeding, this statement would not be c orrec t; do you agree? 

 A. Well, I think this statement -this statement here is qualified about the first bypass, about the risks assoc iated with undergoing surgery so soon after a heart attac k, or while suffering from diabetes. From my rec ollec tion of all those that you have referred to earlier, I don't think it takes into ac c ount these other fac tors that are stated here, if my rec ollec tion is c orrec t. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 46] 

c onveyed to MS. This was the view of the plaintiff and it was shared by the experts on both sides. 

139    Even so, I respec tfully disagree that the plaintiff would be unfairly prejudic ed. I begin by observing, as Dr Tong rightly pointed out to me, that it was the plaintiff who first raised the 3% figure in her statement of c laim (“SOC”). Paragraph 21 of the SOC states: 

 21 Milakov Steven and the Plaintiff were led to belief [ sic ] by Dr Tong that re-do c oronary artery surgery did not c arry with it any spec ial risks. The only information they received form Dr Tong was that there was a 3% risk of the surgery not being successful. Neither were Milakov Steven or the Plaintiff aware of serious c omplic ations and/or risks assoc iated ... 

 [emphasis added] 

The 3% figure appeared again under the partic ulars of breac h at paragraph 29(b) (for negligenc e) and paragraph 32(b) (under c ontrac t). Paragraph 29(b) reads: 

 b. He breac hed his duty of c are when he misinformed Milakov Steven that the re-do c oronary surgery that he rec ommended only c arried a very small operative risk of 3% of the surgery not being suc c essful. This information was not only wrong but was wholly inadequate; 

The c orresponding paragraph 32(b) reads: 

 b. He breac hed the agreement when he misinformed Milakov Steven that the re-do c oronary surgery that he rec ommended only c arried a very small operative risk of 3% of the surgery not being suc c essful. This information was not only wrong but was wholly inadequate; 

140    The 3% figure was also found in the plaintiff’s affidavit. At trial, the figure was even read from the affidavit to Dr Tong, who did not objec t to it. 

141    When Dr Tong stated at trial that he had not c ommunic ated the 3% figure to MS, c ounsel for 


the plaintiff did not c ontest this. It is also c lear from the plaintiff’s written submissions that the plaintiff ac c epts that the 3% figure was not c ommunic ated to MS. How then did the spec ific figure of 3% manage to find its way into the SOC and the plaintiff’s affidavit? I found this to be quite puzzling. 

142    In addition, just as Dr Tong’s c hange of position might be a reason to doubt the evidential value of the c ontemporaneous medic al notes in proving what transpired between MS and the doc tors, the plaintiff’s c hange of position might be a reason to doubt the c redibility of her c laims. If the plaintiff did c ome to know of the 3% figure from Dr Tong, it would not do for her to say that she did not know of the perc entage figure simply bec ause Dr Tong said he never c ommunic ated it. 

143    I add also that I believe the plaintiff’s submission that Dr Tong c arries the burden to prove the positive c ase whic h he asserted is misguided. If the SOC did not mention the 3% figure and simply ac c used Dr Tong not advising MS of the redoCABG’s mortality risks, then Dr Tong would be asserting a positive c ase if he denied that he did not advise regarding the mortality risks on the basis that he c ommunic ated the 3% risk figure. In that situation, I would hold that Dr Tong had the burden to prove that he did in fac t c ommunic ate the 3% figure. However, the plaintiff’s c laim inc luded both the ac c usation that Dr Tong had not advised MS adequately regarding the mortality risks _and_ the ac c usation that the 3% figure whic h he did advise on was a negligent underestimation. In these c irc umstanc es, the defenc e to the plaintiff’s c laim was not exac tly the assertion of a positive c ase sinc e it may be understood as simply ac c epting the plaintiff’s initial averment that the 3% risk figure was c ommunic ated. 

144    Even so, sinc e Dr Tong’s position was that he never c ommunic ated the 3% figure to MS, he should not have ac c epted that he did so in the defenc e. It is also true that in the c irc umstanc es, the plaintiff was deprived of the opportunity to adduc e evidenc e through her expert witnesses regarding the issue whether Dr Tong breac hed his duty to advise MS regarding the redoCABG by not quantifying the risk for MS in perc entage terms. However, while it would have been more helpful to have had more evidenc e presented on this spec ific point, I find that there is suffic ient evidenc e before me on whic h I c an base my dec ision. Although the plaintiff’s experts did not have the c hanc e to testify on this spec ific issue, the defenc e’s experts did give c onvinc ing views whic h I will elaborate on when I move to c onsider the issue proper below. 

145    The _Bolam_ test simply requires that Dr Tong’s prac tic e relating to advic e be affirmed by a body of responsible medic al men skilled in his partic ular art. I will go on to demonstrate below that the evidenc e of Dr Tong’s experts was satisfac torily affirmatory in that respec t. I am also c onfident that any evidenc e whic h the plaintiff’s experts might have provided, short of proving that Dr Tong’s experts did not c onstitute a body of responsible medic al men skilled in Dr Tong’s art, would not c hange my finding in that regard. Therefore, I find that although the misleading nature of Dr Tong’s averments up to the trial should be frowned upon, it did not prejudic e the plaintiff in the outc ome of this c ase. 

146    For the rec ord, I ac c ept Dr Tong’s testimony that he did not c ommunic ate the 3% risk figure to MS and that he had instead simply told MS that the risk of his redoCABG would be “signific antly several times more” than the initial CABG. I c onsidered whether Dr Tong’s c hange of position at trial might have been an expedient tac tic due to his realisation after the plaintiff’s experts gave their evidenc e that 3% was an indefensible underestimation of the redoCABG’s risk. However, Dr Tong did not abandon his position that the 3% figure was reasonable. He stated that the 3% figure was what was on his notes and in his mind when he c ommunic ated to MS that the risk of the redoCABG was “signific antly several times more” than the initial CABG. Sinc e MS was dead, Dr Tong was the only person who c ould give evidenc e regarding exac tly what he said to MS and I saw no advantage to be gained by dec eit on his part, I therefore ac c ept his evidenc e on this. It remains for me to add that, in 


any event, I found that Dr Tong’s 3% risk estimate was not negligently made (see paragraphs [83] – [88] above). As for how the plaintiff obtained the 3% figure for her c laim, in the absenc e of a forthright explanation from the plaintiff, I c an only c onjec ture that she had sight of some medic al report or other in the aftermath of MS’s demise whic h mentioned the figure. 

_Whether Dr Tong’s failure to inform MS of the exact percentage figure of the risk amounted to a breach of duty_ 

147    Moving on to the issue proper, Dr Tong’s evidenc e at trial made it c lear that he did not inform M S of the perc entage figure of risk, and the plaintiff argued that this amounted to a breac h of Dr Tong’s duty to advise. First, the plaintiff argued that the standard prac tic e in Singapore was to c onvey spec ific perc entage figures of risks. In support, the plaintiff c ontended that if the issue of quantum was not important, Dr Tong would not have stated that he had informed MS of the 3% risk in his affidavit and that this figure was reasonable. This was c harac terised by the plaintiff as an admission that suc h c ommunic ation ought to have been part of the sc ope of reasonable advic e that was c ommunic ated to MS. 

148    Further, the plaintiff noted that all the expert c ardiothorac ic surgeons who had given evidenc e during the hearing referred to various risks models whic h highlighted in perc entage terms the risk of mortality and serious morbidity. The experts derived these figures from two international sc oring systems, namely the EuroSCORE and STS. As noted earlier, these are well-rec ognised systems whic h are used, among other things, to provide a spec ific quantum of mortality risks. While the experts had disagreed on the _quantum_ of the risk, they had all used perc entage figures in their expert opinions. The plaintiff argued that if there was no established prac tic e of providing an estimate of mortality risks in perc entage terms, the experts would not have taken so muc h effort to address this issue in their respec tive expert opinions. 

149    However, in my view, the extensive disc ussion of the 3% figure was a func tion of how the plaintiff’s c laim was framed in the first plac e. Dr Tong’s pleadings whic h in all appearanc es affirmed that he c ommunic ated the 3% figure to the plaintiff c ontributed to the eventual melee at the c entre of whic h was the issue of what the redoCABG’s risks should have been reasonably quantified as. That issue naturally led the experts to foc us their disc ussions on perc entages and risk sc ores. Having said that, I would ac c ept that the doc tors are familiar with how one c an responsibly c onc eptualise risks in terms of perc entages and that they have a standard prac tic e of _considering_ the risks in terms of perc entage figures. Nevertheless, this does not nec essarily mean that the doc tors have a standard prac tic e of _communicating_ these perc entage figures. 

150    Ultimately, as I stated earlier, I found the expert evidenc e adduc ed by Dr Tong on this issue to be dec isive. Prof Buxton stated in his written expert opinion (exhibited to his affidavit) the following (at paragraph 2.18) whic h I found extremely pertinent: 

 2.18 In MS’s c ase, he had been informed of an estimated mortality risk of 3% in redoCABGs. A 3% mortality risk is a signific ant risk of death whic h MS appeared to understand. It is also higher than the mortality risk of a first CABG. In practice, many surgeons will not inform patients of the exact percentage or risk, and simply inform the patients that a redo-CABG comes with significant risk of death, higher than in a first CABG. Either case is acceptable. 

 [emphasis added] 

151    I note in partic ular this written opinion was tendered before the trial _ie_ before Dr Tong stated that he did not ac tually c ommunic ate a spec ific perc entage to MS. Prof Buxton went on to testify 


 COURT:Are you saying therefore that as a matter of prac tic e the surgeon should c onvey to the patient their mortality and morbidity risk in terms of perc entage or otherwise? 

 Dr Sin: I think they should do both , depending on how the patient c an understand, if the patient is fully equipped to understand a perc entage, but I would still give a relativity, because it's like the price of a car -here versus in Malaysia versus UK. They are all so different. What is expensive and what is not? You can't tell with just an absolute figure. So I always say you must have a relative benchmark, and the purposes of all this is really to benchmark and help either the surgeon dec ides, what the patient dec ides, but the relationship is between the surgeon and the patient and what the surgeon thinks is a reasonable estimate. 

 [emphasis added] 

that in prac tic e, many surgeons would _not_ inform patients of the exac t perc entage of risk and would simply inform patients that a redoCABG involved a signific ant risk of death, higher than that in an 

initial CABG. [note: 47] 

152    I also had regard to Dr Sin’s expert report (exhibited to his affidavit whic h was also tendered before the trial) whic h stated at paragraph 43: 

 43 It should be noted that a 3% risk of mortality, whic h means death during the surgery itself or in the immediate 30 post-operative days, is a significant risk especially when it is highlighted as higher than in initial CABG which by itself is already a major procedure. In my experienc e, a patient who has been warned of death, espec ially a signific ant 3% risk of death, would be well equipped to understand the high risk of the surgery whic h he is undergoing and to c hoose whether to undergo the surgery or not. 

 [emphasis added] 

Notwithstanding the sec ond sentenc e of the said paragraph 43, the first sentenc e c learly implies that the signific anc e of the risk is brought out not merely by the 3% figure but _especially_ more so when it is highlighted as higher than an initial CABG. This provides c onvinc ing support for Dr Tong’s c ase. 

153    The plaintiff also argued that Prof Buxton was not familiar with loc al prac tic e in Singapore and observed that Dr Sin, who prac tises in Singapore, believed that it was an established prac tic e in Singapore to provide advic e to patients awaiting a redoCABG in terms of perc entages of mortality (s e e [154] below). However, Dr Sin also testified regarding the diffic ulties in giving spec ific risk 

perc entages and opined that to do so without a relative indic ation might not be helpful: [note: 48] 

 Now, it's a problem whenever I talk to patients, bec ause on some years we ac tually have zero mortalities in low risk CABGs, and unfortunately I c annot tell patients that, “Your mortality is zero.” It is a major operation. It is a risky operation. All open heart surgeries are risky, muc h as my patients would like to hear me say, “There is no risk.” ... So when you look at what is high risk, a lot of times we have to give a relative number to help. Some patients like a hard figure, but you would still like to have a benc hmark, so in the c ase of a patient where I say, “Well, our usual risk is 2 to 3 per c ent, and in your c ase your risk is ‘usual’,” then the patient understands that yes, there is a risk, but my risk is usual. On the other hand, if I were to tell a patient that your risk is 30 per c ent, he has no referenc e – is this high or is this low? 

154    When I pursued this matter with Dr Sin, he responded as follows [note: 49] : 


 COURT:My point to you is, having that c onc ession by Dr Tong, what would your opinion be sinc e he did not tell Mr Milakov that the risk was 3 per c ent? Dr Sin: I think the relative -the relativity is more important. It would have been nice to have an absolute figure , but if the patient c an't really have a referenc e point and I c an also understand bec ause SJMC didn't give a figure, and if SJMC didn't give a figure and then we give a figure, the patient gets very confused, or if they give a figure and we give a different figure and ours may be even lower than theirs, depending on how they calculate it , so usually if SJMC had given a figure, I would then say okay, as SJMC told you this risk, now for a redo we say it's at least three or four times, or whatever more times more, I'll then give you this figure so there is a c onsistenc y in how the risk is presented to the patient. So there must always be that relativity, consistency and a benchmark in terms of where we reference a risk score. [emphasis added] 

Therefore, while the plaintiff was right to note that Dr Sin did say that doc tors should c onvey risks in terms of perc entages, this was not an entirely ac c urate portrayal of Dr Sin’s opinion. Dr Sin had repeatedly emphasised that it was more important to c onvey the risks in relative terms, rather than in absolute perc entage figures. 

155    In partic ular, Dr Sin also highlighted that giving MS an absolute figure might have been potentially c onfusing for MS sinc e he might have tried to c ompare it with any absolute risk figures 

whic h SJMC gave to him: [note: 50] 

156    I agree with Dr Sin that it is more important to c onvey the risks in terms of relativity rather than in terms of an absolute perc entage figure. As seen above, risk figures are merely estimates and may legitimately differ to some extent. The perc entages c an vary widely depending on whether the EuroSCORE or the STS system is used, _viz_ 14.34% and 2.3% respec tively in this c ase. In partic ular, Dr Sin alluded to the disparity between the two systems: 

 I c an give that patient a EuroSCORE and he may freak out bec ause it's so high, or I c an give him an STS and he may not freak out bec ause it's so low. 

I note that the reluc tanc e of expert medic al witnesses to measure risks in perc entage terms is not unique to the experts that were before me, as Lord Bridge had observed in _Sidaway_ (at 900 – 901) that “some of the expert medic al witnesses c alled expressed a marked and understandable reluc tanc e” to “measure suc h risks in perc entage terms”. 

157    I will now address the plaintiff’s sec ond argument, _viz_ , that perc entage terms would provide the patient with an easy referenc e to understand the risks of mortality. It would be easy for a reasonably intelligent person to apprec iate that a 3% risk meant that three out of 100 patients would not survive the surgery. Even if there is no general legal requirement for doc tors to provide risk estimates in perc entage terms, this does not rule out the possibility that in some c ases, the failure to disc uss risks in perc entage terms might amount to a breac h of duty. In the instant c ase, it is unc ontroversial that MS would have understood the implic ations of the perc entage figure 

158    While Dr Sin ac knowledged as muc h and stated that “if the patient is fully equipped to understand a perc entage”, then it ought to be c onveyed, there was nothing to suggest that the

 (b) 

positions of Prof Buxton and Dr Sin set out in their reports (in the quotations above) stating there was no need to c ommunic ate a spec ific risk perc entage did not apply to patients who c ould understand the c onc ept of a perc entage risk figure. Indeed, thanks to the spread of numeric al literac y in today’s Australian and Singaporean soc ieties in whic h Prof Buxton and Dr Sin prac tise, it is likely that the majority of patients would understand a risk perc entage figure presented to them. Therefore, while it might be good medic al prac tic e to c onvey risks both in terms of relativity _and_ in perc entage figures, I find that there is a responsible body of medic al opinion whic h supports Dr Tong’s dec ision to c onvey the risks to MS only in relative terms, without a perc entage figure. 

159    Therefore, taking all the evidenc e into c onsideration, I find that Dr Tong’s duty to advise MS did not behove him to present MS with a spec ific risk perc entage. I found that by making c lear to MS that the redoCABG presented him with a risk that was “signific antly several times more” than the initial CABG, MS was adequately impressed with the gravity of the dec ision he was being asked to make and the signific anc e of the risk he was undertaking. 

**_Sub-issue 2b: Whether Dr Tong informed MS about the risks of mortality associated with the redo-CABG_** 

160    It is c lear that the mortality risks assoc iated with a redoCABG are higher than those of an initial CABG. In the instant c ase, in addition to being riskier than an initial CABG, the partic ular redoCABG that MS was to undergo was also riskier than a ‘normal’ redo-CABG for the following reasons: 

 The two proximities in time 

 The proximity in time between the redo-CABG and the initial CABG (“the first proximity in time”) 

 The proximity in time between the redo-CABG and the AMI suffered by MS (“the sec ond proximity in time”) 

 MS’s history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. 

The plaintiff asserts that Dr Tong ought to have spec ific ally advised MS of the two proximities in time. This assertion will be dealt with later in the judgment. I will first examine the general issue of whether the risk of mortality assoc iated with a redoCABG was disc ussed at all, before moving to the spec ific issues on the inc reased risks of the partic ular CABG that MS was to undergo. 

161    There is a fac tual dispute on whether the mortality risks were disc losed. It is important to observe that it is not the plaintiff’s c ase that Dr Tong had to advise MS that the mortality risks in a redo-CABG were _higher_ than that of an initial CABG. The plaintiff’s c ase is that the risk of mortality in a redoCABG was a signific ant risk and that Dr Tong did not disc lose this risk to MS; she does not argue that the relativity of the risks between a redoCABG and an initial CABG need to be spec ific ally highlighted. It was Dr Tong who brought up the point on relativity, as he asserted that he had advised MS that the risks of mortality and c omplic ations in a redoCABG were several times higher than those of an initial CABG. 


162    The onus is on the plaintiff to demonstrate, on a balanc e of probabilities, that the risks of mortality assoc iated with a redoCABG were not disc losed and not on Dr Tong to show that he had advised MS that the risks of mortality in a redoCABG were higher than that of an initial CABG. The plaintiff argues that “[i]f Dr Tong did not warn the late Milakov about the risk of mortality as pleaded in the Defenc e, one would have to fall bac k on the c ase of the Plaintiff that Dr Tong did not advise Milakov about the risk of mortality at all”. I respec tfully disagree with the plaintiff on this point. It is inc orrec t to state that there are only two possible fac tual sc enarios, namely, that MS was advised of a 3% mortality risk or that MS rec eived no advic e on the risk of mortality at all. The evidenc e will be examined to determine what advic e, if any, was given to MS on the inc reased mortality risks of the redo-CABG as c ompared to his initial CABG. 

163    I will first examine the c ontemporaneous evidenc e. There are two main sourc es of c ontemporaneous written evidenc e. The Clinic ian’s Notes (a joint rec ord c ompiled by the members of the Medic al Team) and the Clinic al Summary furnished by M. C. Tong Cardiothorac ic Surgery Centre (“the Clinic al Summary”) and Dr Tong’s personal notes. As stated earlier, Dr Tong made an entry in the Clinic ian’s Notes on 9 Marc h 2007 at 12.00 noon that the “usual OP risk of 3% for redo CABG + small risk of stroke disc ussed”, though Dr Tong subsequently c onc eded that the figure of 3% was never c onveyed to MS. In the Clinic al Summary, Dr Tong rec orded that the “usual op risk of stroke and bleeding in redo-op is higher”. 

164    It must be noted that on the fac e of it, the rec ord did not say that this risk was _communicated_ to MS. The plaintiff also pointed out that Dr Tong’s Clinic al Summary made no referenc e to mortality risks but only referred to stroke and bleeding. Therefore, the c ontemporaneous medic al notes appear to support the plaintiff’s c ase that there was no disc losure of mortality risks. 

165    I will now turn to the rec ollec tion of the parties as to what advic e was given during the c onsultations. 

_Dr Tong’s consultation with MS on 9 March 2007 at 12.00 noon_ 

166    Dr Tong stated that during this c onsultation, he had “emphasised to MS that a redo CABG had a muc h higher risk of mortality and other possible c omplic ations. [He] informed MS that the mortality 

risk was higher than the first CABG...”. [note: 51] Dr Tong also asserted that he was aware of MS’s “history of borderline diabetes mellitus and hypertension, [and] advised him that these c onditions, if not under medic al c ontrol, [might] put him at greater risks c ompared with a patient who did not have 

these c onditions”. [note: 52] 

_Dr Christopher Chew’s consultation with MS on 9 March 2007 at 12.55pm_ 

167    This review took plac e shortly after MS’s disc ussion with Dr Tong. Dr Christopher Chew stated t ha t while he c ould not rec ollec t exac tly what was said at eac h disc ussion, at this partic ular c onsultation, MS explained to him that Dr Tong had rec ommended a redoCABG. Dr Christopher Chew opined that “MS was well aware that there was a serious risk that he c ould die from the redoCABG itself, and that there were risks of c omplic ations”. Further, Dr Chew asserted that he affirmed his agreement with Dr Tong’s assessment of the risks involved in the redo-CABG. 

_Dr Tong’s consultation with MS on 10 March 2007_ 

168    Dr Tong c laims that he “reiterated that there was a higher risk of mortality ... in a redoCABG 

as c ompared to an initial CABG”. [note: 53] 


_Dr Christopher Chew’s consultation with MS on 10 March 2007_ 

169    Dr Christopher Chew admitted that he c ould not rec ollec t exac tly what was said during this disc ussion but stated his belief that he went through the matters previously disc ussed, “inc luding the 

risks, proc edure and pros and c ons of a redoCABG...”. [note: 54] It must be noted that Dr Christopher Chew made no referenc e to _mortality_ risks spec ific ally. 

_The plaintiff’s arguments_ 

170    The plaintiff ac knowledges that she does not have the evidenc e of MS to c ounter what Dr Tong c laimed he had c ommunic ated to MS. However, she asserts that based on the c ontemporaneous evidenc e, there is nothing to suggest that the issue of mortality was disc ussed with MS. Further, she notes that Dr Christopher Chew had c onc eded that he was not able to rec ollec t the c ommunic ations between MS and himself. He also did not c laim to know the spec ific issues relating to mortality in a redo-CABG. 

171    Counsel for the plaintiff also asserted that even though MS met with the Medic al Team on 12 oc c asions, this fac t was neither important nor relevant, as the only person who c ould have c ommunic ated the risk of mortality assoc iated with the redoCABG surgery was the c ardiothorac ic surgeon on the Medic al Team, _ie_ Dr Tong. I respec tfully disagree with c ounsel for the plaintiff on this issue. To state that only Dr Tong c ould give advic e on the risks of the surgery ignores the reality of how a Medic al Team works in prac tic e. It would also lead to unwanted reperc ussions, where eac h doc tor has to run through all the risks of a proc edure, leading to ineffic ienc ies and an ultimately reduc ed quality of c are. 

_Finding_ 

172    As stated above, I ac c epted Dr Tong’s evidenc e that he warned MS that the risks for a redoCABG would be “signific antly several times more” than those for an initial CABG. It is unc ontroversial that MS met several doc tors separately on several oc c asions. I rec all the following passage from _Gunapathy_ at [131]: 

 131 Ac c ordingly, we found that the judge had manifestly erred in his findings relating to the advic e rendered by the doc tors. Given the inc oherenc e of Gunapathy's testimony, there was no justific ation in refuting the c onsistent testimony of the three doc tors who gave c lear evidenc e that she had been informed of the relevant risks. Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that Gunapathy was an educated person, with the presence of mind to seek confirmation by obtaining a second opinion. She had also been suffering under the spectre of brain cancer for more than a year. It seemed most unlikely that she would have allowed herself to be brushed aside with half-baked advice that radiosurgery was "simple" without more. In the totality of evidenc e, we ac c epted the ac c ount given by the doc tors that they had properly informed her of the risks inherent in radiosurgery. 

173    Of c ourse, MS did not seek a sec ond opinion in this c ase but he and the plaintiff were c learly educ ated persons and I find it hard to believe that they did not disc uss the possibility of death with any of the doc tors during any of those c onsultations. Even if they did not, I also find it diffic ult to believe that MS did not apprec iate that the CABG surgery in Houston c arried with it the risk of death. The CABG is open heart surgery whic h involves sawing through the sternum and interfering direc tly with the heart. Surely, MS must have apprec iated that the operation might not go well and that he fac ed a signific ant risk of dying. Having found that MS was told that he fac ed a risk that was 


 Q. -you said nothing else to him about the risk fac tors assoc iated with mortality or about morbidity? A. Well, this is -already mortality is there, at 3 per c ent is there. I mention all that to him, and the other medic al c omplic ation whic h may or may not oc c ur, whic h is only when the major diffic ulty intraoperatively oc c urred then other c omplic ation may be likely to oc c ur. So I don't see any point to point out everything to him. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 55] 

 Q. After c onsultation with whom? 

 A. With Mr Milakov, but in ac tual -I did not what is the -in numbers – ac tual numbers. I said, "Your operative mortality and complications is expected to be significantly several times more, higher than the first-time operation." He nod his head, he understand. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 56] 

“signific antly several times more” in respec t of the redoCABG, I have no trouble holding that he was adequately advised of the signific ant mortality risk whic h he fac ed. 

**_Sub-issue 2c: Whether Dr Tong informed MS of the risk of all the serious morbidities_** 

174    It is unc ontroverted that Dr Tong warned MS of the risk of bleeding, a small risk of a stroke and the possibility of the re-oc c lusion of the grafts. That suc h risks were disc ussed appears c learly from the c ontemporaneous evidenc e. Dr Suelyn Chew, an anaesthetist, also doc umented her advic e on the higher risks of bleeding perioperatively in the Clinic ian’s Notes. However, the plaintiff asserts Dr Tong failed to warn MS of the possibility of serious infec tion, renal failure, liver failure, heart malfunc tion and multi organ failure and she c laims that this amounted to a breac h of Dr Tong’s duty to advise MS. Dr Tong does not dispute that he did not, in fac t, warn MS of the possibility of renal failure, liver failure, heart malfunc tion and multi organ failure. Dr Tong further stated on c ross-examination that he only saw it nec essary to advise MS on the primary and major c omplic ations: 

175    Dr Tong also stated that he warned MS that the risks of c omplic ations would be “signific antly several times more” than the initial CABG, whic h I ac c epted: 

176    Nevertheless, the question is: does the doc tor have a duty to warn the patient of all the major morbidities spec ific ally? The defenc e argues that even though Dr Tong did not advise MS o f _all_ the serious morbidities, this did not amount to a breac h of his duty. The experts c alled by the defenc e opined that it ac c orded with ac c epted prac tic e not to list all the morbidities. Dr Sin agreed that the risks of major morbidities should be c onveyed to the patients but that what ought to be c onveyed 

was the “big headings” of risks. [note: 57] In his opinion, providing a c omprehensive list of morbidities 

and their perc entages would serve to c onfuse patients and might give a “false sense of risk”. [note: 58] 

177    The defenc e relied on _Sidaway_ , where Lord Bridge opined on the duty to advic e: 

 There are, it appears to me, at least theoretic ally, two extreme positions whic h c ould be taken. It c ould be argued that, if the patient's c onsent is to be fully informed, the doctor must 


 specifically warn him of all risks involved in the treatment offered, unless he has some sound c linic al reason not to do so. Logic ally, this would seem to be the extreme to whic h a truly objec tive c riterion of the doc tor's duty would lead. Yet this position finds no support from any authority, to which we have been referred, in any jurisdiction. 

 [emphasis added] 

The defenc e thus argued that there is no requirement that all mortalities and morbidities must be advised and that a doc tor is entitled to exerc ise c linic al judgment in dec iding the degree of disc losure of risks to c onvey, bearing in mind the objec tive of assisting the partic ular patient to make a rational c hoic e as to whether or not to undergo the treatment in question. I ac c ept this argument, as it ac c ords with the c lear position under Singapore law that _Bolam_ applies to the duty to advic e. 

178    In this regard, I also c onsidered the following passage from _Gunapathy_ at [132]: 

 Two defenc e experts agreed that what the doc tors had disc losed in their advic e to Gunapathy was suffic ient in the present c ase. We did not find this opinion to be illogical, for, as explained by Prof Karlsson, the rationale should merely be that the patient understood the main risks of the operation. Ac c ordingly, on an applic ation of the Bolam test to the issue of advic e, the defendant doc tors would not be liable in negligenc e. 

 [emphasis added] 

I find that MS was aware that the redoCABG might result in death and/or c omplic ations whic h would lead to morbidities, a few of whic h were spec ific ally mentioned to him. Ac c ordingly, I find that MS understood the main risks of the operation and Dr Tong did not fail to advise MS properly on the redoCABG in this regard. 

**_Sub-issue 2d: Whether Dr Tong was required to specifically inform MS of the increased risks due to the two proximities in time_** 

179    With regard to the first proximity in time, as explained above, after the initial CABG, there would be sc arring of the tissues in the c hest and these tissues would be highly vasc ularised. A redoCABG would thus involve heavier blood loss than an initial CABG. The freeing of the vasc ular adhesions between the heart and the breast bone and the peric ardium and the heart during the redoCABG would have resulted in a high degree of bleeding in MS’s c ase, given that he had undergone the initial CABG only about 7 weeks prior to the redo. 

180    It must be noted that it was the plaintiff’s c ase that the redoCABG had taken plac e within six weeks from the initial CABG but this appeared to be a c alc ulation error. Nonetheless, nothing material turns on the disc repanc y. The plaintiff emphasised that the proximity in time between a redoCABG and an initial CABG was not a usual feature of a redoCABG but was both very unc ommon and very risky and thus needed to be spec ific ally highlighted to MS. 

181    With regard to the sec ond proximity in time, Dr Sharma testified that operating after a patient had an AMI was an extremely risky proposition as it would involve stopping the patient’s heart after 

part of it had died and asking it to restart again. [note: 59] Prof Buxton agreed that the two proximities 

would enhanc e and inc rease the risk of mortality and major morbidities. [note: 60] 

182    The plaintiff c laims that Dr Tong breac hed his duty to obtain informed c onsent as he failed to inform MS of the partic ular issue of the two proximities in time. She further c laims that the two 


proximities “c ompounded eac h other and had a c umulative effec t in c onnec tion with elevating the risk fac tor in relation to mortality and major morbidity”. This appeared to be ac knowledged by Prof Buxton who opined that the risks of the partic ular surgery MS was to undergo would probably be at the “higher end of the range of risk modelling results”, as it was unc ommon to find a patient who has had “two bypass proc edures within two months or six weeks and, sec ondly, has had an [AMI] prior to the 

[redo-CABG]”. [note: 61] 

183    I noted that the c ases whic h the plaintiff c ites in support of her c laims, indeed, most of the landmark c ases in this area of law, involve doc tors being sued for the failure to warn of unlikely negat ive outc omes whic h ultimately oc c urred. In _Bolam_ , the plaintiff underwent elec troc onvulsive therapy but was not warned that he might suffer a frac ture, whic h he did. In _Sidaway_ , the plaintiff underwent an operation to treat rec urrent pain in her nec k, right shoulder and arms. She was not warned of a risk of between 1 – 2 % that her spinal c olumn might be damaged. The damage oc c urred and she bec ame severely disabled. In _Rogers_ , the plaintiff had lived almost forty years being almost totally blind in her right eye. She was not warned that surgery to help her injured right eye might affec t her good left eye. This was despite the fac t that she asked spec ific ally whether her good eye might be affec ted. Tragic ally, the surgery c aused her to develop a c ondition whic h led to the c omplete loss of sight in her left eye. In _Pearce_ , the plaintiff who was fourteen days beyond her pregnanc y term was advised by her doc tor that medic al intervention as not appropriate given the risks. However, she was not warned by her doc tor that this would inc rease the risk of a stillbirth by 0.1 – 0.2 %. Unfortunately, the untoward event happened and the plaintiff sued. It must be noted that in all these c ases, the patient sued the doc tor for the failure to warn of spec ific morbidities that eventually oc c urred. 

184    Turning to the present c ase, I have found above that that MS was adequately advised on the risk of mortality and morbidities. The plaintiff’s c omplaint here is that MS was unaware that the two proximities would _increase_ the mortality and morbidity risks of the redoCABG and that he should have been advised of that. I have held that MS was warned that the risks of death and morbidities would be “signific antly several times higher”. I should think that, having been advised of the inc reased risks, the omission to advise spec ific ally of _why_ the risks would be inc reased was reasonable and did not amount to a breac h of the duty to advise. Therefore, I find that Dr Tong’s failure to warn MS spec ific ally of the inc rease in risks _due to_ the two proximities was not negligent. 

**_Sub-issue 2e: Whether Dr Tong informed MS of the option to postpone the redo-CABG on account of MS’s improving condition_** 

185    The plaintiff c laims that the option to postpone was never given to MS and that the first time Dr Tong mentioned the option was while he was preparing the defenc e. The plaintiff argues that MS was never advised of the signific anc e of his improving c ondition, _ie_ , that this improvement provided him with an opportunity to delay the redoCABG, instead of going ahead on the sc heduled date of 12 Marc h 2007. 

186    However, in the plaintiff’s reply to Dr Tong’s written submission, the plaintiff appears to c onc ede that there was a disc ussion between MS and Dr Tong on the option to postpone the surgery: 

 The disc ussion on the 10 Marc h 2007 to postpone the surgery was merely an exerc ise Dr Tong embarked in wanting to c onfirm that Milakov’s dec ision to proc eed with the surgery as the Plaintiff had informed him the day before that Milakov was still unsure about going ahead with the surgery. The medic al and c linic al notes as well as the medic al reports prepared by Dr Tong do not support his c ontention that he offered to delay the surgery bec ause Milakov’s health was 


 improving. 

 [emphasis original] [note: 62] 

187    This seems to be a shift from the plaintiff’s earlier position that the first time Dr Tong raised the issue about an opportunity to delay the surgery was when he prepared his defenc e to the c ase and that he had never given MS this disc ussion to postpone. As I understand it, the re-c harac terisation of the issue is that Dr Tong did offer the option to postpone the surgery but did not tell MS about the improvement in his health. The plaintiff c laims that “what is important is not so muc h the disc ussion on postponement of RedoCABG but whether Dr Tong informed the late Milakov that his improving health required him to revisit the dec ision of RedoCABG Surgery on 12 Marc h 2007” and that the “offer to postponing [ _sic_ ] the surgery is one thing but providing the reason why the surgery c an be safely postponed is quite another”. 

188    However, in the c ontemporaneous Clinic ian’s Notes, Dr Tong rec orded an entry on 10 Marc h 2007 stating: 

 Have another talk with patients options of either to postpone or go ahead with the redo CABG on Monday [12 Marc h 2007] disc ussed thoroughly. He dec ided to be operated on Monday. Feeling better today... 

189    While this does not state that the option to postpone was offered to MS _because of his improving condition_ , it is c lear that Dr Tong was aware that MS’s c ondition had improved. Dr Tong affirmed in his AEIC that MS’s improved c ondition had a c ausal effec t on the provision of the option to 

postpone: [note: 63] 

 In light of the improvement in his c ondition, I explained to MS that he c ould postpone the redoCABG or proc eed as sc heduled on 12 Marc h 2007. We had a thorough disc ussion about both options. I explained that he c ould c onsider postponement of the redoCABG as his improved condition reduced the urgency of an immediate redo-CABG ... I asked MS if he had c onsidered the pros and c ons, and made up his mind on the redoCABG, and to let me know if he had any other queries. He c onfirmed that he had dec ided to proc eed with the redoCABG on 12 Marc h 2007, and that he had no other queries ... 

 [emphasis added] 

190    Further, Dr Tong pointed out that the plaintiff’s submissions c ontradic ted her testimony in c ourt. The plaintiff’s submissions stated that the 10 Marc h 2007 disc ussion regarding the postponement of the surgery took plac e bec ause MS was unsure about the surgery at that stage and Dr Tong wanted to c hec k if MS indeed wanted to proc eed with the surgery. Therefore, the plaintiff said, it was not true that Dr Tong offered MS the option to postpone the surgery on the ac c ount that MS’s health was improving. 

191    However, the plaintiff’s AEIC and c ourt testimony made it c lear that although MS was indeed undec ided about the surgery on 9 Marc h 2007, they had dec ided together on the surgery by the end of that day and she notified Dr Tong of it. The following exc erpt is from the portion of the plaintiff’s AEIC (at paragraph 24) desc ribing the events of 9 Marc h 2007: 

 After meeting Dr MC Tong, I returned to the ward where Steve was resting. At the ward, I informed Steve about my disc ussion with Dr MC Tong. I told him what Dr MC Tong told me. After a disc ussion with Steve, we decided that it was in Steve’s best interest to undergo surgery as 


 Q. No, bec ause you left Dr Tong's offic e on the 9th. Our understanding before lunc h was that when you left it was on the assumption that you would go bac k to disc uss it with Steve and then c ome to a dec ision. 

 A. Yeah, we made a dec ision. I called Dr Tong's office and informed his staff that we would proceed with the surgery [sc heduled for 12 Marc h 2007] on the 9th. 

 [emphasis added] 

 Q. But the fac t is you were told that whilst doing the angiogram he had c onsidered and felt it was inappropriate to do a PCI. 

 A. He just plainly told me, "I c ouldn't do a PCI." [note: 64] 

 planned on the 12 March 2007. I then contacted Dr MC Tong’s clinic about our decision. We plac ed our full trust in him. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

On c ross-examination, the plaintiff stated: 

192    I find that MS did notify Dr Tong of his dec ision to proc eed with the surgery on 9 Marc h 2007. On 10 Marc h 2007, Dr Tong rec orded MS as “[f ]eeling better today.” I am satisfied that MS was also aware of the improvement in his health. Taking the evidenc e of Dr Tong and the plaintiff into ac c ount, I find that MS also understood that the improvement in his health was what prec ipitated Dr Tong’s offer to postpone the redo-CABG. 

**_Sub-issue 2f: Whether Dr Tong informed MS of alternative treatment options of OMT and PCI_** 

193    Although the plaintiff did not really pursue her c laim that MS was not adequately advised of alternative treatments in her written submissions, I state for the rec ord my finding that alternative treatments were adequately advised. The need for information to be given on the alternative treatments is to allow the patient to be apprised of the relative risks and benefits of the available treatments to allow him to make an informed c hoic e as to whic h treatment to undergo. 

194    The three options typic ally available to patients who have suffered an AMI are OMT, PCI and CABG. 

195    Dr Christopher Chew had told the plaintiff that he c ould not do a PCI for MS. This was borne out by the plaintiff’s testimony on c ross-examination: 

Therefore, it is c lear that the plaintiff was told by MS’s interventional c ardiologist that PCI was not a viable option. Having ac c epted Dr Christopher Chew’s medic al view and c onfirming it with his own assessment of MS, Dr Tong was under no obligation to provide further advic e on the PCI option. In other words, Dr Tong responsibly c onc urred with Dr Christopher Chew that PCI was not a viable alternative treatment. As stated earlier, a doc tor is only under an obligation to provide advic e on appropriate treatment options. Henc e, his duty to provide advic e on PCI was not engaged. 

196    As for OMT, the plaintiff stated that she was advised on this by Dr Christopher Chew: 


 Q. At what stage did Dr Chew inform you that he would seek the advic e of a c ardiothorac ic surgeon? 

 A. When we were ac tually in the HDU, I ac tually c ame out of the HDU to meet -bec ause -I think other than family no-one is allowed really in the high dependenc y unit, apart from the medic al personnel, and Steve's c olleague Brent Fish had arrived when he was informed that this had happened, so I c ame out of the HDU to meet him, and while we were talking outside of the HDU, bec ause he c ouldn't go in, Dr Chew c ame out of the door and that's when we were standing kind of like in the c orridor, you know, so to speak, and at that point in time we asked him, you know, "What are the next steps?" I'm using this very loosely, of course. He said, "There are two options. One is for conservative medical therapy and the other one is to refer a surgeon." At whic h time he also told me -well, he told us when a surgeon is introduc ed, a surgeon would usually like to operate, bec ause that's how it is. Okay? So that's what he said to us, and he said, "Those are the two options." He said, “With conservative medical therapy, obviously some of the possible consequences could be some more heart attacks, myocardial infarct, and at the same time it could be also fatal." ... 

 [emphasis added] [note: 65] 

197    Further, in Dr Tong’s Clinic al Summary, whic h was rec orded c ontemporaneously with the relevant events, he noted that the “options of to c ontinue c onservative medic al for ves RedoCABG soon if angina pec toris persisted explained to patient’s wife and patient himself” [ _sic_ ]. On the evidenc e, I am satisfied that MS was adequately advised on the alternative of OMT. 

**_Causation_** 

198    Even if, c ontrary to my view, Dr Tong was in breac h of his duty to advise, the plaintiff’s c laim still fails bec ause there was no c ausation. The Court of Appeal c ase of _Yeo Peng Hock Henry v Pai Lily_ <span class="citation">[2001] 4 SLR 571</span> (“ _Yeo Peng Hock_ ”) establishes that to suc c eed in a medic al negligenc e c laim, the plaintiff has to prove, on a balanc e of probabilities, that the alleged negligent ac t had _caused or materially contributed to the injury_. The c ourt held in _Yeo Peng Hock_ : 

 52 Thus, we find that the medic al evidenc e was far from c onvinc ing or c onc lusive on the point whether, had Ms Pai gone to the SGH or SNEC on the evening of 23 Dec ember 1996, her left eye would have been saved. The burden of proof rests squarely on Ms Pai, and in our judgment, on the basis of the evidenc e given by Prof Cartwright and Dr Ang, Ms Pai had not disc harged the burden of proving, on a balanc e of probabilities, that had Dr Yeo advised her to go to the SGH or SNEC immediately on the afternoon of 23 Dec ember 1996 and had she gone there that afternoon, her left eye would have been saved. She had therefore not proven that Dr Yeo's negligenc e and/or breac h of duty c aused or materially c ontributed to the loss of her vision in the left eye. On this ground, her c laim c annot suc c eed. 

199    I noted the plaintiff’s submission that in _Chester v Afshar_ [2005] 1 AC 134, the House of Lords held (at [24]) that justic e required “a narrow and modest departure from traditional c ausation princ iples” to vindic ate the c laimant’s right of c hoic e and to provide a remedy for the breac h. However, that is not the law in Singapore. 

200    In the present c ase, the plaintiff is required to prove, on a balanc e of probabilities, that MS would not have opted for the redoCABG if he had been provided the relevant information, namely, a 


 Q. Did Dr Sc heinin or Dr Kumar advise you that without this proc edure there was a risk of a repeat inc ident of isc haemia and possibly a heart attac k or AMI? A. Yes. 

 Q. And that one of the risks of a rec urrent AMI c ould be death; did you understand that? 

 A. Let me say that perhaps they look at things more on the brighter side instead of the negative aspects of it. Because when you are recommending somebody something that's obviously going -which is to make them right, you wouldn't dwell on what are all the negative consequences. I would say that the position that the doc tors -Dr Sc heinin took was, "This is my rec ommendation. I highly rec ommend that you do this surgery and that you do this surgery immediately, otherwise, you know, there c ould be c onsequenc es", whic h would obviously, you know, put you in a worse light, yes. 

 [emphasis added] [note: 66] 

higher spec ific perc entage risk, a c omprehensive list of morbidities and an explanation that the two proximities would c ontribute substantially to the risks of the redo-CABG. 

201    It was unc ontroversial that MS had led an ac tive lifestyle prior to suffering his first MACE. The plaintiff submitted that MS would not have opted for the redoCABG if he had known the high risk of morbidities whic h the surgery entailed. She noted that if the morbidities eventuated, MS would find it more diffic ult to live the ac tive lifestyle that he wished to. However, I find that that argument c uts both ways. MS was already leading a sedentary and rigorously medic ated life before his AMI on 9 Marc h 2007. After the AMI on 9 Marc h 2007, I do not think he c ould have hoped for an ac tive lifestyle without undergoing a suc c essful redo-CABG. 

202    I find that the plaintiff has not disc harged her burden and thus her c laim on the basis of inadequate advic e fails on the ground of c ausation as well. 

**_Decision: Dr Tong did not breach his tortious and contractual duties of care in advising MS regarding the redo-CABG_** 

203    Having worked through the foregoing sub-issues and making the findings that I have made, I ac c ordingly find that Dr Tong did not breac h the tortious and c ontrac tual duties of c are he owed to MS in advising MS regarding the redoCABG. Admittedly, Dr Tong c ould have been more elaborate in his advic e. However, on the evidenc e of his medic al peers and in my analysis, he met the standard of c are required of him. 

204    Following _Gunapathy_ , the question of the adequac y of medic al advic e is still largely within the sc ope of medic al judgment (as long as it is not illogic al); and I pause here to note that the plaintiff’s testimony has suggested that she might not find it diffic ult to ac c ept that in a doc tor’s responsible medic al judgment, he might c hoose not to fully elaborate on all the potential negative c onsequenc es: 

**Issue 3: Whether the technical aspects of the redo-CABG carried out on 12 March 2007 had been properly performed** 

205    In her SOC, the plaintiff highlighted several sub-issues regarding the spec ific steps Dr Tong took in the performanc e of the redo-CABG: 


 (i) 

 (ii) 

 (iii) 

 (iv) 

 (v) 

 Q. Can you refer us to any material, either in terms of textbooks or literature, whic h show that retrograde c ardioplegia is the only way in whic h one would ac hieve protec tion for myoc ardial func tions? 

 Dr Tong failed to use retrograde c ardioplegia to protec t the func tionality of MS’s heart; 

 The redoCABG was c arried out for a very prolonged period and with c ardiopulmonary bypass time of 333 minutes; 

 Dr Tong ought not to have harvested the RIMA as this added to the length of the surgic al proc edure and inc reased the c omplexity of the proc edure unnec essarily; 

 Dr Tong ought not to have grafted the RIMA to the diagonal LAD system as this would not have done muc h in terms of c oronary revasc ularisation and exposed MS to greater risk of infec tion from sternum wound infec tion; and 

 Dr Tong ought not to have used the c lotting agent, Ac tivated Fac tor VII. 

206    The plaintiff argued that, for the above listed reasons, Dr Tong’s c onduc t of the redoCABG was negligent. I will deal with eac h sub-issue in turn briefly bec ause, as noted earlier, the plaintiff did not substantially pursue this third head of c laim c onc erning the negligent c onduc t of the surgery during the trial or in her written submissions. Further, c ounsel for Dr Tong noted that Dr Blauth, one t h e plaintiff’s experts, made no c ritic ism of Dr Tong’s c onduc t of the surgery and it was only Dr Sharma, the plaintiff’s other expert witness, who had some c ritic isms. 

**_Sub-issue 3a: whether Dr Tong ought to have used retrograde cardioplegia to protect MS’s heart_** 

207    The plaintiff argued that retrograde c ardioplegia should have been used in preferenc e to antegrade c ardioplegia as this would have better protec ted MS’s heart during the redo-CABG. 

208    During the trial, c ounsel for the defendant tendered a doc ument produc ed by the Americ an College of Cardiology Foundation (“ACC”) and the Americ an Heart Assoc iation (“AHA”), the “ACC/AHA 2004 Guideline Update for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery”, whic h states at 4.1.2.1: 

 The wide latitude of tec hniques assoc iated with exc ellent results for the majority of patients undergoing CABG is testimony to the fac t that there is no 'ideal' or universally applicable myocardial protection technique. 

 [emphasis added] 

209    Even though Dr Sharma c ritic ised the use of antegrade c ardioplegia, he did not state that retrograde c ardioplegia was _the only_ reasonable method of protec ting a patient’s heart: 


 A. It's not all or none. They're all additive and there are multiple tec hniques that c an be employed to dec rease the likelihood of poor myoc ardial protec tion. There are many artic les on retrograde c ardioplegia. I have a textbook written by my mentor that c overs that, and I c an send you c opies, if you would like. 

 Q. Does that say that retrograde cardioplegia is the only acceptable way to achieve protection for the heart function? 

 A. As I've repeated, there was no all or none phenomena. There are inc remental benefits to employing these tec hniques. 

210    Therefore, even though Dr Sharma held the view that retrograde c ardioplegia would have been a better form of treatment, he did not go so far as to say that the c hoic e of antegrade c ardioplegia was illogic al. On a c onsideration of the evidenc e, and in partic ular the views of the ACC and AHA, I find that the dec ision to use antegrade c ardioplegia was not negligent. 

**_Sub-issue 3b: whether the length of time of the redo-CABG and the length of the cardiopulmonary bypass time indicated that the surgery was negligently carried out_** 

211    MS’s redoCABG started at 9.00am and ended at 6.55pm on 12 Marc h 2007, _ie_ , the surgery lasted c lose to ten hours. During the surgery, MS was plac ed on the c ardiopulmonary bypass for 333 minutes and the c ross c lamp time was 140 minutes. 

212    It is unc ontroversial that one of the fac tors whic h might c ause sternal wound infec tion is the length of time spent on the c ardiopulmonary bypass mac hine. However, as ac knowledged by Dr Sharma, MS did _not_ suffer any sternal wound infec tion. 

213    Dr Sharma also c onc eded that the c ross-c lamp time of 140 minutes was not unusual. However, he opined that 333 minutes was a long time. I note here that Dr Christopher Chew, one of Dr Tong’s fac tual witnesses, stated during c ross-examination that “I guess the total bypass time of over 300 minutes is really quite a signific ant fac tor in the length of this operation”. Even so, Dr Sharma ac c epted that he c ould not point to any spec ific ac tion of Dr Tong during the redoCABG whic h had led to the prolongation of time but stated that he was unable to do so as there was no dic tated note. In the light of this c onc ession, I find that the plaintiff has not satisfied the burden of proof of showing that the length of time _in itself_ was indic ative of negligent performanc e of the redo-CABG. 

**_Sub-issue 3c and 3d: whether Dr Tong ought not to have harvested the RIMA and whether Dr Tong ought not to have grafted the RIMA onto the diagonal LAD system_** 

214    I will deal with these sub-issues together. Under c ross-examination, Dr Sharma ac c epted that the risk assoc iated with using the RIMA, _ie_ , the risk of sternal wound infec tion, did not materialise in this c ase. Therefore, while the harvesting and grafting of the RIMA might be c ontested, it is c lear that nothing turned on the proc edure. 

**_Sub-issue 3e: whether Dr Tong ought not to have used Activated Factor VII_** 

215    It was undisputed that MS suffered substantial bleeding perioperatively. It was also undisputed that in an attempt to ac hieve haemostasis, platelets and fresh frozen plasma were administered but the Medic al Team found that these were not suffic ient to satisfac torily manage the bleeding. Counsel for the defendant thus urged that the use of Ac tivated Fac tor VII was reasonable, as the bleeding had to be managed. Dr Sharma’s responses to questions under c ross-examination is instruc tive in this 


 Q. So some other form of measure had to be taken to arrest the bleeding; right? 

 A. Yes. 

 Q. It would not have been reasonable to simply leave it alone; c orrec t? A. Correc t. 

 ... 

 Q: So let me put it to you again that the use of Ac tivated Fac tor VII in this c ontext was entirely reasonable. Do you agree? 

 A. Not being in the theatre, my preferenc e is not to use this in non -in c oronary surgery patients. I think it c auses graft thrombosis. 

 Q. But you have not offered any alternative to this c ase; c orrec t? 

 A. No. 

regard: 

216    While Dr Sharma was adamant that the use of Ac tivated Fac tor VII was not reasonable, he did not offer any alternative way to stop the bleeding. I take it that there was none. As it is undisputed that the bleeding needed to be managed and as there was no suggested alternative that c ould be used to ac hieve haemostasis other than Ac tivated Fac tor VII, I find it extremely diffic ult to say that the use of Ac tivated Fac tor VII was illogic al. Therefore, I find that the Dr Tong did not breac h his duty of c are in using Ac tivated Fac tor VII. 

**_Decision: Dr Tong did not breach his tortious and contractual duties of care in the performance of the redo-CABG_** 

217    Having disc ussed the foregoing sub-issues and making the findings that I have made, I ac c ordingly find that Dr Tong did not breac h the tortious and c ontrac tual duties of c are he owed to MS in his performanc e of the redoCABG. It remains for me to add that even the plaintiff’s experts ac c epted that there was no evidenc e of any spec ific instanc es of wrongdoing in the redoCABG. Ac c ordingly, I find that Dr Tong met the standard of c are required of him. 

**Costs** 

218    Until Dr Tong gave evidenc e during the trial, he had taken the position that he had c ommunic ated the 3% risk figure of the redoCABG to the plaintiff. Ac c ordingly, muc h time was spent at trial asc ertaining with the aid of the experts whether the 3% risk figure was a reasonable figure to have been c ommunic ated. 

219    Dr Tong’s c hange of position also led to the plaintiff arguing that she was prejudic ed by the same. Notwithstanding that the plaintiff’s arguments failed, they were nec essitated by Dr Tong’s c hange of position. Therefore, while the plaintiff’s c laim fails, I am of the view that Dr Tong ought to be awarded only 85% of the c osts of the ac tion. 

220    The plaintiff’s ac tion is ac c ordingly dismissed and she is to pay Dr Tong 85% of the c osts of defending the ac tion.
