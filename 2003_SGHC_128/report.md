_The facts_ 

1       On 15 January 2001, the plaintiff, a Chinese national, was injured in the c ourse of the defendant’s employment by a power c utter. The ac c ident resulted in two fingers of his left hand being amputated with a c ut tendon on a third finger. Interloc utory judgment was entered on 2 Oc tober 2001 in default of the defendant’s appearanc e. 

2       On 28 February 2003 the defendant took out an applic ation to set aside the interloc utory judgment. One of the grounds relied on by the defendant was that the plaintiff had allegedly made a false statement in his applic ation for an employment pass to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). On 4 Marc h 2003, I dismissed the defendant’s applic ation. The defendant’s appeal (RA 80 of 2003) against my dec ision was dismissed by Choo Han Tec k J. The c ase proc eeded to full assessment. The plaintiff was the only witness for the assessment. Parties agreed to use the respec tive medic al reports without the need for c ross-examination and no offic er from MOM was c alled. 

_Special Damages_ 

3       The plaintiff c laims transport expenses at $100. The defendant c ontended that no transport rec eipts were produc ed, but I note that the plaintiff’s appointment c ard showed that he did attend on 10 oc c asions at the Singapore General Hospital for treatment. As suc h, I allowed him $80 for transport expenses. 

4       The plaintiff also c laimed 2000 RMB ($418.15 ) for therapy he had paid for in Da Lian, China. Although no rec eipts were produc ed to bac k this up, it should be noted that Dr Thiagarajan did state in his medic al report that the plaintiff would have been required to go for oc c upational therapy three sessions a week for the next four to six months at approximately $80 per session. I was thus prepared to allow the plaintiff to c laim $418.15. 

_Pre-trial loss of earnings_ 

5       The plaintiff is only c laiming for loss of earnings for the period after 19 July 2001 as his wages had already been paid up to that date. He was repatriated from Singapore to China on 26 July 2001. The reason for the plaintiff’s repatriation was stated by MOM in a letter dated 20 Dec ember 2002 as follows:

## [1] 


 a nd a s pa rt a dminis tra tive a ctio n w e ha ve re vo ke d [the pla intiff’s ] Emplo yme nt P a s s o n 26 July 2001. 

6       Sec tion 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Ac t (Cap 133) provides: 

 Any pe rs o n w ho by ma king a fa ls e s ta te me nt o bta ins o r a tte mpts to o bta in a n e ntry o r re -e ntry pe rmit, pa s s o r ce rtifica te fo r hims e lf o r fo r a ny o the r pe rs o n; s ha ll be guilty o f a n o ffe nce ... 

7       In a further letter of 14 February 2003, MOM c larified that the investigation on the plaintiff was in respec t to doc uments submitted by the plaintiff in his Employment Pass applic ation pertaining to his educ ational qualific ations. 

8       The defendant now submits that he is not c ontrac tually bound to pay the plaintiff as the plaintiff had breac hed his employment c ontrac t with him by virtue of the fac t of his Employment Pass being revoked by MOM. This was one of the grounds unsuc c essfully relied on by the defendant before myself and before Choo J in trying to set aside the interloc utory judgment. In his Grounds of Dec ision in RA 80 of 2003 Choo J stated at paragraph 7: 

 In re s pe ct o f the a lle ge d fa ls ifica tio n o f do cume nts re la ting to the pla intiff’s qua lifica tio ns , it mus t be bo rne in mind tha t tha t a lle ga tio n ha d no t be e n pro ve d. It le a ds to the ne xt que s tio n, na me ly, w he the r the pla intiff’s mis re pre s e nta tio n w a s re le va nt a t the tria l o f the to rt a ctio n? I do no t think s o. It is fa r to o re mo te fro m the po int o f ca us a tio n in to rt to s a y tha t if the pla intiff ha d no t re pre s e nte d his qua lifica tio ns , he w o uld no t ha ve e mplo ye d a nd the re fo re he w o uld no t be w he re he w a s o n 15 Ja nua ry 2001, a nd the a ccide nt w o uld no t ha ve o ccurre d, a nd the de fe nda nt w o uld no t be s ue d. 

9       In other words, the plaintiff’s repatriation to China was not oc c asioned by the ac c ident but by an administrative ac t of MOM. This also means that the plaintiff c an c laim Singapore pay only up to the time of his repatriation to China. In the c irc umstanc es, the plaintiff’s pre-trial loss of earnings will be his Singapore pay (at $66.67 per day) from 20 July 2001 to 25 July 2001 and thereafter it will be what he c ould have earned in China. His loss of pre-trial earnings for the Singapore segment would therefore be 6 x $66.67 = $400 (rounded off). 

10     The plaintiff’s evidenc e was that he earned 1200 RMB as a senior tec hnic ian and then 2000 RMB per month as mec hanic al engineer in China before he c ame to Singapore in 1997. His evidenc e that a senior tec hnic ian in China c an presently c ommand 5000 RMB was not substantiated by any doc umentary evidenc e. However, I was prepared to ac c ept that given the experienc e he had gained working in Singapore, he would be able to c ommand a higher salary than the 2000 RMB he was earning in China before he c ame in 1997. I would therefore use a multiplic and of 3000 RMB per month. 

11     The plaintiff submitted that he has to date not been able to sec ure a job and wanted the full loss of earnings for the pre-trial period. Defendant’s c ounsel submitted that he had a duty to mitigate by seeking alternative employment and should not be allowed the full amount. 

12     The plaintiff was given medic al leave until 31 July 2001. Dr Thiagarajan stated in his medic al report dated 13 July 2001 that the plaintiff would require three sessions of oc c upational therapy for the next four to six months thereafter. The medic al evidenc e was that the plaintiff would no longer be able to c arry on in his present job whic h required the use of both his hands. This would be a major c hange in job sc ope as the plaintiff had always used both hands in his work. I was thus prepared to give him a rec overy and adjustment period of up till 25 July 2002. I thus divided the pre-trial loss of earning into two periods. The first period is from 20 July 2001 to 25 July 2002 for whic h the plaintiff shall be entitled to fully rec over loss of earnings. The sec ond period of 26 July 2002 to 4 Marc h 2003 would be to allow the plaintiff to rec over his pre-trial loss of earnings after taking into ac c ount the 


defendant’s submission on his duty to mitigate by seeking alternative employment. 

13     His pre-trial loss from 20 July 2001 to 25 July 2001 (Singapore) has been c alc ulated above at $400. For his pre-trial loss of earning from 26 July 2001 to 25 July 2002 (China), the plaintiff would be entitled to 12 x 3000 RMB ($627.22) = $7526. 

 20 July 2001 to 25 July 2001 (Singapore) $ 400. 

 26 July 2001 to 25 July 2002 (China) $7526. 

 Total $7926. 

14     The plaintiff c ontended that his c ase offic er at MOM had informed him that he c ould return to work in Singapore after two years. However no MOM offic er was c alled to substantiate this c omment. Also, the plaintiff’s self-serving assertion that he c ould get a job in the United Kingdom to earn 20,000 pounds a year was unsubstantiated by any evidenc e at all. I therefore c ontinued to assess the loss of earnings based on what he would earn in China. 

15     The plaintiff said that he had attempted unsuc c essfully to find jobs relating to mec hanic al work, food and beverage industry and repairs of mac hinery and took the position that he would be permanently unable to find a job. It was the plaintiff’s evidenc e that he has a Degree in Ec onomic s Management whic h made him the equivalent of an Assoc iate Professor in China with only 400 to 500 people in China qualifying for this degree eac h year. Further, the plaintiff had tendered an impressive list of testimonials and c itations inc luding being the “Leading Star” of the “One Hundred Leading Stars” c ontest organised by the Da Lian City Federation of Trade Unions. He had also passed the National University Examination for Quality Management. With all these impec c able c redentials, I agreed with the defendant’s c ontention that the plaintiff had a duty to mitigate. The plaintiff should be able to find some managerial or instruc tional jobs (perhaps at a lower pay than a full healthy person) whic h did not require the use of both his hands it should be noted that the plaintiff is right handed whilst the injuries were sustained to his left hand. After deduc ting an amount for alternative employment, I use a multiplic and of 1500 RMB per month or $10.45 per day. 

16     For the sec ond period from 26 July 2002 to 4 Marc h 2003 (222 days) the plaintiff would be entitled to $10.45 x 222 = $2,319.90. 

17     In the c irc umstanc es, I assessed his pre-trial loss of earnings as follows: 

1       st Period (20 July 2001 to 25 July 2002) $ 7,926. 

2       nd Period (26 July 2002 to 4 Marc h 2003) $ 2,319. 

Total $ 10,246. 

_General Damages_ 

_Pain & Suffering and Loss of Amenity_ 


18     The plaintiff suffered amputational injuries to the left middle and ring fingers and a c ut tendon to the left index finger. There were multiple healed sc ars over these three fingers but not beyond the fingers. In _Ong Moh Chong v Hitachi Chemical (S) Pte Ltd_ [1987] 1 MLJ 450 an amount of $30, was awarded for pain and suffering for the amputation of three fingers. As the present c ase involved the amputation of two fingers and a c ut tendon of the left index finger, I award the plaintiff $20,000. In doing so, I also took into ac c ount Dr Thiagarajan’s report whic h stated that the inc idenc e of developing osteoarthritis is moderately high. 

19     On sc arring, the plaintiff’s c ited prec edents all involved extensive sc arring whilst in the present c ase sc arring was c onfined to the fingers. I award an amount of $1,500 for sc arring. 

20     The total award for pain and suffering and loss of amenity is $20,000 + $1,500 = $21,500. 

_Future loss of earnings_ 

21     The plaintiff was born on 18 July 1958. That would make him 44 years old at the time of the assessment. In _Wee Sia Tian v Kong Thik Boon_ <span class="citation">[1996] 3 SLR 513</span> the plaintiff was a c arpenter aged 48 at the time of the hearing. Prakash J affirmed the assistant registrar’s using a multiplier of eight. In the c irc umstanc es, I will apply a multiplier of nine in the present c ase. 

22     I have used a multiplic and of 1500 RMB for the period of 26 July 2002 to 4 Marc h 2003 for pre-trial loss of earnings after taking into ac c ount the plaintiff’s duty to mitigate by seeking alternative employment. For loss of future earnings, I use the same multiplic and of 1500 RMB per month. 

23     As suc h the loss of future earnings would be 9 x 12 x 1500 RMB ($313.61) = $33, (rounded off). 

_Future medical expenses_ 

24     Dr Thiagarajan opined that the plaintiff may require tenolysis (release of sc ar tissue) and the total c ost of this surgery is estimated by Dr Thiagarajan at $8000 to $10,000. This is the c ost of having the operation in Singapore. The plaintiff’s c ounsel c onc eded that sinc e he was c laiming for future surgery he would not be c laiming for the future c ost of oc c upational therapy. 

25     The plaintiff testified that there are equivalent medic al fac ilities in Da Lian, China but no figure was given as to how muc h suc h surgery would c ost. In _Xu Jin Long v Nian Chuan Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2001] 4 SLR 214</span> where no figures for the equivalent c ost of medic al treatment in China were available, Choo JC (as he then was) applied a 50% disc ount. I would thus award an amount of $ to c ater for the c ost of this future surgery after disc ounting for the probability that it might not be required. 

_Conclusion_ 

26     The total amount awarded to the plaintiff is as follows: 

_Special Damages_ 

Transport 80. 

Therapy 418. 


Pre-trial loss of earnings 10,246. 

Total 10,744. 

_General Damages_ 

Pain Suffering and Loss of Amenity 21, 

Loss of Future Earnings 33, 

Future Medic al expenses 4, 

Total 

Grand Total (10,744.70 + 59,370) 70,114. 

27     I award interest at 3% pa on the $10,744.70 awarded for spec ial damages from the date of the ac c ident to the date of today’s judgment. I award interest at 6% pa on the $21,500 awarded for pain and suffering and loss of amenity from the date of servic e of the writ to the date of today’s judgment. No interest is awarded for the loss of future earnings or future medic al expenses. 

28     I shall now hear the parties on c osts. 

 Parties agreed at an exc hange rate of 4.783 RMB to SGD$ C opyright © Government of Singapore.
