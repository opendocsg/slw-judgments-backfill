(c ollec tively, “the Opponent Marks”) 

4       For c onvenienc e, the registered trade marks will be referred to as the “Red Bird Mark” and the “Angry Birds Word Mark”. 

5       The Opponent also uses a stylised version of the Angry Birds Word Mark (“Fanc y Word Mark”). 

The Fanc y Word Mark is exhibited at [10] of the Opponent’s “Amended Grounds of Opposition” [note: 2]. While the Fanc y Word Mark is not a registered trade mark in Singapore, the Opponent has 

asserted that it enjoys c opyright in the Fanc y Word Mark. [note: 3] The Fanc y Word Mark and the Red 

Bird Mark were registered for c opyright in the USA and China. [note: 4] I reproduc e the Fanc y Word Mark below: 

6       Aside from being used in respec t of the _Angry Birds_ game, the Opponent Marks (as well as the Fanc y Word Mark) appear to have been used in Singapore on a wide variety of merc handise, inc luding toys, c akes, snac ks and fast food. The merc handise is not manufac tured and sold by the Opponent itself. It is sold by the Opponent’s lic ensees. In fac t, the Opponent’s business model is at least in part reliant on lic ensing the Opponent Marks to a wide range of businesses for their use on merc handise. That said, the date on whic h the use of the Opponent Marks on merc handise c ommenc ed in Singapore and the sc ale of suc h use are somewhat unc lear from the evidenc e before me. 

7       There is some evidenc e that the _Angry Birds_ c onc ept has been marketed in Singapore. For example, it was promoted in assoc iation with Singapore’s 2011 and 2012 Formula 1 Night Rac e, and the Singapore Cable Car from June 2012. It has also been advertised at the Singapore Changi airport 

in November 2012, and at the Takashimaya Department Store in 2011. [note: 5] 

**The Applicant’s Trade Mark** 

8       The Applic ant is a snac k food manufac turer. It is a c ompany inc orporated in Malaysia. It has sold its snac ks under the brands “Jimbo” and “D-Jac k” in Malaysia and abroad. 

9       The Applic ant applied to register the following mark in Trade Mark Applic ation No. T1204840G on 5 April 2012:

 Date of applic ation: 5 April 2012 

(Referred to as the “Angry Bite Mark”) 

**The Decision below** 

10     Before the PAR, the Opponent objec ted to the registration of the Angry Bite Mark on the grounds of ss 8(2)(b), 8(4) and 8(7) of the Trade Marks Ac t (Cap. 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (“TMA”). 

11     Five main grounds of opposition were relied on: 

 (a) Pursuant to s 8(2)(b) of the TMA: The Angry Bite Mark is similar to the Opponent Marks in respec t of identic al or similar goods, and there exists a likelihood of c onfusion. 

 (b) Pursuant to s 8(4)(a) read with s 8(4)(b)(i) of the TMA: The Angry Bite Mark (or an essential part of it) is similar to the Opponent’s earlier well known trade marks and indic ates a c onnec tion in the c ourse of trade with the likelihood of c ausing damage to the interests of the Opponent. 

 (c ) Pursuant to s 8(4)(a) read with s 8(4)(b)(ii) of the TMA: The Angry Bite Mark (or an essential part of it) is similar to the Opponent’s earlier well known trade marks, the use of whic h will c ause dilution or take unfair advantage of the earlier well known trade marks. 

 (d) Pursuant to s 8(7)(a) of the TMA: The Applic ant’s use of the Angry Bite Mark c onstitutes passing off. 

 (e) Pursuant to s 8(7)(b): The Angry Bite Mark infringes the c opyright in the Opponent’s Red Bird Mark as well as the c opyright in the Fanc y Word Mark. 

12     The evidenc e for the Opponent c omprised two statutory dec larations by Mr Harri Koponen and Ms Kati Levoranta. Evidenc e for the Applic ant c onsisted of a statutory dec laration of Mdm Huang Len Len. No expert or survey evidenc e was provided. 

13     Having c onsidered the evidenc e and submissions presented by both parties, the PAR dismissed the Opponent’s opposition, and awarded c osts to the Applic ant (see [2014] SGIPOS 10 (“the PAR’s GD”)). In summary, the PAR held that: 

 (a) In relation to s 8(2)(b) of the TMA, the marks are more dissimilar than similar in totality, and there is no likelihood of c onfusion. 


 (b) In relation to s 8(4) of the TMA, the Opponent Marks are “well known in Singapore” under s 8(4)(a), but are not “well known to the public at large” under s 8(4)(b)(ii) of the TMA. Regardless, the Opponent Marks and the Angry Bite Mark are not identic al or similar. Further, the Applic ant’s use of the Angry Bite Mark would not indic ate a c onnec tion between its goods and the Opponent. 

 (c ) In relation to s 8(7)(a) of the TMA, under the law of passing off, there is insuffic ient evidenc e to demonstrate goodwill in the Opponent Marks, and there is no misrepresentation. 

 (d) In relation to s 8(7)(b) of the TMA, there is no c opyright infringement bec ause there is no proof that the Opponent Marks are original c reations, and there is no proof of c opying. 

**The present appeal** 

14     The matter is now before me on an appeal filed by the Opponent against the PAR’s dec ision. In the present appeal, the Opponent has dropped its objec tion on the ground of s 8(4)(b)(ii) read with s 8(4)(a) of the TMA whic h c onc erns earlier trade marks whic h are “well known to the public at large in 

Singapore”. [note: 6] 

15     It pursues the appeal on the ground that the PAR erred in relation to s 8(2)(b), s 8(4)(b)(i) read with s 8(4)(a), s 8(7)(a) and s 8(7)(b) of the TMA. 

**Legal issues** 

16     The issues that arise for my c onsideration in this appeal c an be neatly struc tured around the statutory grounds upon whic h the Opponent relies to objec t to the registration of the Angry Bite Mark. 

17     The first broad issue is whether the Opponent’s objec tion on the ground of s 8(2)(b) of the TMA c an suc c eed. Spec ific ally, the following points were c anvassed: 

 (a) For the purposes of the similarity c omparison in s 8(2)(b) of the TMA, c an this c ourt c onsider the separately registered Opponent Marks as a c omposite mark, or is the c ourt limited to c onsidering the Angry Bite Mark separately against the Red Bird Mark and the Angry Bird Word Mark respec tively? 

 (b) In light of the c onc lusion in (a), are the Angry Bite Mark and the Opponent Marks similar? 

 (c ) If the Applic ant is allowed to register and use the Angry Bite Mark, is there a likelihood of c onfusion on the part of the public? 

I note in passing that in its submissions, the Applic ant did not put in question whether the similarity of 

goods requirement is satisfied. [note: 7] Thus, this is not a live issue before me. 

18     The sec ond broad issue relates to the Opponent’s objec tion on the ground of s 8(4)(b)(i) read with s 8(4)(a) of the TMA. The following points arise for c onsideration: 

 (a) Is the “whole or an essential part” of the Angry Bite Mark identic al or similar to either of the Opponent Marks? 

 (b) Are the Opponent Marks “well known in Singapore”? 


 (c ) Would the use of the Angry Bite Mark indic ate a c onnec tion between the goods of the Applic ant and the Opponent? 

 (d) If so, is the c onnec tion likely to damage the interests of the Opponent? 

19     The third broad issue relates to s 8(7)(a) of the TMA, namely whether the Defendant’s use of the Angry Bite Mark is liable to be prevented under the tort of passing off. The following sub-issues arise for c onsideration: 

 (a) Do the Opponent Marks generate goodwill? 

 (b) Will the Applic ant’s use of the Angry Bite Mark amount to a misrepresentation leading to a likelihood of c onfusion and damage? 

20     The fourth broad issue is whether the use of the Angry Bite Mark is liable to be prevented for c opyright infringement under s 8(7)(b) of the TMA. Spec ific ally, it is nec essary to c onsider, 

 (a) Whether the Opponent has subsisting c opyright in the Opponent Marks or any other relevant works; and 

 (b) Whether the Applic ant c opied a substantial part of any of the Opponent’s c opyright works in c reating the Angry Bite Mark. 

**Issue 1: s 8(2)(b) of the TMA** 

21     Sec tion 8(2)(b) of the TMA provides as follows: 

 A trade mark shall not be registered if bec ause — 

 ( a ) it is identic al with an earlier trade mark and is to be registered for goods or servic es similar to those for whic h the earlier trade mark is protec ted; or 

 ( b ) it is similar to an earlier trade mark and is to be registered for goods or servic es identic al with or similar to those for whic h the earlier trade mark is protec ted, 

 there exists a likelihood of c onfusion on the part of the public. 

22     In c onsidering if s 8(2)(b) of the TMA is made out on the fac ts, the Court of Appeal in _Staywell Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc and another and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2014] 1 SLR 911</span> (“ _Staywell_ ”) at [15] has affirmed the step-by-step approac h. This entails assessing the three requirements of similarity of marks, similarity of goods or servic es, and likelihood of c onfusion arising from the two similarities, systematic ally. The first two elements are assessed individually before the final element whic h is assessed in the round (see [15] of _Staywell_ ). 

**_Similarity of marks_** 

23     There is no dispute that the Opponent’s marks are earlier trade marks under the TMA. An important preliminary issue, however, needs to be addressed before embarking on a c omparison of the marks. This c onc erns whether the Red Bird Mark and the Angry Bird Word Mark c an be treated as a c omposite registered trade mark for the purposes of c omparison with the Angry Bite mark. 

_Preliminary issue: Can the Opponent Marks be considered as a composite mark in the similarity_ 


_Preliminary issue: Can the Opponent Marks be considered as a composite mark in the similarity comparison?_ 

24     Before the PAR, the Opponent submitted that in engaging in the similarity c omparison, the c ourt may c ombine the Opponent Marks, even though they are individually registered as separate trade marks. This means that the c ourt c an c onsider if the Angry Bite Mark is similar to a c omposite mark made up of _both_ the Red Bird Mark and the Angry Bird Word Mark. 

25     I start by making a preliminary observation that the Opponent Marks were not registered as a series of trade marks under s 17 of the TMA. Indeed, it seems improbable that the Red Bird Mark and Angry Bird Word Mark would qualify as “a series of trade marks”, whic h is defined in s 17(2) of the TMA as “a number of trade marks whic h resemble eac h other as to their material partic ulars and whic h differ only as to matters of a non-distinc tive c harac ter not substantially affec ting the identity of the trade mark”. The signific anc e of this shall be disc ussed below. 

26     The PAR c onsidered the issue, and found that the Opponent Marks should be treated separately. She reasoned that it is the mark _as registered_ that is treated as a property right, and protec ted under the TMA. The Opponent c ould gain protec tion over a c omposite mark c onsisting of two of its earlier trade marks _only if_ it had separately registered the c omposite mark as well. 

27     On appeal, the Opponent submits that the c ase law c ited by the PAR does not support her position that the c ourt may not c onsider the Opponent Marks as a c omposite. The submission was that from a polic y perspec tive, requiring trade mark proprietors to register their marks in various permutations in order to be afforded what is perhaps best desc ribed as “holistic protec tion” under the TMA was untenable. 

28     That said, the Opponent submits that the c omposite mark c ould have been suc c essfully registered as a trade mark. Given that the individual parts (the Red Bird Mark and the Angry Bird Word Mark) of the c omposite mark were suc c essfully registered as trade marks (thereby appearing to satisfy the requirements of distinc tiveness _etc._ and see sec tion 101(1)(c ) TMA), it followed that the c omposite mark would also have been registrable. Ac c ordingly, sinc e the Opponent does in fac t use the Opponent Marks as a c omposite on its produc ts, the c ourt should c onsider it as a c omposite mark in c onduc ting the similarity c omparison. 

29     The Applic ant seeks to affirm the PAR’s reasoning, and disputes both the Opponent’s interpretation of the relevant c ases as well as its polic y reasoning. 

The relevant c ase law 

30     The first c ase relied on by the PAR and the Applic ant is _Staywell_. The PAR relied on the Court of Appeal’s statement that “assessment of marks similarity is mark-for-mark without c onsideration of any external matter” ( _Staywell_ at [15] and [20]) in c onc luding that the c omparison must be “[a] mark-for[a]-mark” ([50] of the PAR’s GD). 

31     In my view, the Court of Appeal’s statement must be read in c ontext of the issues raised by the parties and the fac ts of _Staywell_. I agree with the Opponent that the Court of Appeal, in making that c omment at [20], did not _specifically direct its mind_ to whether two separately registered marks may be c onsidered as a c omposite at the similarity of marks stage. The Court of Appeal was merely making the point that “external matter”, suc h as fac tors that affec t the relative importanc e of different types of similarities, is irrelevant at the similarity of marks stage. 

32     However, another part of the _Staywell_ judgment, not raised by the parties, is perhaps more 


direc tly on point. 

33     When the _Staywell_ c ase was before the High Court, the Judge found that the “ST REGIS” trade mark c onveys the idea of royalty. The learned judge held that this idea of royalty was reinforc ed by the devic e (the _fleur-de-lis_ devic e) used by the “ST REGIS” brand of hotels in its advertisements 

(see _Staywell Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc and another_ <span class="citation">[2013] 1 SLR 489</span> (“ _Staywell (HC)_ ”) at [28]). The point is that the _fleur-de-lis_ devic e, whilst it does not appear (from the report of the dec ision) to have been registered as a trade mark, was used by the St Regis hotel c hain in its advertisements (see _Staywell (HC)_ at [6]. 

34     However, the Court of Appeal in _Staywell_ (at [36]) held that 

 ... [T]he Judge erred in treating the Opponent’s devic e as a reinforc ement of the c onc ept of royalty. The devic e was not part of the Opponent Mark, and the authorities are c lear that markssimilarity must be assessed without regard to “external added matter or c irc umstanc es... 

35     Whilst the Court of Appeal in _Staywell_ was not addressing the c ase of two related but separately registered trade marks belonging to the same proprietor, the holding lends support to the Applic ant’s position that a c ourt may not c onsider a proprietor’s other registered marks in the similarity of marks c omparison. Other registered marks are in this sense also c onsidered “external added matter or c irc umstanc es”. Instead, eac h opponent mark must be c ompared individually against the applic ant mark; what is required is a mark for mark c omparison. As the learned author of NgLoy Wee Loon, _Law of Intellectual Property in Singapore_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2014) (“ _Ng-Loy Wee Loon_ ”) opines at para 21.5.18(b), even if the earlier trade mark is always used by its proprietor with a tag line, it is inappropriate to make the c omparison between ‘the earlier trade mark plus tag line’ and the later mark. 

36     Of c ourse, the Opponent is entitled to argue that [36] of _Staywell_ does not c onc lusively dec ide the preliminary issue before this c ourt. This would be bec ause the Court of Appeal was not explic itly c onsidering the possibility of a c omposite c onsisting of and the “ST REGIS” trade mark being _the_ 

_mark in question_. Instead, it was undisputed that the c ourt was to c ompare the “ST REGIS” trade mark against the applic ant mark. In that sense, the _fleur-de-lis_ devic e was naturally “external matter”. However, if the Opponent is c orrec t that the mark that is to be the subjec t of c omparison c an c onsist of a c omposite of two earlier registered trade marks, then neither of the two earlier registered trade marks would be “external matter”. Instead, they would be part of the mark whic h is the subjec t of c omparison. 

37     While this argument may be c ritic ised for its relianc e on overly fine tec hnic al distinc tions, there is nevertheless some merit to the view that the Court of Appeal did not direc tly c onsider the permissibility of c ombining two earlier registered trade marks into one c omposite mark for the purposes of the c omparison. 

38     The sec ond c ase to c onsider is _Infamous Nut Co Ltd’s Trade Marks_ [2003] RPC 7 (“ _Infamous Nut_ ”). This was a dec ision of the Appointed Person, Professor Ruth Annand, of the UK Trade Mark Registry. 

39     In that c ase, the applic ant was attempting to register four devic e marks, eac h c omprising a monkey eating a monkey nut. The opponent had a series of registered trade marks c onsisting of monkeys holding a nut. The opponent argued that one fac tor to c onsider is that it has a “series” or “family” of “monkey holding a nut” marks. In addressing the sole question before the c ourt, whic h is whether there was a likelihood of c onfusion under s 5(2)(b) of the UK’s Trade Mark Ac t (whic h is 


almost in _pari materia_ to Singapore’s s 8(2)(b) of the TMA), the c ourt held at [36] that “where the opponent relies on proprietorship of more than one earlier trade mark, the registrability of the applic ant’s mark must be c onsidered against eac h of the opponent’s earlier trade marks separately”. 

40     _Prima facie_ , this c ase lends support to the PAR’s and the Applic ant’s position. However, the Opponent submits that _Infamous Nut_ is inapplic able bec ause that c ase c onc erned a c ommon theme over a “family of marks”, rather than an attempt to c ombine two separately registered marks. 

41     While the Opponent is c orrec t in arguing that unlike the present c ase, _Infamous Nut_ was c onc erned with the thematic similarity ac ross a “family of marks”, it seems to me that the c ourt’s approac h is _generally_ of guidanc e in situations “where the opponent relies on proprietorship of more than one earlier trade mark” ( _Infamous Nut_ at [36]). 

42     The key finding of the Court in _Infamous Nut_ is that “the registrability of the applic ant’s mark must be c onsidered against eac h of the opponent’s earlier trade marks separately” ( _Infamous Nut_ at [36]). This was based (at least in part) on the c ourt’s interpretation of s 5(2)(b) of the UK’s Trade Marks Ac t 1994 (“UK TMA 1994”), whic h c ontemplates refusal of registration on the basis of _an earlier trade mark_ as defined in the same statute. Nothing in this reasoning suggests that the c ourt’s findings are or ought to be limited to its spec ific fac ts or trade marks registered as a series. Rather, it is of general guidanc e when c onsidering situations where an Opponent relies on more than one earlier registered trade mark in opposing the registration of a new mark. 

43     Indeed, I repeat my earlier observation that trade marks are only registered as a series when they resemble eac h other as to their material partic ulars and differ only as to matters of a nondist inc t ive c harac ter whic h do not substantially affec t the identity of the trade mark. The UK’s statutory provision on when marks may be registered as a series is found at s 41 of the UK TMA 1994, whic h is similar to s 17 of the TMA. If it is impermissible to take into ac c ount other registered trade marks within a series for the purpose of c omparison with the applic ant’s mark, the same must follow (and even more so) where the earlier registered trade marks are not registered as a series. 

44     The Opponent also c ited _McDonald’s Corp v Future Enterprises Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2005] 1 SLR(R) 177</span> (“ _McDonalds_ ”) and _The Polo/Lauren Co. LP v Shop in Department Store Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2006] 2 SLR(R) 690</span> (“ _Polo_ ”) in support of its position that the c ourt should take into ac c ount the way the earlier trade marks are used in the similarity of marks c omparison. 

45     In _McDonalds_ , Mc Donald’s Corporation (“Mc Donalds”) opposed the applic ant’s registration of three trade marks, eac h of whic h c ontained a stylised Americ an eagle with the words “Mac Noodles”, “Mac Tea” and “Mac Choc olate”. Mc Donalds had its own registered trade marks – “BIG MAC”, “MAC FRIES”, “SUPERMAC”, EGG Mc Muffin”, “Mc Chic ken”, “Mc Nuggets” and “Mc Donald’s”. Given the applic ant’s applic ation for registration was made in 1995, the Court of Appeal had to c onsider s 15 of the previous Trade Marks Ac t (Cap 332, 1992 Rev Ed) (“Old TMA”), whic h states: 

 It shall not be lawful to register as a trade mark or part of a trade mark any matter the use of whic h would, by reason of its being likely to deceive or cause confusion or otherwise, be disentitled to protec tion in a c ourt of justic e, or would be c ontrary to law or morality, or any sc andalous design. 

 [emphasis added] 

46     In mounting the attac k on the applic ant marks, Mc Donalds stressed that the applic ant had c opied the “distinc tive prefix of the appellant’s family of marks”, namely, “Mc ” (see _McDonalds_ at [7]). 


In brief, the argument was that Mc Donalds had established a reputation and goodwill in the prefix “Mc ”, and that the prefix had bec ome an essential feature in the Mc Donalds’ family of marks. On this basis, it was c laimed that by adopting the prefix “Mac ”, the applic ant may c onfuse the public by giving the impression that their produc ts c ome from Mc Donalds. Mc Donalds’ opposition failed and its appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. 

47     In the present c ase, the Opponent relies on the Court of Appeal’s _dicta_ in _McDonalds_ at [26]. [note: 8] In c onsidering the similarity between the marks in question under s 15 of the Old TMA, the 

Court of Appeal took into ac c ount the fac t that Mc Donalds’ logo (the golden arc hes) was often used with Mc Donalds’ registered trade marks _even though_ the logo does not form a part of the registered trade marks. Presumably, this is argued as lending support to the c laim that in assessing similarity, one must c onsider how the Opponent’s registered trade marks _are actually used_. Spec ific ally, it is relevant to c onsider if the Opponent Marks are used in c onjunc tion with anything else (or with eac h other). 

48     While the Court of Appeal in _McDonalds_ did take into ac c ount how the earlier trade marks were used under s 15 of the Old TMA, this lends little support to the Opponent’s position in the present c ase. As the Applic ant points out, the _dicta_ in Mc Donalds at [26] was made in the c ontext of a _different statutory provision_. Importantly, the c ourt was assessing the likelihood that the applic ant’s marks would “dec eive or c ause c onfusion”. What s 15 required was an examination of whether the _use_ of the applic ant’s trade mark or a part of the trade mark was likely to dec eive or c ause c onfusion or otherwise be disentitled to protec tion in a c ourt of justic e. The emphasis was on the use of the applic ant’s mark and the likelihood of dec eption or c onfusion. By c ontrast, what is in issue under s 8(2)(b) of the present TMA is _the similarity of marks comparison_. This involves a mark-for-mark c omparison, whic h prec ludes c onsideration of external matters suc h as the ac tual or potential use of the trade marks ( _Staywell_ at [20]). What is in dispute is whether the “mark” under the c urrent TMA c an c onsist of two previously registered trade marks c ombined into one c omposite mark. The _McDonalds_ c ase does not speak to this question. It merely stands for the proposition that in assessing the _likelihood of deception or confusion_ , ac tual use may be relevant. 

49     The final c ase to c onsider is _Polo_. The appellant was the registered proprietor of six trade marks: “POLO”, “POLO BY RALPH LAUREN”, “RALPH LAUREN & Polo Player devic e”, “POLO RALPH LAUREN & polo player devic e”, “LAUREN RALPH LAUREN” and “RALPH LAUREN”. Whilst there were six registered marks, only the “POLO” word mark was in issue. 

50     In brief, the appellant c laimed that the respondent’s use of the “POLO PACIFIC” mark in a partic ular font, typefac e and design infringed its “POLO” trade mark under s 27(2)(b) of the Old TMA (whic h is in _pari materia_ with s 27(2)(b) of the c urrent TMA). In partic ular, the appellant submitted that the judge below was wrong to hold, _inter alia_ , that the mark “POLO” was not distinc tive ( _Polo_ at [12(a)]). 

51     At this junc ture, I pause to note that in _Polo_ , the appellant made an “argument based on a family of trade marks with the prefix POLO” (see _Polo_ at [17]). With respec t, it is not entirely c lear to me what the appellant’s argument entailed. The appellant’s argument might have been that sinc e the word “POLO” was the c ommon denominator of some of its registered trade marks, it had ac quired distinc tiveness and a reputation in the minds of the public. On this basis, it appears that what was being c laimed is that the “POLO” word mark should be regarded as similar to “POLO PACIFIC” despite the differenc es between the two marks. 

52     In its judgment, the Court of Appeal applied the three-step approac h and affirmed the High Court’s finding that the sign “POLO PACIFIC” was not similar to “POLO”. The Court of Appeal also 


found that there was no likelihood of c onfusion. What is of interest at this junc ture is the c ourt’s dec ision in relation to similarity of marks. 

53     In assessing similarity of marks, the Opponent rightly noted that the Court of Appeal did c onsider how the “POLO” mark was _used_ on the appellant’s produc ts. In partic ular, the c ourt found it relevant that the appellant never _used_ the word “POLO” _simpliciter_ on its produc ts ( _Polo_ at [23]). However, it is vital to note that the above observations of the Court of Appeal were made as part of the c ourt’s assessment of the _distinctiveness_ of the “POLO” word mark (see _Polo_ at [17] and [23]). What the Court of Appeal held, in effec t, was that the “family of trade marks” argument was a nonstarter. On the fac ts, there was no evidenc e that the appellant had done anything to promote the “POLO” mark on its own. There was no evidenc e of distinc tiveness ac quired through use. Therefore, the c ourt held that the argument based on family of trade marks c arried little weight ( _Polo_ at [17]). 

54     In c oming to its dec ision, the Court of Appeal referred to the dec ision of the Appointed Person (Geoffrey Hobbs QC) in _10 Royal Berkshire Polo Club Trade Mark_ [2001] RPC 32 (“ _Royal Berkshire_ ”). In t hat c ase, the c ourt found that the mark “POLO” was not similar to “10 Royal Berkshire POLO CLUB” even though the evidenc e before the Appointed Person established that the average c onsumer would expec t “POLO” brand toiletries to c ome direc tly or indirec tly from the same undertaking ( _Royal Berkshire_ at [27]). The Appointed Person held that the marks were not similar bec ause he did not think that people exposed to the use of the applic ant’s mark would notic e that it c ontained the word “POLO” without also notic ing that it c ontained the words “ROYAL BERKSHIRE” and “CLUB”. The message of the applic ant’s mark was in the c ombination ( _Royal Berkshire_ at [31]). 

55     Ac c ordingly, I am of the view that the Court of Appeal was not establishing a proposition that the c ourt ought to take into ac c ount _how a mark is used_ in c onduc ting a _similarity of marks comparison_. The dec ision does not support the Opponent’s position that its earlier marks c an be c ombined and c onsidered as a c omposite. I thus find that this c ase is of no assistanc e to the Opponent. 

56     For c ompleteness, I note that the Applic ant also c ited _Time Inc. v Li San Zhong_ [2014] SGIPOS 

14\. However, given that the c onc lusions of the princ ipal assistant registrar in that c ase were based largely on the PAR’s dec ision in our present c ase, I agree with the Opponent that little weight should be plac ed on it in the c urrent appeal. 

57     To sum up, based on what has been argued before me, there is no direc t loc al authority on the issue of whether two earlier registered trade marks may be c ombined into a c omposite whole for the purposes of the similarity of marks c omparison (even if _Staywell_ may be argued to suggest that it should be disallowed). On the other hand, the English approac h, based on the _Infamous Nut_ , seems to be that any suc h c ombination is likely to be disallowed. 

My dec ision 

58     In the absenc e of legally binding judic ial authority, it is apposite to start from the words of s 8(2)(b) of the TMA, and c onsider them in light of the objec tives of trade mark law. 

59     Sec tion 8(2)(b) of the TMA states: 

 A trade mark shall not be registered if bec ause it is similar to an earlier trade mark and is to be registered for goods or servic es identic al with or similar to those for whic h the earlier trade mark is protec ted, there exists a likelihood of c onfusion on the part of the public. 


 [emphasis added] 

60     The key interpretive question for the Court is whether “an earlier trade mark” c an inc lude a c omposite of two previously registered trade marks. Sec tion 2 of the TMA defines an “earlier trade mark” as, _inter alia_ 

 [A] registered trade mark or an international trade mark (Singapore), the applic ation for registration of whic h was made earlier than the trade mark in question, taking ac c ount (where appropriate) of the priorities c laimed in respec t of the trade marks... 

The other parts of the definition of an “earlier trade mark” are irrelevant for our present purposes. 

61     In her judgment (at [49]), the PAR alluded to the argument that given the c onsistent use of the singular ( _eg_ “an earlier trade mark”, “a registered trade mark”), a plain reading of the statutory provisions above suggests that an “earlier trade mark” must refer to a _single_ trade mark. This militates against the Opponent’s position that in c onsidering the similarity of marks, the Court may c onsider the applic ant mark against a c omposite of two or more separately registered trade marks. Against this argument, the Opponent submits that the use of the singular and/or plural in statutes should not be taken literally unless there is evidenc e that Parliament spec ific ally intended the singular and/or plural. [note: 9] 

62     However, leaving aside for the moment well known unregistered marks, even assuming the Opponent is c orrec t, under s 2 of the TMA, an “earlier trade mark” must still be “a _registered_ trade mark” [emphasis added]. It is undisputed that the _composite_ of the Opponent Marks is not “a registered trade mark”. The fac t that it may have been _registrable_ is neither here nor there. This thus brings into serious question the possibility of adopting the Opponent’s approac h to the similarity of marks c omparison ( _ie_ treating an “earlier trade mark” as being a c omposite of two separately registered trade marks) without doing violenc e to the statutory wording. 

63     Of c ourse, while the words of a statute are, and should be, the c ornerstone of statutory interpretation, c ourts have on oc c asion departed from the literal meaning of statutory language in light of the purposes behind the statute. Suc h purposive interpretation is mandated under s 9A of the Interpretation Ac t (Cap. 1, Rev Ed 1985). 

64     Is any suc h departure in favour of the Opponent justified in this c ase? The Opponent’s main submission on this front is that it is untenable to require trade mark proprietors to register every permutation of their registered trade marks. It is submitted that it is not unc ommon for trade mark proprietors to use their registered trade marks in a variety of c ombinations. If the law did not protec t c omposites of two or more separately registered trade marks belonging to the same proprietor, this would severely reduc e protec tion for registered trade marks. This, it was argued, would be c ontrary to what was intended under the statutory regime. Moreover, allowing the registration of the Angry Bite Mark potentially gives the Applic ant legal grounds to objec t to the Opponent registering the Opponent Marks as a c omposite should it wish to in future. This, it was said, would be unfair. 

65     The Applic ant submits that there is nothing untenable about requiring trade mark proprietors to register all the permutations of their existing marks that they wish to use. In fac t, they assert that 

this is c urrently done by some trade mark proprietors. [note: 10] Moreover, allowing proprietors to mix a n d matc h different registered marks to form a c omposite, _d e facto_ registered mark provides exc essive (indeed unwarranted) protec tion. 

66     Having c onsidered the submissions, I am of the view that the statutory purpose behind trade 


mark protec tion does not c ompel a departure from the plain words of the statute. On the c ontrary, it point s against allowing the c ourt to c ombine the Opponent Marks for the similarity of marks c omparison. 

67     The argument that it is imprac tic al or untenable to expec t trade mark proprietors to register eac h c ombination of the marks they intend to use has not been substantiated. Indeed, whilst there w a s little evidenc e on this before the c ourt, it appears that businesses frequently register various permutations of their registered marks. In some c ases, the registrations will be pursuant to separate and distinc t applic ations. In other c ases, a series of trade marks may be registered pursuant to a single applic ation. It is true that over the c ourse of time, a business may well evolve its trade marks and its use of its trade marks suc h that the registered marks may no longer suffic iently protec t the trade marks that are used in prac tise. However, it does not follow that it would be unduly onerous or “unfair” to require a trade mark proprietor to register the evolved mark. On the c ontrary, the reverse is true. Certainty as to what is the mark protec ted by registration is important. 

68     Sec tion 36 of the TMA provides that a registered trade mark is personal property. Property rights are enforc eable _in rem_. Registration c onfers rights both to objec t to the registration of other marks, and to sue other persons for trade mark infringement. As with _in rem_ rights generally, liability for infringement is stric t. In some c ases, c riminal provisions may also c ome into play. A key objec tive of the trade mark registration system and the trade mark register must be to give what is best desc ribed as fair warning to other business and the public generally. Members of the public whose duty it is not to infringe registered trade marks are entitled to know with objec tive c ertainty whic h trade marks (and what they c omprise) are protec ted by registration. 

69     Allowing a trade mark proprietor to c laim protec tion over _all_ the permutations of its registered marks would be granting exc essive protec tion of a wholly unc ertain sc ope. It limits c ompetition from other businesses, opens them up to unpredic table risks of infringement, and potentially inc reases trade mark litigation generally. Even granting protec tion over a c omposite of just two separately registered marks whic h are used together in prac tise (as proposed by the Opponent in the present c ase) would c reate c onsiderable unc ertainty. By granting protec tion, what is meant is to treat the two separately registered trade marks as a single c omposite trade mark for the purpose of determining infringement under the Trade Marks Ac t. There is no reason why the trader should not be expec ted to register the c omposite mark either at the time when he applies to register the first two marks, or subsequently when his use of the registered trade marks and branding strategies makes registered protec tion of the c omposite mark desirable. 

70     Given the above analysis, I affirm the dec ision of the PAR. Under s 8(2)(b) of the TMA, two earlier separately registered trade marks c annot be c ombined so as to form a single c omposite mark. This is also c onsistent with the substantive finding in _Staywell_ that a c ourt may not c onsider extraneous matter in c omparing an earlier registered trade mark against the applic ant mark. 

71     Quite belatedly, at the hearing of the appeal itself, the Opponent attempted to argue that in any c ase, a c omposite mark c onsisting of the Opponent Marks has ac quired the status of an _unregistered trade mark_. The Opponent submits that the unregistered trade mark is an “earlier trade mark” for the purposes of s 8(2)(b) of the TMA, given that it falls under the definition in s 2 of the TMA. While s 2 of the TMA undoubtedly leaves open the possibility that an unregistered trade mark may be an “earlier trade mark” if it is a well–known trade mark, I am of the view that the Opponent has not adduc ed suffic ient evidenc e to show that a c omposite of the Opponent Marks has ac quired the status of an unregistered trade mark. This point was not argued before the PAR (see [7] of the PAR’s GD), nor was it properly argued by the Opponent in his written or oral submissions for the appeal. Indeed, all that was produc ed was a few photographs where the Opponent Marks were used 


together. This is c learly insuffic ient to prove that suc h an unregistered trade mark exists. 

72     For these reasons, I affirm the PAR’s dec ision on the preliminary issue, and shall proc eed on the basis that the Angry Bite Mark is to be c ompared against the Red Bird Mark and the Angry Bird Word Mark _separately_. 

_Legal principles governing the similarity of marks comparison_ 

73     It is well-established that in c onsidering the similarity of two marks, the c ourt should look at visual, aural, and c onc eptual similarity. These three aspec ts of similarity are merely meant to guide the c ourt’s inquiry. Ultimately, the marks must be appraised as a whole: _Staywell_ at [17]–[18]. 

74     Signific antly, previous judic ial authorities have uniformly affirmed the importanc e of what has been termed “the tec hnic al distinc tiveness of a trade mark” in the similarity of marks c omparison. As the Court of Appeal stated in _Staywell_ at [25], “a mark whic h has greater tec hnic al distinc tiveness enjoys a high threshold before a c ompeting sign will be c onsidered dissimilar to it”. I pause to say a few words on the meaning of “distinc tiveness”. 

75     In _Staywell_ (at [24]), the Court of Appeal held that distinc tiveness in the “tec hnic al sense” was to be understood “in c ontradistinc tion to desc riptiveness”. As an example of what was meant by “tec hnic al distinc tiveness”, the Court of Appeal (at [28] of _Staywell_ ) gave the example of a trade mark whic h c omprised (in whole or part) a “non-desc riptive word” or an “elaborate and inventive graphic devic e.” On the basis of these examples, an invented word (espec ially one that has been freshly c oined and is meaningless) would also likely possess “tec hnic al distinc tiveness”. Whilst the expressions “tec hnic al distinc tiveness”, and indeed “inherent distinc tiveness”, have found their way into judgments, I observe that the TMA does not in fac t use the terms “tec hnic al” or “inherent”. Instead, what is stated in s 7(1)(b) of the TMA is that “trade marks whic h are devoid of any distinc tive c harac ter” are not registrable. This does not however prevent registration where the trade mark has “ac quired a distinc tive c harac ter as a result of the use made of it”: s 7(2) of the TMA. 

76     In my view, the essential point made by the Court of Appeal in _Staywell_ was that in c omparing the applic ant mark to the opponent’s mark, the c ourt is entitled to take into ac c ount the “dominant” c omponents or features of the opponent’s mark ( _Staywell_ at [23]). Where the opponent mark has a feature that is c learly dominant, the fac t that this feature is also found in the applic ant mark may lead to a finding of similarity even if some other features are different or absent. Whether there is a dominant feature as suc h is a matter of impression and degree. The observations made by the Court of Appeal in _Staywell_ at [23]–[29] go no further than the proposition that where a c omponent or feature of a mark is tec hnic ally distinc tive (invented, non-desc riptive _etc_ ), that feature may well (as a matter of fac t and impression) be regarded as a dominant feature of the mark and henc e affec t the overall assessment of similarity. That said, the Court of Appeal undersc ored the point that the distinc tiveness of the separate c omponents of a mark must ultimately be related bac k to the impression given by the mark as a whole ( _Staywell_ at [26]). 

77     Finally, it bears emphasis that the similarity of marks c omparison is “more a matter of feel than sc ienc e”: see _Wagamama Ltd v City Centre Restaurants plc_ [1995] FSR 713 at 732. Indeed, the c omparison of any two marks should take plac e at an impressionistic level, rather than on a quantitative or mec hanistic basis: _Staywell_ at [17]. 

_Role of the appellate court_ 

78     Before proc eeding further, it is important to c larify the role of an appellate c ourt hearing an 


appeal from the PAR. In _Future Enterprises Pte Ltd v McDonald’s Corp._ <span class="citation">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 845</span> (“ _Future Enterprises_ ”) at [5], the Court of Appeal quoted _SC Prodal 94 SRL v Spirits International NV_ [2003] EWHC 2756 (Ch), whic h states: 

 It is not the duty of this c ourt to overturn a dec ision of the Trade Mark Registry simply bec ause it c omes to the c onc lusion that it might have dec ided the c ase differently... It has to be demonstrated that the dec ision at first instanc e was wrong in a material way; that is to say there must be some signific ant departure from a proper assessment of the law or the fac ts. 

79     The Court in _Future Enterprises_ c ontinues at [7], stating: 

 ... In the light of the highly subjec tive nature of assessing similarity and the likelihood of c onfusion, we agree with the approac h that an appellate c ourt should not disturb the findings of fac t of a trade mark tribunal unless there is a material error of princ iple. 

80     Bearing in mind that the appellate c ourt’s role is not to dec ide the c ase (and in partic ular, the fac tual findings) _de novo_ , but to intervene _only_ if there has been a material error of fac t or law, I proc eed to c onsider the similarity of marks. 

_Comparison between the Red Bird Mark and the Angry Bite Mark_ 

81     On visual similarity, the Opponent submits that the Red Bird Mark and Angry Bite Mark are similar bec ause of the presenc e of the angry eyes, eye brows, and the bird like features in the latter (inc luding the rather small tail feathers and beak like tongue). It further submits that the angry eyes and eye brows are the dominant features of both the Red Bird Mark and Angry Bite Mark. 

82     The Applic ant repeats the PAR’s reasoning on visual similarity. The PAR found that the only possible similarity is the “angry eyes devic e”. To be c lear, by “angry eyes devic e”, what is being referred to are “the eyes and eyebrow” of the red bird. These are said to depic t anger, henc e the desc ription “angry eyes devic e”. The angry eyes are not a devic e separate from the Red Bird Mark. The applic ant submits that even if the angry eyes were the dominant c omponent of the two marks, the c ourt c annot foc us on that alone. The marks are to be c ompared as a whole. The Red Bird Mark c omprises angry eyes, ac c ented eyebrows, a sharp beak and a red bird. On this basis it is said that, the Angry Bite Mark shows a c reature biting angrily into something, the “ANGRY BITE” words, and the “D-Jac k” words at the c orner. These elements are absent from the Red Bird Mark, and c reate dissimilarity. 

83     The Angry Bite Mark is a c omposite mark. It c omprises a number of elements. Some of these have been desc ribed in the previous paragraph. The “c reature” is depic ted fac e-on with a mouth biting down on an objec t. The phrase “ANGRY BITE” appears in the middle of the fac e. The word “DJac k” in smaller lettering appears on a banner to the left, just above the c reature’s right eye. A small (indeed tiny) mark (said to represent feathers) also appears next to the letter “B”. 

84     On visual similarity, I affirm the PAR’s dec ision, and do not find any material error of fac t or law in her reasoning or c onc lusion. Indeed, while the angry eyes and eye brows may (on one view) be the dominant and distinc tive c omponents of both marks, the PAR has given due weight to this fac t. She was c orrec t in stating that notwithstanding the similarity between the alleged dominant c omponents of the marks, the marks still are to be assessed _as a whole_. I do not find that she erred in c oming to the fac tual c onc lusion that the Red Bird Mark and the Angry Bite Mark are visually dissimilar on the whole. Indeed, the ac tual depic tion of the eyes and eyebrows in the Red Bird Mark and the Angry Bite Mark whilst similar, are not identic al. 


85     On aural similarity, neither side disputes the PAR’s finding that there c an be no aural similarity here given the Red Bird Mark has no aural c omponent. I find no reason to disturb this finding. 

86     Finally, on c onc eptual similarity, the PAR found the Red Bird Mark and the Angry Bite Mark to be dissimilar. She noted that what is important is “the impression of the average c onsumer” (see [65] of the PAR’s GD). The Red Bird Mark c onveys a bird with angry eyes; the Angry Bite Mark c onveys an idea of a c reature biting angrily. Only the emotion of anger is c ommon. 

87     The Opponent submits that not only is the “anger emotion” c ommon, the Angry Bite Mark also has elements of a bird. It points to the feather at the bottom left c orner of the Angry Bite Mark, and the mouth of the c reature whic h is said to look like a beak. In fac t, the Opponent adduc ed evidenc e that the Malaysian trade marks registry desc ribed the c reature in the Angry Bite Mark as a “bird”. [note: 11] 

88     Having reviewed the PAR’s reasoning on c onc eptual similarity, I find no reason to overturn her finding. Notwithstanding the apparent position taken by the Malaysian trade marks registry, I do not find that the Angry Bite Mark c onveys the impression or idea of a bird. In partic ular, I do not see how the mouth of the c reature looks like a bird’s beak at all. Whilst the Opponent c laims that there is a feather devic e shown in the Angry Bite Mark (next to the letter “B” in “BITE”), I am unable to draw any c onc lusion as to what was being depic ted. The devic e is very small and in my assessment, makes little to no visual or c onc eptual impac t at all even though there is a similar devic e on the Red Bird Mark. 

89     In summary, having affirmed the PAR’s finding that there is no visual, aural or c onc eptual similarity between the Red Bird Mark and the Angry Bite Mark, I naturally also affirm her overall c onc lusion that the abovementioned marks are _dissimilar on the whole_. To be c lear, even ac c epting that both marks share “anger” as a c ommon emotion, I find that the marks on the whole are not similar. 

_Comparison between the Angry Birds Word Mark and the Angry Bite Mark_ 

90     The PAR found that while there is aural similarity between the Angry Birds Word Mark and the Angry Bite Mark, the two marks were visually and c onc eptually dissimilar. 

91     Visually, the PAR found that similarity c an only be found in the letters “ANGRY BI”. The other elements of the Angry Bite Mark c learly distinguish it from the Angry Birds Word Mark. The Opponent merely repeated the observation that the letters “ANGRY BI” are similar. It did not address the PAR’s observation that there are other elements to the Angry Bite Mark (namely, the c reature) that distinguishes it from the Angry Birds Word Mark. I agree with the PAR’s observation that the pic torial elements of the Angry Bite Mark c reate visual dissimilarity, and thus see no reason to disturb the PAR’s dec ision that the Angry Bite Mark and the Angry Birds Word Mark are visually dissimilar. 

92     In terms of aural similarity, the PAR found that there was some aural similarity. She reasoned that the c ompeting marks have more syllables in c ommon than not. The Opponent added that the two marks have the same number of syllables ( _ie_ three). The Applic ant however submits that the “I” in the word “BITE” sounds different from the “I” in the word “BIRDS”, c reating a degree of aural dissimilarity. In my view, the PAR’s finding that there is _some_ aural similarity is c onsistent with both the Applic ant’s and Opponent’s submissions. Indeed, we may all agree that while the “ANGRY” c omponent in both marks are aurally identic al, “BIRD” and “BITE” c ontain some aural dissimilarity. 

93     Finally, on c onc eptual similarity, the PAR found that the only similarity is the emotion of anger 


c onveyed. The c onc ept of a c reature angrily biting something is missing from the Angry Birds Word Mark. The Opponent however repeats its submissions that the c onc ept of anger is a signific ant similarity, and there are hints of a bird in the Angry Bite Mark. In this regard, I repeat my findings above on the ideas c onveyed by the Angry Bite Mark. I see no reason to disturb the PAR’s fac tual finding that the marks are c onc eptually dissimilar on the whole. 

94     Given that there is some aural similarity, I will set out in more detail why I agree with the PAR that the Angry Bird Word Mark and Angry Bite Mark are dissimilar _on the whole_ , bearing in mind the need for the c ourt to weigh up the relative importanc e of similarities/dissimilarities in order to dec ide whether the marks are similar _on the whole_. 

95     In this regard, following _Hai Tong Co Pte Ltd v Ventree Singapore Pte Ltd and another and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2013] 2 SLR 941</span> (“ _Hai Tong_ ”) at [40], the PAR (at [68] of the PAR’s GD) took into ac c ount the fac t that the average c onsumer is one who would exerc ise c are and a measure of good sense in her purc hases, rather than an unthinking person in a hurry. She found that the snac k produc ts were bought by c onsumers of all ages, not just the young. As suc h, she c onc luded that to the average c onsumer as desc ribed above, the marks would be more dissimilar than similar on the whole. The Opponent, however, c ontends that c hildren are the target, and indeed, the main, audienc e of the snac k food produc ts. 

96     At this junc ture, a question arises as to the relevanc e of the _nature of consumers purchasing the parties’ products_ at the similarity of marks stage. As the c ourt in _Staywell_ at [20] c larified, at the similarity of marks stage, we are c onc erned with a mark-for-mark c omparison, rather than the “effec t of objec tive similarity between the marks”. It may be argued that the ac tual type of c onsumers purc hasing the produc t is irrelevant to the assessment of the objec tive similarity between two marks. It is relevant only in assessing the _confusing effect_ of that similarity (where, for example, c hildren are presumably more likely to be c onfused than adults by a c ertain objec tive similarity). 

97     We should first c onsider the position taken by the Court of Appeal in _Hai Tong_. The Court of Appeal stated at [40(c )] that: 

 Although the foc us of this part of the inquiry is on the marks in question, it is necessary to set out the viewpoint the court should assume. This viewpoint is that of the average consumer who would exercise some care and a measure of good sense in making his or her purchases, not that of an unthinking person in a hurry (see Polo (CA) ([16] supra) at [34]). Would such a person consider the marks similar? We pause to note that despite the differing expressions that are sometimes used, this viewpoint is, for all intents and purposes, the same as that whic h is assumed when assessing the separate but related question of whether there is a suffic ient likelihood of c onfusion. This is unsurprising given that there will be some inevitable overlap in the fac tual assessment of both elements. 

 [emphasis added] 

9       8 _Prima facie_ , the PAR’s approac h seems to be supported by the passage in _Hai Tong_ c ited above, whic h suggests that similarity is to be assessed from the perspec tive of the “average c onsumer”. However, the question is whether the Court of Appeal in _Hai Tong_ meant the viewpoint of the average c onsumer who _actually purchases the parties’ products_ , or whether the “average c onsumer” at the similarity stage is a _notional “average consumer”_ , having no regard to the ac tual goods or servic es in question. The PAR seemed to have adopted the former interpretation in c onsidering whether c hildren were the main c onsumers of the Applic ant’s and the Opponent’s produc ts. 


99     In my view, the latter interpretation of the above passage in _Hai Tong_ is preferable. In _Hai Tong_ at [85(c )(iii)] and [87], the c ourt c lassified the “partic ular c harac teristic s of the relevant segment of the public ” (referring to the likely purc hasers of the parties’ produc ts) as an extraneous fac tor whic h c ould be taken into ac c ount when assessing “likelihood of c onfusion”, but not the similarity of marks. 

100    This is the position taken in _Staywell_ at [96(b)] also, where “the likely c harac teristic s of the relevant c onsumers and whether they would or would not tend to apply c are or have spec ialist knowledge in making the purc hase” was c onsidered an extraneous fac tor relevant at the “likelihood of c onfusion stage”. The c ourt in _Staywell_ held (at [20]) that the “issue of _resemblance_ between c ompeting marks is distinc t from the question of the _effect_ of suc h resemblanc e” [emphasis in original], and that it was impermissible to c onsider extraneous fac tors at the similarity of marks stage. This did not mean that the c ourt ignored the reality that the effec t of aspec ts of similarity might depend on c irc umstanc es suc h as the nature of the goods and the perc eption of c ustomers ( _Staywell_ at [20]). However, the Court of Appeal held that these c onsiderations were better reserved for the c onfusion stage of the inquiry, where the c ourt was asked to assess the _effect_ of the objec tive similarity between the marks. 

101    Applying _Staywell and Hai Tong_ , it follows that a c ourt in dec iding whether the applic ant’s mark is similar to the opponent’s mark (the first stage of the three step test) must make the assessment on an objec tive basis. The points of similarity and dissimilarity must be assessed in relation to the ma rks as a whole. This is a matter of impression for the judge. While the judge should put himself/herself into the position of a reasonable or notional average c onsumer (as opposed to an unthinking person in a hurry), the c ourt should not, following _Staywell and Hai Tong_ , delve into the detailed c harac teristic s and perc eptions of the ac tual c onsumers of the parties’ produc ts at the similarity of marks stage. Thus, I find that the PAR’s c onc lusion that the Angry Bite Mark and the Angry Birds Word Mark are dissimilar (on the whole) is fully supportable. 

102    To sum up, having c onsidered the visual, aural and c onc eptual similarities and dissimilarities between the marks, and having c onsidered the marks as a whole, I do not think that the PAR erred in finding that the Angry Bite Mark and Angry Birds Word Mark are dissimilar. While the Opponent did submit that the Court should plac e some weight on the fac t that the designer of the Angry Bite Mark was _inspired by_ the Opponent Marks, the argument does not c arry the Opponent any further. Trade mark law does not have as one of its goals the objec tive of stopping c ompetition _simply_ on the basis that the c ompetitor’s trade mark was _inspired_ by the trade mark proprietor’s trade mark, branding or marketing. In the present c ase, the Opponent must still prove that the relevant marks are _similar_. The fac t that the Angry Bite Mark was inspired by the Opponent Marks may give rise to a _heightened possibility_ of similarity, but in no way _establishes_ it. 

103    In c onc lusion, I affirm the PAR’s findings that the Angry Bite Mark is not similar to either the Angry Birds Word Mark, or the Red Bird Mark. While this is suffic ient to dispose of any opposition on the ground of s 8(2)(b) of the TMA, I shall nevertheless proc eed to c onsider the “likelihood of c onfusion” in c ase I am wrong on similarity of marks. 

**_Likelihood of confusion_** 

104    As disc ussed above, at the “likelihood of c onfusion stage”, the c ourt is broadly c onc erned with the “ _effect_ of objec tive similarity between the marks, on the perc eption of c onsumers” [emphasis in original]: _Staywell_ at [20]. In _Hai Tong_ at [74], the Court of Appeal stated that there are “at least two spec ific aspec ts to the element of c onfusion”. The first is “mistaking one mark for another”, and the sec ond is where “the relevant segment of the public may well perc eive that the c ontesting marks are different, but yet remain c onfused as to the origin whic h eac h mark signifies”. The c ourt in _Hai_ 


_Tong_ at [75] went on to distinguish “mere assoc iation” from a “likelihood of c onfusion”. Spec ific ally, “it is not suffic ient that the relevant segment of the public would rec ognise or rec ollec t similarities between the c ontesting marks if there is no likelihood of c onfusion as to origin ensuing”. 

105    In assessing the likelihood of c onfusion, the PAR (at [73]–[74] of the PAR’s GD) c onsidered it relevant that the Opponent Marks were used on produc ts together, but stated that “this only renders the marks somewhat more similar”. She found that the overall impression given by the Angry Bite Mark (that of a c reature angrily biting) is different from the overall impression given by the Opponent Marks. Further, the PAR weighed the following fac tors in c onc luding that there was no likelihood of c onfusion: 

 (a) The reputation of the ANGRY BIRD brand is likely to reduc e the likelihood of c onfusion. 

 (b) Given the snac ks are self-serve items on super market shelves, the visual and c onc eptual aspec ts figure more prominently than the aural aspec ts at the point of selec tion and sale (rec all that she found there was some degree of aural similarity, but no visual or c onc eptual similarity). 

 (c ) The purc hasing public is likely to exerc ise a greater degree of c are in selec ting the snac k produc ts given these are to be ingested. 

 (d) The low pric e of the snac k produc ts is outweighed by the other fac tors pointing against a likelihood of c onfusion. 

106    On appeal, the Opponent submits as follows: 

 (a) The likelihood of c onfusion is enhanc ed by the similarity in c olours used on the Applic ant’s pac kaging, as well as the depic tion of a c atapult at the bottom right c orner of the Applic ant’s pac kaging (given that a c atapult is a key feature of the Opponent’s Angry Bird mobile phone game). Pic tures of c risps pac kets in identic al shades of yellow, green, red etc were presented to the c ourt. 

 (b) The PAR erred in finding that the aural similarity is less signific ant than visual and c onc eptual similarities for self-serve items suc h as those sold in supermarkets. 

 (c ) The PAR erred in finding that the reputation of the Opponent’s brand detrac ts from the likelihood of c onfusion. Given the imperfec t rec ollec tion of c onsumers, the fac t that the Opponent’s brand is entrenc hed in the minds of its c onsumers furthers the likelihood of c onfusion. 

 (d) The PAR erred in finding that a degree of c are would be taken in c hoosing the snac k produc ts bec ause they are to be ingested. On the c ontrary, food safety does not weigh heavily on the minds of c onsumers in Singapore when buying snac ks in a supermarket. 

 (e) The snac k produc ts are likely to be purc hased by c hildren and adolesc ents, who are unlikely to apply c are or fastidiousness in the selec tion of snac ks. 

107    In response, the Applic ant repeats the PAR’s reasoning, and additionally submits the following: 

 (a) Following Staywell , extraneous fac tors like pac kaging or other “superfic ial marketing c hoic es” are irrelevant in opposition proc eedings, even at the “likelihood of c onfusion” stage. 

 (b) Consumers who purc hase goods from the supermarket are ordinary sensible members of the public who are not easily dec eived or hoodwinked. 


108    Based on the above, the following issues on the “likelihood of c onfusion” inquiry under s 8(2)(b) of the TMA arise for c onsideration: 

 (a) Can extraneous fac tors suc h as the c olour of the Applic ant’s pac kaging and the c atapult on the Applic ant’s c risp pac k be taken into ac c ount? 

 (b) Does the reputation of the Opponent’s brand enhanc e or detrac t from a likelihood of c onfusion? 

 (c ) What is the relevanc e of the fac t that the Applic ant’s and Opponent’s goods are ingestible self-serve items sold in supermarkets? 

 (d) Who are the likely c onsumers of the Applic ant’s and Opponent’s goods? 

_Can extraneous factors such as the colour of the Applicant’s packaging and the catapult on the Applicant’s crisp pack be taken into account?_ 

109    Extraneous fac tors may be taken into ac c ount in opposition proc eedings at the likelihood of c onfusion stage. However, this general position is subjec t to important qualific ations: _Staywell_ at [77] and [83]. The Court of Appeal laid down the following guidelines in _Staywell_ at [95]: 

 The permissible fac tors are those whic h (a) are intrinsic to the very nature of the goods and/or (b) whic h affec t the impac t that the similarity of marks and goods has on the c onsumer. The impermissible fac tors are those differenc es between the c ompeting marks and goods whic h are c reated by a trader’s differentiating steps. In other words, factors which are not inherent in the goods, but are susceptible to changes that can be made by a trader from time to time, should not be permissible considerations. In partic ular, we are satisfied t h a t it is unnecessary, unworkable and impermissible for the court to have regard to such issues as pricing differentials, packaging and other superficial marketing choices which could possibly be made by the trader. In c ontrast, extraneous fac tors that relate to the purc hasing prac tic es and degree of c are paid by the c onsumer when ac quiring goods of the sort in question, c an be c onsidered and assessed without desc ending into the details of partic ular differentiating steps whic h the trader might c hoose to take in relation to the goods and servic es falling within the spec ific ation. 

 [emphasis added] 

110    The Opponent rather ingeniously argues that the limits or qualific ations plac ed on extraneous fac tors apply _only_ when an applic ant seeks to _distinguish_ its goods on the basis of extraneous fac tors. It submits that _Staywell_ only refers to c ertain extraneous fac tors being impermissible for the purpose of _differentiating_ goods that are otherwise c onfusingly similar (for example, see _Staywell_ at [86], [89], and [90]). It does not prec lude an opponent using extraneous fac tors to show an _enhanced_ likelihood of c onfusion. The Opponent submits that this is in line with the princ iple that an existing proprietor has monopoly rights over its trade mark whic h deserves full protec tion. 

111    Reading _Staywell_ as a whole, I find it hard to agree with the Opponent’s position on extraneous fac tors. It is true that the Court of Appeal in _Staywell_ foc used on the impermissibility of extraneous fac tors being used to _negate_ a likelihood of c onfusion. However, this is readily explained by the fac t that the Court of Appeal was asked to c onsider that very question. 

112    A c loser look at _Staywell_ would reveal that the c ourt _did not_ intend to limit its remarks on 


extraneous fac tors to the _negating_ of a likelihood of c onfusion. 

113    At [86] of _Staywell_ , the Court of Appeal stated: 

 ... In the same way that c onfusion stemming from sourc es other than the similarity of marks and goods is outside the reac h of trade mark protec tion (see [64] above) so too must suc h fac tors be irrelevant to displac e a finding of likely c onfusion if the property rights represented in the trade mark are to be meaningfully upheld. 

114    Given that c onfusion must _stem from the similarity of marks and goods_ , rather than from extraneous fac tors, the Court of Appeal’s remarks on the “impermissible extraneous fac tors” c learly apply to both negating _and enhancing_ the likelihood of c onfusion. In fac t, based on the passage c ited above, the impermissibility of admitting c ertain extraneous fac tors to _negate_ the likelihood of c onfusion seems to be premised on the impermissibility of basing a finding of c onfusion on those very same fac tors. 

115    Indeed, even looking at the matter from the point of view of legal princ iples and polic y, this c onc lusion makes sense. Registered trade mark law gives proprietors proprietary rights over _trade marks only_ ; it does not give them rights over c ertain types of pac kaging, or marketing tec hniques. It follows that proprietors are protec ted _only to the extent_ that c onfusion (or the likelihood of c onfusion) arises from a use of a mark similar to the registered trade marks in respec t of similar or identic al goods or servic es. 

116    In this c ase, the Opponent does not have an exc lusive right to use the c oloured pac kaging for its c risps. Whilst the evidenc e on this was not explored in detail, I note that the same or similar c oloured pac kaging is in fac t used by many c risps manufac turers, not just the Applic ant and the Opponent. The Opponent does not have any registered trade mark over the c olour of the pac kaging. Also, sinc e the Opponent is not c laiming a trade mark over the c atapult, any c onfusion c aused by it (or likely to be c aused by it) must be irrelevant. 

117    I thus find that fac tors to do with the Applic ant’s pac kaging are superfic ial marketing c hoic es and henc e impermissible extraneous fac tors whic h may not be c onsidered by this c ourt in determining the likelihood of c onfusion arising from the alleged similarities between the marks. 

_Does the reputation of the Opponent’s brand enhance or detract from a likelihood of confusion?_ 

118    Under the registered trade mark system, new marks whic h have not been used previously (whether at all, or in respec t of a partic ular c ategory of goods and servic es) may be registered. While it is nec essary for the applic ant to have a bona fide intention to use the trade mark (s 5(2)(e)(ii) of the TMA), it is not nec essary to show prior use before applying to register a trade mark. It follows that a new trade mark may be properly registered even though it has not yet ac quired any reputation. The question that arises in the present c ase is whether the c ourt c an take into ac c ount the reputation generated by the use of the mark as a fac tor in determining whether there is a likelihood of c onfusion. Nothing in the question posed suggests that a registered trade mark must have a reputation in order for there to be a likelihood of c onfusion. The issue raised is really the reverse: where reputation in the opponent’s mark is established, is this relevant in determining the likelihood of c onfusion? 

119    The PAR was of the view that, on the fac ts, where a mark or brand bec omes so well known that it is entrenc hed in the minds of c onsumers, this c ould have the effec t of reduc ing the likelihood o f c onfusion. The PAR c ited [96(a)] of _Staywell_ in support of her c onc lusion. There, the Court of 


Appeal c ites _Polo_ at [34] for the proposition that the “reputation of the marks” is a fac tor that relates to the impac t of marks-similarity on c onsumer perc eption. At [34] of _Polo_ , the Court of Appeal states “the greater the exposure and use of a partic ular registered mark, the greater its reputation is likely to be, and therefore the greater the protec tion likely to be afforded to it”. None of these authorities seem to lend support to the PAR’s c onc lusion that where a mark is well known, that _reduces_ the likelihood of c onfusion. On the c ontrary, [34] of _Polo_ seems to suggest that where a mark is well known, it ought to be afforded more protec tion, and henc e, it should be _easier_ to find a likelihood of c onfusion. 

120    However, the Applic ant did c ite some authorities whic h more direc tly support the PAR’s position. At [64] of _McDonalds_ , the Court of Appeal stated “the very suc c ess of the appellant, whic h is inseparable from its logo, is also the very reason why c onfusion is unlikely”. 

121    Indeed, I note that there is some Australian authority to that effec t. In _Mars Australia Pty Ltd v Delfi Chocolate Manufacturing SA_ [2014] ATMO 113 ( _Mars Australia_ ) at [28], the c ourt stated that if the reputation in the “MALTESERS” trade marks were taken into c onsideration (c oupled with the rec ognition of the Australian c onsumer’s imperfec t rec ollec tion), this would tend to reduc e the likelihood of dec eption or c onfusion between it and the applic ant trade mark, “MALTITOS”. Also, the learned authors of Mark Davidson & Ian Horak, _Shanahan’s Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off_ (Lawbook Co, 5th Ed, 2012) at para 50.2410 state “[i]n some c ases the partic ularly well known nature of the opponent’s mark has in fac t told against its argument that c onfusion is likely”. 

122    That said, the relevant Australian statutory provisions are not the same as those in Singapore. The observation in _Mars Australia_ was made in respec t of s 44 of Australia’s Trade Marks Ac t 1995 (Cth) (“Australian TMA”), and opposition was based on the c laim that the applic ant’s trade mark was “dec eptively similar”. Whilst under the Australian TMA, a mark is dec eptively similar if it is likely to dec eive or c ause c onfusion, the differenc e in statutory language does in my view affec t the persuasive weight of _Mars Australia_ in Singapore. 

123    It is also worth mentioning that in _Mars Australia_ , whilst the objec tion under s 44 of the Australian TMA failed, the opposition under s 60 suc c eeded. Sec tion 60 of the Australian TMA reads as follows: 

 The registration of a trade mark in respec t of partic ular goods or servic es may be opposed on the ground that: 

 (a) another trade mark had, before the priority date for the registration of the first-mentioned trade mark in respec t of those goods or servic es, ac quired a reputation in Australia; and 

 (b) bec ause of the reputation of that other trade mark, the use of the first-mentioned trade mark would be likely to dec eive or c ause c onfusion. 

124    The c ourt in _Mars Australia_ held that opposition to registration suc c eeded under s 60 of the Australian TMA bec ause an assessment of the reputation of the trade mark went beyond mere examination of turnover of goods, and inc luded the “c redit, image and values projec ted” and the “esteem” c omponent of the reputation ( _Mars Australia_ at [40]). On this basis, the trade mark offic er f ound at [51] that dec eption or c onfusion would arise from the demonstrated reputation in the opponent’s trade mark, taking into ac c ount the extent of use and the way in whic h the reputation was established in Australia. Even though the trade mark offic er had earlier found that the applic ant and opponent’s marks were not dec eptively similar, there was some similarity ( _Mars Australia_ at [48]). In an opposition under s 60, what was in issue was whether the _use_ of the applic ant’s mark would 


c ause dec eption or c onfusion. On this basis, the finding at [50] was that the demonstrated reputation in the opponent’s mark would “reduc e rather than reinforc ed the effec t of the differenc es”. I note that the provisions in Singapore on well known earlier trade marks (c onsidered below) are not the same as the Australian provisions. 

125    Returning to s 8(2)(b), I do not find it nec essary to review the jurisprudenc e on this matter in any more detail than I already have (espec ially as _Mars Australia_ was not c ited in argument). In my view, it is plain that there c an be c ases where the reputation of an opponent mark reduc es the likelihood of c onfusion _as a matter of fact_. The more a mark is etc hed in the minds of c onsumers, and the more familiar c onsumers are with the details of a mark, the more disc erning they may be in some c ases, espec ially where on the fac ts, the c ustomers will likely be able to detec t differenc es at a glanc e. But of c ourse, it all depends on the fac ts. I do not think c ase law goes so far as to establish a rule of law that the greater the reputation of a mark, the less the likelihood of c onfusion. I do not think suc h a rigid rule is c onduc ive to guiding what is fundamentally a fac t spec ific inquiry either. Whether there is a likelihood of c onfusion is a question of _fact_ for the c ourt, taking into ac c ount, _inter alia_ , the reputation of the marks (as stated in _Staywell_ at [96(a)]). The exac t effec t the reputation of a mark has may differ on the spec ific fac ts of a c ase. As the learned author of _Ng–Loy Wee Loon_ states at para 21.5.29(c ), whilst the reputation of an earlier trade mark is relevant, it is not “the determinant fac tor”. The approac h is not “reputation-therefore-c onfusion” (or the reverse). 

126    In this c ase, I do not think that the PAR erred in her fac tual c onc lusion that “the Opponent’s reputation in the c urrent c ase is likely to have an effec t c ontrary to a likelihood of c onfusion”. In my view, the reputation and assoc iation between the “angry bird” c harac ter and the Opponent’s Angry Bird brand renders the absenc e of a c lear bird image in the Angry Bite Mark a fac tor that tends to reduc e the likelihood of c onfusion. 

_What is the relevance of the fact that the Applicant’s and Opponent’s goods are ingestible self-serve items sold in supermarkets?_ 

127    First, the PAR found that the _ingestible_ nature of the Applic ant’s and the Opponent’s snac k food produc ts made it more likely that c onsumers will pay greater attention to the labels and trade marks before buying the goods. On the fac ts and evidenc e, I do not agree that this proposition has been made out. In my view, the “ingestible” nature of the snac k food produc ts is a neutral fac tor in relation to the overall assessment of a likelihood of c onfusion. 

128    Sec ond, the PAR found that on the fac ts, the visual and c onc eptual similarities were more important than the aural similarity bec ause the goods are self-serve items and sold in supermarkets. While I do not disagree that the visual and c onc eptual similarities play a signific ant role when c onsumers sc an the supermarket shelves and pic k out a pac ket of c risps, it does not follow that aural similarity is irrelevant. The more diffic ult question is the relative weight to be asc ribed to aural similarity. In Singapore, the material time at whic h c onfusion must exist is at the time of purc hase: _Ng-Loy Wee Loon_ at para 21.5.26, c iting _Staywell_ (although questions may arise on post sale c onfusion). This explains the learned author’s c omment at para 21.5.29(d) that the normal way under whic h the average c onsumer would purc hase the goods or servic es is a relevant fac tor in assessing the likelihood of c onfusion. Where the similarity lies mainly in their aural aspec t, the risk of c onfusion would be greater if the goods are normally purc hased by plac ing verbal orders. Given the snac k produc ts in the present c ase are not purc hased by plac ing verbal orders, I find no reason to disturb the PAR’s assessment that aural similarity is less important on the fac ts of the present c ase. 

_Who are the likely consumers of the Applicant’s and Opponent’s goods?_ 


129    The PAR disagreed with the Opponent’s submission that c hildren were the primary c onsumers of the Applic ant’s and Opponent’s goods. No evidenc e was given on this issue. The c ourt is thus left to c ome to a dec ision based on its general impression of who the likely purc hasers of snac k food produc ts are. 

130    On that basis, there is no reason to disturb the PAR’s c onc lusion that people who buy snac ks are not merely, or even primarily, c hildren. After all, people of all ages purc hase snac ks whether for themselves or others. It is likely that in many c ases the parents or adults will be the ac tual purc hasers (even if c risps are meant for c onsumption by the c hild). 

_Conclusion on the likelihood of confusion_ 

131    I find that _on the whole_ , the PAR is justified in c onc luding that there is no likelihood of c onfusion. In c oming to this c onc lusion, I have ignored the alleged similarities in pac kaging between the parties’ goods. 

132    Given my c onc lusion that the marks are not similar, and that there is, in any event, no likelihood of c onfusion, I find that the opposition on the ground of s 8(2)(b) of the TMA must fail. 

**Issue 2: s 8(4)(b)(i) read with s8(4)(a) of the TMA** 

133    I set out the relevant parts of s8(4) of the TMA: 

 Subjec t to subsec tion (5), where an applic ation for registration of a trade mark is made on or after 1st July 2004, if the whole or an essential part of the trade mark is identical with or similar to an earlier trade mark , the later trade mark shall not be registered if – 

 (a) the earlier trade mark is well known in Singapore ; and 

 (b) use of the later trade mark in relation to the goods or servic es for whic h the later trade mark is sought to be registered – 

 (i) would indicate a connection between those goods or servic es and the proprietor of the earlier trade mark, and is likely to damage the interests of the proprietor of the earlier trade mark ; 

 [emphasis added] 

**_Are the Opponent Marks “well known in Singapore”?_** 

134    The PAR found that as of 5 April 2012 (the relevant date, being the date of the applic ation of the Angry Bite Mark), the Opponent Marks were “well known in Singapore”. She c ited the Court of Appeal’s holdings in _Novelty Pte Ltd v Amanresorts Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">[2009] 3 SLR(R) 216</span> (“ _Amanresorts_ ”) at [229], whic h emphasised that pursuant to s 2(7)(a) of the TMA, the trade mark need only be well known to “any relevant sec tor of the public ” in Singapore to be deemed “well known in Singapore”. At [145] of her grounds of dec ision, the PAR repeated the observation of the Court of Appeal in _Amanresorts_ at [229] that this was not too diffic ult a threshold to c ross. Bearing that in mind, the PAR was prepared to hold that the Opponent Marks were well known in Singapore as of 5 April 2012. 

135    The Applic ant does not dispute this finding on appeal. [note: 12] However, it submits that even 


if the Opponent Marks are well known in Singapore, it is well known _only in relation to computer_ 

_games_. [note: 13] The Applic ant does not, however, make any further submissions on the legal implic ations of its observation. There is no explanation as to how this may render s 8(4) of the TMA inapplic able on the fac ts. 

136    In dec iding whether a trade mark is well known, the c ourt is essentially assessing the reputation of the trade mark. A trade mark is a sign whic h is c apable of being represented graphic ally, and whic h is c apable of distinguishing goods or servic es dealt with or provided in the c ourse of trade by different traders. It is obvious that a trade-mark may be well known for partic ular goods or servic es only. Suc h a trade mark may not be well known for c ompletely different goods or servic es. From this, it follows that there will be c ases where the trade mark is well known only to the sec tor or c lass of the Singapore public that purc hases the partic ular good or servic e, without being well known to the public in general. That said, there may also be c ases where the trade mark is well known not just within the c ommunity of c ustomers for those goods or servic es, but to the public at large. 

137    Well known trade marks are espec ially valuable in the market plac e. The proprietor of a well known trade mark is likely to have c ommitted substantial resourc es in promoting and developing brand awareness. Even if the proprietor’s c urrent business is c onc erned solely with a partic ular type of produc t or servic e, he may have very real c onc erns where the same or similar trade mark is taken and used on different goods or servic es. These c onc erns lie behind the spec ial protec tion that is c onferred on well known trade marks. 

138    It is plain that s 8(4) of the TMA is not just c onc erned with the goods or servic es in respec t of whic h the trade mark is well known. Sec tion 8(4)(a) read with s 8(4)(b)(i) of the TMA grants proprietors of trade marks whic h are “well known in Singapore” protec tion from the registration and/or use of identic al or similar trade marks on _dissimilar_ goods or servic es: _Amanresorts_ at [229] and _NgLoy Wee Loon_ at para 21.5.41. 

139    It does not matter that the mark is well known in respec t of goods or servic es other than those whic h an applic ant seeks to use a similar or identic al mark for. As suc h, based on the parties’ submissions, I have no reason to disturb the PAR’s finding that the Opponent Marks are “well known in Singapore”. 

140    However, I would make one observation about the PAR’s holding on this issue. It is not immediately c lear who the “relevant sec tor of the public ” she refers to c omprises. Unlike high end luxury resorts in _Amanresorts_ , the Opponent’s Angry Bird game and merc handise do not seem to have a c learly defined group of c onsumers. The sec tor of the public might have been “the public interested in c omputer games and mobile apps.” However, I note that the Red Bird Mark and Angry Bird Word Mark were registered in multiple c lasses that stretc hed ac ross many different types of goods and servic es, inc luding c onfec tionery. At this junc ture, I find it important to make a few more c larific atory c omments on this issue. 

141    Sec tion 8(4)(a) requires that the earlier trade mark be well known in Singapore. Sec tion 2(8) states that a trade mark that is well known to any relevant sec tor of the public in Singapore, is deemed to be well known in Singapore. That said, it does not follow that in order for the earlier trade mark to be well known in Singapore, it is nec essary to show that the trade mark is well known to a partic ular and well-defined sec tor of the public. An earlier trade mark may be well known in Singapore even if it is diffic ult to define with prec ision the sec tor or c lass of the public among whic h it is well known. Sec tion 2(7) makes c lear that the question whether any trade mark is well known in Singapore is a question of fac t whic h depends on all the c irc umstanc es. Apart from whether the trade mark is known or rec ognised by any relevant sec tor of the public , other relevant fac tors inc lude the duration, 


extent and geographic al area of use and promotion of the mark. Any value assoc iated with the mark c an also be c onsidered. 

**_Is the “whole or an essential part” of the Angry Bite Mark identical or similar to either of the Opponent Marks?_** 

142    Sec tion 8(4) of the TMA requires that the “whole or an essential part of the trade mark” be identic al or similar to an earlier trade mark. The question that arises is whether this inquiry is any different from the similarity of marks inquiry in s 8(2)(b) of the TMA. 

143    The PAR found that given the similarity of wording between s 8(2)(b) and s 8(4) of the TMA, the same princ iples may apply to the similarity of marks c omparison under both provisions. On that basis, she c onc luded that the similarity of marks requirement under s 8(4) of the TMA is _not_ satisfied. 

144    The parties agreed that the same princ iples applied to the similarity of marks c omparison under 

both provisions as well. [note: 14] A t the c ourt’s request, they jointly submitted that the Court of Appeal’s holding in _Sarika Connoisseur Cafe Pte Ltd v Ferrero SpA_ <span class="citation">[2013] 1 SLR 531</span> (“ _Sarika_ ”) provided the nec essary guidanc e. The c ourt in _Sarika_ was c onc erned with the interpretation of s 55(2), whic h gives the proprietor of a well known trade mark the right to “restrain by injunc tion the use in Singapore, in the c ourse of trade and without the proprietor’s c onsent, of any trade mark whic h, or an _essential part_ of whic h, is identic al with or similar to the proprietor’s trade mark, in relation to identic al or similar goods or servic es, where the use is likely to c ause c onfusion” [emphasis added]. 

145    In _Sarika_ , the Court of Appeal had to c onsider, _inter alia_ , whether the differenc e in wording between s 27(2)(b) and s 55(2) of the TMA made a differenc e to the similarity of marks analysis. Sec tion 55(2) makes referenc e to an “essential part” of the trade mark, while s 27(2)(b) (on infringement) does not. The Court of Appeal held at [69]–[73] that the High Court did not err in applying the same reasoning to both provisions. The differenc e in statutory wording was unintentional, and arose bec ause the provisions were adopted from different legislative sourc es. 

146    While _Sarika_ was c onc erned with different provisions in the TMA, I am similarly of the view that little turns on the referenc e to “essential part” in s 8(4). After all, even under s 8(2)(b) where the phrase “essential part” does not appear, it is c lear that c ourt in making the mark for mark c omparison is entitled (where relevant) to take into ac c ount the dominant features of the trade mark. Indeed, I agree with _Sarika_ that the differenc e in statutory wording c an be explained by the legislative history of the provision, rather than by any deliberate polic y intention on Parliament’s part. Sec tion 8(4) was introduc ed into the TMA in 2004. The 2004 amendments as a whole were intended to ensure c omplianc e with Singapore’s obligations under the USSingapore Free Trade Agreement (“USSingapore F TA”). The USSingapore F TA required c omplianc e with the provisions on well known marks in Art 6 of the Paris Convention for the Protec tion of Industrial Property (1967) (see Artic le 16.2, para 

4). [note: 15] Under Art 4 of the World Intellec tual Property Organisation’s ( “ W IP O” ) _Joint Recommendation Concerning Provisions on the Protection of Well-Known Marks_ (1999), “a mark shall be deemed to be in c onflic t with a well-known mark where that mark or an essential part thereof, c onstitutes a reproduc tion, an imitation... of the well-known mark.” Thus, it seems that Parliament imported the WIPO definition to ensure c omplianc e with its international obligations, without deliberately intending to c reate any differenc e between the similarity of marks c omparison in s 8(2)(b) and s 8(4) of the TMA. 

147    I therefore affirm the PAR’s c onc lusion and repeat my finding that the marks are _not_ similar. 


**_Would the use of the Angry Bite Mark indicate a connection between the goods of the Applicant and the Opponent?_** 

148    The PAR found that there was _no_ c onfusing c onnec tion under s 8(4)(b)(i) of the TMA for the same reasons that she found there was _no_ likelihood of c onfusion. On appeal, the parties were also c ontent to rely on their submissions on the “likelihood of c onfusion” under s 8(2)(b) of the TMA for 

this issue. [note: 16] 

149    In _Amanresorts_ at [226], the c ourt held that: 

 ... The “damaging c onnec tion” c ondition in s 8(4)(b)(i)... will be satisfied only where there is a c onfusing c onnec tion between the plaintiff and defendant’s goods or servic es (ie, only where there is c onfusion) bec ause non-c onfusing c onnec tion is c overed by the “unfair dilution” c ondition in s 8(4)(b)(ii)(A)... 

150    Following _Amanresorts_ , it seems that proving a likelihood of c onfusion is bot h _necessary_ and _sufficient_ to prove a c onnec tion between an applic ant’s goods and servic es, and the proprietor of the earlier trade mark. I thus say no more on this issue, and following my finding that there is no likelihood of c onfusion, affirm the PAR’s c onc lusion also that there is no “c onfusing c onnec tion”. 

**_If so, is the connection likely to damage the interests of the Opponent?_** 

151    Given my findings above, it is unnec essary for me to c onsider whether the c onnec tion is likely to damage the interests of the proprietor of the earlier trade mark. Indeed, any assessment of damages arising from a c onfusing c onnec tion would be artific ial given my finding that no suc h c onfusing c onnec tion exists in the first plac e. Having c ome to the c onc lusion that there is _no_ c onfusing c onnec tion, the PAR did not deal with this issue. Nevertheless, in the event that I am wrong about similarity and a c onfusing c onnec tion under s 8(4) of the TMA, I shall briefly touc h on the submissions made by the Opponent on damage. 

152    The Opponent submits that it suffers the following types of damage: 

 (a) Its entry into the snac k food industry is limited. This in turn limits its business expansion opportunities. 

 (b) The Opponent’s business model of lic ensing its trade marks would be severely affec ted if other businesses realise that marks similar to the Opponent Marks like the Angry Bite Mark c an be freely used. 

153    In response, the Applic ant submits the following: 

 (a) The Opponent has not offered any evidenc e that its interests have been damaged even though the Angry Bite Mark is already being used on snac k food produc ts. 

 (b) The Plaintiff’s business is not in the snac k food industry. Its primary business is in c omputer games. It has not offered any evidenc e of lic ensing agreements with snac k food manufac turers. 

154    In _Amanresorts_ , the Court of Appeal at [234] agreed with the High Court holding that the test to be applied to determine the “c onnec tion” and “likely to damage the interests of the proprietor” requirements was essentially the same as the tests applied in a passing off ac tion. That said, whilst 


the foc us in passing off was on goodwill, the foc us in s 8(4) is on the “interests” of the proprietor. The proprietor of a well known mark may not in fac t possess goodwill in Singapore. Similar views were expressed by the Court of Appeal in _Sarika_ at [76]. In the latter c ase, the Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court’s assessment that damage was established on the basis that the opponent’s expansion into the drinks business in Singapore would be restric ted. Even though the opponent had not suffered any ac tual loss in terms of sales, the Court of Appeal in _Sarika_ at [78] agreed that the restric tion on expansion into the Singapore drinks business would be a rec ognised head of damage. Similarly, in _Staywell_ , damage was found on the basis of a restric tion on the ability of the earlier trade mark proprietor to expand into the 4-star hotel market in Singapore (a c losely c onnec ted field of business to 6-star hotel market). 

155    In this c ase, if I did find that the similarity of marks and c onfusing c onnec tion requirements were met, the Opponent may well have been able to establish damage to its interests bec ause its ability to expand into c risps and snac ks is arguably restric ted. Whether it suc c eeds would of c ourse depend on all the fac ts, inc luding an assessment of how c losely related the fields of businesses are. However, in this c ase, given my finding that the marks are _not_ similar, and that there is _no_ likelihood of c onfusion, I similarly find that there is no likelihood of damage c aused to the Opponent from the Applic ant’s use of the Angry Bite Mark. 

156    In c onc lusion, I find that the Opponent’s opposition to the registration of the Angry Bite Mark on the ground of s 8(4)(a) read with s 8(4)(b)(i) of the TMA must fail. 

**Issue 3: s 8(7)(a) of the TMA** 

157    Under s 8(7)(a) of the TMA, a mark shall not be registered if “its use in Singapore is liable to be prevented by virtue of any rule of law (in partic ular, the law of passing off) protec ting an unregistered trade mark or other signed used in the c ourse of trade”. The key question is whether the use of the Angry Bite Mark is “liable to be prevented” by the law of passing off. 

158    In _Amanresorts_ at [37], the Court of Appeal c onfirmed that there are three c lear, identifiable c ore c onc epts fundamental to a passing off ac tion. These are goodwill, misrepresentation and damage. Before going into the substanc e of what was argued, a threshold question arises. In the c ontext of s 8(7)(a) of the TMA, to what extent must an opponent demonstrate that it would suc c eed in a passing off ac tion in order to demonstrate that the use of the applic ant mark is “liable to be prevented” by the law of passing off? 

159    Opposition based on s 8(7)(a) of the TMA is based on the assertion of a private right (protec ted by the law of tort) whic h existed prior to the date of applic ation for registration (or the priorit y date). However, in the c ontext of trade mark opposition proc eedings, a c ourt is generally hampered in evaluating the potential suc c ess of any passing off ac tion. For one, the mark may not even have been used by the trader yet. The dec ision is based on a notional ac tion for passing off. Sec ond, the c ourt may have relatively few fac ts and evidenc e before it on whic h it has to make a dec ision as to whether the notional passing off ac tion will suc c eed. It is in this c ontext, that I now c onsider what is the appropriate threshold of proof an opponent must meet before suc c eeding under s 8(7)(a) of the TMA. 

160    It is fairly well established that in evaluating opposition to trade mark registration under s 8(7) (a) of the TMA, the c ourt c onsiders whether the normal and fair use of the applic ant mark in respec t of the goods or servic es for whic h the mark is sought to be registered would result in passing off: Tan Tee Jim, _Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off in Singapore_ , vol 1 (Sweet & Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2014) (“ _Tan Tee Jim_ ”) at para 8.159 and James Mellor _et al_ , _Kerly’s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names_ 


(Sweet & Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2011) (“ _Kerly’s on Trade Marks_ ”) at para 9–147. Thus, s 8(7)(a) effec tively requires the c ourt to c onsider the position of the opponent in a notional passing off ac tion. 

161    It is also well-established that it is the opponent in opposition proc eedings who bears the burden of making out the grounds of opposition he relies on: _Kerly’s on Trade Marks_ at para 9–166. In the c ontext of s 8(7)(a), the question is whether an opponent relying on the said provision must prove, on a balanc e of probabilities, that he would have a valid passing off c laim if the applic ant mark was used in relation to any of the goods or servic es for whic h the mark is sought to be registered. 

162    In _Wild Child Trade Mark_ [1998] RPC 455 (“ _Wild Child Trade Mark_ ”), the appointed person (Geoffrey Hobbs QC) c onc luded that the opponent’s evidenc e, whic h c omprised two dec larations from the opponent’s managing direc tor on the use of the earlier mark (see _Wild Child Trade Mark_ at [15]– [16]), did not c learly establish use of the mark as a trade mark and was an insuffic ient basis for a c laim in passing off. In this regard, Hobbs QC opined: 

 I apprec iate that the Registrar is often required to ac t upon evidenc e that might be regarded as less than perfec t when judged by the standards applied in High Court proc eedings. However, I am not willing to regard assertions without any real substantiation as suffic ient to sustain an objec tion to registration under Sec tion 5(4). 

163    Indeed, the learned authors of Christopher Morc om, Ashley Roughton and Thomas St Quintin, _The Modern Law of Trade Marks_ (Lexis Nexis, 4th ed, 2012) at para 6.89 (“ _The Modern Law of Trade Marks_ ”) rightly note that following _Wild Child Trade Mark_ , save in plain c ases in whic h the likelihood of dec eption is fairly c lear, an opponent invoking the UK equivalent of s 8(7)(a) of the TMA must be prepared to obtain rather more evidenc e than his own dec laration on his use of a same or similar earlier mark. Compared to the old statutory provision in the UK ( _ie_ , s 11 of the UK Trade Mark Ac t 1938), the present s 5(4)(a) of the UK TMA 1994 (whic h is _in pari materia_ with s 8(7) of the TMA) is far narrower and demands far more from an opponent in terms of proof: _The Modern Law of Trade Marks_ at para 6.88. 

164    Having c onsidered the statutory language of s 8(7)(a) of the TMA and the limited authorities on the matter, I am of the view that s 8(7)(a) of the TMA at the very least requires an opponent to adduc e suffic ient evidenc e to establish a _prima facie_ c ase on goodwill, misrepresentation, and damage: see _Tan Tee Jim_ at para 8.159. I use the phrase _prima facie_ only to indic ate the reality that the c ourt is inevitably hampered by the lac k of a full trial and detailed fac ts and evidenc e (espec ially if the mark has not been used yet) in determining if a passing off c laim would ac tually suc c eed should one be brought. However, the opponent must still persuade the c ourt that on the materials before it, there is at least a _prima facie_ c ase that a passing off c laim would be suc c essful if, at the time of the applic ation, the applic ant mark were to be used in a normal and fair manner in respec t of the goods or servic es for whic h the mark is sought to be registered. Indeed, it may be preferable to just use the words of the statutory provision: has the Opponent established that the use is “liable to be prevented” by passing off? In other words that the Opponent had proved a c ase of passing-off in the notional passing-off ac tion. In the present c ase, for reasons whic h will be apparent, nothing turns on this as either way the opposition fails. 

165    To this end, it is inc umbent on an opponent to adduc e evidenc e on, _inter alia_ , (i) the nature and extent of the goodwill and reputation relied on, (ii) the c loseness or otherwise of the respec tive fields of ac tivity, (iii) the similarity of the marks, (iv) the manner in whic h the applic ant has used the mark (if any), (v) the manner in whic h the partic ular trade is c arried out, (vi) the c lass of persons whom the applic ant mark is likely to be dec eived, and (vii) the likely damage the opponent would suffer. 


166    It is with these points in mind that I turn to c onsider the objec tion under s 8(7). 

**_Goodwill_** 

167    In analysing goodwill, the PAR noted that goodwill may be shared by the Opponent and its lic ensees, and may be proven by showing volume of sales in relation to the vessels of goodwill (the Opponent Marks in this c ase): see the PAR’s GD at [192]–[193]. She proc eeded to analyse all the instanc es where the Opponent has entered the Singapore market, taking into ac c ount only evidenc e relating to events before 5 April 2012 (the date of the applic ation for the registration of the Angry Bite Mark): see the table at [196] of the PAR’s GD. Indeed, whilst nothing appears to turn on this, if the Applic ant’s use of the Angry Bite Mark in Singapore had started at an earlier date, this earlier date would bec ome the relevant date for c onsideration bec ause in a passing off ac tion, the c ourt c onsiders if the plaintiffs had goodwill _etc_ at the date of c ommenc ement of the ac tivities c omplained of. 

168    The PAR did not c ome to a firm c onc lusion on goodwill. This was bec ause she found at [199] that subsistenc e was a “non-issue” bec ause of her finding on “misrepresentation.” Nevertheless, it is apposite to set out some c omments made by the PAR on goodwill. In partic ular, she noted the following: 

 (a) There were no sales or advertisement figures relating spec ific ally to Singapore. No evidenc e was given on what proportion of the worldwide figures relate to Singapore. Nor are there invoic es buttressing the worldwide figures. 

 (b) In relation to several events that evidenc e the Opponent’s entry into the Singapore market, it was unc lear what merc handise was sold or what revenue was otherwise generated. For example, the PAR mentions that it is unc lear what merc handise was sold (if at all) at the 2011 Formula 1 Singtel Singapore Grand Prix. 

169    On appeal, the Opponent submits the following: 

 (a) There is evidenc e that the Opponent has spent substantial amounts on marketing and advertising in Singapore. Instanc es of marketing and advertising have been noted in the PAR’s GD at [196]. 

 (b) Merc handise with the Opponent Marks on them ( eg toys, stationary, t-shirts, snac k pac kets from Polar and Korean super markets) was being sold before 5 April 2012. Suc h merc handise was purc hased prec isely bec ause the Opponent Marks were appended on them. In its oral submissions, the Opponent referred the c ourt to pic tures of snac ks with the Opponent Marks appended. These snac ks were sold in Korean supermarkets in Singapore. It also presented a rec eipt showing that suc h snac ks were purc hased in Singapore before 5 April 2012, presumably to prove that these snac ks are indeed being sold in Singapore. 

170    The Applic ant, on the other hand, submits that the Opponent only has goodwill _in relation to_ 

_c omputer games_. [note: 17] There is insuffic ient evidenc e to show that the Opponent’s goodwill extends to snac k foods. 

171    Both _Staywell_ at [131] and _Amanresorts_ at [39] c ite the definition of goodwill in _The CIR Muller & Co’s Margarine Ltd_ [1901] AC 217 at 223-224 as an authoritative statement of the meaning of goodwill. There, the House of Lords defined goodwill as “the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and c onnec tion of a business. It is the attrac tive forc e whic h brings in c ustom...”. Following the House of Lords, the c ourt in _Amanresorts_ at [39], identified two essential features of 


goodwill: 

 First, it is the assoc iation of a good, servic e or business on whic h the plaintiff’s mark, name, labelling, etc (referred to generally as the plaintiff’s “get-up”) has been applied with a partic ular sourc e. Sec ond, this assoc iation is “an attrac tive forc e whic h brings in c ustom”. 

172    In order to suc c eed in a passing off ac tion in Singapore, the c ourt in _Staywell_ at [130] emphasised that “goodwill must exist _i n Singapore_ ” [emphasis added]. The first step to proving goodwill in a passing off ac tion is therefore to demonstrate that the c laimant has a business in Singapore. Thereafter, what is nec essary is to establish that the c laimed _indicia_ of origin ( _ie_ , the brand, name, logo, or get-up) enjoys a reputation in Singapore. Establishing a reputation requires proof that the c laimed mark is known to the public in Singapore as a mark assoc iated exc lusively with goods or servic es of a partic ular origin. In short, the public must view the c laimed mark as an indic ator of origin. The PAR rightly notes at [186] that passing off protec ts goodwill, and not the mark used to promote it. The passage c ited by the PAR (at [186] of the PAR’s GD) from NgLoy Wee Loon, _Law of Intellectual Property in Singapore_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 2009) at para 17.1.3 bears repeating: 

 Passing off protec ts the plaintiff’s business or goodwill, and not the mark used to promote it. The mark is merely a tool used by the plaintiff to educ ate their c ustomers to identify whic h goods or servic es originate from his business. Although it is important to bear in mind that the proper subjec t matter of protec tion in an ac tion for passing off is the plaintiff’s business or goodwill, and not the mark, the role of the mark is c ruc ial when proving the element of goodwill. This is bec ause the test whic h has been used by the c ourts to determine whether the plaintiff’s business has goodwill is this: has the mark adopted by the plaintiff bec ome distinc tive of his goods or servic es in the sense that it is assoc iated or identified exc lusively with his goods or servic es. 

173    In this way, assuming that the plaintiff in a passing off ac tion is able to establish a business in Singapore, he must go on to prove that the c laimed mark is a badge of rec ognition upon whic h the reputation is founded so as to _generate_ goodwill: William Cornish _et al_ , _Intellectual Property: Patents, Copyright, Trade Marks and Allied Rights_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2013) at para 17-08. 

_How goodwill may be proven in practice_ 

174    I now c onsider how goodwill may be proven in prac tic e. The first c ase that arises for c onsideration is _Amanresorts_. In c onc luding that the “Aman” name has goodwill whic h is limited in sc ope (see [58]–[59] of _Amanresorts_ ), the c ourt in _Amanresorts_ took into ac c ount the following fac tors (amongst others): 

 (a) The extensiveness of the marketing of the “Aman” name, whic h was relevant to determining the extent to whic h the Singapore public had been exposed to the “Aman” name: Amanresorts at [51]. 

 (b) How frequently Internet users in Singapore visited the Amanresorts website: Amanresorts at [54]. 

 (c ) Sales revenue from c ustomers in Singapore: Amanresorts at [56]. 

 (d) Whether the Amanresorts had ac tual or potential c ustomers in light of the high pric e of the resorts: Amanresorts at [60], [63]. 

 (e) Type of business in respec t of whic h the goodwill in the “Aman” name exists, namely, the 


 high end hotel and resort market, and not residential ac c ommodation: Amanresorts at [65]. 

175    At this junc ture, I must point out that _Amanresorts_ (at [44]) c learly establishes that goodwill is not an all-or-nothing attribute. Goodwill c ould be limited to partic ular sec tions of the public provided that the sec tion of the public was not so small as to be negligible. Onc e goodwill is established among a sec tion of the public in Singapore, goodwill subsists in Singapore. By this, what was meant is that if the plaintiff c an show that he has a business in Singapore, it does not matter that the business targets and has dealings with only a sec tion of the Singapore public. If the c laimed mark is a badge of rec ognition to those c ustomers in Singapore, it is a generator of goodwill in Singapore. 

176    The next relevant c ase is _Staywell_. The Court of Appeal had to dec ide if the St. Regis hotel c hain had goodwill in Singapore before it had an ac tual hotel in Singapore. It ultimately c onc luded that the “ST REGIS” brand had no goodwill in Singapore as of the relevant date. It c onsidered (amongst others) the following fac tors in reac hing that c onc lusion: 

 (a) Pre-trading ac tivity c an establish goodwill, and revenue-generating ac tivity is not always nec essary to establish goodwill. The key question is whether valuable demand for the good or servic e exists: Staywell at [141]. 

 (b) How widespread the advertising efforts were, and whether marketing efforts were suffic ient to generate demand in Singapore for the St Regis hotel c hain: Staywell at [146]–[147]. 

177    The brief findings on goodwill in _Hai Tong_ at [112]–[114] are also instruc tive. The Court of Appeal found that the appellant’s business had “undoubtedly ac quired goodwill” on the basis that c ustomers were exposed to the trade mark in question, and the appellant has been trading and running a sustainable business for more than four dec ades. Moreover, the c ourt took into ac c ount the appellant’s annual sales figures for the relevant range of produc ts in Singapore. 

178    Finally, I mention in passing a rec ent High Court dec ision, whic h briefly disc usses what is required to prove goodwill in an ac tion for passing off. In _Jamal Abdulnaser Mahmoud Al Mahamid v Global Tobacco Manufacturers (International) Sdn Bhd_ <span class="citation">[2015] SGHC 42</span> (“ _Jamal_ ”) at [62], Aedit Abdullah JC rec ognized that goodwill may be shown through various means, suc h as sales figures. The c ourt also noted that sales or evidenc e of marketing _alone_ does not establish goodwill. It must be proven that the sales were _a result_ of c onsumers being attrac ted to the plaintiff’s brand or produc t (as opposed to an ac c idental purc hase of the produc t, for instanc e): _Jamal_ at [63]–[64]. 

179    The dec ision in _Jamal_ was only released post–submissions in the present c ase. Given that the parties have not addressed the dec ision, I will c onfine myself to making only brief observations on the dec ision. The expression “attrac tive forc e” in the definition of goodwill does not mean that the brand must be popular or desirable. The question is whether the plaintiff has c ustomers (business) within jurisdic tion and whether the c ustomers rec ognise the c laimed mark as a badge of rec ognition. With respec t to the c omments in _Jamal_ , it is not immediately apparent why it must be shown that the c ustomers made a deliberate dec ision to ac quire the spec ific produc t in question. Indeed, the fac t that no alternative produc t was available does not mean that (i) the plaintiff did not have c ustomers, and (ii) that the mark does not have a reputation in that it is rec ognised by the public as a badge of rec ognition. That said, it is quite right and ac c epted that the mere proof of a few oc c asional sales to a very limited group of people suc h as staff of a foreign embassy is unlikely to be enough to prove that the mark is rec ognised as a badge of rec ognition by the public or a sec tion of the public (see _Anheuser-Busch v Budejovicky Budvar_ [1984] FSR 413, where sales to Americ an military bases in the UK was not c ounted). Whether the sales and marketing efforts are suffic ient to establish goodwill (at the relevant time) is a question that must depend on the c irc umstanc es and fac ts as a whole. 


180    Bringing together the authorities mentioned above, it appears to me that the existenc e of goodwill is normally established with the following evidenc e: 

 (a) Figures on sales in Singapore: Actual sales figures must often be adduc ed to demonstrate the volume of sales in Singapore. It stands to reason that the greater the volume of sales and proven demand, the greater the likelihood that the c laimed mark will be found to be a badge of rec ognition in the minds of the public. 

 (b) Marketing and advertising efforts in Singapore: These show the extent of public exposure of the partic ular brand or business in Singapore. The c ourt will sc rutinise the nature, extent and effec tiveness of advertising in determining if the business in question has ac hieved some degree of notoriety (in the sense of rec ognition) in the minds of Singapore c onsumers. 

_Whether goodwill has been proven on the facts of the present case_ 

181    The Opponent asserts goodwill in the Opponent Marks. By this, what the PAR at [165] understood the c laim to refer to was the registered Red Bird Mark and the Angry Bird Word Mark. 

182    In the present c ase, there is evidenc e of some marketing of the “Angry Bird” brand in Singapore. However, the evidenc e is thin espec ially as to the _scale or extent_ of the marketing efforts. No statistic s on marketing expenditure in Singapore were produc ed in evidenc e. No statistic s were provided on the volume of sales of Angry Bird merc handise (or snac k foods spec ific ally) in Singapore before 5 April 2012. 

183    The fac t that “Angry Birds” as a mobile-game or c omputer applic ation is well known and popular in Singapore does not mean that goodwill in the Opponent Marks subsists in Singapore. Despite the PAR’s c omments at [198]–[199], the Opponent did not ask for leave to adduc e further evidenc e on sales figures and marketing expenditure _specific to Singapore_ on appeal. Whilst there is some evidenc e of the promotion of the Red Bird Mark and Angry Bird Word Mark ( _eg_ at the 2011 Formula 1 Singtel Singapore Grand Prix and the Takashimaya Department Store in November 2011), the evidenc e as to just what was being promoted and what merc handise was being sold was unc lear. 

184    In the Statutory Dec laration of Harri Koponen (for the Opponent) at para 3, it is stated that “ _Angry Birds_ was first released in Dec ember 2009 as an iPhone game on Apple’s _App Store_ ”. By Oc tober 2011, it was c laimed that there were more than one million downloads in Singapore alone. Whilst there was no independent evidenc e to support this c laim, I note that the Applic ant in its written submissions ac c epts that the Opponent’s business and henc e goodwill were in c omputer 

games. [note: 18] 

185    It is not entirely c lear what the Applic ant meant by this submission. If the Opponent has established a business in c omputer games in Singapore, and if the Opponent Marks have ac quired a reputation in Singapore as badges of origin, goodwill will subsist in Singapore. The fac t that the business and rec ognition is in respec t of c omputer games does not affec t the finding of goodwill. That said, the fac t that the Applic ant’s business (goods or servic es) does not relate to c omputer games, but relates to snac k food produc ts, may be relevant in dec iding whether the Applic ant’s use of the Angry Bite Mark c onstitutes a misrepresentation suc h as is likely to damage that goodwill. 

186    In the present c ase, whilst the evidenc e that the Opponent or its lic ensees had established business ac tivities for snac k food produc ts on or before5 April 2012 in Singapore is thin, I am of the view that there is c lear evidenc e that there were substantial downloads of the Angry Bird game in Singapore by that date. This, in my view, c onstitutes business ac tivity in Singapore. To establish that 


one has business ac tivity in Singapore, it is not of c ourse nec essary to establish a bric k and mortar shop in Singapore. A business established on an Internet website hosted in Singapore is still a business in Singapore. Where the website is hosted outside of Singapore, the question whether there is suffic ient nexus to Singapore to c onstitute a business in Singapore (or business ac tivity in Singapore) c an be tric ky. English c ases suc h as _800-Flowers Trade Mark_ [2000] FSR 697 and _Euromarket Designs Inc v Peters_ [2001] FSR 20 stress the importanc e of questions suc h as the purpose of the website and advertisement, and who are the intended c ustomers. Just bec ause individuals in c ountry X c an ac c ess the website in c ountry Y does not mean that the owner of the website has business ac tivities in c ountry X. The position may well be different where it is established that the proprietor took ac tive steps to promote the goods or servic es in c ountry X. 

187    Whilst these English c ases c onc erned registered trade marks and what c onstitutes “use”, the general point is that just bec ause a person in Singapore c an ac c ess a website overseas on whic h goods and servic es are offered does not mean that the website owner has a business in Singapore. The mere presenc e of c ustomers in the UK for servic es provided elsewhere is not suffic ient to establish business ac tivity in the UK: _Kerly’s on Trade Marks_ at para 18-053. It is at least nec essary to show that some form of c ommerc ial ac tivity is c arried out in the relevant jurisdic tion, whic h c ould inc lude c ustomers making telephone or online bookings in that jurisdic tion for servic es overseas: _Starbucks (HK) Ltd v British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC_ [2015] UKSC 31 at [52]. 

188    In the present c ase, it appears that members of the public in Singapore were able to ac c ess and download c opies of the Angry Bird game over the Internet. In _Amanresorts_ , the Court of Appeal (at [54]) was c autious as to whether the existenc e of a domain name and website was suffic ient to establish goodwill, but held that proof that ac tive steps were taken to reac h c ustomers in Singapore c ould make a differenc e. Proof of ac tive steps inc luded evidenc e of how many “hits” on the website c ame from Internet users in Singapore. 

189    Whilst very little detail was provided (for example, as to whether the downloads were free or paid), it appears that the Angry Bird game thus downloaded (within the terms of the website) were provided to _users in Singapore_. There is nothing to suggest that the website was intended to target only users in Europe or elsewhere. That being so, whilst the evidenc e c ould have been muc h c learer, given that the Applic ant appears to ac knowledge that the Opponent had goodwill in respec t of c omputer games, I ac c ept the Opponent has established goodwill in Singapore in the Red Bird Mark and the Angry Bird Word Mark. 

190    In c oming to this view, I make c lear that even if all one million downloads from individuals in Singapore were free for the c ustomer, this does not mean that there is no business ac tivity in Singapore suffic ient to support a finding of goodwill. Monetising goods and servic es provided online c an c ome in many different forms, inc luding advertisements and development of merc handising. As the Court of Appeal in _Staywell_ held at [141], pre–trading ac tivity need not be revenue generating bec ause “goodwill does not foc us on the inc ome of the t rader _per se_ but the response of the c ustomer. The fac t that inc ome is generated is only a proxy for the attrac tive forc e of the business.” Indeed, the Court of Appeal in _Staywell_ went on at [141] to c ite its earlier dec ision in _CDL Hotels International Ltd v Pontiac Marina Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1998] 1 SLR(R) 975</span> as ac knowledging that a “valuable demand may be c reated in a produc t or business prior to its being monetised.” 

**_Misrepresentation_** 

191    The PAR found at [207] of her grounds of dec ision that there is no misrepresentation in the Applic ant using the Angry Bite Mark for broadly the same reasons whic h she found that there is no “likelihood of c onfusion” under s 8(2)(b) of the TMA and no “c onfusing c onnec tion” under s 8(4)(b)(i) 


of the TMA. 

192    On this, I note that the Court of Appeal in _Amanresorts_ stated at [234]: 

 ... [T]he tests to be adopted for the purposes of the “c onnec tion” requirement and the “likely to damage the [plaintiff’s] interests requirement” in s 55(3)(a) of the c urrent TMA would yield the same results as those obtained from applying the c orresponding tests vis-à-vis the Respondent’s c laim for passing off... 

193    While _Amanresorts_ was c onc erned with s 55(3)(a) of the TMA, the language used in that provision is substantially similar to that in s 8(4)(b)(i) of the TMA. It therefore applies equally in the c ontext of s 8(4)(b)(i). 

194    As stated by Lord Oliver in _Reckitt & Coleman Products Ltd v Borden_ [1990] RPC 341 at 406, to suc c eed in passing off, aside from goodwill, it is nec essary to show: 

 (a) a misrepresentation by the defendant (whether intentional or not) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that the goods or servic es offered by him are the goods or servic es of the plaintiff; and 

 (b) damage or the likelihood of damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant’s misrepresentation that the sourc e of the defendant’s goods or servic es is the same as the sourc e of those offered by the plaintiff. 

195    A c omparison of the Applic ant’s Angry Bite Mark, and the Red Bird Mark and Angry Bird Word Mark, has already been made for the purposes of the objec tions raised under ss 8(2) and 8(4) of the TMA. The signific ant differenc es between the marks led to the holding that the marks were dissimilar. Indeed, I would add that even if the Red Bird Mark and Angry Bird Word Mark were treated as a c omposite mark (for the purposes of the passing off issue), there are still signific ant differenc es between the Angry Bite Mark and a c ombined version of the Red Bird Mark and the Angry Bird Word Mark suc h as the absenc e of a bird. 

196    While my previous finding on dissimilarity is suffic ient to dispose of the question of misrepresentation ( _ie_ , to justify a finding that there is no misrepresentation), I would like to make a few c omments on two further issues related to misrepresentation that arise in the present c ase: first, I c onsider whether it is relevant that the Applic ant was inspired by “Angry Birds” in designing the Angry Bite Mark, and sec ond, I c onsider whether the parties were in the same field of business, and the relevanc e of that fac t to the misrepresentation inquiry, if any. 

_Relevance of inspiration_ 

197    The fac t that the Applic ant ac c epts that the Angry Bite Mark was inspired by “Angry Birds” is not in itself evidenc e of an intention to dec eive. The law of passing off does not in general prevent one trader from being inspired by the business model of another trader. Indeed, even if there was an intention to dec eive, it does not mean that the c ourt is bound to find misrepresentation and c onfusion, although the burden on the plaintiff in a passing off ac tion will be muc h lessened. 

198    Thus, the fac t that the Angry Bite Mark may have been inspired by the “Angry Birds” designs does not, on its own, c ontribute to a finding that there is or is likely to be misrepresentation. 

_Common fields of business activity_ 


199    Whilst the law of passing off no longer requires that the parties are c ompeting in the same or c ommon field of ac tivity, a relevant fac tor in dec iding whether any misrepresentation is likely to c ause c onfusion is how c lose or far apart are the fields of ac tivity. Muc h will depend on the ac tual fac ts and c irc umstanc es. As was said in _Ng-Loy Wee Loon_ at para 18.3.28: 

 The c loser the defendant’s field of business ac tivity is to that of the plaintiff, the greater is the risk of c onfusion. However, it does not automatic ally follow from this, that c onfusion c annot arise if the parties are in c ompletely different fields of ac tivity. 

200    In general, the fac t that the defendant used a similar mark in a wholly unrelated field will lessen the likelihood of c onfusion, and indeed, damage. But equally, where the plaintiff’s mark is wellestablished and the fields of ac tivity (whilst not identic al) are c lose or related, a likelihood of c onfusion and damage may still be found. Other relevant fac tors in determining misrepresentation and c onfusion inc lude whether the plaintiff has already started using the mark in that different field of ac tivity. 

201    In the present c ase, there is arguably some evidenc e that the Opponent Marks were not merely used in the unrelated field of c omputer or mobile phone games, but were also used in relation to snac k food produc ts. The PAR (at [203]–[206] of the PAR’s GD) disc ussed the evidenc e available on the use of the Opponent Marks on sweets, c hips, c akes and moon c akes. In my view, the evidenc e as to when the Opponent started to use (or lic enc e the use) of the Opponent Marks on these goods was unc lear, and some of the evidenc e c learly related to events after the relevant date (5th April 2012). However, I ac c ept that Polar c up c akes with the marks had been served on a Finnair Helsinki–Singapore flight on 21 September 2011. 

202    The Opponent further asserts that its merc handise (suc h as soft toys, stationary and t-shirts) were available in Singapore from April 2011. For example, plush toys modelled after the red bird with angry eyes (and other angry bird c harac ters) were apparently available in Singapore. In the statutory dec laration of Harri Koponen at [12], it is stated that these merc handise were “extremely popular in Singapore”. First, I point out that the Applic ant’s business does not relate to suc h merc handise. Sec ond, even if it is ac c epted that these merc handise relate more c losely to snac k food produc ts, no invoic es or ac c ounts were provided to substantiate the c laim that suc h merc handise was sold in Singapore from April 2011. 

203    For the reasons stated above, I find that there is no reason to disturb the PAR’s finding that misrepresentation and likelihood of c onfusion have not been demonstrated. Any use of the earlier marks in Singapore on sweets and c akes _etc_ prior to 5 April 2012 appears to have been intermittent and slight. In addition, the Angry Bite Mark and the Opponent Marks are signific antly different. Even if the Opponent Marks were c ombined, there would still be many points of differenc es as pointed out by the PAR at [209] and [210] of the PAR’s GD. 

**_Damage_** 

204    Given my c onc lusion that there is no misrepresentation, nothing more c an be usefully said on the issue of damage to goodwill pursuant to a misrepresentation. 

205    Thus, I c onc lude that the opposition on the ground of s 8(7)(a) of the TMA fails. 

**Issue 4: s 8(7)(b) of the TMA** 

206    The final ground of opposition invoked by the Opponent is s 8(7)(b) of the TMA. The Opponent 


submits that the use of the Angry Bite Mark is liable to be prevented by virtue of the law of c opyright. 

207    In partic ular, the Opponent submits that the Angry Bite Mark is said to infringe the c opyright in 

two of the Opponent’s designs. [note: 19] 

 (a) The first is the Red Bird Mark as depic ted above at [3]. 

 (b) The sec ond is the Fanc y Word Mark, whic h, as desc ribed at [5] above, c onsists of a stylised version of the “Angry Birds” words. 

 (c ollec tively, “the Artistic Works”) 

208    Two sub-issues arise in relation to the possibility of c opyright infringement. First, the Opponent must prove the subsistenc e and its ownership of c opyright in the Artistic Works. Sec ond, the Opponent must prove that the Angry Bite Mark is a c opy of a substantial part of the Artistic Works. 

**_Subsistence and ownership of copyright_** 

209    The relevant statutory provision on the subsistenc e of a c opyright is s 27(2) of the Copyright Ac t (Cap 63, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”). It states: 

 (2) Subjec t to the provisions of this Ac t, where an original literary, dramatic , music al or artistic work has been published — 

 (a) c opyright shall subsist in the work; or 

 (b) if c opyright in the work subsisted immediately before its first public ation, c opyright shall c ontinue to subsist in the work, 

 if, but only if — 

 (c ) the first publication of the work took place in Singapore ; 

 (d) the author of the work was a qualified person at the time when the work was first published; or 

 (e) the author died before that time but was a qualified person immediately before his death. 

 (emphasis added) 

210    The PAR found that the Red Bird Mark and the Fanc y Word Mark satisfied the requirement in s 27(2)(c ) of the CA read with Regulation 3(1)(a) of the Copyright (International Protec tion) Regulations (see the PAR’s GD at [235]–[236]). On appeal, the parties did not dispute that the “first public ation” requirement in s 27(2)(c ) of the CA is satisfied. The Red Bird Mark and the Fanc y Word 

Mark were first published in Finland on 1 Dec ember 2009 and 21 Oc tober 2010 respec tively. [note: 20] As the PAR c orrec tly stated at [236]–[237] of her grounds of dec ision, sinc e Finland is a party to the Berne Convention, c opyright will subsist in Singapore if the two marks are in fac t original artistic works. If they are original works, the further questions are whether c opyright belongs to the Opponent, and if so, whether it is likely that the Angry Bite mark infringes the c opyright. 


211    The PAR held that the Opponent had not proven the subsistenc e of c opyright in the Artistic Works bec ause originality was not proven. Neither evidenc e nor submissions were made by the Opponent to demonstrate originality in the Designs (see [238]–[239] of the PAR’s GD). The PAR also held that on the evidenc e, there was insuffic ient proof of substantial c opying by the Applic ant. Before the PAR, opposition under s 8(7)(b) thus failed. 

212    While the Opponent referred to c ertific ates of registration of c opyright from China and the United States, the PAR found that the registration c ertific ates _on their own_ do not show that the substantial requirements of registration, inc luding originality, are satisfied. The PAR was of the view that what was needed was evidenc e and submissions on what is required for registrations of c opyright in those jurisdic tions. In partic ular, the PAR noted that there were some jurisdic tions where there may not be a formal examination of the work before a registration c ertific ate is issued. 

213    On appeal, the Applic ant furthered the attac k with the following submissions: 

 (a) The c ertific ates of registration were not adduc ed as evidenc e by way of a statutory dec laration, whic h is required under Rule 69 of the Trade Marks Rules. 

 (b) Even ac c epting the c ertific ates as evidenc e, the owner of the mark on the US c ertific ate is “Rovio Mobile Oy, dba Rovio Mobile Oy”. Prima facie , that stated entity is not the Opponent. No evidenc e has been given as to the relationship of that entity with the Opponent. 

214    In support of its position, the Opponent submits the following: 

 (a) Sec tion 130 of the CA allows the subsistenc e and ownership of c opyright in the Designs to be presumed in favour of the Opponent. 

 (b) Even if s 130 of the CA does not apply, the requirements for proving originality are not high. All that needs to be proven is that some skill or labour had been expended in the c reation of the Artistic Works, and that they have not been c opied. There is no evidenc e that the Artistic Works have been c opied. Therefore, c opyright subsists in the Artistic Works. 

215    The first issue that arises from the parties’ submissions on appeal is the applic ability of s 130 of the CA. If the presumptions in s 130 of the CA apply, the Opponent submits that the absenc e of direc t proof of c opyright subsistenc e is irrelevant. 

216    It is useful to set out s 130 of the CA in full: 

 Presumptions as to subsistenc e and ownership of c opyright 

130\. —(1) In an ac tion brought by virtue of this Part — 

 (a ) copyright shall be presumed to subsist in the work or other subject-matter to whic h the ac tion relates if the defendant does not put in issue the question whether copyright subsists in the work or other subject-matte r; and 

 (b) where the subsistenc e of the c opyright is established — the plaintiff shall be presumed to be the owner of the copyright if he claims to be the owner of the copyright and the defendant does not put in issue the question of his ownership. 

 (1A) Where the defendant puts in issue the question of whether c opyright subsists in the work or 


 other subjec t-matter or whether the plaintiff is the owner of the c opyright, but does not satisfy the c ourt that he does so in good faith, the presumption as to the subsistenc e or ownership of c opyright under subsec tion (1)(a) or (b), as the c ase may be, shall apply notwithstanding that the defendant puts that question in issue. 

 (1B) Where the defendant, in good faith, puts in issue the question of whether c opyright subsists in the work or other subjec t-matter or whether the plaintiff is the owner of the c opyright, an affidavit made on behalf of the plaintiff in whic h the plaintiff makes assertions of fac ts relevant to showing — 

 (a) that c opyright subsists in the work or other subjec t-matter; and 

 (b) that he is the owner of the c opyright, 

 shall be admitted in evidenc e and shall be prima facie proof of the matters stated therein until the contrary is proved, unless the court directs that oral evidence be adduced to prove those matters. 

 (2) Where a defendant, without good faith, puts in issue the questions of whether c opyright subsists in a work or other subjec t-matter to whic h the ac tion relates, or the ownership of c opyright in suc h work or subjec t-matter, thereby oc c asioning unnec essary c osts or delay in the proc eedings, the c ourt may direc t that any c osts to the defendant in respec t of the ac tion shall not be allowed to him and that any c osts oc c asioned by the defendant to other parties shall be paid by him to suc h other parties. 

217    Sec tion 130 of the CA, as enac ted in 1987, was modelled on similar provisions in s 126 of Australia’s Copyright Ac t 1968. In 2004, protec tion given to c opyright owners was strengthened suc h t hat where a defendant c hallenges the subsistenc e and ownership of c opyright without good faith, the presumptions in s 130 still operates (s 130(1A) of the CA). Further, even where the defendant does c hallenge the subsistenc e and ownership of c opyright in good faith, the plaintiff under the amended provisions was permitted to file an affidavit to show that c opyright subsists and that he is the owner (s 130(1B) of the CA). 

218    Before going into the substanc e of s 130 of the CA, a prior question that must be determined is whether s 130 of the CA c an be invoked by a litigant in _trade mark opposition proceedings_. The Applic ant argues that it c annot, bec ause the presumptions in s 130 of the CA only apply where there is a c opyright infringement ac tion. 

219    In relation to this submission, the c ruc ial part of s 130 of the CA whic h merits our attention is the phrase “[i]n an ac tion brought by virtue of this Part...”. From this, the Applic ant submits that it follows that the presumptions in s 130 of the CA only apply to ac tions brought under “Part V Remedies for infringements of c opyright” in the CA. 

220    While I agree that s 130 of the CA only applies in ac tions brought under Part V of the CA, this does not mean that s 130 of the CA is irrelevant in dec iding whether opposition under s 8(7)(b) of the TMA may suc c eed. Just like opposition under s 8(7)(a), opposition under s 8(7)(b) requires the c ourt to c onsider a notional ac tion for c opyright infringement. The Opponent must at the very least establish a _prima facie_ c ase of c opyright infringement. This arises from the language of the provision and the need to show that the use of the applic ant mark is _liable to be prevented_ by the law of c opyright. It follows that this requires a determination, on the materials before the c ourt, of whether an _action for copyright infringement_ is likely to suc c eed (at least on a _prima facie_ basis) should the 


applic ant use the Angry Bite Mark on its produc ts. Indeed, it bears repeating that it may be preferable simply to use the words of the sec tion in formulating the test. Has the Opponent established that an ac tion for c opyright infringement is likely to suc c eed? If the plaintiff in the notional c opyright infringement ac tion is able to invoke the presumptions in s 130 of the CA, a c ourt assessing opposition under s 8(7)(b) of the TMA should be permitted, and indeed, required, to c onsider the likely suc c ess of any c opyright infringement proc eeding in light of s 130 of the CA. 

221    There is, however, still the question of whether the substantive requirements of s 130 of the CA are satisfied suc h as to entitle the Opponent to invoke the presumptions therein. Before moving there, I pause to note the Registrar’s c omments in _PT Lea Sanent v Levi Strauss & Co._ [2006] SGIPOS 6 at [69]–[72]. In c ommenting on the phrase “liable to be prevented” by the law of c opyright in s 8(7)(b) of the TMA, the registrar held that “the plac ement of the word “liable” sets the level of inquiry at a spec ulative level”. The Registrar voic ed the apprehension at [72] that the Registry was essentially determining the same issue as a c ourt would have to determine in an ac tion for c opyright infringement, minus the advantage of a strong disc overy proc ess and a full trial. These are salutary points to bear in mind. Sec tion 8(7)(b) requires that an opponent establishes that the use of the applic ant mark is _liable_ to be prevented by c opyright law. One view is that this requires an opponent to prove that there is a “prima fac ie” c ase, on the materials before the c ourt, that there would be c opyright infringement if the applic ant mark were to be reproduc ed or used by the applic ant. The other view is that it is preferable to simply ask whether on the material before the c ourt, the Opponent has established (or proved) that the use of the mark is liable to be prevented. Either way, this undeniably involves some spec ulation given that the c ourt is c onsidering a notional ac tion for c opyright infringement, a c ourt in trade mark opposition proc eedings is unfortunately required to make the determination in the broad c ontext of determining whether to grant an applic ant proprietary rights over a partic ular mark given the earlier right that has been asserted 

222    I now return to c onsider the spec ific requirements under s 130 of the CA. Broadly, under s 130(1) of the CA, a c ourt must c onsider the following: 

 (a) Is the defendant putting into question the subsistenc e and/or plaintiff’s ownership of the c opyright? 

 (b) If so, is that done in good faith? 

 (c ) If it is done in good faith, is there an affidavit filed by the plaintiff stating the fac ts relevant to the subsistenc e and its ownership of the c opyrights in question? 

 (d) If so, has the defendant adduc ed enough evidenc e to rebut the prima facie proof that c opyright belongs to the plaintiff? 

223    Keeping in mind that the presumptions in s 130(1) of the CA do not apply in trade mark opposition proc eedings _per se_ , but is a _relevant factor_ in light of s 8(7)(b) of the TMA, the question before me is whether the presumptions therein are likely to be suc c essfully invoked in potential c opyright infringement proc eedings. Thus, it is _not_ for me to dec ide if the Applic ant has, in good faith, “put into question” the subsistenc e or the Opponent’s ownership of c opyright in _the present opposition proceedings_. Also, there is also no need for the affidavit mentioned in s 130(1B) of the CA to be filed in opposition proc eedings. This is bec ause the c ourt is not c onc erned with ac tually invoking the presumptions in suc h proc eedings. Instead, a c ourt in my position is asked to determine whether, on a balanc e of probabilities, the defendant is likely to put into question the subsistenc e and the plaintiff’s ownership of the relevant c opyright _in copyright infringement proceedings_ , and whether it is likely to have good grounds to do so. If so the question that arises next is whether the plaintiff is 


likely to be able to produc e the affidavit required in s 130(1B) of the CA. Again, I ac knowledge that this is a rather spec ulative exerc ise. However, the c ourt is unfortunately required by statute and the nature of trade mark opposition proc eedings to engage in some degree of spec ulation. 

224    In the present c ase, I find that the Applic ant will in all likelihood put into question the subsistenc e and/or the Opponent’s ownership of the Designs if c opyright infringement proc eedings were to be c ommenc ed between the parties. Assuming that this is done in good faith (for I have no reason to believe otherwise on the material before me), and bearing in mind the c onc erns that the Applic ant and the PAR have about the evidenc e adduc ed by the Opponent in support of their c laim to c opyright, the question whic h arises is whether there is a basis for the c onc lusion that the Opponent will likely be able to produc e an affidavit or indeed otherwise prove subsistenc e of c opyright in and ownership of the Artistic Works. Whilst the evidential gaps are, of c ourse, theoretic ally surmountable, this is a dec ision that I must take _based on the material before the court_. 

225    At this junc ture, I would emphasise again the prac tic al diffic ulties a c ourt fac es in determining issues of c opyright subsistenc e, ownership, and infringement in trade mark opposition proc eedings. Referenc e to the dec ision of the UK Trade Mark Registry in _Campbell’s Trade Mark_ [2008] ETMR 56 is helpful. The registered trade mark in question was the title “The Offic ial Guide to International Women’s Month” in the form of a figurative, stylised trade mark. An applic ation for a dec laration of invalidity was brought by the applic ant under, _inter alia_ , s 5(4)(b) TMA UK on the ground that the use of the trade mark was liable to be prevented by virtue of c opyright. The question was whether c opyright subsisted in the registered mark, and if so, whether the applic ant was the owner of the c opyright. The registered proprietor’s position was that she, rather than the applic ant, was the owner of the c opyright. After c onsidering the relevant authorities on originality and artistic works, the Hearing Offic er c ame to the view that the c onfiguration and typefac e used in the logo (the figurative mark) was suc h that c opyright subsisted in the registered trade mark. What remained was the issue as to who was the owner of the c opyright. The UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Ac t 1988 does not have a provision equivalent to s 130 of the TMA. In dec iding to prefer the evidenc e of the registered proprietor as to how the trade mark was c reated, and henc e finding that the registered proprietor owned the c opyright in the trade mark, the Hearing Offic er noted that there had not been any c ross examination, and that the Registry was c aught between “Sc ylla and Charybdis” in making the dec ision. The nec essity of making a dec ision however meant that the Hearing Offic er had to c hoose whic h version of the truth he/she steered c loser to. 

226    So too in the present c ase, the PAR had to assess the available evidenc e (suc h as it was) and reac h a dec ision on ownership and subsistenc e of c opyright in the Artistic Works on the basis of that limited evidenc e. In addition, there is the further need to reac h a dec ision on whether the use of the trade mark is liable to be prevented by c opyright law. 

227    I mention briefly that in _The Modern Law of Trade Marks_ at para 6.91, _Re Team Lotus Mark Application_ [1999] ETMR 669 is c ited as an example of a suc c essful c opyright opposition. In that c ase, the opponent suc c eeded in opposing the registration of the applic ant mark. The opponent c laimed ownership of the c opyright in various marks, and the applic ant did not question his assertion of ownership. The opponent’s and applic ant’s marks were found to be strikingly similar. The objec tion based on an earlier c opyright ac c ordingly suc c eeded. 

228    Having c onsidered a few authorities on the matter, I now turn to the evidenc e the Opponent plac ed before the c ourt. These inc lude: 

 (a) Copyright registration c ertific ates; 


 (b) Statutory dec laration of Harri Koponen; and 

 (c ) Statutory dec laration of Kati Kevoranta. 

229    I start by c onsidering the legal and evidential value, if any, of the c opyright registration c ertific ates. The Opponent’s c opyright registration c ertific ates were set out in Exhibit D of the Amended Grounds of Opposition. The ten registration c ertific ates relied on by the Opponent were 

tabulated and referred to at [17] of the Amended Grounds of Opposition. [note: 21] One registration was in the USA, whilst the remainder were registrations in China. The USA registration was desc ribed as “Angry Bird (red bird)”. The registrations in China were for “Red Bird”, “Mighty Eagle”, “Green Bird”, “White Bird”, “Blac k Bird”, “Red Bird”, “Yellow Bird”, “Big Red Bird”, and “Blue Bird”. The Fanc y Word Mark is referred to in Exhibit C and [10] of the Amended Grounds of Opposition. 

230    The c opyright registrations were briefly referred to at [6] of the statutory dec laration of Harri 

Koponen as well. [note: 22] However, no other evidenc e was before the c ourt as to the authorship and origination of the drawings and logo. 

231    The USA c opyright c ertific ate for the work titled “Angry Bird” exhibited before the c ourt in Exhibit D of the Amended Grounds of Opposition, sets out, _inter alia_ , (i) the plac e and date of first public ation (Finland, Dec ember 10, 2009), (ii) the author (Rovio Mobile Oy), (iii) the nature of the work c reated (2D artwork made for hire), and (iv) the c opyright c laimant (Rovio Mobile Oy, dba Rovio 

Mobile Oy). [note: 23] 

232    The Chinese c ertific ates of registration as set out in the Bundle of Doc uments before me on appeal do not c ontain translations of the Chinese statements that appeared on the c ertific ates. However, I am assisted by [240] of the PAR’s GD, where she noted that the doc uments were filed by “Rovio Entertainment Ltd”. 

233    At this junc ture, I must make c lear that whilst evidenc e on c opyright registration in over ten designs was adduc ed before this c ourt, in its submissions on appeal, the Opponent only relies on the 

Red Bird Mark and the Fanc y Word Mark to pursue their objec tion under s 8(7)(b) of the TMA. [note: 24] 

234    What is the legal or evidential value of these c opyright c ertific ates in proving that the relevant designs enjoy c opyright _in Singapore_? At [240]–[241] of the PAR’s GD, the PAR noted that no submissions were made as to whether there had been any substantive examination of the c laimed works by the authorities in the USA and China before c opyright registration was granted. She held that the c opyright c ertific ates, on their own, do not show that the requirement of originality has been satisfied (PAR’s GD at [239]). 

235    I agree with the PAR that the mere fac t that c opyright has been c laimed and registered for the Artistic Works in the USA and China does not mean that c opyright does in fac t and law subsist in the Artistic Works in Singapore. While c opyright registration c ertific ates from other jurisdic tions may have some persuasive value if evidenc e is adduc ed on the proc esses undertaken to obtain suc h registration, the issue at hand is ultimately whether the Opponent will be able to establish that it owns c opyright in the Artistic Works _in Singapore_ in notional c opyright infringement proc eedings. It is to this I now turn. 

236    To establish a c ase that c opyright does subsist in Singapore, the CA requires proof of the following: 


 (a) That the material in question is c opyright subjec t-matter, ie a literary, dramatic , music al, artistic work or a sound rec ording, c inematograph film, broadc ast, c able programme or published edition of works. 

 (b) That if what is c laimed is a literary, dramatic , music al or artistic work, the work is original. 

 (c ) If the above requirements are satisfied, it must also be shown that the c onnec ting fac tors have been satisfied in respec t of the nationality, residenc e and/or plac e of first public ation. 

237    In the present c ase, there is no dispute that the c onnec ting fac tors have been established. What is nec essary is some evidenc e from whic h the c ourt c an make an assessment of whether the material in question is an original artistic work. In a c opyright infringement ac tion where subsistenc e and ownership is in dispute, evidenc e and submissions are often required on, _inter alia_ , (i) who is the author, (ii) whether the work is original to the author, (iii) whether the material falls into one of the nine types of c opyright subjec t-matter, and (iv) the basis for the c laim to c opyright if the c laimant is not the author (suc h as an employment relationship, or assignment). 

238    Having c onsidered the materials before me, I am of the view that the Opponent may well be able to establish a suffic ient c hain of title whether by assignment or exc lusive lic ense or otherwise. However, it is less c lear whether the Red Bird Mark and Fanc y Word Mark is an _original artistic work_ under the CA. There c an be no doubt that the Red Bird Mark is an artistic work. Whilst more doubt may exist as to whether the Fanc y Word Mark is also an artistic work, I am prepared to ac c ept that there is suffic ient visual stylization in the Fanc y Word Mark suc h that it c an properly be treated as an artistic work. 

239    What remains is the question of originality. Put broadly, did the author(s) originate the Artistic Works, or were they slavish c opies of existing works? There is neither evidenc e on the proc ess by whic h the Artistic Works were c reated, nor is there any evidenc e whic h suggests that the works were slavish c opies. This being the state of the evidenc e, and bearing in mind that the Applic ant has not raised any argument or evidenc e whic h suggests that the artistic works lac ked originality, I find that, on a balanc e of probabilities the Opponent would likely be able to demonstrate that the Red Bird Mark and the Fanc y Word Mark are original works in c opyright infringement proc eedings. Henc e, I find that the Opponent is, on a balanc e of probabilities, likely to be able to satisfy the requirement in s 130(1B) of the CA in potential c opyright infringement proc eedings. Of c ourse, my dec ision here is not to be taken as a c onc lusive dec ision on the subsistenc e and ownership of c opyright in the works should an ac tual c opyright infringement ac tion be litigated between the parties. 

**_Copying_** 

240    Given my c onc lusion that the subsistenc e and ownership of c opyright in the Artistic Works are likely to be suffic iently proven by the Opponent in potential c opyright infringement proc eedings, it leaves me to c onsider whether “c opying” has taken plac e and if so, whether the Angry Bite Mark does reproduc e a substantial part of the c laimed works. 

241    At the outset, I affirm the PAR’s finding (at [245] of the PAR’s GD) that the fac t that the designer of the Angry Bite Mark may have been inspired by the Opponent’s _Angry Birds_ brand does not mean that c opying has taken plac e. 

242    The evidenc e of the Applic ant as set out in the Statutory Dec laration of Huang Len Len at [6] was that its in-house designer designed the Angry Bite Mark after he was inspired when he saw his 


nephew playing the _Angry Bird_ game. The design was modified so as to make the fac e “human and 

matc hed it with lips and a row of white teeth biting into a snac k”. [note: 25] 

243    Copyright protec ts original _expression_ from c opying. What has to be c opied is the original expression, not the underlying idea or c onc ept behind the work. Whilst the expression/idea dic hotomy c an be tric ky to apply, there is no doubt that this dic hotomy is well known and deeply entrenc hed in c opyright law. 

244    The first question that arises is what, if anything, did the Applic ant’s designer c opy from the c opyright works? Thereafter, it is nec essary to c ompare the part c opied with the c opyright works in order to dec ide whether the part c opied was substantial. Substantiality depends more on the quality of the part taken rather than the quantity with referenc e to the c opyright works. 

245    In the present c ase, the Applic ant ac c epts that the designer was aware of the _Angry Birds_ game and that the game was the inspiration for Angry Bite Mark. Whilst it is c lear that the c onc ept or idea of an angry figure was borrowed, the detailing of the Angry Bite Mark is quite different from the Red Bird Mark. The Angry Bite Mark shows a fac e head on. The fac e is not “bird-like”, and does not resemble the depic tion in the Red Bird Mark. Indeed, whilst angry eyes are depic ted in the Angry Bite Mark, there is really no c learly defined fac e at all. Further, there is no beak. Instead, what is depic ted in the Angry Bite Mark are distorted lips, teeth and what appears to be a c one-like snac k in the proc ess of being c rushed between the teeth. There are no c lear feathers in the Angry Bite Mark, although the Opponent does assert that there is a very small representation of feathers emerging from the letter “B” in “BITE”. 

246    On the basis of the evidenc e before me, it appears that what was taken (by way of inspiration) was the c onc ept of an angry c harac ter. In the Red Bird Mark, the impression of anger (an angry bird) flows from the fierc e eyes, eyebrows and the sharp, fierc e looking beak. In the Angry Bite Mark, whilst angry eyes and ac c ented eyebrows are used, very little else appears to have been taken. Indeed, the eyes and eyebrows whilst showing anger are not the same as the angry eyes or eye brows in the Red Bird Mark. The message of “anger” in the Angry Bite Mark is predominantly to be found in the eyes and the words “Angry Bite” that appears between the eyes and the mouth of the c reature. 

247    I emphasise that the expression and idea dic hotomy applies to all c opyright subjec t-matter, inc luding simple artistic works. In _King Features Syndicate, Inc v O and M Kleeman, Ltd_ [1941] AC 417, a dispute arose over whether the defendant had infringed the c opyright in c artoon drawings of “Popeye the Sailor Man.” Whilst liability was found, it is noted that one of the issues raised was whether the defendant had merely borrowed the idea of a “musc ular sailor-man”, or whether the partic ular expression of the idea had been c opied. Even though the c laim suc c eeded, the remarks of Lord Porter at 448 bear repeating: 

 ... [T]he idea c reated by a pic ture or drawing does not nec essarily form an element in the original work or its design whic h is protec ted by c opyright. The same idea whic h is suggested by the c opyright work may be expressed by another painting or drawing whic h is in no sense a c opy and does not borrow its design. No doubt, if the learned judge had asked himself whether the essential idea of "Popeye" had been utilized in the dolls and brooc hes, instead of asking whether one or more of the material sketc hes had been c opied, he would have applied the wrong test. 

248    The House of Lords found infringement bec ause the defendant did more than just take or use the same idea: the defendant’s brooc hes suffic iently resembled the figures relied on, the salient features being prac tic ally identic al in eac h. 


249    It does not follow of c ourse that a finding of taking of a substantial part requires proof that the defendant’s work is “prac tic ally identic al” in the salient features. Substantiality is always a question of fac t and degree. That said, where the author’s expression over and above the underlying idea is simple, this c an affec t the assessment of substantiality as is demonstrated and disc ussed by c ases suc h as _Kenrick & Co v Lawrence & Co_ (1890) 25 QBD 99 and _Politechnika Ipari Szovetkezet v Dallas Print Transfers Ltd_ [1982] FSR 529. 

250    This brings me to the dec ision in _Spectravest Inc v Aperknit Ltd [1988] FSR 161 (“Spectravest”)_. Whilst this c ase was not c ited in argument, a brief referenc e to it is helpful. The c ase c onc erned c opyright in drawings (design) of c ats sitting in various positions, all wearing boots. The design was referred to as “PussNBoots.” The defendants produc ed drawings (design) of dogs in a variety of positions also in boots. Millett J stated that it was permissible to use another person’s work as inspiration to make a new work so long as the essential features and substanc e is not taken with minor or inc onsequential variations. In dec iding infringement, the attention should be on the parts reproduc ed, and not the part whic h were not. On this basis, infringement was found even though there were differenc es suc h as the fac t that all the c ats were shown full-fac e whereas many of the dogs were in profile. What was important was the depic tion of the boots: the basic shape, outline, angles, perspec tives, arrangement of the tongues and lac es were identic al. The c olours were also nearly identic al. The drawings of the boots were found to be a substantial part of the c opyright works (on both a quantitative and qualitative basis). Ac c ordingly, liability was established with Millett J holding at p 172 that the defendant had done more than just c opy the theme of animals in footwear. The essential features had been taken. 

251    In the present c ase, the PAR’s c onc lusion was that there was _no_ c opying bec ause there was no “substantial similarity” between the Red Bird Mark (drawing) and the Angry Bite Mark (drawing). Whilst I agree that a c ase for c opyright infringement has not been made out, this is bec ause the Opponent has not been able to make out a c ase that the Applic ant had c opied a substantial part of the Red Bird Mark. Whilst the Applic ant’s designer was inspired and did use the theme of anger or angry c harac ters, this is not something that is prohibited by the c opyright in the Red Bird Mark (drawing). The Red Bird Mark (drawing) is a simple c artoon drawing. The c olour theme was red. Unlike _Spectravest, where many aspects of a key feature (boots) were taken (as well as colour), I am unable to conclude that the Applicant’s designer has taken sufficient details of any key features of the Red Bird Mark such as to amount to substantial copying. Whilst the Red Bird Mark and the Angry Bite Mark depict characters with angry eyes and accented eyebrows, the details and colours are different. The beak element also has not been taken_. 

252    _I turn now to consider the Fancy Word Mark, which appears to have been the subject matter of a copyright registration in China. What is depicted here are the words “ANGRY BIRDS” in a heavily stylised form, different from the plain font used in the Angry Birds Word Mark. I am of the view that a ny claim for copyright infringement on the basis of the Fancy Word Mark will fail. The visual appearance and stylization used by the Applicant in the Angry Bite Mark is quite different. The words “ANGRY BITE” (as opposed to “ANGRY BIRDS”) are depicted in outline block letters. The stylization and detailing used in each work also differs significantly. I therefore find that the Fancy Word Mark has not been substantially copied by the Applicant in its Angry Bite Mark._ 

253    For the above reasons, the objec tion on the ground of s 8(7)(b) of the TMA fails. 

**Conclusion** 

254    In c onc lusion, I affirm the PAR’s c onc lusions on s 8(2)(b), s 8(4)(b)(i) read with s 8(4)(a), s 8(7)(a) and s 8(7)(b) of the TMA, and dismiss the appeal in full.
