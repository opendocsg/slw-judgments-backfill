**Introduction** 

1       The plaintiff (“Shohel”) c laimed damages for personal injuries suffered as a result of the negligenc e of the defendants, whilst performing work at a worksite on 21 September 2014 at the instruc tions of the first defendant, Chen Yongbiao (“Chen”), a direc tor of the sec ond defendant, Dongwu Steel Industry Pte Ltd (“Dongwu Steel”). The defendants denied that Shohel was employed by them on that day or that he was instruc ted to perform any work. I granted interloc utory judgment for Shohel to the extent of 80% of the damages, with damages to be assessed. The defendants have appealed and I provide my detailed grounds of dec ision. 

**Plaintiff’s case** 

2       Shohel, a Bangladesh c itizen, was a foreign worker who was at the material time engaged by SPG Marine Pte Ltd (“SPG Marine”) under a work permit. He lived in a dormitory and had a room-mate c alled Sujan, who was also employed by SPG Marine and whom he knew during the time they worked 

for SPG Marine. [note: 1] On 20 September 2014, Sujan informed Shohel that he had previously done some work for Chen and asked Shohel whether he was interested to do the same. Sujan also informed Shohel that he would be paid $60 for a day’s work, but did not give him any further details about the 

job. [note: 2] Sinc e the next day was his day off, [note: 3] Shohel agreed. 

3       In the morning of Sunday, 21 September 2014, Shohel followed Sujan to Joo Koon MRT station. 


There, Chen pic ked them up and drove them to a worksite at 30 Tuas Road (“the worksite”), at whic h Dongwu Steel operated. Upon arrival, Chen instruc ted them on their work, namely to shift some metal 

plates from inside the worksite to outside the worksite. [note: 4] Shohel did not talk to Chen direc tly as his English was poor. However, he was informed by Sujan that he would be paid $60 per day (for 

eight hours) and overtime. [note: 5] Whilst c arrying a large metal plate with Sujan, Shohel stepped and 

fell into a “large hole”. [note: 6] Chen was not present when the ac c ident happened. Shohel was then brought to Westpoint Hospital and was transferred to National University Hospital (“NUH”) on the same day. 

4       Contrary to Chen’s testimony, Shohel stated that upon his arrival at the worksite, Chen did not 

ask Shohel or Sujan to sign any Visitor Applic ation Form (“VA Form”) [note: 7] or to remain at the guardhouse to wait for their VA Forms to be proc essed. Shohel stated that whilst he was hospitalised at NUH, Chen gave him two forms to sign whic h appeared to be the VA Form and a form titled 

“Ac c ident Statement” [note: 8] (c ollec tively, the “two forms”). Shohel simply signed the two forms as 

he did not understand them and did not know how to read English. [note: 9] The two forms were not 

filled in when he signed them [note: 10] , and were never read or translated to him. For the Ac c ident Statement in partic ular, c ontrary to Chen’s allegations, Shohel stated that Chen did not ask him any 

questions before Chen filled it in. [note: 11] These two forms will be disc ussed further below. 

**Defendants’ case** 

5       The defendants’ c ase was narrated by Chen. Dongwu Steel is a c ompany in the business of supplying grating and other metals. Chen explained that where the sc ope of Dongwu Steel’s c ontrac ted works inc luded the installation of suc h materials, this would be subc ontrac ted to another c ompany. At the material time, Dongwu Steel operated as a sub-sub-c ontrac tor at the worksite for the supply and installation of drain grating and c hequered plate c overs (“the c ontrac ted works”). 

6       As Dongwu Steel was short of labour for the c ontrac ted works, Chen arranged to meet Sujan, whom he understood to be a labour supplier, for a job interview with a view to engaging Sujan’s c ompany to supply workers to Dongwu Steel. Chen thus arranged to meet Sujan to bring him to the worksite for the job interview. When Chen arrived at Joo Koon MRT station on 21 September 2014 to pic k Sujan up, Sujan introduc ed Shohel to him. Chen did not expec t to see Shohel as he was there to 

meet Sujan only. Chen c laimed that that was the first time he had ever met Sujan [note: 12] and Shohel. 

7       Chen left Sujan and Shohel at the guardhouse of the worksite and proc eeded to park his c ar before returning to the guardhouse to meet them. At that time, there was no guard at the guardhouse. Chen then filled in a VA Form eac h for Sujan and Shohel. He obtained the partic ulars required for the filling in of the VA Forms from their work permits. This was the first time Chen saw Sujan and Shohel’s work permits. Chen then informed Sujan that both he and Shohel had to sign the VA Forms, whic h they did. He also instruc ted them to wait at the guardhouse for their VA Forms to be proc essed by the guard (who was not there at that time) and went to attend to some pressing matters. Throughout the entire time, Chen only spoke to Sujan and did not speak to Shohel at all. 

8       About one hour later, Chen rec eived a c all from Sujan informing him that Shohel had “fallen into a hole”, whic h, ac c ording to Chen, was the basement of the substation building situated inside the worksite. Chen stated that Sujan and Shohel had entered the building without his knowledge or c onsent. Chen then brought Shohel to Westpoint Hospital. 


9       Chen c laimed that Sujan and Shohel kept and did not return the VA Forms to Chen on 21 September 2014. Chen only retrieved Shohel’s VA Form from Shohel at the hospital about a week later. Chen c ould not retrieve Sujan’s VA Form from Sujan despite having c ontac ted him. Chen rec koned that Sujan was refusing to return his c alls and was avoiding him as Sujan had borrowed money from Chen after Shohel’s ac c ident. 

10     As for the Ac c ident Statement, Chen stated that on the morning of 1 Oc tober 2014, he visited Shohel in hospital and c onfirmed three matters with him. First, that Chen did not know Shohel prior to the ac c ident. Sec ond, that it was Sujan who brought Shohel to the worksite on 21 September 2014, 

and third, that it was Sujan who instruc ted Shohel to move the metal plate. [note: 13] Chen then went bac k to his offic e and typed out the c ontents of the Ac c ident Statement and returned the same afternoon to the hospital. He then read the Ac c ident Statement to Shohel word for word, and told to him that he needed this statement in order to make the insuranc e c laim. Shohel signed the Ac c ident Statement in Chen’s presenc e. 

**My decision** 

11     Although Shohel’s pleaded c ase was premised on various c auses of ac tion, namely negligenc e and breac h of duty by an employer, oc c upiers’ liability, and breac h of statutory duty under the Workplac e Safety and Health Ac t (Cap 354A, 2009 Rev Ed), in c losing submissions, the parties proc eeded only on the first. The trial was also bifurc ated; I therefore only had to make findings on the issue of liability. 

**_Whether Shohel was engaged by defendants to perform work on 21 September 2014_** 

12     It was not disputed that Shohel was at the material time an employee of SPG Marine and that on 21 September 2014, Chen brought Shohel and Sujan to the worksite at whic h Dongwu Steel was 

operating as a sub-sub-c ontrac tor. [note: 14] It was also not disputed that Shohel and Sujan were c arrying a metal plate when Shohel fell into a “hole”. The question, however, was whether Chen had instruc ted Shohel to c arry the metal plate and had therefore engaged Shohel to work for the defendants. The defenc e c ounsel put to Shohel that it was Sujan who had instruc ted him to c arry the metal plate. In my view, and for reasons whic h I will explain, this did not mean that Chen did not also instruc t Shohel, through Sujan, to perform work on that day at the worksite. If so, the defendants would have engaged or employed Shohel on that day, albeit without a valid work permit. 

13     I begin with Chen’s meeting with Sujan. I note that Sujan was not c alled as a witness and c ould not therefore provide evidenc e pertaining to this meeting. Chen c laimed that he did not know Sujan or Shohel and had never met them before. I disbelieved Chen that he met Sujan for the first time only on 21 September 2014. Chen c laimed that when he pic ked Sujan and Shohel from Joo Koon MRT station 

on that day, he did not verify their identities. [note: 15] Even if I ac c epted Chen’s submission that he c ould not stop his vehic le for long when he was pic king Sujan and Shohel up from the MRT station, one would have thought that he would have, at the very least, done a quic k verific ation before letting two strangers into his c ar and driving them to the worksite. The handphone messages that 

Chen produc ed [note: 16] were neutral – they did not establish that Sujan met Chen for the first time on 21 September 2014. 

14     Chen stated that he knew Sujan and Shohel were work permit holders when he was purportedly filling in the VA Forms at the guardhouse. However, he c laimed that he merely had a “glanc e” at their 

work permits and did not pay “spec ial attention” to or “memorise” the partic ulars therein. [note: 17] He did not verify whether they were employed by someone else at that time, although his intention was 


to interview Sujan for work or for the supply of manpower. One would have thought that if Chen was indeed looking for manpower, it would have been important for him to verify the employment status of Sujan and Shohel, who were work permit holders. Chen’s evidenc e at trial was that he had c hec ked the expiry date of their work permits as this indic ated whether they were working legally in Singapore. [note: 18] 

15     From the above, I c ould not but infer that Chen must have known Sujan prior to 21 September 

2014\. This explained why Chen did not bother to verify Sujan’s identity when he first met him at the MRT station or verify his employment status subsequently. This is leaving aside the issue of the time and c irc umstanc es under whic h the VA Forms were filled in, to whic h I will turn later (at [19]). 

16     I ac c epted Shohel’s testimony that Chen had instruc ted him and Sujan to perform work at the worksite, and that it was Sujan who c onveyed to Shohel Chen’s instruc tions as Shohel did not understand English. Chen’s position was also that he spoke only to Sujan as he c ould not c ommunic ate with Shohel. The defendants’ c ase was that Sujan and Shohel were never instruc ted by Chen to c arry out any works whatsoever, but that they were merely at the worksite for a job interview. If so, there would have been no reason for Sujan to have, on his own volition, instruc ted Shohel to c arry metal plates. There would also have been no reason for the both of them to voluntarily c arry the heavy metal plates espec ially if Chen’s story was to be believed, namely that he had told them to wait at the guardhouse and had not informed them of their pay, let alone the type of work to be performed. 

17     Shohel stated in c ross-examination that he was instruc ted by Chen to c arry some metal plates from the inside to the outside of the worksite, whereas his statement of c laim stated that he was 

instruc ted to c arry the metal plates from the outside to the inside of the worksite [note: 19] This did not materially affec t his testimony. I ac c epted that he c ould not rec all whic h way round it was 

bec ause this inc ident happened approximately two years ago. [note: 20] The fac t remained that Shohel was c arrying a metal plate when the ac c ident happened. 

18     Further, although the statement of c laim was inac c urate in so far as it pleaded that Chen was Shohel’s lawful employer under the work permit, this was not fatal to Shohel’s c ase. Shohel’s pleadings made it suffic iently c lear that he was alleging that he had performed work under Chen’s instruc tions. The objec t of pleadings is to enable both parties to c ome to c ourt prepared to answer what the other side alleged suc h that neither party is taken by surprise ( _Rajendran a/l Palany v DrilQuip Asia Pacific Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2001] 1 SLR(R) 887</span> at [19]; _Cheng William v Allister Lim & Thrumurgan and another and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2015] 3 SLR 201</span> at [16]). The defendants were not taken by surprise as to the c rux of Shohel’s c laim. 

19     I turn then to the VA Forms and Ac c ident Statement. The c irc umstanc es under whic h the two forms were signed were important. If Shohel and Sujan’s VA Forms were signed at the guardhouse, it would lend support to the defendants’ c ase that Shohel and Sujan were merely there for an interview and Chen had left them at the guardhouse (without instruc tions to do any work) for the VA Forms to be proc essed. If the VA Form was signed by Shohel when Shohel was hospitalised, it would lend support to Shohel’s version of the events. 

20     Chen c laimed that he made Shohel sign the VA Form at the guardhouse on 21 September 2014, after Chen filled it in with all the relevant partic ulars. Chen also c laimed that Shohel and Sujan kept their respec tive VA Forms and Chen was only able to retrieve the VA Form from Shohel after he was hospitalised. On balanc e, I preferred Shohel’s testimony that he did not sign the VA Form at the guardhouse that day, but only signed it whilst in hospital. I also ac c epted Shohel’s evidenc e that at 


that time, the VA Form was not filled. 

21     If Chen had filled in the VA Form for Shohel and Sujan at the guardhouse based on the partic ulars on their work permits, it was highly doubtful that Chen would not notic e that Shohel was already employed by someone else (even if Chen did not “pay spec ial attention” to or “memorise” the partic ulars of the work permit as he c laimed) or that Shohel’s oc c upation was that of a “marine trades worker”. Chen’s evidenc e was that he had c hec ked the expiry date of Sujan and Shohel’s work 

permits as this would indic ate whether they were working legally in Singapore. [note: 21] If so, Chen was c learly aware of the law governing the employment of foreign workers in Singapore, namely that a foreign worker must have a valid work permit to work for a _specified_ employer. Henc e, it would have been logic al for Chen to ask them why they were seeking a job interview, or alternatively, to send them away sinc e they were already work permit holders engaged by another employer. Instead, Chen proc eeded (as he later admitted in c ross-examination) to show them a plan of the installation works and even asked Sujan to give him a quotation for the supply of manpower (see [25] below). Chen’s explanation that he did not send Shohel or Sujan away bec ause he thought that Shohel was one of Sujan’s men, that they were there merely for an interview, and that they c ould have been workers from a labour c ompany who would subsequently rec ommend the job to their bosses, was 

unc onvinc ing. [note: 22] I found that Chen did not send Sujan and Shohel away, even though he knew they were work permit holders engaged by another employer, bec ause he had intended to engage them to perform work that day. 

22     More pertinently, Chen’s c laim that he filled in all the partic ulars on Shohel’s VA Form before Shohel signed it, belies an important detail. The time of visit stated on the VA Form was “10.30 am – 11.30 am”, whic h was an hour’s duration. This c oinc ided with Chen’s evidenc e that Sujan informed him of Shohel’s fall about an hour after he dropped Sujan and Shohel off at the guardhouse. It also c oinc ided with his evidenc e in c ourt that after he had purportedly filled in the VA Forms at the guardhouse, he left Shohel and Sujan there for approximately 45 minutes before Sujan informed him 

about Shohel’s fall. [note: 23] At the time Chen purportedly filled in the VA Form (whic h was at the _beginning_ of Shohel’s arrival at the worksite), he c ould not have known the time the visit would end or how long the entire visit would last. I c ould not but infer that the VA Form was filled in after the event, bec ause by that time, it would have bec ome c lear how long Shohel had been at the worksite. I was unpersuaded by Chen’s explanation that the time stated in the VA Form was but a mere estimate [note: 24]. Chen’s evidenc e was that he had left Shohel and Sujan at the guardhouse bec ause he had 

to attend to pressing matters. If so, it was unlikely that Chen c ould have estimated, in advanc e, the length of their visit when he did not know how long it would take to proc ess the VA Form (bearing in the mind there was no guard at the guardhouse at that time). It was also unlikely that he would have provided suc h an estimate as he was rushing off to attend to other matters. Chen stated that he did even not know what time he would finish dealing with his urgent matters before he c ould interview Sujan. Chen also did not know how long the interview would last, partic ularly sinc e he c laimed that he 

was tied up and very busy [note: 25] with some other matters then. I was of the view that this small but important detail pertaining to the time of Shohel’s visit was overlooked by Chen in his attempt to prepare the VA Form after the ac c ident and to obtain Shohel’s signature at the hospital. 

23     As for the Ac c ident Statement, I onc e again preferred Shohel’s testimony to Chen’s. Chen c laimed that he read the c ontents of the Ac c ident Statement bac k to Shohel word for word, and that Shohel also read it before he signed it. I was very doubtful of this. Chen’s evidenc e was that he did not c ommunic ate at all with Shohel at the worksite on 21 September 2014 as Shohel did not 

understand English. [note: 26] Yet, in less than two weeks, on 1 Oc tober 2014, he was able to have a 

substantial c onversation, in English, with Shohel at the hospital. [note: 27] Ac c ording to Chen, at the 


hospital, Shohel related the ac c ident to Chen [note: 28] and was asked by Chen to c onfirm three matters (see [10] above) whic h Chen then inc luded in the Ac c ident Statement. Chen then returned to the hospital on the same day, read the Ac c ident Statement “word-for-word” to Shohel and asked him to sign it. Chen also c laimed to have informed Shohel that Sujan had gone missing and that without the Ac c ident Statement, Chen c ould not proc ess the insuranc e c laim. Chen c laimed that all 

these took plac e in English and that Shohel understood him. [note: 29] In my view, it was hardly believable that Chen would suddenly be able to c onverse with Shohel in English on 1 Oc tober 2014 when his evidenc e was that he did not speak to Shohel on 21 September 2014 bec ause Shohel c ould not understand him then. For these reasons, I found that Shohel did not c ommunic ate with Chen on 21 September 2014 bec ause of the language barrier and for the same reason, did not know the nature of the Ac c ident Statement whic h he signed whilst in hospital. In c ontrast to Chen’s testimony, Shohel was c onsistent in maintaining that he c ould not c ommunic ate with Chen. In my view, Chen’s c laim that Shohel understood him on 1 Oc tober 2014 was a lie that served to bolster his submission that the c ontents of the Ac c ident Statement were filled in, and that Shohel had understood the c ontents therein, before he signed it. 

24     Further, the c ontents of the Ac c ident Statement were inc onsistent with Chen’s initial testimony at trial. Chen initially testified that he left Shohel and Sujan at the guardhouse after he had filled in their VA Forms and did not speak to them about work. Ac c ording to Chen, the next time he saw Shohel was after the ac c ident. Yet the Ac c ident Statement, whic h was prepared by Chen, stated that Chen had provided Shohel and Sujan with a “drawing for study”, that Chen had showed them the “material for job trying”, and that Chen had wanted to know whether they were able to do the job. 

25     When this was pointed out in c ross-examination, Chen’s testimony took a drastic shift; he admitted that he had provided Sujan with a plan for the installation projec t for whic h Chen required manpower and pointed out to Shohel and Sujan the relevant materials ( _ie_ , the metal plates) at the 

worksite [note: 30]. Chen also admitted that he asked them to take a look at the site c ondition to see whether they c ould do the work and to give him a quotation for the manpower based on the site c ondition. This c learly c ontradic ted Chen’s earlier testimony that he never spoke to Shohel and Sujan about the work that he required. It was c lear that, based on Chen’s own admission, he had spoken to them, at least briefly, about the sc ope of intended work, but stopped short of admitting that he had instruc ted them to proc eed to work. 

26     Chen’s c onduc t was also inc onsistent with his explanation that that he had no intention to engage Sujan and Shohel on 21 September 2014 to work bec ause he “c ould tell that they c ouldn’t do 

the work” and he “didn’t have a good impression of them”. [note: 31] If so, it was puzzling that he would, as he admitted, proc eed to show Sujan a plan for the installation projec t and ask Sujan and Shohel to look at the worksite c ondition and to give him a quotation for the manpower. Further, if he truly did not intend to hire Sujan and Shohel, it is puzzling why he would ask them to wait at the 

guardhouse, for an indefinite period of time, whilst he attended to his urgent matters. [note: 32] 

27     Taking all the evidenc e together, inc luding Shohel’s explanation (whic h I ac c epted) that he was asked to sign the two forms, whic h were unfilled, at the hospital, I was of the view that Chen was trying to c onc eal the fac t he had engaged Shohel and Sujan on 21 September 2014 to perform work at the worksite. He did this by attempting to show that the only purpose of their visit at the worksite was for a job interview. I found that the two forms were but mere self-serving doc uments that Chen prepared on behalf of the defendants. 

28     Before me were also two loan agreements that Chen c laimed were signed by Sujan. Ac c ording 

to Chen, Dongwu Steel had, at Sujan’s behest, [note: 33] agreed to lend money to Sujan to disc harge 


Shohel’s hospital bills via these loan agreements. Ac c ording to the defendants, this did not go towards any admission of liability by Dongwu Steel. There was insuffic ient evidenc e for me to make a finding with respec t to the purpose of the loan agreements. Sinc e Sujan was not c alled as a witness, no evidenc e c ould be obtained from him regarding the purported loans. Nonetheless, in my view, it was unlikely that Sujan would have undertaken the responsibility of bearing Shohel’s hospital bills by asking Chen for a loan to disc harge the bills. There was no evidenc e that Shohel was Sujan’s employee. It was more likely that, if Dongwu Steel had extended the loans, it was in the hope that Shohel would not make any further c laims against Dongwu Steel. Whilst I make these observations, my findings with respec t to the defendants’ liability do not turn on them. 

29     Overall, I found Shohel to be an honest and reliable witness. Although he had diffic ulty expressing himself and had a poor understanding of English, I saw no reason to doubt his testimony. He was essentially doing some extra work on his day off, albeit illegally. I ac c epted that he was introduc ed to Chen by Sujan. It was inc onc eivable that Shohel would have gone to the worksite on his day off and started c arrying the heavy metal plates if he had not been instruc ted to do so, and if he had not been informed that he would be paid for his work. On the c ontrary, I found Chen to be an evasive and dishonest witness who, as explained above, provided inc onsistent evidenc e on key matters. 

**_Liability of the defendants and public policy_** 

30     My finding that Shohel was instruc ted by Chen to c arry the metal plates for Dongwu Steel’s installation works at the worksite meant that the defendants had engaged Shohel as their worker on 21 September 2014. At this junc ture, I deal briefly with the defendants’ submission that Sujan was not their agent and did not have their authority to engage Shohel to work for them. To my mind, this submission misses the point as the issue of agenc y did not surfac e in the present c ase. My finding that Shohel was instruc ted by Chen to c arry the metal plates meant that Chen had direc tly engaged Shohel to perform work for Dongwu Steel. In any c ase, the fac t that Sujan c onveyed Chen’s instruc tions to Shohel did not make Sujan the defendants’ agent. Sujan was but a mere translator nec essary for Chen to c onvey his instruc tions to Shohel due to the language barrier existing between them. 

31     The defendants further argued, in c losing submissions, that public polic y militated against imposing a duty of c are on the defendants as employers, as any c ontrac t of servic e entered into between the parties would have been c ontrary to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Ac t (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“EFMA”), whic h c learly prohibits moonlighting by foreign employees. Paragraph 1 of Part VI of the Fourth Sc hedule to the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012 (GN No S 569/2012) (the “Regulations”) expressly states that “foreign employee[s] shall work only for the employer spec ified and in the oc c upation and sec tor spec ified in the work permit”. A foreign worker who c hooses to moonlight in breac h of his work permit disregards the c onditions of his employment under the work permit. Therefore, finding that a duty of c are was owed by the 

defendants as employers to suc h foreign employees would be c ontrary to public polic y. [note: 34] 

32     I was c ognisant of the fac t that the defendants’ allegations of Shohel’s illegality and the issue of public polic y was not spec ific ally pleaded despite the fac t that O 18 r 8(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) requires a party to “plead spec ific ally any matter .... showing illegality”. Nonetheless, I was of the view that even if the defendants had pleaded the aforementioned matters (see above at [31]) in respec t of the Shohel’s illegality, public polic y would not negate a finding of a duty of c are. I rejec ted the defendants’ argument that Shohel’s breac h of paragraph 1 of Part VI of the Fourth Sc hedule to the Regulations negated a finding of a duty of c are owed by the defendants to Shohel. To my mind, this submission blatantly ignores the fac t that the defendants themselves had 


breac hed the law by employing a foreign worker without a valid work permit to work for them. 

33     In _Ooi Han Sun and another v Bee Hua Meng_ <span class="citation">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 922</span> (“ _Ooi Han Sun_ ”), the plaintiff, who was a Malaysian, was a passenger in his employer’s vehic le whic h was involved in a road ac c ident. He did not possess a work permit in Singapore at the time of the ac c ident. Yong Pung How CJ held at [15] that the maxim _ex turpi causa non oritur actio_ (no c ause of ac tion arises out of a base c ause) has “only very limited applic ation in tort” and that “the fac t that the plaintiff is involved in some wrongdoing does not itself provide the defendant with a good defenc e”. The only exc eptions would appear to be the limited range of c ases in whic h, on the fac ts of the c ase, an injury c an be held to have been direc tly inc urred in the c ourse of a c ommission of a c rime. Yong CJ added that this would be “in line with the public polic y in Singapore whic h is reflec ted in the Contributory Negligenc e and Personal Injuries Ac t (Cap 54, 1989 Rev Ed) under whic h a c laim will not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering the damage; and in the Workmen’s Compensation Ac t (Cap 354) whic h provides that a workman will not be prevented from suing for rec overy of c ompensation even under an illegal c ontrac t”. Although Yong CJ’s observations were made in respec t of _ex turpi causa_ as a defenc e, the princ iples pronounc ed remain relevant to the c ourt’s finding of a duty of c are in the tort of negligenc e bec ause the defenc e of illegality rests upon the foundation of public polic y (see _Hounga v Allen and another_ [2014] 1 WLR 2889 (“ _Hounga_ ”) at [42]). I note that the c ourts have, apart from treating _ex turpi causa_ as a defenc e, also examined the c onc ept as part of the _prima facie_ inquiry into a duty of c are or standard of c are in the tort of negligenc e (see Gary Chan Kok Yew, _The Law of Torts in Singapore_ (Ac ademy Publishing, 2nd ed, 2016) at para 08.010 and, for example, _Ashton v Turner and another_ [1981] 1 QB 137 at 146). 

34     The c ase of _Hounga_ is also instruc tive. In that c ase, the UK Supreme Court dealt with a c laim by a vic tim of unlawful disc rimination in relation to her dismissal under an employment c ontrac t, a statutory tort. The c laimant, however, ac hieved her entry into the UK through illegal means and therefore had no right to work in the UK. The c ourt held (at [40] and [45]) that the defenc e of illegality did not defeat her c laim bec ause her illegality “provided ... no more than the c ontext” for the first respondent’s disc riminatory ac ts, suc h that the c onnec tion between the alleged tort and the illegality was insuffic ient to bar the c laim. Lord Wilson examined what (if any) public polic y c onsiderations underlying the doc trine of illegality militated in favour of applying the defenc e to defeat the vic tim’s c laim. In partic ular, his Lordship c onsidered the importanc e of preserving the integrity of the legal system. He desc ribed as “fanc iful” the idea that an award of c ompensation to the vic tim would c ompromise the integrity of the legal system by appearing to enc ourage others to enter into illegal c ontrac ts of employment. Lord Wilson was of the view that the integrity of the legal system would be c ompromised if the vic tim’s c laim was not allowed bec ause “it might engender the belief that [employers] c ould even disc riminate against suc h employees with impunity” (at [44]). 

35     In the light of _Ooi Han Sun_ and _Hounga_ , I was of the view that public polic y and the preservation of the integrity of Singapore’s legal system would warrant the imposition of a duty of c are on the defendants. In the present c ase, Shohel’s illegality merely provided the c ontext for the defendants’ negligenc e and c annot be said to fall within the limited range of c ases in whic h an injury was direc tly inc urred in the c ourse of c ommitting a c rime. Finding that public polic y militated against the imposition of a duty of c are might engender a belief among employers that they c an disc riminate against suc h employees whom they c hoose to hire despite knowing that it is illegal (by, for example, providing them with little or no safety equipment). In my view, this would run c ounter to the polic y of the protec tion of these workers at the workplac e and may even enc ourage or embolden employers in employing foreign workers illegally, knowing that the employer would be absolved from any liability to c ompensate a worker who suffered injuries through the fault of the employer in the c ourse of that employment. 


36     Next, I ac c epted that Shohel did not exerc ise suffic ient c are to keep a proper lookout as he was walking at the worksite. This, however, did not defeat his c laim in the entirety. It was held in _Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1999] 3 SLR(R) 377</span> at [45], that the c ommon law duty of employers visà-vis employee is three-fold – to provide a c ompetent staff of men, adequate material, and a proper system and effec tive supervision. Likewise, in _Chandran a/l Subbiah v Dockers Marine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2010] 1 SLR 786</span> (“ _Chandran_ ”) at [15], it was held that the c ommon law required employers to take reasonable c are for the safety of their employees in all the c irc umstanc es of the matter. The defendants thus had a duty to provide Shohel with a safe plac e of work, adequate material, and effec tive supervision. Further, the c ourts have held that an employer remains responsible for the safety of his employees even if they were sent to work at a site c ontrolled by others (see _Chandran_ at [19]; _Sim Cheng Soon v BT Engineering Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 148</span> (“ _Sim Cheng Soon_ ”) at [29]). Therefore, the fac t that Dongwu Steel was merely a sub-sub-c ontrac tor at the worksite did not prec lude a finding that the defendants had breac hed their duty of c are. 

37     Henc e, I was satisfied that there was fault on the part of both Shohel and the defendants (see further below at [42] to [44]). The issue then bec ame one of determining the extent to whic h it was just and equitable to reduc e the damages whic h would otherwise be rec overable by the plaintiff (see _Sim Cheng Soon_ at [28]). 

**_Contributory negligence_** 

38     I was of the view that the defendants, as the parties with a greater degree of blameworthiness, should be made to bear a greater proportion of the liability for the personal injury c aused to Shohel. For reasons whic h I will explain, I apportioned liability at 80% to the defendants. It would be apposite, at this junc ture, for me to set out the c ases whic h I found instruc tive in determining the appropriate apportionment of liability between Shohel and the defendants. 

39     In _Sim Cheng Soon_ , the plaintiff was a welder who was working at the sec ond respondent’s shipyard when he fell through an unc overed and unfenc ed opening in the platform on whic h he had been working. The ac c ident took plac e in broad daylight and there was enough natural lighting for the plaintiff to see where he was going. The plaintiff had worked in shipyards in the past and had undergone safety c ourses at the shipyard. He also attended safety talks and meetings both generally and spec ific ally for the c onversion works to be done of the vessel. He was familiar with the layout of the plac e where he was working. The c ourt found that the plaintiff had not looked at where he was going and that that was the immediate c ause of the ac c ident. He was negligent in failing to observe the ordinary c are whic h an ordinary prudent person would have taken for his own safety. As blameworthiness was there and to a higher degree than that of the defendants as employer and oc c upier of the site respec tively, the plaintiff’s liability was apportioned at 60%. Henc e, the plaintiff was only entitled to 40% of the damages. 

40     In _Xu Ren Li v Nakano Singapore (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2012] 1 SLR 729</span>, the plaintiff c onstruc tion worker was using a stairc ase in an unc ompleted building at the c onstruc tion site when he lost his balanc e on one of the steps and fell against a wall and landed on his buttoc ks. The plaintiff was aware that there was no lighting at the stairc ase and the stairc ase landings were only dimly lit. He was also aware the steps on the stairc ase were unfinished and uneven. Henc e, the c ourt found that he should have exerc ised c are when using the stairc ase. The c ourt also found that the plaintiff was rushing down the stairs, whic h signific antly inc reased the risk of the ac c ident happening and c ontributed to the degree of his injuries. However, bec ause it was diffic ult to determine whic h party was more at fault, liability was apportioned equally between the parties. Henc e, the plaintiff was only entitled to 50% of the damages. 


41     In _Manickam Sankar v Selvaraj Madhavan (trading as MKN Construction & Engineering) and another_ <span class="citation">[2012] SGHC 99</span>, the plaintiff fell as he plac ed his foot in a wrong plac e whilst c rossing a c atwalk. The c ourt found him c ontributorily negligent to the extent of one-third. The c ourt stated that the plaintiff c ould have taken more c are for his safety. He should not have taken the risk of c rossing when he did not know how to sec ure the safety harness, although the c ourt opined that this should not be c ounted as a very signific ant fac tor against the plaintiff given that he was a new worker. Further, the c ourt found that no steps were taken to ensure that all the workers knew how to hook their safety harness properly. In that c ase, the poor lighting made it diffic ult for the plaintiff to differentiate between the c atwalk and the c eiling panels. Although the plaintiff was paired with one Kannan who was a more experienc ed worker, the defendant did not c all Kannan as a witness to substantiate its assertion that Kannan had warned the plaintiff of the dangers and taught him to hook his safety harness or how to navigate the c atwalk. 

42     In the present c ase, I ac c epted that Shohel did not exerc ise suffic ient c are for his own safety by failing to keep a proper lookout, despite being fully aware that he was working at a c onstruc tion site. I noted that Shohel was also performing the task in daylight. However, there was no evidenc e given as to the desc ription or the exac t size of the “hole” into whic h Shohel fell. What was c lear, however, was that the “hole” had to be of a suffic ient size for a person to fall into and that Shohel would have notic ed it if he had kept a proper lookout. 

43     Nevertheless, this must be balanc ed against the fac t that Shohel was sent off to work immediately at a worksite with whic h he was unfamiliar. He was not given any opportunity to familiarise himself with his surroundings or given any safety briefing or instruc tions on how to perform his task. He was not supervised or provided with any safety equipment or gear. The metal plates were 

large (approximately 4 feet by 5 feet), heavy and quite diffic ult to c arry even by two persons. [note: 35] The size of the metal plate would, in all likelihood, have made it more diffic ult for Shohel to keep a 

proper lookout when he was walking. There was no evidenc e that Shohel was experienc ed in performing work of suc h nature or that he had gone for any c ourses relating to the type of work that he had performed at the worksite. In fac t, Shohel’s evidenc e, whic h I ac c epted, is that he had never 

performed this type of work before. [note: 36] Further, as he was not briefed on the surroundings of the worksite, he was most likely unaware of any openings in the ground, namely the “hole” or 

“basement”. [note: 37] There was also no evidenc e as to whether this “hole” or “basement” was properly barric aded, c overed, or sec ured, or whether any signs were plac ed nearby to warn persons of it. As I have explained above at [36], the fac t that Dongwu Steel was only a sub-sub-c ontrac tor at the worksite did not absolve it of its responsibility to maintain a safe workplac e for its workers. 

44     The defendant bears the onus of establishing c ontributory negligenc e on the part of the plaintiff (see _Ng Swee Eng (administrator of the estate of Tan Chee Wee, deceased) v Ang Oh Chuan_ <span class="citation">[2002] 2 SLR(R) 321</span> at [59]). Although Shohel had to keep a proper lookout and exerc ise suffic ient c are for his own safety, little evidenc e, if any, was proffered on the degree of his blameworthiness whic h c ontributed to the ac c ident, or what prec autions or steps were taken by the defendants to minimise the risk of suc h ac c idents at the worksite. What was borne out by the evidenc e was the defendants’ c omplete failure to take any steps to protec t Shohel’s safety at the worksite (see above at [43]). 

45     The apportionment of liability is more an exerc ise of disc retion than in c linic al sc ienc e ( _Cheong Ghim Fah and another v Murugian s/o Rangasamy_ <span class="citation">[2004] 1 SLR(R) 628</span> at [87]). As the Court of Appeal stated in _Asnah bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin_ <span class="citation">[2016] 2 SLR 944</span> at [118] (in the majority dec ision), “it has been said that a finding of apportionment is a finding upon a question, ‘not of princ iple or of positive findings of fac t or law, but of proportion, of balanc e and relative emphasis and of weighing different c onsiderations’” (c iting _British Fame (Owners) v MacGregor (Owners)_ [1943] AC 


197    at 201). The c ourt also observed that the apportionment exerc ise should be applied in a “rough and ready” manner, for the fac tors that the c ourt is required to c onsider are “inc apable of prec ise measurement” and are often “inc ommensurable”. Two c onsiderations emphasised by the Court of Appeal were the relative c ausative potenc y of the parties’ c onduc t and the relative moral blameworthiness of their c onduc t. 

46     Taking into c onsideration all the c irc umstanc es of the present c ase, I was of the view that a greater degree of blameworthiness should be attributed to the defendants and that Shohel was c ontributorily negligent to the extent of 20%. I therefore found that the defendants were to bear 80% of the liability for the ac c ident, on a joint and several basis. 

**_Costs_** 

47     I also awarded c osts of the ac tion to Shohel, with c osts of the assessment of damages to be reserved to the c ourt c onduc ting the assessment. As with _Sim Cheng Soon_ , I exerc ised my disc retion to award the c osts of the ac tion entirely to Shohel as he was the suc c essful party despite the apportionment of liability. Shohel’s c laim was not defeated by a finding of some fault on his part. In keeping with the c osts guidelines as set out in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Prac tic e Direc tions, from whic h I saw no reason to depart, I awarded Shohel c osts fixed at $30,000 (for approximately two days of hearing inc luding the time taken to render my oral dec ision), with disbursements to be agreed between the parties.
