## HEADNOTES 

### Civil Procedure 

_- Failure of the appellants to apply to judge for further arguments within seven days of interlocutory_ 

### order in chambers – Motion brought to Court of Appeal for an extension of time to request for 

### further arguments – Whether an extension should be granted – Whether Court of Appeal has 

### jurisdiction to grant the extension of time – Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) s 34(1)(c) 

### Facts 

### This was a motion by Denko-HLB Sdn Bhd (‘Denko’) to the Court of Appeal in respect of two matters: 

### (i) an extension of the time prescribed by s 34(1)(c) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (‘SCJA’) 

### to apply for further arguments to the judge in chambers in relation to an interlocutory order made by 

### that judge; and (ii) an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal against the interlocutory 

### order. 

### Denko was the defendant in an action brought by Fagerdala Singapore Pte Ltd (‘Fagerdala’) for 

### money due on goods sold. Denko applied to have the action stayed on the ground of forum non 

### conveniens. The Senior Assistant Registrar (‘SAR’) ordered a stay. On 19 February 2002, Lai Siu Chiu 

### J , sitting in chambers, allowed the appeal and reversed the order of the SAR. The decision of 19 

### February 2002 was an interlocutory order and under s 34(1)(c), if Denko wished to appeal, it must 

### first apply for further arguments to the judge within seven days of the order. Under O 56 r 2 of the 

### Rules of Court, the party can only file his notice of appeal if the judge certified that he did not wish 

### to hear further arguments or if the judge failed to notify the party of his intention within 14 days and 

### is thereby deemed not to require further arguments. 

### On 12 March 2002, Denko’s solicitor applied for further arguments and on 19 March 2002, Denko 

### filed the notice of appeal. The Registrar of the Supreme Court notified Denko the next day that their 

### request for further arguments was out of time and that the notice of appeal was therefore not valid. 

### Denko thus applied to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to request for further arguments. 

### Fagerdala contended, inter alia , that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to grant an extension of 

### time to enable Denko to request the judge in chambers to hear further arguments, as no such 

### jurisdiction or power was conferred upon it by either s 34(1)(c) or any other provisions in the SCJA, or 

### any other written law. By virtue of s 18 and paragraph of the First Schedule to the SCJA, the High 

### Court is given the power to enlarge or abridge time prescribed by any written law for doing an action 


### or taking any proceeding, and the Court of Appeal has all the powers and duties of the High Court by 

### virtue of s 37(2) of the SCJA. However, for s 37(2) to operate, there must first be a pending appeal 

### before the Court of Appeal and there was none here. 

### Held 

### , dismissing the motion: 

### (1) The Court of Appeal in The Tokai Maru <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 105</span> had drawn a distinction between an 

### application for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal and an application to extend time in 

### relation to other matters and had ruled that a less stringent approach should be adopted in relation to 

### the latter kind of application. Denko’s application was more akin to an application for an extension of 

### time to file an appeal, given that the objective of Denko’s application was to enable it to appeal 

### against the order on 19 February 2002. Therefore, a stricter approach should be followed in 

### determining whether an extension of time should be granted to Denko (see ¶ 9 and 10). 

### (2) There are four factors to consider in determining whether an extension of time should be granted 

### to file or serve a notice of appeal: the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, the merits of the 

### appeal and the question of the degree of prejudice (see ¶ 11). 

### (3) The delay was for some 14 days. Considering that the period allowed by s 34(1)(c) to apply for 

### further arguments is only 7 days, a delay of 14 days cannot be said to be relatively short. As for the 

### second factor, Denko, other than stating that it was simply an "oversight" on the part of the 

### solicitors, did not offer any other explanation with regard to the oversight. In respect of the merits in 

### the application for a stay on the ground of forum non conveniens , the application was not "hopeless", 

### since Denko’s application for a stay had succeeded before the SAR before it was reversed by Lai Siu 

### Chiu J on appeal. Fagerdala had not shown any real prejudice which could not be compensated by 

### costs, e.g., changed position pursuant to interlocutory order (see ¶ 12 – 17). 

### (4) The greatest obstacle in the way of Denko’s application was in relation to the first two factors. 

### Not only was the length of the delay quite substantial, there were no extenuating circumstances 

### offered for the "oversight" of the solicitor. Some explanation should have been offered to mitigate or 

### excuse the oversight. If, in every case, "oversight" is per se a satisfactory ground, there will be a risk 

### of turning the rules prescribing time into dead letters. It would be all too simple for a party to run to a 

### judge to ask for indulgence because of oversight (see ¶ 18). 

### (5) As for the jurisdictional point, the reference to s 37(2) was erroneous. The more appropriate 

### provision is s 29A(3)(a) of the SCJA. By virtue of s 18(2) read with paragraph 7 of the First Schedule 

### to the SCJA, the judge making the interlocutory order could have the power to grant an extension of 

### time to enable Denko to apply for further arguments out of time. The Court of Appeal would have the 

### powers which are conferred upon the High Court, at the hearing of the appeal or at the hearing of a 

### matter incidental to the appeal: s 29A(3)(a). However, Denko’s application for an extension of time to 

### apply for further arguments cannot be considered to be the "hearing of" an appeal or a matter 

### incidental to the hearing of an appeal, as there was, as yet, no appeal (see ¶ 24 – 28). 

### (6) The Court of Appeal does not have an original jurisdiction to entertain an application to extend 

### time prescribed in s 34(1)(c). If Parliament had intended that the Court of Appeal should have a 

### separate power to extend time prescribed in s 34(1)(c), it would have so provided as it did in relation 

### to the criminal jurisdiction of that Court: see ss 47(5) and 50 of the SCJA. In the present case, Denko 

### should have taken the following approach: it should have applied to the judge to extend time for it to 

### make the request for further arguments and if the extension application is refused by the judge, it can 

### then appeal to the Court of Appeal (see ¶ 29 – 32).

## Judgment: 

### GROUNDS OF DECISION 


1       This w as a motion by Denko-HLB Sdn Bhd (Denko), seeking the indulgence of the Court of Appeal in respect of tw o matters – 

 (i) an extension of the time prescribed in s 34(1)(c) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (SCJA) for a request to be made for further arguments to the judge in chambers in relation to an interlocutory order made by that judge. 

 (ii) an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal against the said interlocutory order. 

2       W e heard the motion on 21 May 2002 and dismissed it. W e now give our reasons as some points of practical significance w ere in issue. 

**The Facts** 

3       Denko w as the defendant in an action, Suit No. 1241/2001, brought by Fagerdala Singapore Pte Ltd (Fagerdala) for money due on goods sold. Denko applied to have the action stayed on the ground of _forum non conveniens_. The Senior Assistant Registrar (SAR) granted the application and ordered a stay. Fagerdala appealed against that order to the High Court. On 19 February 2002, Lai Siu Chiu J, sitting in chambers, allow ed the appeal and reversed the order of the SAR. The effect of this decision w as that there w ould be no stay of proceedings. 

4       It w as not in dispute that the decision of 19 February 2002 w as an interlocutory order and that under s 34(1)(c), if Denko w ished to appeal, it must first apply for further arguments to the judge w ithin seven days of the order. Pursuant to O 56 r 2, if the judge certified that he did not w ish to hear further arguments, or if he failed to notify the party of his intention w ithin 14 days, he w ould be deemed not to require further arguments and the party could proceed to file his notice of appeal. But if the judge should certify that he w ished to hear further arguments then the order already made w ould be suspended and the judge at the further hearing could make such order as he thought fit: see _Singapore Press Holdings v Brown Noel Trading_ <span class="citation">[1994] 3 SLR 151</span> and _Thomson Plaza Pte Ltd v The Liquidators of Yaohan Department Store Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2001] 3 SLR 248</span>. 

5       In the present case, the solicitor for Denko overlooked the requirement of s 34(1)(c) and did not apply for further arguments w ithin the prescribed time. On 11 March 2002 his client instructed him to appeal and only then did he realise that he had failed to comply w ith s 34(1)(c). So on 12 March 2002, Denko’s solicitor applied for further arguments. Fagerdala objected to the application by w ay of a letter dated 14 March 

2002\. On 19 March 2002, Denko filed the notice of appeal. The next day, the Registrar of the Supreme Court notified Denko that their request for further arguments w as out of time and not valid and that the notice of appeal filed by Denko the day before w as also not valid. 

6       These w ere the factual matrix upon w hich Denko moved the court for the tw o reliefs prayed for. 

7       Finally, w e should add that in the parties’ submissions before us, besides seeking to persuade us to grant, or to refuse to grant, an extension of time, in terms of the motion, Fagerdala had also raised a jurisdictional point. How ever, w e think it w ould be more expedient if w e first deal w ith the substantive application in the motion. 

**Extension of time** 

8       This Court has in numerous cases in the past set out the factors w hich should guide the court in determining w hether to grant an extension of time to enable a party to file and/or to serve a notice of appeal out of time: e.g., _Pearson v Chen Chien Wen Edwin_ <span class="citation">[1991] 1 SLR 212</span>; _Nomura Regionalisation Venture_ 


_Fund Ltd v Ethical Investments Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2000] 4 SLR 46</span>; _Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Ltd v Fraser & Neave Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2001] 4 SLR 441</span>. Obviously, this application by Denko w as not strictly an application to extend time to file and serve a notice of appeal. It w as in relation to a step that w as needed to be taken before an appeal could be lodged. So the question is: should the factors w hich are applicable to an extension of time to file and/or serve a notice of appeal also apply here? 

9       In this regard, the decision of this Court in _The Tokai Maru_ <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 105</span> is germane. The dispute there concerned late filing of affidavits of evidence-in-chief. The appellants applied to obtain retrospective extension of time for the late filing. The judge below held that as there w as no material before the court w hich satisfactorily explained the delay, he refused to give any extension and instead granted the respondent’s application to have the appellants’ defence struck out. On appeal, this Court ruled that a distinction should be draw n betw een an application for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal and an application to extend time in relation to other matters and that a less stringent approach should be adopted in relation to the latter kind of application. The Court declared the applicable principles to be as follow s (at 113-4):

 "The rules of civil procedure guide the courts and litigants tow ards the just resolution of the case and should of course be adhered to. Nonetheless, a litigant should not be deprived of his opportunity to dispute the plaintiff’s claim and have a determination of the issues on the merits as a punishment for a breach of these rules unless the other party has been made to suffer prejudice w hich cannot be compensated for by an appropriate order as to costs. 

 Save in special cases or exceptional circumstances, it can rarely be appropriate then, on an overall assessment of w hat justice requires, to deny a defendant an extension of time w here the denial w ould have the effect of depriving him of his defence because of a procedural default w hich, even if unjustified, has caused the plaintiff no prejudice for w hich he cannot be compensated by an aw ard of costs." 

10     W hile Denko’s application w as not an application for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal, neither w as it an application to extend time in relation to a matter of the nature as in _The Tokai Maru._ But the objective of Denko’s application w as to enable Denko to appeal against the order made on 19 February 

2002\. It w ould appear that there is no previous case w hich addressed this very point. As w e see it, Denko’s application w as more akin to an application for an extension of time to file appeal rather than to file affidavits of evidence-in-chief out of time as in _The Tokai Maru_. It w as a necessary step to filing an appeal. Therefore, a stricter approach should be follow ed in determining w hether an extension of time should be granted to Denko. It must be borne in mind that the very limited time frame prescribed in s 34(1)(c) is to ensure that an interlocutory order made by a judge in chambers w ill obtain finality quickly so that the trial of the action w ill take place soonest practicable and not be bogged dow n by interlocutory squabbles. The trial of the action should not be delayed. 

11     There are four factors w hich this Court have consistently declared to be pertinent in determining w hether an extension of time should be granted to file or serve a notice of appeal: the length of the delay; the reason for the delay; the merits of the appeal; and the question of the degree of prejudice. W e w ill consider these factors in turn. 

**Length of delay** 

12     The delayed application to request for further arguments w as made on 12 March 2002 w hen Denko should have made it on 26 February 2002, a delay of some 14 days. Considering that the period allow ed by s 34(1)(c) to apply for further arguments is only 7 days, a delay of 14 days cannot be said to be relatively short. 


**Reason for delay** 

13     As for the second factor, there w as only a one line cryptic explanation for the delay: "oversight on (solicitors) and there w as no fault on the part of (Denko)." W e had in _Nomura Regionalisation_ review ed the authorities w here mistake or oversight on the part of the solicitor w as the cause of the delay in filing or serving the notice of appeal out of time. At the conclusion of the review , w e made the follow ing pronouncement (at 54-55):

 "We agreed ... that there is no absolute rule of law w hich prescribes that an error on the part of a solicitor or his staff can never, under any circumstances, be a sufficient ground to grant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal. Having said that, w e do not think it is possible to lay dow n any hard and fast rules as to the circumstances under w hich a mistake or error on the part of the solicitor or his staff w ould be held to be sufficient to persuade the court to show sympathy to the application. It is the overall picture that emerges to the court that w ould be determinative. How ever, a mistake, even bona fide , is only one factor in the overall consideration. Such a mistake per se may not be sufficient to enable the court to exercise its discretion in favour of an extension. As illustrations, and no more, w e note that tw o aspects w hich seem to have considerable bearing in the court’s consideration in Gatti v Shoosmiths and Palata Investment v Burt & Sinfield to grant extension w ere (i) the fact that in each of those tw o cases, notice w ithin the prescribed time w as given to the other side that an appeal w ould be taken and (ii) the mistake w as understandable and not gross. But this is not to say that only w here such a notice w as given that a blunder by the solicitor or his staff w ould be view ed sympathetically. There could w ell be other circumstances.." 

14     W e noted that in the affidavits filed in support, Denko, other than stating that it w as simply an "oversight" on the part of the solicitors, did not offer any other explanation w ith regard to the "oversight". Section 34(1)(c) w as enacted in 1993. It is a provision w hich has been in operation for some nine years and there is nothing in it w hich is complex or could give rise to a misunderstanding. Indeed, the substance of w hat is in s 34(1)(c) has been around for more than thirty years. In the 1970 Edition of Singapore Statutes, s 34(2) of the then SCJA (Cap 15) read: 

 "No appeal shall lie from an interlocutory order made by a Judge in chambers unless the Judge has certified, after application, w ithin four days after the making of such order by any party for further argument in court, that he requires no further argument, or unless leave is obtained from the Court of Appeal or from the Judge w ho heard the application." 

**Merits of application** 

15     W ith regard to the third factor, the merits, it must mean, in relation to this case, the merits in Denko’s application for a stay on the ground of _forum non-conveniens._ There w as a clear connection betw een the judge w ishing to hear further arguments and the merits of the application for a stay. The threshold to be satisfied on this factor w as not high. It w as not necessary for Denko to show that the application w as likely to succeed. All that w as necessary to be show n w as that the application for a stay w as not "hopeless". W e noted that before the SAR, Denko’s application for a stay w as granted. It w as on appeal that Lai Siu Chiu J reversed this order. W e really could not say that the application for a stay w as "hopeless" and thus, as far as the third factor w as concerned, w e w ould say that it w as satisfied. 

**Question of prejudice** 

16     Turning to the fourth factor, the degree of prejudice, tw o points w ere raised by Fagerdala: (i) if an extension w as granted, it w ould mean further delay in the substantive action coming on for hearing before the court; and (ii) a director of Denko, Dato Ahmed Anuar bin Mohamed, had informed Mr Paul Yeo, the 


Managing Director of Fagerdala, that Denko w ere in the process of completing the sale of their assets and/or the business w as in the process of being acquired by a third party. If this w ere true, the enforcement of any eventual judgment w hich Fagerdala w ould obtain against Denko w ould be frustrated. This allegation w as, how ever, denied by Dato Ahmad Anuar and Fagerdala w as not able to produce any concrete evidence to substantiate its assertion. 

17     W e accept that if an appeal w ere eventually filed it w ould, of course, lead to some delay. But that w ould be the effect of almost every appeal. Fagerdala had not show n any real prejudice w hich could not be compensated by costs, e.g., changed position pursuant to interlocutory order. Thus, it seemed to us that prejudice w as not show n. 

**Our overall assessment** 

18     As w e view ed it, the greatest obstacle in the w ay of Denko’s application w as in relation to the first tw o factors. Not only w as the length of the delay quite substantial (bearing in mind the prescribed period of time w ithin w hich a party must apply to the judge for further arguments w as only 7 days), there w ere no extenuating circumstances offered for the "oversight’ of the solicitor. Some explanation should have been offered to mitigate or excuse the oversight. If, in every case, "oversight" is _per se_ a satisfactory ground, w e run the risk of turning the rules prescribing time into dead letters. It w ould be observed in breach. It w ould be all too simple for a party to run to a judge to ask for indulgence because of oversight. The need for finality must be borne in mind. 

19     W e have earlier referred to the fact that s 34(1)(c) has been in the statute book since 1993. Furthermore, a similar, though not identical provision, w as in the SCJA long before that. In all recent cases w here this Court exercised its discretion to extend time, there w ere extenuating circumstances in relation to the solicitor’s mistakes or oversight, e.g., _Nomura Regionalisation; Aberdeen Asset Management; Tan Chiang Brother’s Marble (S) Pte Ltd v Permasteelista Pacific Holdings Ltd_ [2002]. Tw o English cases, w hich are enlightening, had also adopted a similar approach: _Gatti v Shoosmith_ [1939] 3 All ER 916 and _Palata Investments Ltd v Burt & Sinfield Ltd_ [1985] 2 All ER 517. 

20     In summary, there must be circumstances w hich w ould persuade the court to exercise its discretion in favour of the applicant. It w ould not be sufficient for an applicant to merely say, my solicitor forgot about the w hole matter. This aspect w as w hat w as lacking in Denko’s application. 

21     In passing, w e must emphasise that the decision w hich Denko w ould like to have reversed is not one relating to the substantive claim in the action. It only decided that there w ould be no stay because Denko had failed to satisfy the judge that Malaysia w as the more appropriate forum. All it meant w as that the action proper w ould be heard here in Singapore. 

**Jurisdictional issue** 

22     W e now turn to the jurisdictional point. Fagerdala contended that this Court had no jurisdiction to grant an extension of time to enable Denko to request the judge-in-chambers to hear further arguments. Its reasoning ran as follow s. This Court is a creature of the SCJA and its jurisdiction must, of necessity, be as circumscribed in that Act. Its civil jurisdiction consists of appeals from any judgment or order of the High Court, subject to the SCJA or any other w ritten law regulating the terms and conditions upon w hich the appeals may be brought. Since Denko failed to comply w ith s 34(1)(c), the decision of 19 February had become non-appealable. 

23     Denko averred that this Court had no jurisdiction or pow er to extend time to enable that decision to be rendered appealable, as no such jurisdiction or pow er w as conferred upon this Court by either s 34(1)(c) 


or any other provisions in the SCJA, or any other w ritten law. By virtue of s 18 and ¶7 of the First Schedule of the SCJA, the High Court is given the pow er to enlarge or abridge time prescribed by any w ritten law for doing an act or taking any proceeding, w hether the application is made before or after the expiration of the time prescribed. Section 37(2) of SCJA also provides that the Court of Appeal "shall have all the pow ers and duties ... of the High Court." But for s 37(2) to operate there must first be a pending appeal before the Court of Appeal. And there w as none here. 

**Analysis** 

24     W e w ould at the outset state that the reference made by Denko to s 37(2) is erroneous. This subsection touches on the pow ers of the Court of Appeal at the hearing of an appeal and it specifically mentions that the Court of Appeal "shall have all the pow ers and duties, as to amendment or otherw ise of the High Court" and it goes on to say the Court has full discretionary pow er to receive further evidence. It does not relate to the pow er of the court, w hether the High Court or the Court of Appeal, to grant an extension of time. If at all, it seems to us that the more appropriate provision is s 29A(3)(a), w hich is set out later in ¶27. 

25     It is clear, pursuant to s 34(1)(c), that in relation to an interlocutory order made by a judge in chambers, unless the application for further arguments is made w ithin 7 days by the party w ho w ishes to have the order reversed or varied, no appeal may be brought against that order. Section 18(2) provides that the High Court shall have the pow ers set out in the First Schedule to the SCJA and ¶7 thereof reads as follow s:

 "Pow er to enlarge or abridge the time prescribed by any w ritten law for doing any act or taking any proceeding, w hether the application therefor is made before or after the expiration of the time prescribed, but the provision shall be w ithout prejudice to any w ritten law relating to limitation." 

26     By virtue of ¶7 of the First Schedule, the judge making the order could have the pow er to grant an extension of time to enable Denko to apply for further arguments out of time. Of course, in the present case Denko did not apply to the judge for an extension of time but had instead merely requested for further arguments. This w as rightly rejected by the Registrar, Supreme Court, as being a request made out of time and w as invalid. 

27     So the question is, has the Court of Appeal the jurisdiction to entertain an application in terms of the motion herein. Tw o provisions in the SCJA are pertinent, s 29A(1) and (3), and they read:

 (1) The civil jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal shall consist of appeals from any judgment or order of the High Court in any civil cause or matter w hether made in the exercise of its original or of its appellate jurisdiction ... 

 (3) For the purposes of and incidental to – 

 (a) the hearing and determination of any appeal to the Court of Appeal; and 

 (b) the amendment, execution and enforcement of any judgment or order made on such an appeal. 

 the Court of Appeal shall have all the authority and jurisdiction of the court or tribunal from w hich the appeal w as brought. 

28     It seems to us clear that the civil jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is to hear appeals from the High 


Court. It also seems to us that the effect of s 29A(3) is that the Court of Appeal w ill only have the pow ers of the High Court, w here there is in existence an appeal. It is only at the hearing of the appeal, or at the hearing of a matter incidental to the appeal, that the Court of Appeal w ould have the pow ers w hich are conferred upon the High Court. Denko’s application for an extension of time to apply for further arguments can, under no stretch of the imagination, be considered to be the "hearing of" of an appeal or a matter incidental to the hearing of an appeal. There w as, as yet, no appeal. 

29     If Parliament had intended that the Court of Appeal should have a separate pow er to extend the time prescribed in s 34(1)(c), it w ould have so provided as it did in relation to the criminal jurisdiction of that Court: see ss 47(5) and 50. 

30     There may be a temptation to compare this application by Denko w ith an application for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal, w hich this Court often receives. Tw o factors differentiate the latter application from the former. First, the time limit to file a notice of appeal is not prescribed in the SCJA, but in the Rules of Court (the Rules). Second, the Rules specifically gives a pow er to the High Court as w ell as this Court to extend the time prescribed under the Rules: Order 3 r 4 and Order 57 r 17. Quite apart from the question w hether the Rules may modify w hat is laid dow n in s 34(1)(c), the Rules do not confer such a pow er or jurisdiction upon the Court of Appeal to enlarge the time prescribed by that provision. 

31     But that is not to say that the same application may not come before the Court of Appeal by the more normal route. As w e have mentioned, a dissatisfied party, w ho is out of time, may apply to the judge to extend time (extension application) for that party to make the request for further arguments (s 18(2) read w ith ¶7 of the First Schedule). If the extension application is refused by the judge, that party can then appeal to the Court of Appeal. That should have been the approach w hich Denko should have taken. This appears to have been the approach adopted in _Seabridge Transport Pte Ltd v Olivine Electronics Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1995] 3 SLR 545</span> but w ith one difference. Instead of making the extension application direct to the judge, the appellant made it to the Assistant Registrar and having failed to obtain an extension from the Assistant Registrar, the appellant did not pursue it further. So there w as really no cause for this Court in that case to consider this procedural point. Similarly, there w as also no cause for this Court in that case to express any view w hether it had a separate jurisdiction to entertain an application to extend time prescribed in s 34(1) (c), other than by w ay of an appeal from a refusal to extend time by the court below. 

32     For the reasons w e have indicated, it is our opinion that this Court does not have an original jurisdiction to entertain an application to extend time prescribed in s 34(1)(c). Thus, the motion filed by Denko w as not in order.
