**Tan Lee Meng J:** 

1       The plaintiff, Mr Chiam Toon Hong (“Chiam”), sought a dec laration that his c ontrac t dated 2 April 2002 to sell his five per c ent share of 145 Killiney Road to the defendant, Mr Ong Soo Yong (“Ong”), had been resc inded. He also sought an order that the c aveat lodged against the said property by Ong on 5 April 2002 be removed. Ong asserted that Chiam’s applic ation should be dismissed as it was the latter who delayed the c ompletion of the sale and purc hase of the property. 

**Background** 

2       The property known as 145 Killiney Road (“the Killiney property”) is owned by Chiam and several other tenants-in-c ommon. Eac h tenant-in-c ommon has a separate c ertific ate of title for his or her respec tive share of the property. 

3       A rent-c ontrolled building stands on the Killiney property. It houses a hotel. Some of the c oowners of the Killiney property are in the partnership that runs the hotel. In 1996, two c o-owners who had a 40% share of the Killiney property instituted Originating Summons No 582 of 1996 to obtain an order that the property be sold. By an order of c ourt dated 21 August 2002 and varied on 18 September 1996 (“the Order of Court”), Kan Ting Chiu J direc ted that the Killiney property be sold by public tender with or without vac ant possession at a reserve pric e to be determined by the c ourt. In view of the frac tious relationship between the parties, Kan J required all the c o-owners to exec ute all doc uments nec essary for the sale of the property, failing whic h the Registrar of the Supreme Court should exec ute any suc h doc ument or doc uments on behalf of any defaulting party. 

4       The Killiney property was put up for sale by tender, but the c ontemplated sale did not materialise bec ause the partnership that ran the hotel demanded $21m as c ompensation for vac ating the premises. An applic ation in 1997 to c ompel the surrender of the premises to the owners did not suc c eed. To date, the Killiney property has not been sold. 

5       On 2 April 2002, Chiam entered into an agreement to sell his share of the Killiney property to Ong without revealing to the latter that he was required by the Order of Court to ac t in unison with his c o-owners to effec t a sale of the property by public tender. The sale to Ong was subjec t to the 


Law Soc iety of Singapore’s Conditions of Sale 1999 and the c ompletion date was 2 June 2002. 

6       Both Chiam and Ong were represented by the same solic itor, Mr Ang Gek Peng (“Ang”) of M/s Ang Jeffrey & Partners, and Ong paid Chiam a deposit of $20,000. What ought to be noted at this junc ture is that one Mr Yap Pow Fook (“Yap”) was instrumental in arranging the sale of Chiam’s share of the Killiney property to Ong and that Ong agreed to pay him a c ommission of two per c ent of the purc hase pric e, whic h amounted to $4,000, bec ause the vendor, Chiam, did not want to pay the c ommission that vendors usually pay to estate agents. For unexplained reasons, Yap bec ame one of Chiam’s two representatives in his dealings with Ang and Ong regarding the Killiney property. Chiam’s other representative was his brother-in-law, Mr Oh Chin Hoc k (“Oh”). 

7       After the sale and purc hase agreement was signed, Ang disc overed that the Killiney property was affec ted by the Order of Court. On 17 May 2002, he wrote to the Singapore Land Authority as follows: 

 Our c lient has entered into an agreement to purc hase from Chiam Toon Hong his 1/20 share of the [Killiney property]. We note that in the Certific ate of Title issued to Chiam Toon Hong, the entry for Order of Court is “Nil”. However, our searc h revealed that an Order of Court dated 21 August 1996 relating to the property was registered on 18 Oc tober 1996 in Volume 2740 No 143. In this regard, we shall be grateful if you c ould c larify. 

8       On 24 May 2002, the Singapore Land Authority replied as follows: 

 The Order of Court ... was omitted ... on the abovementioned qualified Certific ate and on the other Certific ates of Title issued for the lot. 

 We thank you for bringing this to our attention and apologise for the inc onvenienc e c aused in the matter. 

 Meanwhile, please arrange to forward us the Certific ate of Title Vol 560 Fol 176 in exc hange for the amended one. 

9       On 24 May 2002, Ang met Chiam’s representatives, Oh and Yap, for disc ussions. What transpired at this meeting was disputed by the parties. Ac c ording to Chiam, who did not attend the meeting, Ang told Oh and Yap that Ong was no longer interested in buying the property bec ause of the Order of Court. However, Ang denied that he said these words and Ong denied ever indic ating to Ang that he had sec ond thoughts about the purc hase of Chiam’s share of the Killiney property. Whatever may have transpired at the meeting on 24 May 2002, it was c ommon ground that on that day Ang handed Yap a letter to be delivered to Chiam. In the letter, Ang stated as follows: 

 Our title searc h revealed that an Order of Court dated 21 August 1996 relating to the property was registered on 18 Oc tober 1996 in Volume 2740 No 143. It would appear from the order that you are not allowed to sell your share individually. As suc h, we would suggest that you appoint another solic itor to ac t for you and have the Order resc inded. 

10     On 28 May 2002, Ang wrote to Chiam to ask whether or not the latter wanted the c ertific ate of title to be forwarded to the Singapore Land Authority in exc hange for an amended c ertific ate of title. Chiam did not respond to Ang’s letter. Neither did he take any ac tion to resc ind or vary the Order of Court. He also made no effort at that time to return the $20,000 deposit to Ong. 

11     Although the date fixed for c ompletion was 2 June 2002, nothing was done by either party 


until April of the following year. It is pertinent to note that until the end of April or the beginning of May 2003, both parties were apparently still represented by Ang, who did not write a single letter to Chiam or Ong after the date fixed for c ompletion, namely 2 June 2002, had passed. 

12     Chiam, who had not returned Ong his $20,000 deposit, c laimed to have saved up enough money by April 2003 to refund the deposit. Chiam’s representatives, Oh and Yap, met Ong on 21 April 

2003\. What was disc ussed at this meeting was disputed. However, it was c ommon ground that the issue of the Order of Court was raised and that the talks broke down bec ause Chiam refused to bear the legal c osts for varying the Order of Court while the latter insisted that it was not his responsibility to have the Order of Court varied. 

13     On 24 April 2003, Chiam instruc ted another law firm, M/s Koh Ong & Partners (“KOP”), to take over his file from Ang. In the meantime, Ong also appointed another firm of solic itors, M/s T M Hoon & Co (“TMH”), to represent him. On 9 May 2003, TMH wrote to KOP to propose that Chiam apply for a variation of the Order of Court so that he c ould sell his interest separately from the other tenants-inc ommon. It was further proposed that the c ompletion date be one month from the date Chiam sorted out the problem of the Order of Court. On the same day, KOP replied to put on rec ord that Ong had terminated the sale and purc hase agreement on 24 May 2002. KOP added that Chiam has raised enough money to refund Ong his deposit of $20,000 and would do so in due c ourse. TMH replied on 12 May 2003 and denied that Ong had aborted the transac tion. On 20 May 2003, KOP sent a c heque for the $20,000 deposit to TMH, who promptly returned the c heque. 

14     On 22 May 2003, KOP again sent a c heque for the $20,000 deposit to TMH and reiterated that the sale and purc hase agreement for Chiam’s share of the Killiney property had been resc inded. On 27 May 2003, TMH returned the c heque and warned that if Chiam failed to obtain the permission of the c ourt to sell his share of the Killiney property to Ong within ten days, legal proc eedings would be instituted to seek the nec essary relief. 

15     On 30 May 2003, KOP informed TMH that Chiam remained ready, able and willing to return Ong’s deposit and demanded that Ong withdraw his c aveat on the property by 7 June 2002. On the very same day, KOP served on Ong a notic e under c l 5 of the Law Soc iety of Singapore’s Conditions of Sale 1999 that the sale and purc hase would be annulled in ten days. On 5 June 2003, TMH objec ted to the notic e to annul the sale and purc hase agreement and returned the c heque for the $20,000 deposit. TMH also stated that Ong was now willing to bear the c ost of an applic ation to the c ourt for approval of the sale and that Chiam was required to sign the nec essary papers in relation to the applic ation. Chiam did not ac c ept Ong’s offer to pay for the c ost of an applic ation to vary the Order of Court. 

16     In due c ourse, Chiam filed this originating summons for a dec laration that the sale and purc hase agreement between him and Ong for his share of the Killiney property had been resc inded and for an order that the c aveat lodged by Ong against his property on 5 April 2002 be removed. 

**Whether the contract was terminated in May 2002** 

17     Chiam’s assertion that the sale and purc hase agreement was orally terminated by Ong on 22 May 2002 at a meeting between his representatives, Oh and Yap, and his lawyer, Ang, who also ac ted for Ong in the transac tion, will first be c onsidered. At the outset, it should be noted that where a c ontrac t is required to be evidenc ed in writing, the disc harge of suc h a c ontrac t need not be in writing. This is c lear from _Morris v Baron & Co_ [1918] AC 1, where the House of Lords held that an oral c ontrac t to disc harge a c ontrac t for the sale of c loth, whic h was then required to be evidenc ed in writing, was binding. 


18     Chiam’s assertion that the c ontrac t was orally disc harged on 24 May 2002 when Ang met Oh and Yap is untenable for a number of reasons. Ang c ategoric ally denied that he had told Oh or Yap that Ong was no longer interested in buying a share of the said property. In any c ase, Ong c ould not unilaterally pull out of the c ontrac t and Ang rightly pointed out in a letter to Chiam dated 23 May 2003 that if Ong wanted to abort the transac tion, he would have sought Chiam’s c onsent for the disc harge of the c ontrac t. The unc hallenged evidenc e is that Chiam was not asked whether he agreed to the termination of the c ontrac t. 

19     Sec ondly, if Ong wanted to terminate the agreement on the ground that it was not possible for him to purc hase the Killiney property without a variation of the Order of Court, he would have asked for a refund of his $20,000 deposit. Chiam took the rather strange position that as he had already spent the money, he would return the deposit only when he had saved up enough money to do so. His evidenc e as to whether Ong knew about his unusual arrangement was not very satisfac tory. When c ross-examined as to what his representative, Oh, told him about the meeting with Ang on 24 May 2002, Chiam did not refer to this arrangement at all. He said as follows: 

 Q What did Oh say? 

 A He told me that there were problems with the c ertific ate of title and the transac tion c ould not go through. 

 Q Was that all? 

 A Yes. 

[emphasis added] 

20     When further c ross-examined, Chiam c hanged his evidenc e and said that Oh mentioned his financ ial problems to Ang. However, his answers did not make sense as he said as follows: 

 Q I put it to you that Oh did not mention anything about the refund of the deposit of $20,000 to the defendant [at the meeting on 24 May 2002]. 

 A I asked Oh. He said that he asked Jeffrey Ang about this but Ang kept quiet. 

 Q Was it on the evening of 24 May 2002 [when Oh was telling you about his meeting with Ang] that you told Oh that you had problems refunding the deposit to the defendant? 

 A Yes. 

 Q Not before that date? 

 A That is right. 

 [emphasis added] 

21     As Chiam c laimed that he told Oh about his financ ial problems only on the evening of 24 May 2002 and not earlier, Oh c ould not have told Ang earlier on in the day during their meeting that Chiam c ould not refund the deposit immediately bec ause he was short of c ash. 

22     Thirdly, Yap said in para 11 of his affidavit as follows: 


 .... We were unhappy therefore that the ball was being thrown bac k into our c ourt in that [Chiam] was being asked to engage another lawyer to solve the problem of the Order of Court. 

23     If Ong was not interested in the property any more, there would have been no reason for Yap to say that the ball was thrown bac k in Chiam’s c ourt. Yap and Oh were obviously unhappy bec ause Chiam had to do something to c omplete the transac tion with Ong. 

24     Chiam’s c ounsel submitted that as Ong did not c all Ang as a witness, an adverse inferenc e should be drawn. It should be borne in mind that both parties to this originating summons were quite happy to have the issues determined on the basis of affidavit evidenc e. When I asked c ounsel who they would like to question bec ause there were disputed fac ts, no one suggested c alling Ang. Had Chiam’s c ounsel indic ated that he would like to question Ang, the latter would have been asked to appear at the hearing. In any c ase, Ang’s letter to Chiam dated 28 May 2002 and his response to the affidavits of Chiam, Oh and Yap were exhibited in Chiam’s affidavit. In these c irc umstanc es, the question of an adverse inferenc e does not arise. 

25     After listening to the witnesses and evaluating their testimony, I prefer Ong’s version of events to that offered by Chiam, Oh and Yap. I thus hold that Ong did not terminate the c ontrac t for the sale and purc hase of Chiam’s share of the Killiney property on 24 May 2002. 

**Clause 5 of the Law Society of Singapore’s Conditions of Sale 1999** 

26     Chiam next asserted that the c ontrac t for the sale and purc hase of his share of the Killiney property was annulled by his solic itor’s notic e under c l 5 of the Law Soc iety of Singapore’s Conditions of Sale 1999 (“c l 5”), whic h provides as follows: 

 5.1 Where the Vendor is: 

 (a) unable, or 

 (b) unwilling, bec ause of diffic ulty, delay or expense or for other reasonable c ause, 

 to remove or to c omply with any objec tion or requisition of the Purc haser as to title, c ontrac t, sale plan and these Conditions, the Vendor has the right to annul the sale, notwithstanding any previous negotiation or litigation. 

 5.2 The Vendor must give the Purc haser not less than 10 days’ written notic e to annul the sale. 

27     Chiam c ontended that he was entitled to serve a notic e of annulment under c l 5 bec ause Ong had no right to insist on a variation of the Order of Court before the c ompletion of the sale and purc hase of his share of the Killiney property. 

28     The c irc umstanc es under whic h c l 5 may be relied on by a vendor were c onsidered by the Court of Appeal in _Chay Chong Hwa v Seah Mary_ [1984–1985] SLR 183, whic h was upheld on appeal to the Privy Counc il in [1986] SLR 48_._ L P Thean J, as he then was, who delivered the judgment of the c ourt, emphasised at 190, [16] that “c ondition 5 does not c onfer on the vendor a wide and unfettered right to annul the c ontrac t”. He added at 189–190, [12] and [16] as follows: 

 It is obviously a c ondition for the benefit of a vendor giving him a right in c ertain c irc umstanc es to resc ind the c ontrac t whic h has been validly made. Suc h a c ondition is undoubtedly of a very 


 drastic nature, and understandably the c ourts in exerc ise of their equitable jurisdic tion have evolved c ertain princ iples qualifying suc h right of the vendor.... 

 In determining whether a vendor c an avail himself of suc h a c ondition the c ourt will look c losely at the c onduc t of the parties to the c ontrac t. In partic ular, in relation to the matter objec ted to or required by the purc haser to be c omplied with, the vendor must not have been guilty of ‘rec klessness’ in entering into the c ontrac t, and unwillingness on the part of the vendor to meet the objec tion or c omply with the requirement raised by the purc haser must not in the c irc umstanc es be unreasonable. A vendor c annot in relianc e on suc h c ondition arbitrarily, c apric iously or unreasonably resc ind the c ontrac t, and c ertainly he c annot do so ac ting in bad faith. 

29     Chiam’s c ounsel relied on _Foo Ah Kim v Koo Chen Lim_ <span class="citation">[1995] 3 SLR 207</span>. In that c ase, the appellant purc haser entered into an agreement on 11 June 1993 to purc hase 125 Joo Chiat Road for $890,000 with “vac ant possession on c ompletion”. The c ontrac t, whic h was subjec t to the Law Soc iety of Singapore’s Conditions of Sale 1981, provided that if any enc roac hment was found to exist on the property, the purc haser would be entitled to resc ind the property. A survey of the property revealed that a wooden store straddled the rear of the property and the neighbouring property. Furthermore, the c ommon wall between 125 and 127 Joo Chiat Road was c ompletely within 127 Joo Chiat Road. On 4 August 1993, the purc haser’s solic itors informed the vendors’ solic itors that the purc haser required the vendors to give good title to the wooden shed that stood partly on 125 Joo Chiat Road and partly on the adjoining property, and the c ommon boundary wall that stood c ompletely on the adjoining property. The vendors agreed to have the wooden shed demolished but this did not satisfy the purc haser. Why she expec ted the vendor to give her good title to part of the adjoining property c ould not be fathomed. After the vendors’ solic itors served a notic e under c l 5 of the Law Soc iety of Singapore’s Conditions of Sale 1981 on 19 Oc tober 1993, the purc haser withdrew her demand regarding title to the wooden shed but she c ontinued to insist that she be given title to the c ommon wall. Karthigesu JA, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, pointed out that the vendors were plac ed in an impossible position. He added that the purc haser’s final demand that there be good title to the wall that stood on the adjoining land was merely a ploy to get a reduc tion in the purc hase pric e. In these c irc umstanc es, the c ourt ac c epted that the vendors were not ac ting arbitrarily, c apric iously or unreasonably when they invoked c l 5 to annul the c ontrac t for the sale and purc hase of the terrac e shophouse. 

30     The above-mentioned c ase is c learly distinguishable from the present c ase. When c onsidering whether or not Ong’s request for a variation of the Order of Court is unreasonable, it should be noted that Chiam’s former solic itor, Ang, advised him and Ong that the sale of the former’s share of the Killiney property c ould not be c ompleted unless the Order of Court was varied. All that Chiam was c onc erned about until he instruc ted KOP almost one year later was whether or not he had to pay the legal fees for the variation of the Order of Court. He asserted that he was not responsible for the legal fees bec ause Ong had agreed that he was to rec eive a net amount of $200,000 for the sale of his share of the Killiney property. As suc h, he c ontended that Ong should bear the c osts of varying the Order of Court. Suc h a term was not provided for in the c ontrac t of sale and purc hase and I do not believe that Ong agreed to suc h a term. 

31     In my view, it was not unreasonable for Ong to insist that the Order of Court be varied before the transac tion is c ompleted and espec ially so after he offered to pay the legal c osts in relation to an applic ation to vary the Order of Court, whic h was made bec ause of the frac tious relationship between the c o-owners of the Killiney property. Kan J had required all the c o-owners of that property, inc luding Chiam, to ac t in unison to sell the property by public tender and to distribute the proc eeds in the proportions spec ified in the Order of Court. It was obvious that no party to the Order of Court 


should ac t on his own to sell his share, for suc h a private sale of a share of the Killiney property c ould c omplic ate matters and delay c omplianc e with the Order. Even if Chiam took his duties to the c ourt lightly, a purc haser in Ong’s shoes, with notic e of the Order of Court, was entitled to be c autious enough to seek the approval of the c ourt for the sale and purc hase of a share of the Killiney property. Whatever may have been his earlier position, Ong finally offered to pay for the legal c osts involved in obtaining a variation of the Order of Court. As suc h, Chiam should have c o-operated with Ong by signing the requisite papers for the variation of the Order of Court. In these c irc umstanc es, Chiam’s refusal to c o-operate with Ong was unreasonable. It follows that he was not entitled to rely on c l 5 to annul the c ontrac t for the sale of his share of the Killiney property to Ong. 

**Whether the contract was abandoned by Ong** 

32     For the sake of c ompleteness, the question of abandonment will be briefly referred. This question arises only if there has been ac tual abandonment by both sides or where one side c reates a situation in whic h he is estopped from asserting, as against the other party, that he had not abandoned the c ontrac t: see _Paal Wilson & Co A/S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal_ [1983] AC 854. In the present c ase, there was no evidenc e that Ong led Chiam to believe that he had no further interest in the c ontrac t in question. Neither Chiam nor his witnesses raised the issue of abandonment in their affidavits and KOP spec ific ally relied on the termination of the c ontrac t by Ong on 24 May 2002 and on their notic e under c l 5 of the Law Soc iety of Singapore’s Conditions of Sale when they were ac ting on his behalf. As suc h, the issue of abandonment need not be disc ussed further. 

**Costs** 

33     As Chiam did not suc c eed in his applic ation, Ong is entitled to c osts.
