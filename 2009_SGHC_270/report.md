**Belinda Ang Saw Ean J:** 

1       The appeal and c ross-appeal in this c ase arose from the Assistant Registrar’s assessment of damages in relation to a c onsent judgment dated 27 November 2006. RA 152/2008 is the plaintiff’s appeal whic h is against part of the dec ision of the Assistant Registrar (“AR”) delivered on 28 January 2008 and 4 April 2008. RA 153/2008 is the defendants’ c ross-appeal against the whole of the AR’s dec ision. 

**Background** 

2       The plaintiff, Fish & Co Restaurants Pte Ltd (formerly know as O.B. Singapore Operations Pte Ltd), is the owner of a c hain of seafood restaurants c alled “Fish & Co”. The first defendant, MFM Restaurants Pte Ltd (“MFM”) is the owner of seafood restaurants in Singapore c alled “The Manhattan Fish Market”. The dispute relates to the first MFM restaurant whic h was opened on 20 May 2005 at Plaza Singapura. The sec ond defendant, Low Theng Yong Dic kson (“Dic kson”), was a former employee of the plaintiff. Until his resignation, Dic kson was the plaintiff’s operations manager. On 30 Marc h 2005, the plaintiff c ommenc ed Suit No 257 of 2004 (“Suit 257”) against Dic kson for taking, using and divulging c onfidential information represented by, _inter alia_ , the plaintiff’s guide to sec ret rec ipes, c ooking tips and methods inc luding kitc hen operations unique to Fish & Co in an apparent attempt to use the c onfidential information for the establishment of “The Manhattan Fish Market” restaurants in Malaysia. In breac h of the non-c ompetition obligation in his c ontrac t of employment, Dic kson set up and was ac tively running “The Manhattan Fish Market” c hain of restaurants in Malaysia. 

3       Suit 257 was eventually disc ontinued following a settlement of the dispute between the plaintiff and Dic kson. Notably, MFM and three Malaysian c ompanies agreed to be parties to the settlement even though they were not named as defendants in Suit 257. The terms of the settlement were rec orded in a Settlement Deed dated 27 April 2005 (“the Deed”). Relevant to the present c ase are four spec ific undertakings given by the defendants under c l 3 of the Deed: 


 (i) [The defendants] undertake not to use, in the Manhattan Fish Market Restaurants around the world, within a period of four (4) months from the date of this Deed, serving pans identic al and/or similar to those serving pans used in Fish & Co Restaurants. 

 (ii) [The defendants] undertake not to use any slogans and/or jingles identic al to or c onfusingly similar to that used by [Fish & Co] in any way whatsoever, inc luding but not limited to the use of suc h slogans/or jingles in their menus, websites, promotional materials and/or any other materials and/or doc uments in relation to the Manhattan Fish Market Restaurants. 

## ... 

 (iv) [The defendants] undertake not to use the words and/or phrases more partic ularly desc ribed in Sc hedule 3, in any c ombination whatsoever, whether on their own and/or in c ombination with any word(s) and/or phrase(s), in their menus, websites, promotional materials and/or any other materials and/or doc uments inc luding but not limited to those used for marketing and/or franc hising in relation to the Manhattan Fish Market Restaurants. PROVIDED ALWAYS that [the plaintiff ] shall not have exc lusive rights to use the individual words “garlic ”, “lemon”, “butter and/or “sauc e”. 

 (v) [The defendants] undertake, within a period of three (3) months from this Deed, to use a c ompletely different garlic lemon butter sauc e, sauc e used in the dish known as “Garlic Lemon Mussels”, c reamy garlic lemon sauc e, garlic lemon sauc e, garlic butter sauc e and lemon butter sauc e (c ollec tively known as “the MFM Sauc es”) in any or all their dishes in the Manhattan Fish Market Restaurants, or in any manner whatsoever, from the Garlic Lemon Butter Sauc e and Lemon Butter Sauc e used in Fish & Co Restaurants (“the O.B. Sauc es”). The differenc e between the MFM Sauc es and the O.B. Sauc es shall be in relation to the taste and ingredients used. 

4       Some five months after the Deed was signed, the plaintiff on 20 September 2005 filed Suit 670 of 2005 (“Suit 670”) against MFM as first defendant and Dic kson as sec ond defendant for breac h of c l 3 of the Deed. The plaintiff alleged that its sales c ontinued to be affec ted by MFM’s deliberate and c alc ulated breac h of the c l 3 undertakings. On the first day of trial, 27 November 2006, MFM and Dic kson c onsented to (a) judgment on liability; (b) an injunc tion order similar to the undertakings in c l 3 (i),(ii),(iv) & (v) of the Deed; and (c ) an order for damages to be assessed. 

**AR’s decision** 

5       At the assessment stage, the plaintiff put forward two heads of c laim for damages: 

 (a) Loss of profits during the breac h period from August 2005 to January 2007 (“breac h period”); and 

 (b) Loss of profits from February 2007 onwards (“post breac h loss”). 

6       The AR awarded the plaintiff damages totalling $72,688 for both heads of damages together with interest thereon at the rate of 3% per annum from the date of c ommenc ement of Suit 670 ( _ie_ , 20 September 2005) to the date of judgment ( _ie_ , 4 April 2008) and c osts on an indemnity basis. 

7       In arriving at his dec ision, the AR rejec ted the report of the defendant’s expert, Mr Sajjad 


Ahmad Akhtar, a c hartered ac c ountant. The AR found his reasoning “simplistic ” and his method of c omparison of the performanc e of the outlet to be “faulty”. Explaining his c ritic isms of the report, the AR said: 

 For example, in the table generated by Mr Akhtar in page 43 of his Affidavit of Evidenc e-inChief, he sought to c hart performanc e by simply c harting whether there was a rise in sales or a fall in sales. Suc h a method, in my view, fails to take into ac c ount quantitatively the amount of rise or the fall. I also found his method of c omparison of performanc e of the outlet by referenc e to month-on-month performanc e, even during the breach period , faulty. As a basis for c omparison, it appears obvious to me that analysis using data from the prebreac h period would yield a more ac c urate result. 

8       In addition, the AR found Mr Akhtar to be not an objec tive expert as he had in his testimony strayed into areas outside his field of expertise. The AR observed: 

 Lastly, I regret to add that the Defendant’s expert appears to have gone [out] on a limb of his own in passing judgments on areas whic h, by his own admission, he was not an expert on. By this, I am referring to his opinions on the effec ts of the use of serving pans, slogans, etc on c ustomers. 

9       The plaintiff’s expert, Mr Tony Samuel, is a forensic ac c ountant from Australia. Mr Samuel had worked out two alternative bases Method A and Method B – to asc ertain the loss suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the defendants’ breac h of the undertakings (see [12]-[13] below). Whilst agreeing with the plaintiff that Method A was the c orrec t method to asc ertain the loss of profits, the AR nonetheless c hanged the original parameters of Method A. The AR held that the Glass House outlet was the only affec ted restaurant and that the restaurants unaffec ted by the breac h to whic h a c omparison should be made with the Glass House outlet were the Fish & Co outlets loc ated at Bugis Junc tion, Centrepoint and Suntec City. For c onvenienc e, I shall in this judgment refer to the new parameters as “the AR’s parameters”. Based on Method A as modified by the AR’s parameters, the plaintiff was awarded damages based on a 60% loss in business profits for the breac h period from August 2005 to January 2007; and a further 12 months of loss of profits being post breac h damages from February 2007. The plaintiff had termed the post breac h damages as “springboard losses”. 

**The contentions** 

**_The plaintiff’s arguments_** 

10     Counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Tony Yeo, submits that the AR’s assessment was too low. The proportion of loss during the breac h period – August 2005 to January 2007 – whic h the AR found to be attributable to the defendants’ breac h, was determined at a figure of 60% based on Method A as modified by the AR’s parameters. In addition, the AR assessed the effec t of the breac h as likely to last for another 12 months from February 2007, and using the same perc entage figure of 60%, the AR awarded damages for post breac h loss. In assessing the plaintiff’s loss of profits, the proper approac h would be to use Mr Samuel’s Method A based on its original parameters (not the AR’s parameters) and then disc ount the resulting total profits by a perc entage to reflec t various legitimate imponderables not attributable to the breac h. Mr Yeo c ontends that the disc ount or allowanc e should not have been as muc h as 40% used by the AR. A fair and reasonable disc ount should be no more than 20%. In other words, the proportion of the plaintiff’s loss of profits attributable to the defendants’ breac h should be at least 80%. As for post breac h loss of profit, the plaintiff seeks the same proportion of 80% over a period of 18-24 months. 


11     Mr Yeo made a number of spec ific points in support of a higher award. First, in breac hing the four undertakings in the Deed, the defendants had c aused “c onfusion” and that “resulted in the plaintiff’s c ustomers going to the MFM outlet bec ause the c ustomers thought they were going to the plaintiff’s restaurant”. The c onfusion arose from the defendants exploiting the Fish & Co c onc ept whic h inc ludes, _inter alia_ , the use of slogans and/or jingles; use of selec ted phrases to desc ribe the plaintiff’s sauc es; use of either blac k or stainless steel pans to serve its seafood dishes; and the use of partic ular rec ipes for its sauc es. Sec ond, the intention of the undertakings in c l 3 (i),(ii),(iv) & (v) was to c reate some differentiation between the Fish & Co restaurants and those operated by MFM. Third, during the period of the breac h, the defendants gained an unfair “leg up” whic h allowed them to get into the seafood restaurant business from a more advantageous position. For instanc e, within three months (May 2005 to August 2005) of the opening to the Plaza Singapura outlet, MFM’s sales reac hed the average level of the Fish & Co restaurants. Fourth, the c onfusion in the public ’s mind, so the argument c ontinues, is a natural c onsequenc e of the blatant breac h of the four undertakings. In _Draper v Trist and Tristbestos Brake Linings Ltd_ [1939] 56 RPC 429 (“ _Draper v Trist_ ”), the plaintiff there was permitted to rec over substantial losses without the need to adduc e evidenc e of c onfusion. The c ourt ac c epted that it was impossible to adduc e c lear evidenc e to show what was in the public ’s mind, and as suc h the plaintiff was not required to adduc e evidenc e of c onfusion in the market. Mr Yeo maintains that the AR was right in adopting the same approac h in _Draper v Trist_. Finally, the plaintiff submits that the same measure of damages as in a passing-off ac tion applies on the fac ts to the plaintiff’s c ontrac tual c laim. Ac c ording to Mr Yeo the test is “what is the sum of money whic h would put the injured party in the position he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong.” 

12     At this junc ture, I interrupt the narration of the plaintiff’s arguments to briefly desc ribe Method A and Method B. In Method A, the approac h is based on the revenue that the plaintiff would have made but for the defendants’ breac h. In order to determine the loss in revenue, Mr Samuel identified the affec ted restaurant outlets in the c ity and the monthly sales of the affec ted outlets were c ompared with those of the unaffec ted outlets, whic h were essentially the suburban restaurants outlets of the plaintiff. From the monthly sales data for the pre-breac h period, Mr. Samuel was able to asc ertain that there was a fairly c onsistent parallel trend between the sales of the affec ted restaurants and those of the unaffec ted outlets resulting in a 15% sales differential between the two groups. However, the c orrelation in sales between the two groups disappeared from August 2005 onwards _ie_ , during the breac h period. Mr. Samuel then applied the 15% premium on the monthly sales of the unaffec ted outlets during the breac h period whic h is treated as the benc hmark to obtain projec ted monthly sales of the affec ted restaurants. The resulting projec ted monthly sales would be what the affec ted restaurants would have ac hieved had it not been for the defendants’ breac h. The loss in revenue was then derived by subtrac ting the ac tual monthly sales of the affec ted restaurants from the respec tive projec ted monthly sales. The lost profit for the affec ted restaurants was c omputed by deduc ting the various c ost c omponents, namely, the food c osts, other variable expenses and rent adjustments based on the plaintiff’s operating struc ture. Mr Samuel was unable to say how muc h of the fall was attributable to the defendants’ breac h. He duly presented to the c ourt in Table 1 of his report, a range of loss in five bands of 20% from 20% to 100% for the c ourt to determine the perc entage as appropriate (see paragraph 13 of his report under “Summary of My Conc lusions” – Method A, Table 1 titled “Proportion of Affec ted Restaurants’ revenue dec line attributable to breac h of Deed”). 

13     In Method B, Mr. Samuel sought to c ompute the plaintiff’s loss of profit utilising the first defendant’s sales based on the premise that part of the latter’s sales were as a result of the breac h. Using the first defendant’s total revenue during the breac h period as the base, Mr. Samuel provided a range of revenue in five bands of 10% from 10% to 50% and, as with Method A, he was unable to say how muc h of the revenue gained by MFM was attributable to the breac h of the Deed (see paragraph 14 under “Summary of My Conc lusions” – Method B, c onstruc ted Table 2 titled “Assumed share of 


MFM revenue attributable to breac h of Deed”). Similar to Method A, the lost profit was derived after deduc ting from the respec tive revenue band the c orresponding c ost c omponents of food c osts, other variable expenses and rent adjustments based on the plaintiff’s monthly ac c ounts. 

14     Returning to the plaintiff’s c ase, Mr Yeo urges me to follow the AR in rejec ting Mr Akhtar’s report whic h purportedly supported the defendants’ position that no damages should be awarded as the plaintiff did not suffer any loss. Mr Yeo points out that Mr Akhtar did not suggest any method of c alc ulation. The AR’s reasons for rejec ting Mr Akhtar’s evidenc e are found in [7] and [8] above. 

15     As between the two experts, the AR preferred Mr Samuel’s approac h and applied Method A as modified by the AR’s parameters to assess the plaintiff’s loss of profits. To rec ap, the AR’s parameters were: (a) the Glass House outlet was the only affec ted restaurant as opposed to the inc lusion of three additional c ity outlets loc ated within a radius of 1.6km of the MFM restaurant at Plaza Singapura. The three c ity outlets used by Mr Samuel for Method A were those loc ated at Centrepoint, Bugis Junc tion and Suntec City; and (b) the unaffec ted restaurants to whic h a c omparison should be made with the Glass House outlet, ac c ording to the AR, were the Fish & Co restaurants at Bugis Junc tion, Centrepoint and Suntec City. Mr Samuel had initially selec ted as the unaffec ted restaurants those suburban restaurants loc ated at Novena Square, Jurong Point, Tampines Mall and Parkway Parade. 

16     The plaintiff’s c ase is that the AR should have applied Method A with the original parameters unc hanged, and that he was wrong to have introduc ed a different set of parameters. Mr Samuel had not supported the applic ation of the AR’s parameters to Method A. The applic ation of the AR’s parameters to the Method A approac h threw up inc onsistent trends in revenue movement of the AR’s c hoic e of unaffec ted restaurants during the breac h period. Mr Samuel went on to explain that in using the AR’s parameters, the new c alc ulations showed that the Glass House outlet had made gains, rather than losses, and he c onc luded that the c alc ulations were illogic al. In c ontrast, Mr Akhtar’s c alc ulations applying the AR’s parameters to Method A c ontained flawed assumptions, and as suc h Mr Akhtar’s c alc ulations showed no c onsistent trend between the restaurants pic ked by the AR during the breac h period. 

17     At the fifth tranc he of the hearing on 18 February 2009, the plaintiff sought to amend RA 152/2008 to inc lude in the appeal Method B as its fallbac k method of asc ertaining the plaintiff’s loss of profits. The sec ond amendment was a prayer for indemnity c osts pursuant to c l 12 of the Deed. The defendants did not resist the amendments sought and they were allowed. Mr Yeo submits that if damages are to be assessed using Method B, the appropriate proportion of profit attributable to the breac h is 30% of Method B’s c alc ulation. For post breac h loss, the plaintiff seeks the same perc entage for a period of 18 months. 

**_The defendants’ arguments_** 

18     As indic ated, the defendants’ appeal is against the whole of the AR’s dec ision. Mr Daniel John and Mr Marc Wang appeared on behalf of the defendants. The submissions for RA 153/2008 were first advanc ed by Mr John. RA 152/2008 and the defendant’s reply to RA 153/2008 were argued by Mr Wang. In brief, the defendants’ c ase based on Mr Akthar’s evidenc e is that the plaintiff is entitled, at best, to only nominal damages, and bearing in mind the $50,000 Offer to Settle of 8 February 2007, the AR should have awarded c osts on the Subordinate Courts’ sc ale of c osts. Their alternative argument is that the perc entage figure of 60% dec ided by the AR should be reduc ed to 5-10%. 

19     Mr John’s submission upon the c ross-appeal was an attac k upon the princ iple of the AR’s assessment. He reminds the c ourt that the plaintiff’s c laim in Suit 670 was for breac h of c ontrac t and 


was not a c ase of passing-off. As suc h, the AR was wrong in allowing damages “akin to passing-off” in a c laim for breac h of c ontrac t. If the AR had evaluated the effec t of the defendants’ breac h of the four undertakings from a c ontrac tual point of view absent misrepresentation and dec eption, the c laim for loss of profit would have failed bec ause the plaintiff did not prove that the breac h c aused the partic ular loss and damage that was sought at the assessment hearing. This same point was reiterated by Mr Wang. 

20     On the plaintiff’s allegation of dec eption of the public by reason of the defendants’ breac h, the defendants’ c omplaint is that the plaintiff had misapplied _Draper v Trist_. Distinguishing _Draper v Trist_ , Mr John points out that some ac tual evidenc e of dec eption was led there whereas in the present c ase no suc h evidenc e was adduc ed and the requirement of c ausation was simply assumed, _ie_ , the breac h c aused the plaintiff’s loss in sales or c ustom. Mr John maintains that in passing-off c ases, c onfusion alone is not enough; it has to be shown that it was c aused by the defendants as opposed to indifferenc e on the part of the c onsumer. The plaintiff’s witnesses of fac t (Adine Loh Tsu Lyn, the plaintiff’s deputy c orporate direc tor and Joe Chiang Kok Kin, the plaintiff’s c hief financ ial offic er), Mr John maintains, had simply and boldly asserted that bec ause of the breac h, there had to be c onfusion and henc e loss suffered by the plaintiff. Moreover, it is a telling point that Mr Samuel’s report stated that he was asked to assume that the plaintiff suffered loss direc tly as a result of the defendants’ breac h. In adopting the _Draper v Trist_ approac h, Mr Yeo wrongly c onc luded that the burden was not on the plaintiff to prove that the defendants’ breac h c aused loss in sales. The plaintiff’s response, at the hearing, was that the c ourt c ould infer that c onfusion and misrepresentation in the market had resulted from the defendants’ intentional and deliberate breac h and that substantial damage was c aused to the plaintiff. 

21     In a press interview on 26 May 2006, the plaintiff’s managing direc tor, said that the plaintiff had experienc ed tough c ompetition in the F&B market generally from as early as 2004 and had taken a strategic dec ision to start c onc entrating in other brands and the overseas market. The defendants’ point there is that a signific ant proportion of the loss in sales c ould not be attributable to the defendants’ breac h. Apart from c ausation, the other issue raised by the defendants is that the post breac h damages fell within the sec ond rule of _Hadley v Baxendale_ (1854) 9 Exc h. 341 and evidentially, the plaintiff had not met the rule. 

**Discussions and decision** 

**_Damages akin to passing-off_** 

22     Although the plaintiff stated in its c losing submissions that the plaintiff’s c laim is for breac h of c ontrac t, and that Suit 670 was not a passing-off c ase, Mr Yeo spent time at the hearing urging the c ourt to infer on the balanc e of probabilities that the public was likely to be c onfused and dec eived by the defendants’ breac hes, and the resultant loss in sales to the plaintiff should also be inferred as was the c ase in _Ductline Pty Ltd v Arcric Investments Pty Ltd_ (1995) 32 IPR 419 (“ _Ductline_ ”). Mr Yeo made the point before the AR, and again on appeal, that it was not nec essary for the plaintiff to show that the public was ac tually dec eived and c onfused, and as suc h there was no need to adduc e independent evidenc e of that. He submits that unless a market surveyor stood outside the MFM restaurant at Plaza Singapura, it would be very diffic ult to c ollate any ac c urate and reliable evidenc e to show c onfusion in the public. Besides, the c osts of suc h a market survey would be disproportionate to the amount involved in the proc eedings. Ac c ording to Mr Yeo, the damages suffered were akin to damages suffered in a passing-off c ase _ie_ , c onfusion and misrepresentation in the market. Spec ific ally, the damages the plaintiff suffered were a result of lac k of differentiation in the market bec ause of the defendants’ refusal to c omply with the four undertakings in the Deed. Agreeing with Mr Yeo that it was not nec essary to show that the public was ac tually c onfused or dec eived as suc h 


an approac h would be seeking the impossible, the AR went on to adopt the approac h taken in _Draper v Trist_ whic h he paraphrased as requiring him to c onsider: 

 ... all the fac ts and c onsiderations on either side, to arrive at a proper sum to estimate the plaintiff’s damage in this c ase. In doing so, I took a c ommonsense approac h and exc luded what I c onsidered to be irrelevant or unproven fac tors. 

23     I agree with Mr John that the plaintiff had wrongly relied on _Draper v Trist_ , a passing-off c ase. In awarding c ompensation on princ iples analogous to those applic able in a passing-off c ase, the AR had, in my view, inadvertently c onflated different legal princ iples. Notably, a passing-off ac tion c an lie without proof of damage. This is an important distinc tion that must be borne in mind. It is for this reason that a plaintiff in a passing-off ac tion is not required to prove that the plaintiff has suffered damage as a result. Goddard LJ in _Draper v Trist_ explains (at 442): 

 But, in passing-off c ases, the true basis of the ac tion is that the passing-off by the defendant of his goods as the goods of the plaintiff injuries the right of property in the plaintiff, that right of property being his right to the goodwill of his business. The law assumes, or presumes, that, if the goodwill of a man’s business has been interfered with by the passing-off of goods, damage results therefrom. He need not wait to show that damage has resulted, he can bring his action as soon as he can prove the passing-off; because it is one of the class of cases in which the law presumes that the plaintiff has suffered damage. 

 [emphasis added] 

24     Obviously, if the plaintiff has evidenc e of damage, he is not barred from leading evidenc e of damage in a passing-off ac tion. This is c learly stated by Goddard LJ in the paragraph immediately following the passage quoted in [23] above: 

 If a trader is slandered in the way of his business, an action lies without proof of damage. That does not mean that the plaintiff c annot give evidenc e showing that he has suffered damage in fac t. The more he can show that he has suffered damage in fact, the larger the damages he can recover. The more the defendant can show that he has suffered no damage in fact, the less he will recover. 

 [emphasis added] 

25     Nominal damages, at the least, will be awarded, but the law does award something more than nominal damages if there is evidenc e of passing-off. Sir Wilfred Greene MR at 435 & 436 noted the position of an award of damages in a passing-off c ase: 


 ... a jury properly instruc ted, were entitled to award damages as for the violation of a right, and that at the least the plaintiff would be entitled to nominal damages as he would always be entitled to nominal damages on the violation of a right. 

 ... 

 The real problem is when all the facts are considered and all the considerations on either side are given fair weight, what is the proper sum at which to estimate the plaintiff’s damage? Now, that a jury would be entitled, if it were shown that goods were sold under a deceptive appearance or description, to award something more than nominal damages in my opinion is the law. 

 [emphasis added] 

26     From these pronounc ements, Mr Yeo’s relianc e on _Draper v Trist_ is misplac ed. It must be remembered that general damage other than that whic h is inferred or presumed requires to be proved. It c annot be disputed that the plaintiff must prove its c laim for damages sinc e this c ase for breac h of c ontrac t is _not_ one of those c ases where inferenc es of damage are presumed in law. 

27     In my view, the princ iples for assessing damages in breac h of c ontrac t c ases are no different from the princ iples for assessing damages in breac h of c onfidenc e c ases. There are apparently two measures of damages in a breac h of c onfidenc e c ase. One measure is the plaintiff’s loss – normally of profits – as a result of the defendant’s breac h of c onfidenc e (see _Cadbury Schweppes Inc v FBI Foods Ltd_ [1999] 1 SCR 142). The other measure is that first stated by Lord Denning MR in _Seager v Copydex (No 2)_ [1969] 1 WLR 809. Damages are to be assessed on the market value of the c onfidential information on a sale between a willing seller and a willing buyer. Of the two measures, one c onc erns the market value of the information; the other c onc erns the plaintiff’s ac tual loss of profits. In _Dawson & Mason Ltd v Potter_ [1986] 1 WLR 1419 at 1432 (“ _Dawson”_ ), Sir Edward Eveleigh explained that the c ourt should award the market value of the information only when the plaintiff would have sold the information; when the plaintiff intended to exploit the information by himself, damages should be measured by the plaintiff’s loss of profits c aused by the defendant’s breac h of c onfidenc e. Whether the two measures are distinc t, related or they overlap depending on the set of fac ts, they are c ompensatory in nature and are c onsistent with the c ontrac tual measure. The measures follow from the same princ iple –that damages are assessed based on the amount needed to c ompensate the plaintiff for the loss of the c ontrac tual bargain. 

**_Issue of proof of loss: damage and causation_** 

_The applicable principles_ 

28     The princ iple governing the quantum of damages for breac h of c ontrac t is straightforward. As indic ated, the award should c ompensate the vic tim of the breac h for the loss of his c ontrac tual bargain. On a c ontrac tual analysis, the plaintiff’s c laim for damages would be measured on a c ompensatory basis in order to put it in the same financ ial position as if the undertakings in the Deed had been performed. This is a fac tual inquiry and eac h c ase turns on its fac ts. In this c ase, loss of profit is arguably by reason of loss of general c ustom. 

29     As indic ated, the defendants have raised two reasons as to why the c ourt should refuse rec overy. First, there was no proof of loss for the breac h period of August 2005 to January 2007, and if there was indeed a loss, there was no proof that it was c aused by the defendants’ breac h of the 


Deed. Sec ond, in so far as the post breac h loss was c onc erned ( _ie_ , from February 2007), the loss, if any, was too remote. I start on the rival c ontentions of the parties on the first issue of loss allegedly suffered by the plaintiff before looking at the AR’s findings on c ausation. At this stage, it is worth mentioning that the evidenc e of the plaintiff’s expert, whether one applies Method A or Method B, is only to assist the c ourt to arrive at the _quantum_ of the alleged damage, but not the fac t that the alleged damage was in fac t suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the breac h. 

30     I agree with the defendants that even though the defendants had allowed c onsent judgment to be entered against them for breac h of _all_ the four undertakings in the Deed, the plaintiff must establish, on a balanc e of probabilities, that the defendants’ breac h had c aused the plaintiff to suffer 

loss so as to be entitled to damages. _McGregor on Damages_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2009) provides suc c inc tly for this requirement at para 8-001: 

 A c laimant c laiming damages must prove his c ase. To justify an award of substantial damages he must satisfy the c ourt both as to the fac t of damage and as to its amount. If he satisfies the c ourt on neither, his ac tion will fail, or at the most he will be awarded nominal damages where a right has been infringed. If the fac t of damage is shown but no evidenc e is given as to its amount so that it is virtually impossible to assess damages, this will generally permit only an award of nominal damages; this situation is illustrated by Dixon v Deveridge and Twyman v Knowles. 

31     The Court of Appeal in _Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2008] 2 SLR 623</span> at [27] quoted with approval the same passage in [30] from _McGregor On_ 

_Damages_ , 17th Ed, para 8-001. Andrew Phang JA noted further that: 


 [27] ... [T]he proof of damage depends wholly on the fac tual matrix c onc erned. In the c irc umstanc es, it is impossible to lay down any general rules or princ iples as to what c onstitutes adequate proof of damage sinc e the partic ular fac tual c irc umstanc es c an take, literally, a myriad of forms. 

 [28] The law, however, does not demand that the plaintiff prove with c omplete c ertainty the exac t amount of damage that he has suffered. Thus, the learned author of McGregor on Damages c onstitutes as follows (at para 8-002): 

 [W]here it is c lear that some substantial loss has been inc urred, the fac t that an assessment is diffic ult bec ause of the nature of the damage is no reason for awarding no damages or merely nominal damages. As Vaughan Williams L.J. put it in Chaplin v Hicks ]1911] 2 KB 786], the leading c ase on the issue of c ertainty: “The fac t that damages c annot be assessed with c ertainty does not relieve the wrongdoer of the nec essity of paying damages.” Indeed if absolute certainty were required as to the precise amount of loss that the claimant had suffered, no damages would be recovered at all in the great number of cases. This is particularly true since so much of damages claimed are in respect of prospective, and therefore necessarily contingent, loss. [emphasis added] 

 ... 

 [31] To summarise, a plaintiff c annot simply make a c laim for damages without plac ing before the c ourt suffic ient evidenc e of the loss it has suffered even if it is otherwise entitled in princ iple to rec over damages. On the other hand, where the plaintiff has attempted its level best to prove its loss and the evidenc e is c ogent, the c ourt should allow it to rec over the damages c laimed. 

 [emphasis in original] 

32     Assessment of damages is a question of fac t and in awarding c ompensatory damages, the c ourt has to be satisfied on a balanc e of probabilities that the partic ular loss as proved is c ausally c onnec ted or linked to the breac h of c ontrac t. On this question of c ausation, the law is c onveniently 

set out in _Chitty on Contracts_ (13th Ed, Sweet & Maxwell, 2008) at vol 1 para 26-032: 

 The c ourts have avoided laying down any formal tests for c ausation: they have relied on c ommon sense to guide dec isions as to whether a breac h of c ontrac t is a suffic iently substantial c ause of the c laimant’s loss. The answer to whether the breac h was the c ause of the loss or merely the oc c asion for loss must “in the end” depend on “the c ourt’s c ommonsense” in interpreting the fac ts. 

33     In _Galoo v Bright Grahame Murray_ [1994] 1WLR 1360, the Court of Appeal said the approac h to adopt on the question of how the c ourt dec ided whether or not the breac h of c ontrac t was the c ause of the plaintiff’s loss fell to be answered by the applic ation of the c ourt’s c ommon sense. 

3       4 _Trietel, The Law of Contract_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2007) at para 20-095 c ommented as follows: 


 In all the above c ases, the defendant is not liable for a loss whic h is not c aused by the breac h at all; but a c laimant c an often rec over damages although the breac h is not the sole c ause of the loss. As Devlin J said in Heskell v Continental Express Ltd [1950] 1 All ER 1035 at 1048 “If a breac h of c ontrac t is one of two c auses, both c o-operating and both of equal effic ac y, ... it is suffic ient to c arry a judgment for damage”. 

_The evidence and findings_ 

35     With the above princ iples in mind, I turn to the first question whether the plaintiff’s loss as c laimed was suffered, or had it c ome from an assumption or premised on a hypothesis bec ause the plaintiff’s expert was told to make it in his terms of referenc e. In a c ase like the present one, the c onsideration is really whether the fac ts in evidenc e lend support to the inferenc e of loss in terms of loss of business during the breac h period, and the loss was the result of the defendants’ breac h of the Deed. Looking at the relevant fac ts and matters in evidenc e, ac tual loss may properly be inferred. 

36     First, it is a signific ant fac t that the four undertakings in the Deed were c losely related to the business operation of the plaintiff. In other words, given the c irc umstanc es of this c ase, the loss of business is the best evidenc e of loss. This view is fortified by Mr John’s ac knowledgment that the defendants in giving the undertakings agreed to refrain from “c opying” the plaintiff in the four areas. 

37     Sec ond, the breac h c ontinued for 18 months despite the plaintiff’s demands that the defendants desist. The Deed was a settlement made with the sec ond defendant who was a party to Suit 257 as well as the first defendant who was not a party to Suit 257. Suit 257 was a breac h of c onfidenc e c ase against the sec ond defendant. The intention of the Deed was c lear. One c an reasonably deduc e from the four undertakings that c onfidential information was taken, divulged to and used by the defendants who subsequently agreed to stop using them by a stipulated time. I interpose here to c omment that the defendants were given a grac e period to c omply with two of the four undertakings in c l 3 of the Deed. In effec t, the defendants were allowed to use the serving pans and the O.B. Sauc es for a c ertain grac e period. Within the grac e period, MFM was further obliged by implic ation to phase out the use of the serving pans and the O.B. Sauc es. Mr Yeo made the point that Mr Samuel’s graphs show that within three short months (May 2005 to August 2005) of the opening of the first MFM restaurant at Plaza Singapura, it sales reac hed the average level of the plaintiff’s restaurants. He submits that this “ac c eleration in the sales c ould only have been ac hieved as a result of the defendants’ breac hes of the undertakings. This is the ‘springboard’, or ac c elerated entry, whic h the [defendants] wanted to ac hieve through their deliberate and c alc ulated breac hes of the Deed.” Not muc h c an be made of Mr Yeo’s last point. MFM did well in the first three months of its operation but that was during the grac e period stipulated in the Deed. However, after the grac e period, the breac h of the Deed, partic ularly in respec t of the O.B. Sauc es, c ontinued for 18 months. Eventually, as it turned out, and given the c onsent judgment, the defendants had done the very thing they had c ontrac ted not to do. Starting from August 2005, there c an be no breac h without inflic ting at any rate some measure of damage on the plaintiff having regard to the evidenc e that the breac h, though deliberate, took plac e in a c ommerc ial c ontext, and the defendants ac ted as they did in the c ourse of a business (the MFM outlet). The breac h c onstituted a flagrant c ontravention of the defendants’ undertakings with a view to their own financ ial gain or reward. No doubt deliberate breac hes of c ontrac t oc c ur in the c ommerc ial world, and it was only upon the defendants’ c onsent to judgment being entered and the granting of the injunc tion that any unfair c ompetitive advantage gained from the use of the O.B. Sauc es c eased. 

38     Third, evidenc e of the MFM’s performanc e as a new entrant in the Singapore market in 2005 was exc eedingly good. During the breac h period ( _ie_ , August 2005 to January 2007), MFM’s revenue 


was $3,025,520 c ompared to the performanc e of the Glass House outlet of $4,057,000. I shall disc uss further the performanc e of MFM below. For present purposes, Mr Samuel in answer to the AR’s question opined that besides the c lose proximity between two restaurants, there was “a c lose c orelation between the falling revenue of the affec ted restaurants and the opening of the MFM restaurant”. Mr Akhtar ac c epted that a direc t c ompetitor “c an be expec ted to have some impac t on the sales of the existing player’s outlet that is in the vic inity”. 

39     Four, there was no c annibalisation (as “in the lowering or eating away”) of the plaintiff’s profit by opening of outlets of the same c hain of restaurants in c lose proximity to eac h other. If anything, c annibalisation, on the evidenc e would as the AR held only reduc e the plaintiff’s c laim substantially, not c ompletely. The AR observed at p 4 of his grounds of dec ision: 

 Whether by ac c ident or design, however, in failing to establish his point regarding c annibalisation between the outlets, Defenc e Counsel has, in my view, suc c eeded on a c ruc ial point. That is: if Fish & Co’s Affec ted Outlets [ ie , Bugis, Suntec , Glass House & Centrepoint] did not c annibalise eac h other (or c annibalised eac h other only minimally), then the Plaintiff also c annot argue that a c lone of the Fish & Co outlet, plac ed in very c lose proximity to its Glass House outlet, c an take away business from all 4 Affec ted outlets. It must naturally follow. On this sc ore, I find that the efforts of the Plaintiff’s witnesses (Ms Loh & Mr Chiang) in resisting any suggestion that there c ould be c annibalisation, have ironic ally, reduc ed their own c laim substantially. 

40     Five, the number of restaurants affec ted by the breac h c ould not be as many as four. I agree with the AR’s finding that Glass House was the only affec ted outlet given its very c lose proximity to the MFM outlet in Plaza Singapura. He reasoned as follows: 

 However, I am of the view that the assumption (that 4 restaurants were affec ted adversely by the Defendant’s Plaza Singapura outlet) simply c annot stand, given the fac t that the 4 affec ted restaurants c atered to different “market segments” – to use the words of the Plaintiff’s witness, Chiang. While the assumption was reasonable to start with, it subsequently turned out to be an inac c urate assumption, given the testimonies of Ms Loh & Mr Chiang. 

41     Six, MFM’s arrival on the seafood restaurant sc ene had a negative impac t on the Glass House outlet. Before c ommenting on the performanc e of the two outlets, I must point out that both the plaintiff and the first defendant have different financ ial year ends, and the breac h period straddles their respec tive financ ial periods so muc h so that a simple c omparison of the financ ial years of the two to determine the pre-breac h and post breac h performanc e is inadequate. A more meaningful and relevant c omparison would be the c omputation of the average monthly sales figures for pre-breac h and breac h period respec tively. 

42     From the monthly sales data of the Glass House outlet provided by the plaintiff, average monthly sales of about $241,300 was c omputed for the pre-breac h 18-month period from February 2004 to July 2005. Compared with the $225,400 average monthly sales for the breac h period from August 2005 to January 2007, a 6.6% dec line was shown. In the c ase of MFM, for the pre-breac h period, there were no sales figures to be had from the first defendant as it had yet to c ommenc e operations. Nevertheless for the c orresponding breac h period, MFM ac hieved average monthly sales of $168,100. However, for the post breac h period from February 2007 to August 2007 for whic h monthly sales data was provided, MFM’s average monthly sales rose by 67.4% to $281,500. As stated, the figures tell a story that MFM’s operations affec ted the performanc e of the plaintiff’s Glass House 


outlet. 

43     It is worthwhile to note that the Department of Statistic s, Singapore Press Release in relation to the Catering Trade Index for the 16-month period starting from Oc tober 2005 to January 2007, and in partic ular the perc entage year on year c hange at c urrent pric es of the Catering Trade Index for Restaurants, indic ated that the Glass House outlet’s sales statistic s were signific antly underperforming the sec tor. In fac t, nine months out of the 16-month period of the Glass House outlet’s sales reflec ted negative perc entages c ompared to a positive trend throughout for the sec tor, while the other months were well below the industry benc hmark statistic s during the period. Conversely, MFM’s sales statistic s for the period were the opposite of the plaintiff’s; the first defendant was outperforming the industry. The statistic al material is a helpful guide and it tells us that the Glass House outlet’s monthly sales performanc e for the period was even below the industry’s norm. 

44     Seven, in so far as the c laim for loss of profits during the breac h period is c onc erned, the defendants are not saying (and rightly so) that suc h a head of c laim is too remote. The plaintiff’s c laim for loss of c ustom, whic h may be translated into one for loss of profits, would in the ordinary c ourse of things be of the type and kind whic h the defendants would expec t as not unlikely if the undertakings in the Deed were not observed and c omplied with. As suc h, the c laim is not too remote. Even if the c laim for loss of profits arose from spec ial c irc umstanc es, the defendants had been well aware of those c irc umstanc es, and henc e the c laim would not be too remote. The defendants, ac ting on legal advic e, voluntarily gave the undertakings in the Deed. Therefore, the undertakings c ould not have been given lightly. In that regard, the c ontrac tual promise to observe the undertakings after the grac e period was well within the knowledge and c onsent of the defendants. In addition, the terms of the settlement would c ertainly be a matter whic h parties may be held to have had in reasonable c ontemplation under the sec ond rule in _Hadley v Baxendale_ ( _supra_ [21]). In that regard, the defendants ought reasonably to have c ontemplated as the likely c onsequenc es of the breac h at the time they made the Deed that they would have to pay damages and c osts if the undertakings were breac hed. Therefore, the sec ond rule in _Hadley v Baxendale_ seems to me to be met. As for the defendants’ other c ontention that the post breac h loss ( _ie_ , from February 2007) is too remote, I will disc uss this together with the post breac h c laim (see [60] – [68] below). Suffic e it to say that my observations here equally apply to the c laim for post breac h loss. 

45     For all the reasons stated above, I am satisfied, and I so find, that on a balanc e of probabilities, the plaintiff has suffic iently established by inferenc e (a) its loss in terms of loss of c ustom during the breac h period; and (b) the c ausal link between the breac h of the Deed and the loss of c ustom. However, the extent of that loss is altogether another matter. In other words, the quantific ation of the loss is another thing. Suffic e it to say at this stage that realistic ally not _all_ sales by MFM c onstituted a loss of c ustom to the Glass House outlet. The plaintiff ac c epts that position and for that reason there is, for instanc e, using Method B, a need to selec t a perc entage of the MFM sales whic h c ould be said to have been attributable to the breac h. 

**_Assessment of the quantum of damages_** 

46     This part of the judgment examines the different approac hes taken by the plaintiff to prove its c laim for loss of profits. In this c onnec tion, the c ourt has to dec ide firstly what approac h it has to adopt in assessing damages in a c ase like this. Onc e that has been established, the next diffic ult part lies in evaluating the extent of the loss to determine the quantum of damages. 

47     Generally, the princ iples for assessing damages in breac h of c onfidenc e c ases are not different from the princ iples for assessing damages in c ontrac t. As indic ated in [27] above, a c laim for loss of profits c aused by a defendant’s breac h of c onfidenc e is made when a plaintiff intends to exploit the 


 Perc entage 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 

 Profit lost $114,600 $229,200 $338,500 $445,800 $553, 

information by himself (see Sir Edward Eveleigh in _Dawson_ ). In this respec t, the Americ an Restatement (3d) of Unfair Competition, Ch 4 § 45 at 516 on how to prove loss of profits from breac h of c onfidenc e is instruc tive. The relevant paragraph is reproduc ed below: 

 e. Relief measured by plaintiff’s loss. A frequent element of loss resulting from the appropriation of a trade sec ret is the lost profit that the plaintiff would have earned in the absenc e of the use by the defendant. The plaintiff may prove lost profits by identifying specific customers diverted to the defendant. The plaintiff may also prove lost profits through proof of a general decline in sales or a disruption of business growth following the commencement of use by the defendant, although the presence of other market factors that may affect the plaintiff’s sales bears on the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s proof. If the evidence justifies the conclusion that the sales made by the defendant would have instead been made by the plaintiff in the absence of the appropriation, the plaintiff may establish its lost profits by applying its own profit margin to the defendant’s sales. 

 [emphasis added] 

48     At the forefront of the plaintiff’s c ase to asc ertain a general dec line in sales or a disruption of business growth during and after the breac h of the Deed is Mr Samuel’s Method A. Mr Yeo summarised the range of figures c alc ulated under Method A in respec t of the c laim for loss of profits during the breac h period as follows: 

49     I was invited to infer from the c alc ulations in Method A that a drop in sales during the period of the breac h was from a loss in market share and that should be attributed to the defendants’ c ontravening c onduc t. In my view, Method A c annot support the partic ular inferenc e I have been asked to draw. I have already explained that I agree with the AR’s findings that the Glass House outlet was the only affec ted restaurant. The AR ac c epted the evidenc e led on behalf of the plaintiff that eac h Fish & Co restaurant serves different market sec tors, and by logic al deduc tion, the only affec ted restaurant was the Glass House outlet, a short distanc e away from Plaza Singapura. That said, I ac c ept Mr Samuel’s testimony that the AR’s parameters distorted the methodology of Method A for the reasons stated in [16] above. Sinc e there is only one affec ted restaurant, the methodology of Method A whic h is based on more than one affec ted restaurants is not helpful, and ac c epting Mr Samuel’s c ritic isms of the AR’s parameters, Method A is disregarded in this appeal. 

50     The defendants rely on Mr Akthar’s c alc ulations to advanc e the untenable proposition that no loss at all was oc c asioned by the breac h. I have already mentioned the AR’s c ritic isms of Mr Akthar’s evidenc e and I agree with his assessment and c onc lusion. 

51     Method B is akin to the approac h set out in the Americ an Restatement (3d) of Unfair Competition Restatement at [47] above. It is based on the performanc e of the first defendant, utilising MFM’s sales revenue and applying the profit margins and c ost struc ture of the plaintiff’s affec ted operations with some adjustments to c ompute the lost profits. In essenc e, Method B endeavours to rec over the plaintiff’s lost profits from the first defendant’s ac tual sales on the basis that it would have been what the plaintiff would have earned but for the defendants’ breac h ( _ie_ , use of the O.B. Sauc es etc during the breac h period) and therefore the measure of the plaintiff’s loss. In 


my view, Method B is a sensible approac h to asc ertain the loss of profits suffered by the plaintiff. 

_(i) Loss of profit claim during the breach period_ 

52     Having dec ided that Method B is the most appropriate means of assessing damages in this c ase, I now c ome to the diffic ult part on evaluating the quantum of damages for the breac h period. Although Mr. Samuel had quantified in his report the loss of profits based on various perc entages of MFM’s revenue during the breac h period, he was unable to say how muc h of MFM’s revenue was attributable to the breac h of the Deed. This is by no means an easy task but nevertheless not an impossible one. The c ourt will have to do its best to determine the loss of profits given the available material. Mr Yeo submits that the plaintiff is entitled to at least 30% of the defendant’s sales under Method B but offers no basis for this perc entage figure. 

53     I have been provided with a plethora of information by both sides. However, the most c ruc ial and relevant of these are the sales figures. The plaintiff has submitted monthly sales figures of the Glass House outlet from the period February 2004 to August 2007. Similarly, the first defendant has provided monthly sales data from its c ommenc ement of business in May 2005 to August 2007. From MFM’s sales data, it is c lear that the restaurant immediately generated respec table revenues as opposed to a gradual build up of c ustom typic al of any new start-up operation. In evaluating the sales data, it must be remembered that May 2005 to July 2005 was the grac e period granted to the defendants in the Deed. This is important bec ause the figures used as the basis of c alc ulating lost profits are taken after the expiry of the grac e period _ie_ , from August 2005 for a period of 18 months to January 2007 when the restaurant had a c hanc e to settle down, so to speak, in the initial operation period. It is not an unreasonable inferenc e that during the same 18-month period, at least O.B. Sauc es were used during the breac h period. The jingles and phrases were stopped on 8 November 2005; the serving pans c hanged by 28 Dec ember 2006. At this junc ture, I make two points. First, sinc e the plaintiff’s damages would be measured on a c ompensatory basis, MFM’s motives in breac hing the Deed would not have a bearing on the quantum. Sec ond, the number of breac hes dec reasing over the period need not nec essarily result in the dec rease in lost profits attributable to the breac hes over the period. The dec rease should not be material bec ause the most signific ant breac h as a matter of c ommon experienc e and c ommon sense must be the use of the O.B. Sauc es whic h persisted throughout the 18-month period of the breac h. Notably, the defendants had c onc eded that MFM’s sauc e was not different in taste and ingredients from that of Fish & Co during the breac h period. 

54     It is c ommon knowledge that restaurants do not operate in a vac uum but are influenc ed and affec ted by market c onditions. I therefore find helpful the statistic s, in partic ular, the perc entage year on year c hange at c urrent pric es in the Catering Trade Index for Restaurants for the period from Oc tober 2005 to January 2007. I have briefly mentioned these in [43]. In my view, these statistic s offer independent evidenc e as to the general status of the relevant market in order to derive a c ommon benc hmark suc h that a c omparison of the performanc e of eac h of the outlets c an be made relative to its peers operating under prevailing market c onditions. Exc ept for the month of January 2007, the perc entage year on year c hange at c urrent pric es in the Catering Trade Index for Restaurants exhibited a positive trend during the larger part of the breac h period and are about **12%** during the period. 

55     A review of the Glass House outlet’s monthly sales perc entage year on year c hange at c urrent pric es from Oc tober 2005 to January 2007 revealed negative deviations of about **4%** in the same period from the sec tor’s trend of **12%**. In the c ase of MFM, the available monthly sales perc entage year on year c hange at c urrent pric es are from August 2006 to January 2007. This is bec ause between January 2006 and April 2006 there were no c omparative sales in the previous year sinc e MFM 


only c ommenc ed operations in May 2005. For the months from May 2006 to July 2006, the perc entage year on year c hange at c urrent pric es are not meaningful sinc e those months in the previous year were the initial operation period and inc lusion of those perc entage c hange would c ause an aberration. Moreover, those months were the grac e period under the Deed. Nevertheless, MFM’s monthly sales perc entage year on year c hange at c urrent pric es during the available period of August 2006 to January 2007 indic ate a positive trend of about **19%** for the available period exc eeding the restaurants sec tor’s Catering Trade Index. 

56     The plaintiff has as I have found for the reasons stated in [36] to [44] suffered loss as a result of a dec line in sales due to the breac h of the Deed. However, the plaintiff has not properly quantified the amount of the loss. A mere submission of a tabulation of a range of loss of profits will not suffic e. It resulted in the defendants’ asserting that the plaintiff had not led evidenc e to overc ome the question of c ausation sinc e the loss c ould be due to other fac tors like direc t c ompetition, pric ing, tight c ompetition in the food and beverage market and c onvenienc e. The plaintiff’s c laim for loss of profits, so the argument develops, should be reduc ed to take into ac c ount the probability of loss c aused by fac tors other than the breac h of the Deed. Cannibalisation as a fac tor has been disc ussed earlier in [39]. I agree that it would be unsafe in the c irc umstanc es to award the plaintiff’s loss of profits based on all of MFM’s sales during the breac h period. However, it would be logic al to infer that if the defendants had not c ommitted the breac h, the plaintiff’s sales would be, at least, in line with the industry’s trend of **12%** during the period. As the Glass House outlet’s monthly sales perc entage year on year c hange at c urrent pric es during the breac h period is **-4%** , there is a **16%** gap between the former and the industry index. For the plaintiff to be in line with the industry, Glass House outlet’s sales would have to inc rease by **16%**. Using the methodology of Method B, loss of profits c alc ulation ought to be based on **16%** of MFM’s sales during the period. In my view, the approac h adopted is a rational basis for assessing loss profits for it will in some way alleviate the spec ulative element in the exerc ise. To award a perc entage of sales higher than **16 %** of MFM’s sales would introduc e the influenc e of fac tors other than the breac h that has a bearing on the loss of profits. 

57     From Method B, Table 2 – “Assumed share of MFM’s revenue attributable to breac h of Deed” in Mr. Samuel’s report dated 6 Dec ember 2007, I have interpolated the loss profits on 16% of MFM’s total revenue to be $230,600 based on a linear relationship of loss of profit to sales. 

58     Before I move on to the next head of damages, I must deal with the Singapore Department of Statistic s Retail Sales Index and Catering Trade Index of 2008 whic h the defendants provided under c over of their c ounsel’s letter dated 24 February 2009 shortly after the 19 February 2009 hearing. The defendants referred to Table 6 Perc entage Change in Catering Trade Index over the c orresponding period of the previous year for the indic es at c onstant pric es and pointed out that although the restaurant trade improved by 4.6% in 2004 relative to 2003, the Glass House outlet did worse by 5.76%. The objec tive of this was to influenc e the c ourt in its assessment of the quantum of the damages on the basis that sinc e the performanc e of the Glass House outlet was negative no damages should be awarded. At best, the plaintiff is entitled to nominal damages. 

59     I make the following observations on the 2008 statistic s provided. First, the statistic s are for the respec tive c alendar years. The financ ial year of the Glass House outlet is not c oterminous with that of the years for whic h the statistic s were prepared for. In order for there to be an ac c eptable and meaningful c omparison to demonstrate that there has been a real dec line in the pre-breac h periods as c ompared to the breac h period, regard must be given to c omparing like periods, that is, in 18-month tranc hes similar to the breac h period of August 2005 to January 2007. No monthly Catering Trade Index statistic s over the c orresponding month of the previous year were given for the years 2003 and 2004 respec tively. Therefore, a c areful and detailed c omparison based on similar 18-month periods is not possible. For the foregoing reasons, I disregarded the defendants’ late submission of the 


statistic s. In arriving at this dec ision, I have taken on board the plaintiff’s objec tions to the late submission of fresh evidenc e. 

_(ii) Post breach loss of profit_ 

60     The AR awarded damages post breac h on the basis that the effec t of the c ontravening c onduc t was not spent. The defendants submit that there is no basis to award springboard losses post breac h. Mr John c omplains that the plaintiff’s relianc e on the patent infringement c ase of _Gerber Garment Technology Inc v Lectra Systems Ltd_ [1995] RPC 383 (“ _Gerber_ ”) to c laim springboard losses is misplac ed. I do not propose to touc h on _Gerber_ sinc e Mr Samuel had not relied on the c onc ept defined in _Gerber_. The c laim for springboard losses arises from the “c ontinuing” effec t of the defendants’ breac h of the four undertakings. The defendants submit that this head of damages should properly be termed “momentum” loss. In any c ase, Mr Wang argues (and rightly so) that a key issue is whether this type of loss, referred to as either momentum loss or springboard loss, is too remote. 

61     Mr Yeo argues that the AR was right in princ iple to award post breac h loss of profit. His objec tion is that the duration of the loss should be more than 12 months. Mr Yeo relies on _Ductline_ for the proposition that post breac h loss is rec overable. In _Ductline_ (at 428), the c ourt agreed that loss of business profits suffered in c onsequenc e of the passing-off c annot be said to have c eased entirely as at the relevant time. However, in that c ase there were misleading fliers remaining in the hands of wholesalers and the c ourt was not prepared to assume that the effec t of the misleading information was entirely spent. In _Ductline_ , a small sum was awarded to ac c ommodate the lingering effec t of the respondent’s c ontravention. Ac c ordingly, the c ourt awarded a sum to ac c ommodate this situation. The fac ts of this c ase are different. 

62     It must be remembered that the injunc tion in the c onsent judgment would protec t against any future breac hes and in the absenc e of any proven loss, the financ ial remedy for the past breac hes would be that sustained during the breac h period, and that has been dealt with. The c onsent to the injunc tion order may also be interpreted as rec ognition by the defendants that as at the date of the injunc tion, the unfair c ompetitive advantage still existed and would c ontinue to have effec t unless the injunc tion was granted. 

63     In my view, rec overy of post breac h loss of profit is to be resolved through the usual princ iples of c ausation and remoteness rather than to introduc e the springboard c onc ept from intellec tual property law. On the fac ts of this c ase, it was reasonably foreseeable that the effec t of the MFM’s breac h would c ontinue. Henc e, it would not be unusual at all to award to the plaintiff, damages for its loss of profits _after_ the injunc tion order. The c essation of the breac h in January 2007 did not nec essarily mean the end of the losses. The plaintiff argued, and the AR agreed, that there would be a gradual trailing off of the effec t of the breac h. I agree. However, it is diffic ult evidentially to say whether how long and to what extent c ustomers will c ontinue to patronise MFM’s outlet after the defendants had begun using MFM sauc es. 

64     _McGregor on Damages_ at para 6-191 c ities passages from two authorities: 

 ... first, “the c ourt will ... assume that the parties as business men will have all reasonable ac quaintanc e with the ordinary c ourse of business” and sec ondly, “as reasonable businessmen eac h must be taken to understand the ordinary prac tic es and exigenc ies of the other’s trade or business”. 

Relying on the above quotes, the plaintiff submits that a reasonable man having the defendants’ knowledge of the seafood restaurant business and industry would c ontemplate that the loss of 


c ustom or market share whic h the plaintiff suffered during the breac h period would c ontinue to have an effec t even after an injunc tion was imposed against the defendants. 

65     I ac c ept that a general loss of c ustom and business is the natural and direc t result of the breac h of the Deed. The four undertakings in the Deed were to stop attempts to use them for the establishment of the MFM restaurant and, in the event of c ontravention, the innoc ent party may rec over the amount of business profits lost. Evidenc e of the loss of business whic h was not ac c ounted for in any other way is the proper c onsideration in estimating damages. The evidenc e showed that the first defendant, during the breac h period, was better off than the plaintiff, an established business. The first defendant was about to start the first MFM restaurant in Singapore, and the plaintiffs wanted the first defendant and the Malaysian c ompanies to be parties to the Deed. The Deed was signed after one month of negotiations. It would have reasonably been c ontemplated by the defendants that plaintiff’s loss of c ustom would c ontinue to run after the defendants’ breac h had stopped. In that regard, there is no merit in the defendants’ argument that post breac h loss of profit is too remote as it falls within the first limb of Hadley v Baxendale. The post breac h loss should not be c ategorised as c onsequential but flowed direc tly from the breac h for the same reasons stated in [44]. Baron Alderson’s famous dic tum in Hadley v Baxendale and its treatment by Asquith LJ in his judgment in Vic toria Laundry (Windsor Ltd) v Newman [1949] 2 KB 528 were c onsidered by the House of Lords in The Heron II [1969] 1 AC 350. The effec t of the speec hes in that c ase is that a kind of loss falls within the first rule if it is one whic h the defendant when he made the c ontrac t, ought to have realised was not unlikely to result from the breac h even though he was not given any express intimation to that effec t by the plaintiff (see Lord Reid at 382-383 and 388 and at 405, 410-411, per Lord Morris, Lord Hodson and Lord Pearc e respec tively). 

66     The AR projec ted a c ontinuing loss of profit into 2008 for 12 months from February 2007 on the same basis. The diffic ulty about the AR’s approac h to the post January 2007 period is the absenc e of any findings by him as to why the trailing off effec t should last for one year, not earlier or not more than one year. It is of c ourse for the plaintiff to establish this loss, and the plaintiff did not made good a c laim for loss of profits post January 2007 for the next 24 months. Given that inability, it is diffic ult to see how, c onsistently with that c onc lusion, the AR c ould have held the defendants responsible for c ontinuing loss of profits post January 2007 into the next 12 months. On what basis c ould it be said that suc h losses have been c aused by the defendants’ past breac hes c ommitted between August 2005 and January 2007? Mr Yeo c alled it springboard losses. Mr Wang disagreed arguing that the proper terminology should be momentum loss. In a sense the AR treated the post breac h c laim as momentum loss. He adopted Mr Samuel’s example of riding a bic yc le down the hill. He said: 

 In the present c ase, I do not think that it is too remote to see that losses would c ontinue to ac c rue to the Plaintiff even after the Defendants have c eased their breac h. On top of that, I find the explanation given by Mr Tony Samuel c ompelling – he testified that “unless MFM’s c ustomer knew immediately that the breac hes had c eased, there would be a period of loss whic h c ontinues after the breac hes had c eased. If you ride a bic yc le and stop peddling, it will take some time before it stops.” Suc h reasoning is, to my mind sound. 

67     As indic ated, the c orrec t analysis of this c ase is not one of c ontinuing breac h whic h had been remedied and an injunc tion ordered, but of whether or not the past breac hes c ould have a trailing off effec t whic h is also subjec t to unknown fac tors operating in relation to the ac ts of third parties or other events independent of the defendants’ breac h. As suc h an allowanc e for the unc ertainties must be made in assessing loss of profits post breac h. The problem fac ing the plaintiff is evidential. The evidenc e in support of the plaintiff’s c laim for an additional 18-24 months of damages is tenuous. 


68     The plaintiff provided monthly management ac c ounts of Glass House for the next seven months after the injunc tion order. I note from the ac c ounts over the period of seven months that sales in the post breac h period c ontinued to dec line. I agree that the effec t of the breac h was not entirely spent after the injunc tion order. Unlike the AR, I am only prepared to ac c ommodate this with an additional six months of damages based on loss of profits on 16% of MFM’s sales as reasonable c ompensation for the trailing effec t of the breac h. Using the methodology in Method B, Table 4 of Mr. Samuel’s report dated 6 Dec ember 2007, the average monthly profit during the 18-month period on the above c omputed loss of profits of $230,600 would be about $12,800 per month. Having regard to the trailing off effec t envisaged in Method B, an award of six months using a multiple of 3 will translate into an amount of $38,400 for post breac h loss of profit. 

**Result** 

69     The total amount assessed as rec overable under both heads of damages is $269,000. Sinc e the plaintiff has not appealed against the rate of interest ordered by the AR under s 12(1) of the Civil Law Ac t (Cap 43, Rev Ed, 1999), the defendants are to pay interest on the judgment sum of $269,000 at the rate of 3% per annum from the date the writ (ie, 20 September 2005) to the date of judgment (ie, 26 November 2009). I will hear parties on c osts at a later date.
