2       The prosec ution proc eeded with the sec ond, third, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth c harges. AGG pleaded guilty to all the c harges and I ac c epted his plea of guilt and c onvic ted him on the c harges. AGG agreed to the first, fourth and fifth c harges to be taken into c onsideration for sentenc ing. 

3       The fac ts leading to the c ommission of the offenc es, the arrest and other relevant information were c ontained in the Statement of Fac ts (“SOF”) whic h AGG agreed to. Paragraphs 3 to 30 of that SOF read as follows: 

 B. FIRST INFORMATION REPORT 

3\. On 30 April 2009, at about 3.50pm, the vic tim lodged a polic e report at the Criminal     Investigation Department, in whic h she stated that between the year 2000 and mid-2007, she had been molested by her brother on several oc c asions. The vic tim also stated that the ac c used had begun to rape her, at their residenc e, from sometime in either 2005 or 2006. 

 4 The ac c used was thereafter arrested on 2 June 2009, at about 4.50pm, at the Serious 


Sexual Crimes Branc h of the Criminal Investigation Department. 

**C. FACTS RELATING TO THE 6 th CHARGE (OUTRAGE OF MODESTY)** 

5\. The vic tim’s immediate family c onsists of her parents and two older brothers. The ac c used is the eldest son of the family. 

6\. ... 

7\. ... 

8\. ... 

9\. At [address redac ted], the vic tim’s father oc c upied the master bedroom, while the vic tim’s mother slept on the living room sofa. This was due to the fac t that the vic tim’s parents were estranged and on poor terms. The ac c used and the vic tim shared the other bedroom in the flat: the ac c used slept on the only bed in the room, while the vic tim slept on a pull-out mattress plac ed on the floor adjac ent to the ac c used’s bed. 

10\. On a night sometime in the year 2005 or 2006, both the ac c used and the vic tim were in their shared bedroom at [address redac ted]. The ac c used was lying on his bed and the vic tim was lying on her mattress. The ac c used then c ame over to where the vic tim lay on her mattress.     Assuming that the vic tim was asleep, the ac c used then inserted his hand into the vic tim’s panties, and used his hand to rub on the vic tim’s vulva and c litoris. The ac c used admitted that he felt aroused and exc ited whilst touc hing the vic tim in this manner. 

11\. Unbeknownst to the ac c used, the vic tim was awake and aware of that the ac c used was touc hing her. However, out of fear and embarrassment, the vic tim refrained from stirring, in order not to alert the ac c used to the fac t that she was awake. 

12\. In addition to stroking her vulva with his hand, the ac c used also began to touc h the vic tim’s bare breasts by sliding his hands under her top. The ac c used also c aressed and suc ked on the vic tim’s nipples. The ac c used then inserted his finger into the vic tim’s vagina whilst she lay on her mattress in their shared bedroom at night. 

13\. The above ac ts were c arried out, at night, whilst all of the lights in the bedroom were switc hed off. When the ac c used c ommitted the ac ts of molest against the vic tim, he had assumed that the vic tim had remained asleep throughout the entire episode. 

14\. ... 

**D. FACTS RELATING TO THE 2nd AND 3rd CHARGES (RAPE)** 

15\. On a night sometime in the year 2007, the ac c used and the vic tim were again in their shared bedroom at [address redac ted]. At around midnight, the ac c used went to where the vic tim lay on her mattress, in the darkness, and proc eeded to remove all of the vic tim’s c lothing.     As the vic tim did not appear to move, the ac c used assumed that the vic tim was asleep. The ac c used then turned the vic tim so that she lay fac ing up, spread her legs apart, and kneeled in between her thighs. He then began to rub, grope, lic k and suc k on the vic tim’s breasts and nipples. The ac c used also inserted a finger into the vic tim’s vagina and began to move it in and out of the vagina. 


16\. When the vic tim did not stir, the ac c used then undressed c ompletely and guided his erec t penis into the vic tim’s vagina with his right hand. He began moving his hips and thrusting his penis repeatedly in and out of the vic tim’s vagina, supporting his weight by resting his palms at the side of the vic tim’s body. The ac c used did not use a c ondom or any other c ontrac eptive devic es. 

17\. ... 

18\. The ac c used raped the vic tim again on a sec ond oc c asion sometime in the year 2007. ... 

19\. Although the vic tim was awake and aware of what the ac c used was doing on the sec ond oc c asion as well, she onc e again remained still due to her fear of the ac c used, as well as due to the fac t that she felt embarrassed by the sexual abuse perpetrated by the ac c used on her. The vic tim did not at any time c onsent to having sexual interc ourse with the ac c used. 

20\. The ac c used admitted that he enjoyed having sexual interc ourse with the vic tim, even though he was aware that she had not c onsented to the said sexual interc ourse, and that it was wrong for him to have forc ed himself on her in suc h a manner. Prior to eac h ac t of sexual abuse c ommitted on the vic tim, the ac c used had viewed pornographic material via the Internet, and felt the urge to touc h a female. He would thereafter ensure (so he thought) that the vic tim was asleep, before starting to molest and rape her. The ac c used therefore c ontinued to have sexual interc ourse with the vic tim as he c ould not resist his sexual urges. 

21\. ... 

**E. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS** 

i. **Confrontation and violence between the accused and the victim** 

22\. Sometime in 2007, at [address redac ted], the vic tim c onfronted the ac c used and threatened to tell their parents that he had been having sexual interc ourse with her without her c onsent. Their parents were not at home at the time. The ac c used was shoc ked that the vic tim was aware of the sexual abuse he had c ommitted on her, and surmised that she had not been asleep after all when he c ommitted the ac ts of molest and rape on her. 

23\. The ac c used immediately began punc hing the vic tim on her fac e and body several times, in response to her threat to inform their parents. The vic tim quic kly ran out of the flat and ran to a neighbouring flat for assistanc e, where she c alled both the polic e and their parents. When their parents and the polic e returned to the flat, the ac c used admitted that he had assaulted the vic tim, but did not mention that he had done so after having been c onfronted by the vic tim. The polic e subsequently advised the vic tim’s parents to apply for a Personal Protec tion Order (‘PPO’) on behalf of the vic tim. However, the vic tim’s parents eventually dec ided against applying for the said PPO. 

**ii**. **Discovery of the offences** 

24\. At the end of 2007, the vic tim ran away from her home at [address redac ted] as she c ould not endure the inc idents of molest and rape c ommitted by the ac c used against her any further.     She did not tell her parents that the ac c used was raping her as she felt that her parents were unsympathetic to her, and would either not believe her or not do anything (a feeling partly engendered by their dec ision not to apply for a PPO on her behalf against the ac c used). The vic tim therefore went to stay with her then-boyfriend at his residenc e. 


25\. The vic tim c ontinued to reside with her then-boyfriend until April 2009, when she finally informed her sec ondary sc hool princ ipal about the inc idents of molest and rape c ommitted by the ac c used on her. The princ ipal and sc hool c ounsellor duly informed the polic e about the matter, after whic h the vic tim formally lodged a polic e report against the ac c used on 30 April 2009. 

 F. MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF THE VICTIM 

26\. The vic tim was examined on 5 May 2009 by Dr. [D], an Assoc iate Consultant at the     Department of Obstetric s and Gynaec ology at [hospital 1]. In a medic al report dated 20 May 2009, Dr. [D] stated that: 

 a. Clinic al examination of the vic tim’s breast and abdomen were normal; 

 b. Pelvic examination revealed multiple old hymenal tears; 

 c. The vic tim’s urine pregnanc y test was negative; and 

 d. Sc reening for c ommon STD’s were negative. 

 G. MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF THE ACCUSED 

27\. The ac c used was examined on 14 July 2009 by Dr. [E], a Consultant at the Department of     Urology at [hospital 2]. In a medic al report dated 14 August 2009, Dr. [E] stated that the ac c used did not have erec tile dysfunc tion. 

 H. FACTS RELATING TO THE TRAFFIC CHARGES (7th – 9th CHARGES) 

28\. The c omplainant is Senior Staff Sergeant Kheong Yew Ming, attac hed to the Tanglin Polic e Division of the Singapore Polic e Forc e. 

29\. In the early morning of 30 January 2009, the c omplainant was performing road-bloc k duties along Farrer Road. At about 3.33 am, the ac c used, who was riding a motorc yc le bearing registration number [XXX] along Farrer Road, was stopped by the c omplainant at the said road- bloc k. Upon c onduc ting a c hec k, the c omplainant disc overed that the ac c used did not possess a valid Class 2B driving lic enc e in respec t of the motorc yc le. 

30\. Investigations revealed that the said motorc yc le bearing registration number [XXX] was registered to one [C], the ac c used’s father. On 30 January 2009, the ac c used had taken the ignition keys of the said motorc yc le without the c onsent or permission of his father. The ac c used thereafter took the motorc yc le from their residenc e [address redac ted] and rode the said motorc yc le, until he was stopped by the c omplainant at the road-bloc k along Farrer Road. 

4       AGG pleaded for a lighter sentenc e. He said that he was extremely remorseful. He was a hooligan a few years ago but had c hanged. He wanted to finish his national servic e. He was c onc erned about his mother and grandmother who were seriously ill. 

5       AGG had previous c onvic tions in 2002 in respec t of unc ensored or obsc ene films, voluntarily c ausing hurt and theft for whic h he was asked to reside in a juvenile home. I did not enhanc e his sentenc e bec ause of these prior offenc es as they were different in nature from the offenc es of outrage of modesty and rape. However, they demonstrated that he had had a brush with the law before. Instead of c hanging his ways, he had gravitated to the more serious offenc es of outrage of 


modesty and rape. 

6       There is only one other c ase of rape by a sibling of a young age. This was _PP v S_ <span class="citation">[2003] SGHC 70</span> (“ _PP v S_ ”) in whic h I had c onvic ted the ac c used on his plea of guilt in respec t of rape under s 376(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). I said at [22]: 

 I took into ac c ount the fac t that the ac c used was in a position of responsibility and trust vis-àvis the vic tims but he was not their parent and he was of a young age. I also took into ac c ount the fac t that he had sexually abused not one but three of his siblings in various ways on various oc c asions over a number of years. 

7       In that c ase, I sentenc ed the ac c used to ten years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the c ane for eac h of the two c harges under s 376(2) of the Penal Code with the sentenc es for eac h of these two c harges to run c onsec utively making a total of 20 years of imprisonment. 

8       However, in _PP v S_ , there were three vic tims and the c harge was under the more serious s 376(2) rather than s 376(1) of the Penal Code. 

9       On the other hand, AGG, while professing to be remorseful, had esc alated his sexual offenc es from outrage of modesty to rape and had assaulted B when she c onfronted him instead of feeling shame and remorse. 

10     In the c irc umstanc es and being mindful of his young age, I sentenc ed AGG to 12 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the c ane on eac h of the c harges under s 376(1) and one year’s imprisonment and three strokes of the c ane for the c harge under s 354 of the Penal Code. While the sentenc e of ten years’ imprisonment on eac h of the s 376(2) c harges in _PP v S_ might appear lower than that of 12 years’ imprisonment for eac h of the s 376(1) c harges in the present c ase before me, it must be remembered that in _PP v S_ , I had ordered the two stiffest sentenc es to run c onsec utively making a total of 20 years whereas I was not minded to do that for the present c ase. Ac c ordingly, the total imprisonment for AGG was in fac t 13 years’ imprisonment, _ie_ , the sentenc e of one year for the sixth c harge (under s 354) was to run c onsec utively with the sentenc e of 12 years for the sec ond c harge (under s 376(1)) whic h was in turn to c ommenc e from 4 June 2009, the date of remand. On the totality princ iple, I was of the view that the c onduc t of the ac c used person in _PP v S_ was more heinous than that of AGG. This explains why the total imprisonment for AGG was less than that in _PP v S_. 

11     As for eac h of the seventh to ninth c harges, I sentenc ed AGG to a fine of $600 and in default, six days’ imprisonment. I added the mandatory disqualific ation from holding or obtaining a driving lic enc e under the Road Traffic Ac t (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) for 12 months from the date of c onvic tion, _ie_ , 19 February 2010 for the ninth c harge. 

12     AGG has filed an appeal against the sentenc e.
