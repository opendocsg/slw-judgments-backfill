**Introduction** 

1       This was an applic ation by the plaintiff to set aside the adjudic ation determination dated 11 September 2014 (“the AD”) in SOP/AA 240 of 2014 under the Building and Construc tion Industry Sec urity of Payment Ac t (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the SOPA”). An unusual feature of the c ase was that the defendant did not deny that the adjudic ator had ac ted outside his powers when he determined that the plaintiff, who was the _claimant_ in the adjudic ation, shall pay the defendant, who was the _respondent_ , a sum of $141,508.56. Nevertheless, the defendant argued that the AD should not be set aside. 

2       After hearing the arguments of the parties, I set aside the AD. The defendant has appealed against my dec ision. I now give my reasons. 

**Background** 

3       The plaintiff was engaged as a sub-c ontrac tor by the defendant for a projec t. On 7 July 2014, 

the plaintiff submitted a progress c laim for the sum of $561,693.14. [note: 1] On 25 July 2014, the 

defendant issued a payment response for the amount of negative $155,891.63. [note: 2] As the defendant was not making the payments that the plaintiff felt that it was entitled to, the plaintiff lodged an Adjudic ation Applic ation on 12 August 2014. The defendant lodged the Adjudic ation 

Response on 20 August 2014. [note: 3] 

4       On 11 September 2014, the adjudic ator rendered the AD and made the following determinations: 

 (a) The plaintiff shall pay the defendant the adjudic ated sum of $141,508.56 (“the Sum”). [note: 4] 

 (b) The c ost of the adjudic ation, being the adjudic ation applic ation fee of $642.00 and the adjudic ator’s fee of $14,124.00, to be borne by the plaintiff and the defendant in the proportion 


 of 80:20 respec tively. [note: 5] 

 (c ) A simple interest of 1% shall run from 29 August 2014 at the rate of 1% per annum on any part of the Sum whic h remains unpaid until the same is paid. [note: 6] 

5       On 12 September 2014, the plaintiff asked the defendant to c onsent to the setting aside of the 

AD. [note: 7] On 16 September 2014, the defendant replied in a letter (“the 16 Sep Letter”) to state that it will not ask the plaintiff to make payment of the Sum, but added that it would also not 

c onsent to any applic ation by the plaintiff to set aside the AD. [note: 8] These c orrespondenc es were made _via_ letters between the parties’ solic itors. 

6       On 29 September 2014, the plaintiff filed the present originating summons to set aside the AD. 

7       The plaintiff and the defendant were in the midst of arbitration proc eedings when the 

adjudic ation applic ation was lodged. [note: 9] 

**Whether the adjudicator had acted** **_ultra vires_** 

8       I begin by disposing of the first issue. It was c lear that the adjudic ator had exc eeded his jurisdic tion in determining that the plaintiff (the sub-c ontrac tor) had to pay the defendant (the main c ontrac tor) the Sum and that interest was payable on any part of the Sum whic h remained unpaid. 

9       Sec tion 17 of the SOPA sets out the adjudic ator’s powers in relation to determining an adjudic ation applic ation. In partic ular, s 17(2) of the SOPA states: 

 (2) An adjudic ator shall, in relation to an adjudic ation applic ation, determine — 

 ( a ) the adjudic ated amount (if any) to be paid by the respondent to the claimant ; 

 ( b ) the date on whic h the adjudic ated amount is payable; 

 ( c ) the interest payable on the adjudic ated amount; and 

 ( d ) the proportion of the c osts of the adjudic ation payable by eac h party to the adjudic ation, 

 and shall inc lude, in the determination, the reasons therefor. 

 [emphasis added] 

10     Under s 17(2)( _a_ ), the adjudic ator may determine the amount to be paid by the _respondent_ to t h e _claimant_. The plaintiff was the c laimant in the adjudic ation while the defendant was the respondent. By determining that the plaintiff should make payment to the defendant, the adjudic ator had ac ted in exc ess of the powers c onferred upon him by the SOPA. 

11     Quite rightly, the defendant’s solic itors did not dispute this. They c andidly admitted that the adjudic ator fell into error in this respec t. They ac c epted that under the SOPA, the c laimant either gets a nil amount or he gets paid. The adjudic ator has no power to determine that the plaintiff is to 

_refund_ the defendant for the amount that the latter allegedly overpaid the former. [note: 10] As stated in Chow Kok Fong, _Security of Payments and Construction Adjudication_ (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013) at 


para 16.63: 

 ... upon the c onstruc tion of sec tion 17(2) of the Singapore SOP Ac t, an adjudic ator c an either dismiss a c laim or award a sum in favour of the c laimant in an adjudic ation determination. This arises c learly from the stipulation that the adjudic ated amount is to be determined by the adjudic ator. This is desc ribed in sec tion 17(2)(a) as ‘the adjudic ated amount (if any) to be paid by the respondent to the c laimant’. Thus, while an adjudic ator may determine the entitlement of the respondent to c ounterc laims and set-offs – suc h as deduc tions for liquidated damages, bac k c harges and sums expended for rec tifying defec ts – and set these off against the amount to whic h the c laimant is otherwise entitled, he has no mandate to order any amount to be paid to a respondent by the claimant. It follows that, under the Singapore SOP Ac t, even if the adjudic ator determines that the aggregate of a respondent’s set-offs and c ounterc laims exc eeds the amount determined in favour of the c laimant, the best result for a respondent in an adjudication is a determination by the adjudicator that the claimant is not entitled to be paid any part of the subject payment claim. 

 [emphasis added] 

**Whether there were “live issues” between the parties** 

12     Notwithstanding this c onc ession, the defendant nevertheless argued that the AD should not be set aside. Its first argument was that there were no live issues between the parties. The defendant relied on the 16 Sep Letter wherein the defendant had stated that the plaintiff would not be asked to make payment of the Sum, whic h meant that the adjudic ator’s error had no adverse financ ial effec t on the plaintiff. It would not have mattered one iota whether the outc ome was in the plaintiff’s favour 

or otherwise. [note: 11] 

13     The defendant referred to _Attorney-General v Joo Yee Construction Pte Ltd (in liquidation)_ <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR(R) 165</span> (“ _Joo Yee Construction_ ”) where it was held at [14] that: 

 ... a c ourt will not undertake to dec ide on issues, whic h if dec ided in the appellant's favour, will not gain him “something whic h he would not gain if he lost”, and will not dec ide on issues simply to have a dec ision that will be useful for similar c ases in the future. 

14     The fac ts of _Joo Yee Construction_ were somewhat unusual. The appellant in that c ase was the AttorneyGeneral, who was representing the Ministry of Health (“MOH”). The respondent had entered into a building c ontrac t with MOH to c onstruc t a hospital building. After the respondent went into liquidation, MOH made direc t payments to four nominated subc ontrac tors pursuant to the terms of the building c ontrac t. An issue arose as to whether direc t payments to the four nominated subc ontrac tors by MOH would c ontravene the c ombined operation of ss 280(1) and 327(2) of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 1988 Rev Ed). The High Court held that the payments were indeed in c ontravention of the Companies Ac t and held that suc h payments would be void as against the respondent’s liquidators. The AttorneyGeneral appealed, but the four nominated subc ontrac tors either did not appeal or withdrew their appeals. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that there were no longer any live issues ( _Joo Yee Construction_ at [10] and [15]): 

 10 ... The real issue in this c ase was not whether the c ontrac tual obligations survived following the liquidation of the respondents but whether, firstly, the parties c ould c ontrac t out of the insolvenc y laws and sec ondly, whether in the instant c ase payments direc t to the nominated subc ontrac tors would c ontravene the insolvenc y laws. That issue was no longer an issue when the c ourt ruled that a direc t payment to the nominated subc ontrac tors would c ontravene ss 


 280(1) and 327(2) of the Ac t and the four nominated subc ontrac tors ac c epted the c ourt's ruling by withdrawing or not proc eeding with their appeals. In so far as the Ministry of Health was c onc erned, its interest in this issue c eased to exist onc e the c ourt had ruled on the issue and the four nominated subc ontrac tors had ac c epted the c ourt's ruling by withdrawing or not proc eeding with their appeals. The Ministry of Health c ould not thereafter be prejudic ed or be exposed to the risk of litigation at either the instanc e of the respondents or the four nominated subc ontrac tors if it ac ted in ac c ordanc e with the ruling of the c ourt. Ac c ordingly in our view there was no live issue in this appeal. 

 ... 

 15 ... Applying these princ iples to this appeal the Ministry of Health's liability to pay the amounts c ertified under the building c ontrac t would not be affec ted one bit whether the Ministry of Health suc c eeded in the appeal or not. If the Ministry of Health suc c eeds in the appeal it would be able to pay the amounts c ertified under the building c ontrac t direc t to the four nominated subc ontrac tors but what does the Ministry of Health gain by it? Nothing in our view. The parties who are in ac tual c ontroversy, namely, the four nominated subc ontrac tors, and who would gain something if the respondents lost are not before this c ourt, they having ac c epted the judgment of the c ourt of first instanc e. 

15     It is useful now to set out the c ontents the 16 Sep Letter. The defendant’s solic itors had written as follows: 

 ... 

 We c onfirm that our c lients do not intend to ask your c lients to make payment under paragraph 3(a) of Mr Leong’s Adjudic ation Determination. As c onfirmed by Mr Leong’s Adjudic ation Determination, your c lients have been overpaid. At the c onc lusion of the arbitration in SIAC Arb 87 of 2014, our c lients will be c ollec ting the amount overpaid, together with interest at 5.33% per annum from c ommenc ement of arbitration. 

 If your c lients c hoose to proc eed with an applic ation to set aside the adjudic ation determination, our c lients will not stop your c lients, neither will our c lients c onsent to the applic ation. We will make the nec essary arguments at the setting aside forum if indeed there is going to be suc h an applic ation. 

16     The fac ts of the present c ase were hardly on par with those of _Joo Yee Construction_. For one, both parties with a real financ ial interest in the matter were before the c ourt. Nor was this a c ase where the party seeking a remedy was protec ted against further litigation by the effec t of an order of c ourt. Until the AD was set aside, the potential for the plaintiff to be sued on it remained a real prospec t. It was not at all unreasonable for the plaintiff to seek rec ourse in a c ourt of law rather than to rely on the assuranc e of the defendant that it did not “intend to ask [the plaintiff ] to make payment” of the Sum. Whatever the legal effec t of the representations made in the 16 Sep Letter, it c ertainly did not render the legality of the AD _purely academic_. Indeed, the plaintiff had argued that it was the defendant whic h had a c ollateral purpose in objec ting to set aside the AD whic h was c learly wrong, _ie_ , to prevent the plaintiff from applying for further adjudic ation. It was therefore plain that there were live issues to be adjudic ated upon. 

**The court’s jurisdiction** 

17     The plaintiff relied on s 27(5) of the SOPA and/or the inherent jurisdic tion of the c ourt as the 


basis for it to apply to set aside the AD. [note: 12] In this regard, the defendant argued that s 27(5) of the SOPA did not permit the plaintiff to make the present applic ation. Sec tion 27 of the SOPA provides as follows: 

 Enforcement of adjudication determination as judgment debt, etc. 

27\. — (1) An adjudic ation determination made under this Ac t may, with leave of the c ourt, be enforc ed in the same manner as a judgment or an order of the c ourt to the same effec t. 

 (2) Where leave of the c ourt is so granted, judgment may be entered in the terms of the adjudic ation determination. 

 (3) An applic ation for leave to enforc e an adjudic ation determination may not be filed in c ourt under this sec tion unless it is ac c ompanied by an affidavit by the applic ant stating that the whole or part of the adjudic ated amount has not been paid at the time the applic ation is filed. 

 (4) If the affidavit referred to in subsec tion (3) indic ates that part of the adjudic ated amount has been paid, the judgment shall be for the unpaid part of the adjudic ated amount. 

 (5) Where any party to an adjudic ation c ommenc es proc eedings to set aside the adjudic ation determination or the judgment obtained pursuant to this sec tion, he shall pay into the c ourt as sec urity the unpaid portion of the adjudic ated amount that he is required to pay, in suc h manner as the c ourt direc ts or as provided in the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5), pending the final determination of those proc eedings. 

18     The defendant submitted that it is only a _respondent_ in an adjudic ation applic ation who c an avail himself of s 27(5) of the SOPA to file an applic ation to set aside an adjudic ation determination. Its arguments may be summed up as follows: 

 (a) Sec tion 27(5) makes it mandatory for anyone who wishes to set aside an adjudic ation determination to pay the adjudic ated amount into c ourt. 

 (b) The purpose for suc h payment is to deter ingenious respondents who have unmeritorious c omplaints from launc hing setting aside applic ations with the dominant purpose of dragging out the time to make payment. 

 (c ) Ac c ordingly, the plaintiff, being the c laimant in the adjudic ation applic ation, c annot avail himself of s 27(5) to make the present applic ation. 

19     As it turned out, this fac et of the dispute is now moot as the Court of Appeal has held in _Citiwall Safety Glass Pte Ltd v Mansource Interior Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2014] SGCA 61</span> (“ _Citiwall_ ”), a judgment that was handed down on 27 November 2014 _after_ I heard the parties, that a c ourt exerc ises its supervisory jurisdic tion in hearing and determining an applic ation to set aside an adjudic ation determination ( _Citiwall_ at [41]). It is unthinkable that this jurisdic tion is only exerc isable when the respondent makes the applic ation, and in any event, it is plain from s 27(5) that “ _any party to an adjudication_ ” may apply to set aside an adjudic ation determination. 

20     For c ompleteness, I will also deal with the question whether the plaintiff has to make payment into c ourt as sec urity for the unpaid portion of the Sum pursuant to s 27(5) of the SOPA. The plaintiff had taken the view that it did not need to do so as the “adjudic ated amount” refers to an amount 

payable by the _respondent_ to the _claimant_ in an adjudic ation. [note: 13] 


21     I have partially dealt with the meaning of “adjudic ated amount” at [8] to [11] above, but I will add to the analysis here. Sec tion 27(5) of the SOPA imposes a requirement for an applic ant seeking to set aside an adjudic ation determination to “pay into the c ourt as sec urity the unpaid portion of the _adjudicated amount_ that he is required to pay”. Under s 2 of the SOPA, the words “adjudic ated amount” is defined as “the amount of a progress payment that is determined to be payable under sec tion 17 or 19, as the c ase may be”. It is c lear from ss 17(2)( _a_ ) and 19(5)( _a_ ) that the “adjudic ated amount” c an only be referring to payments determined to be made by the respondent _to_ the c laimant. A c laimant is defined under s 2 as “a person who is or c laims to be entitled to a progress payment under sec tion 5”, and s 5 in turn states that “Any person who has c arried out any c onstruc tion work, or supplied any goods or servic es, under a c ontrac t is entitled to a progress payment”. Finally, a respondent is defined under s 2 as “a person who is or may be liable to make a progress payment under a c ontrac t to a c laimant”. 

22     So any sums that had to be paid by the _claimant_ to the _respondent_ would not c onstitute the “adjudic ated amount” that is referred to in s 27(5) of the SOPA. As a result, if a c laimant, suc h as the plaintiff, applies to set aside an adjudic ation determination, there is no need for him to pay into c ourt any sec urity pursuant to s 27(5). Suc h was the c ase here. 

23     For the reasons above, I set aside the AD. I made no order as to c osts.
