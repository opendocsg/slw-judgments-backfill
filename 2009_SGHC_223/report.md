_Companies_ 

30 September 2009 Judgment reserved. 

**Kan Ting Chiu J:** 

1       The plaintiffs are two direc tors/shareholders of a c ompany, Hiap Seng & Co Pte Ltd (“the c ompany”). They are applying for leave under s 216A of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) to bring an ac tion in the name of the c ompany against three other direc tors/shareholders of the c ompany. 

2       All the individual parties are members of the same family, although the family name is spelt variously as Law, Lau and Lew. The patriarc h of the family, Lew Huat Leng, set up a business with the name of Hiap Seng & Co in the 1940s. The c ompany was inc orporated in 1976 and it eventually took over and expanded on the business of Hiap Seng & Co. The patriarc h died in 1980. 

3       The plaintiffs are Law Chin Eng (“LCE”) and Lau Chin Whatt (“LCW”). I shall refer to them individually as the first plaintiff and sec ond plaintiff respec tively. The three direc tors/shareholders who are the proposed defendants are Lau Chin Hu (“LCH”), Lew Kiat Beng (“LKB”) and Law Chin Chai (“LCC”), and they have been direc tors of the c ompany sinc e 1979. I shall refer to them individually as the first to third proposed defendants respec tively. 

4       The plaintiffs, the first proposed defendant and the third proposed defendant are the sons of Lew Huat Leng. LKB, the sec ond proposed defendant, is their nephew and the son of the patriarc h’s dec eased eldest son, Lim Chin Hwa. Lim Chin Hwa managed the c ompany up to his death in 2001, when his son LKB took over. Eac h of the four surviving sons, as well as the estate of Lew Chin Hwa holds 16.82% of the shares of the c ompany, while LKB holds 15.9%. The c ompany is a family c ompany with the shareholders split into two c amps in this applic ation. 

5       The proposed ac tion is founded on the proposed defendants’ breac h of fiduc iary duties to the c ompany as its direc tors. In para 8 of the draft statement of c laim, six heads of c omplaints of breac hes of fiduc iary duties were set out: 

 a. The Defendants had c aused the Plaintiff to enter into fic titious transac tions with one Hawker Enterprise Ltd (“Hawker”). 


i. Sometime in 2001, the Plaintiff obtained various c redit fac ilities totalling $5,400,000 from United Overseas Bank Ltd. Of these fac ilities, $3,900,000 was in the form of an overdraft (the “OD Fac ility”). Properties of the Plaintiff were mortgaged to the Bank to obtain the said fac ilities. Eac h of the direc tors, inc luding Law Chin Eng and Lau Chin Whatt, had also given personal guarantees as sec urity. 

ii. Sometime in Dec ember 2001, the Defendants used money drawn from the OD Fac ility to proc ure payment by the Plaintiff of a sum of $4,406,589.23 (by way of a c ash c heque drawn on ICB Bank – c heque number 085878) to Hawker. No approval was sought nor rec eived from the other direc tors and shareholders of the Plaintiff in respec t of the use of the OD Fac ility in this manner or of the payment of this sum to Hawker. This payment was not part of the ordinary business of the Plaintiff. 

iii. Sometime in January 2002, the 1st and 2nd Defendants c aused to be rec orded 

 in the Plaintiff’s books that eac h of them had lent the Plaintiff $2,000, purportedly to enable the Plaintiff to repay the OD Fac ility. 

iv. In Dec ember 2002, the Defendants proc ured the Plaintiff to pay the 1st 

 Defendant and 2nd Defendant eac h the sum of $2,000,000, in purported repayment of the said ‘loans’ (by way of c heque numbers UOB 567482, 220841 and 220842). No c onsent or approval was sought from the other direc tors and shareholders. 

v. These transac tions and payments were only disc overed muc h later during the inspec tion of ac c ounts whic h was c onduc ted by Lau Chin Whatt between 7 September 2005 and 27 September 2005. 

vi. On or about 30 November 2005, the 2nd Defendant verbally informed Lau Chin 

 Whatt that the transac tion with Hawker was used for ac c ounting purposes as a form of tax avoidanc e. In a letter dated 23 Dec ember 2006, the 2nd Defendant admitted that Hawker was a fic titious entity invented for the purposes of tax evasion. 

b. The Defendants c aused irregular and/or unauthorized payments and/or withdrawals of monies to be made from the Plaintiff’s bank ac c ounts. 

i. Sometime in Dec ember 2001, the Defendants proc ured the withdrawal of the sum of $487,405.99 from the Plaintiff’s ac c ount. The ac c ounts show that out of this sum of $487,405.99, $63,051.92 was paid to the 1st Defendant, $268,187.32 was paid to the 2nd Defendant and $98,000.00 was paid to the 3 rd Defendant. Law Chin Eng was to rec eive $53,166.75 out of this alleged payment of $487,405.99. However, Law Chin Eng never rec eived this payment. There was no explanation on rec ord of the purpose of these payments. Further, the balanc e sum of $5000 from the withdrawn amount of $487,405. appeared to be c ompletely unac c ounted for. 


ii. As with the fic titious transac tion with Hawker mentioned above, these payments and/or withdrawals were only disc overed muc h later during the inspec tion of ac c ounts whic h was c onduc ted by Lau Chin Whatt between 7 September 2005 and 27 September 2005. 

iii. The 2nd Defendant used $2 million of the Plaintiff’s monies to purc hase a 

 property in Marsiling, Singapore, without any proper valuation. No approval was sought and none was rec eived from the other direc tors and/or shareholders of the Plaintiff in respec t of the said purc hase. Sometime in the sec ond half of 2004, the 2nd Defendant verbally admitted to Lau Chin Whatt that he had unilaterally withdrawn the sum of $2 million from the Plaintiff’s ac c ount for this purpose. The property was transferred on 30 Dec ember 2003 into the name of Winstant & Co Pte Ltd, a c ompany whose shareholders and direc tors were the 2 nd Defendant and the 2nd Defendant’s brother, although part of the purc hase pric e in the sum of S$2 million c ame from the Plaintiff. This property was subsequently sold on 9 Marc h 2007 to one HSBC Institutional Trust Servic es (Singapore) Limited at the pric e of $18,008,800. Sometime in about 2005, the 2 nd Defendant informed Lau Chin Whatt that this property did not belong to the Plaintiff, notwithstanding the fac t that S$2 million was taken from the Plaintiff as aforesaid. 

iv. The 2nd Defendant had proc ured the purc hase by the Plaintiff of a property in 

 Shenzhen without any proper valuation. No approval was sought and none was rec eived from the other direc tors and/or shareholders of the Plaintiff in respec t of the said purc hase. 

c. The Defendants generated fraudulent and/or fic titious transac tions with one Drilbo World Trade Sdn Bhd (“Drilbo”) 

i. On various oc c asions in 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2001 and 2002, the Defendants had generated fic titious trades between the Plaintiff and Drilbo. Drilbo is a c ompany in whic h Lau Chin Whatt and his son, Lau Kiat Boon, are direc tors. At all material times, Lau Chin Whatt and his son, Lau Kiat Boon, were not involved in any of the affairs or day to day running of Drilbo, whic h was managed and run by the 2nd Defendant sinc e 1985. The fic titious trades were c onduc ted without the knowledge and/or approval of Lau Chin Whatt and his son, Lau Kiat Boon. 

ii. These fic titious trades were only disc overed during the inspec tion of the Plaintiff’s ac c ounts by Lau Chin Whatt in September 2005 and subsequently disc overed by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. 


iii. On or about 30 November 2005, Lau Chin Whatt, c onfronted the 2nd Defendant 

 with respec t to the fic titious trades between the Plaintiff and Drilbo. On or about 17 Dec ember 2005, Lau Chin Whatt c onfronted all the Defendants with respec t to the fic titious trades between the Plaintiff and Drilbo. The Defendants gave a vague explanation that Drilbo was used to “fac ilitate various things” when c onfronted with this issue. 

iv. The 2nd Defendant also verbally admitted during the Plaintiff’s board of 

 direc tors meeting held on 17 Dec ember 2005 that Drilbo was intended to be used “as a dec oy”. 

v. The 2nd Defendant had also c aused one Ms Stella Tai (one of the Plaintiff’s 

 employees), to forge Lau Chin Whatt’s signature on doc uments purporting to support the fic titious transac tions with Drilbo. These fic titious transac tions were then booked into the ac c ounts of the Plaintiff to c reate an appearanc e of genuine c ommerc ial sales. The 2nd Defendant then proc ured invoic es to be issued by Drilbo and payment to be made by the Plaintiff in respec t of these invoic es. The 2nd and 3rd Defendants then proc ured that payments by the Plaintiff were in the form of c ash c heques whic h were subsequently c ashed by the 2nd Defendant himself. These ac tions were done without Lau Chin Whatt’s knowledge or c onsent. 

vi. On or about 30 November 2005, the 2nd Defendant verbally admitted to Lau 

 Chin Whatt that he knew about Ms Stella Tai’s forging of Lau Chin Whatt’s signature. 

d. The 1st and 2nd Defendants had generated fic titious trades between the Plaintiff and 

 one Manfield Company (“Manfield”), a c ompany inc orporated in Hong Kong and having its registered address at Rm 2 Bloc k B, 8/F, Honour Building, 78K, Tokwawan Road, Kowloon Hong Kong. This was admitted by all three Defendants during the aforesaid meeting on 17 Dec ember 2005. 

e. The 1st and 2nd Defendants had also generated fic titious trades between the Plaintiff 

 and one Aic hi & Co Pte Ltd (“Aic hi”) whose direc tors are Wong Ngok Kiew Magdalene (the wife of the 1st Defendant), Lee Aik (the mother of 2nd Defendant), the 1st Defendant and Law Chin Eng. At all times, Law Chin Eng was not involved in any of the affairs or day to day running of Aic hi, whic h was also managed and run by the 1st and 2nd Defendants. The fic titious trades were generated without the knowledge or c onsent of Law Chin Eng or Lau Chin Whatt. 

f. There were numerous other improper and/or irregular transac tions, ac ts and/or ac c ounting of the Plaintiff’s assets c arried out by the Defendants in the c ourse of managing and/or operating the Plaintiff’s business or affairs. 


i. The 2nd Defendant forged Lau Chin Whatt’s signature on some of the Plaintiff’s 

 c orporate resolutions and doc uments without his c onsent and/or approval. On or about 7 September 2005 the 2nd Defendant verbally admitted this to Lau Chin Whatt. 

ii. In Dec ember 2004, when the Plaintiff dec lared and paid out dividends, Lau Chin Whatt did not rec eive his share of the dividends despite it being rec orded in the Plaintiff’s books that he had. Lau Chin Whatt only rec eived his share of the dividends in late May 2005 after making repeated demands for the same. 

iii. The 1st and 2nd Defendants have ignored repeated demands to produc e the 

 ac c ounts of the Plaintiff c ompany and its statutory rec ords for inspec tion by Lau Chin Whatt until sometime in September 2005 after he threatened to take legal ac tion. 

iv. From 2002 up to late Dec ember 2006, the 1st and 2nd Defendants had 

 c onsistently failed to notify Law Chin Eng and Lau Chin Whatt of several board or shareholders’ meetings of the Plaintiff c ompany. 

v. The 1st and 2nd Defendants had used the Plaintiff’s funds to purc hase a 

 property known as 94 Tokwawan Road #03-12, Hong Kong. However, notwithstanding that the Plaintiff’s money was used to purc hase this property, the Defendants have, despite numerous requests by Lau Chin Whatt, failed, neglec ted and/or refused to give an ac c ount of this property (inc luding but not limited to the value thereof ) and/or any inc ome whic h may have been derived from this property to the Plaintiff and/or its other direc tors. 

vi. Sometime in early 2006, the Defendants c aused the Plaintiff to file the annual returns for year 2002 without having laid the ac c ounts therein before the Plaintiff and the full board of direc tors at the Annual General Meeting. The 2nd Defendant had persuaded the c ompany sec retary of the Plaintiff at the material time to file the annual returns on the Plaintiff’s behalf for the year 2002 although the requisite signature of the direc tors of the Plaintiff had not been obtained. The 2nd Defendant assured the Plaintiff’s c ompany sec retary that the 2nd Defendant would obtain the requisite signatures from all the Plaintiff’s direc tors after the returns had been filed. 

vii. The Plaintiff’s ac c ounts were not properly audited as the Defendants wanted 

 to evade tax. This was verbally admitted by the 1st Defendant at a meeting of the Plaintiff’s board of direc tors held sometime in late Dec ember 2005 or early 2006. 

g. There 2nd Defendant had proc ured the Plaintiff to c ommit tax evasion in breac h of 

 various provisions of the Inc ome Tax Ac t. 


 i. By reason of the matters stated above in paragraphs 8(a) to (c ), the Plaintiff has been and is c urrently subjec t to investigation by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) and is exposed to sanc tions under the Inc ome Tax Ac t. 

The sec ond plaintiff filed an affidavit whic h set out the c irc umstanc es in whic h the alleged breac hes were c ommitted and disc overed. In the affidavit, the sec ond plaintiff revealed that the IRAS investigations related to the c ompany’s fic tional transac tions with Drilbo had resulted in the c ompany having to make payment of $2,562,614.85 in unpaid taxes and $4,573,167.33 as a c omposition fine. 

6       All three proposed defendants opposed the applic ation. The first and third proposed defendants are represented by one firm of solic itors while the sec ond proposed defendant is represented by another firm. 

7       The plaintiffs’ and the proposed defendants’ arguments on the applic ation are c entred around the requirements of s 216A(3), that: 

 No ac tion may be brought and no intervention in an ac tion may be made under subsec tion (2) unless the Court is satisfied that — 

 (a) the c omplainant has given 14 days’ notic e to the direc tors of the c ompany of his intention to apply to the Court under subsec tion (2) if the direc tors of the c ompany do not bring, diligently prosec ute or defend or disc ontinue the ac tion; 

 (b) the c omplainant is ac ting in good faith; and 

 (c ) it appears to be prima fac ie in the interests of the c ompany that the ac tion be brought, prosec uted, defended or disc ontinued. 

8       The proposed defendants resisted the plaintiffs’ applic ation on the ground that it was another c hapter in the longstanding feud between the plaintiffs and the proposed defendants, whic h had already resulted in a pending ac tion in Suit No 839 of 2006 (“S 839”). They c ontended firstly that this applic ation was not made in good faith; sec ondly, that the proposed ac tion was not in the interests of the c ompany; and thirdly, that winding up the c ompany was an appropriate remedy to the plaintiffs’ grievanc es. 

9       S 839 was taken out by the same plaintiffs as in this ac tion. The defendants are LCH, LCC, LKB, the c ompany, and a c ompany named Winstant Holding Pte Ltd. In the suit, the plaintiffs alleged that there was an undoc umented “Lau Family Trust” set up for the benefit of the members of the family, whic h c overed a range of assets the plaintiffs alleged were ac quired from the assets of the family whic h they c all the “Family Assets”. They c laim to be benefic iaries under the trust. 

10     S 839 in its original form also inc luded a c laim that LCH, LCC and LKB had breac hed their fiduc iary duties as direc tors of the c ompany. Tan Lee Meng J struc k out those c laims on the grounds that: the wrongs pleaded were done to the c ompany; the resultant loses were suffered by the c ompany; and the c ompany had a c ause of ac tion in respec t of these alleged wrongs. Thus, under “the proper c laimant rule” otherwise known as the rule in _Foss v Harbottle_ (1843) 2 Hare 461; 67 ER 189, the proper plaintiff was the c ompany and not LCE and LCW as shareholders and direc tors of the c ompany. The appeal from Tan J’s judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. 


**Section 216A** 

11     Sec tion 216A rec eived the attention of the Court of Appeal in _Pang Yong Hock v PKS Contracts Services Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2004] 3 SLR 1</span> (“ _Pang Yong Hock_ ”). The Court referred to earlier dec isions of the High Court in _Teo Gek Luang v Ng Ai Tiong_ <span class="citation">[1999] 1 SLR 434</span> (“ _Teo Gek Luang_ ”) and _Agus Irawan v Toh Teck Chye_ <span class="citation">[2002] 2 SLR 198</span> (“ _Agus Irawan_ ”) with approval. In _Teo Gek Luang_ , Lai Kew Chai J held at [15] that when an applic ation under s 216A was made: 

 [T]he c ourt at the leave stage was not c alled upon to adjudic ate on the disputes of fac ts and inferenc es, relying merely on affidavit evidenc e. Those matters would be for trial. The c ourt had to see if there was prima fac ie merit to it. 

Similarly, in _Agus Irawan_ , where the question was where the burden to prove good faith lay, Choo Han Tec k JC held that it was for the party opposing the s 216A applic ation to show that it was not made in good faith. 

12     The Court of Appeal explained at [19] of _Pang Yong Hock_ that s 216A was enac ted: 

 for the protec tion of genuinely aggrieved minority interests and for doing justic e to a c ompany while ensuring that the c ompany’s direc tors are not unduly hampered in their management dec isions by loud but unreasonable dissidents attempting to drive the c orporate vehic le from the bac k seat. 

13     Regarding the “good faith” requirement in ss (3)(b), the Court held at [20] that: 

 The best way of demonstrating good faith is to show a legitimate c laim whic h the direc tors are unreasonably reluc tant to pursue with the appropriate vigour or at all. Naturally, the parties opposing a s 216A applic ation will seek to show that the applic ation is motivated by an ulterior purpose, suc h as dislike, ill-feeling or other personal reasons, rather than by the applic ant’s c onc ern for the c ompany. Hostility between the fac tions involved is bound to be present in most of suc h applic ations. It is therefore generally insuffic ient evidenc e of lac k of good faith on the part of the applic ant. However, if the opposing parties are able to show that the applic ant is so motivated by vendetta, perc eived or real, that his judgment will be c louded by purely personal c onsiderations, that may be suffic ient for the c ourt to find a lac k of good faith on his part. An applic ant’s good faith would also be in doubt if he appears set on damaging or destroying the c ompany out of sheer spite or worse, for the benefit of a c ompetitor. It will also raise the question whether the intended ac tion is going to be in the interests of the c ompany at all. To this extent, there is an interplay of the requirements in s 216A(3)(b) and (c ). 

14     It went on at [21] to state that in dec iding on the “interests of the c ompany” requirement in ss (3)(c ), a c ourt must: 


 weigh all the c irc umstanc es and dec ide whether the c laim ought to be pursued. Whether the c ompany stands “to gain substantially in money or in money’s worth” ( per Choo JC in Agus Irawan ) relates more to the issue of whether it is in the interests of the c ompany to pursue the c laim rather than whether the c laim is meritorious or not. A $100 c laim may be meritorious but it may not be expedient to c ommenc e an ac tion for it. The c ompany may have genuine c ommerc ial c onsiderations for not wanting to pursue c ertain c laims. Perhaps it does not want to damage a good, long-term, profitable relationship. It c ould also be that it does not wish to generate bad public ity for itself bec ause of some important negotiations whic h are underway. 

The interests of a c ompany are, of c ourse, not to be measured only in monetary terms. A c ompany may engage in litigation over matters with no monetary implic ation, e.g. its employment polic y. 

15     The Court added at [22] that in dec iding whether to approve an applic ation for leave to c ommenc e a derivative ac tion: 

 the c ourt should also c onsider whether there is another adequate remedy available, suc h as the winding up of the c ompany ( Barrett v Duckett [1995] 1 BCLC 243). 

**Good faith** 

16     The first proposed defendant averred in his affidavit that the proposed derivative ac tion was motivated by the sec ond plaintiff’s personal vendetta against the proposed defendants. The first proposed defendant then went on to set out a history of the alleged ac rimony going bac k to the mid1990s. 

17     The sec ond proposed defendant in his affidavit deposed that the sec ond plaintiff had, in 2004, wanted the proposed defendants to buy him out of the c ompany on his terms. The proposed defendants found his terms unreasonable and rejec ted them. The sec ond proposed defendant c ontended that the sole motivating fac tor in this applic ation was to c oerc e the proposed defendants to ac c ept those terms. 

18     There is no doubt that there had been serious disagreements between the plaintiffs (partic ularly the sec ond plaintiff ) and the proposed defendants (partic ularly the sec ond proposed defendant) for more than a dec ade. There is still a strong degree of distrust and personal hostility between them. But suc h sentiments, however deep, do not c onstitute bad faith. As the Court of Appeal had explained in _Pang Yong Hock_ at [20]: 

 Hostility between the fac tions involved is bound to be present in most of suc h applic ations. It is therefore generally insuffic ient evidenc e of lac k of good faith on the part of the applic ant. However, if the opposing parties are able to show that the applic ant is so motivated by vendetta, perc eived or real, that his judgment will be c louded by purely personal c onsiderations, that may be suffic ient for the c ourt to find a lac k of good faith on his part. 

19     The good faith requirement for making an applic ation for leave to bring an ac tion in the name of a c ompany is satisfied when the applic ant is shown to be ac ting in the interests of the c ompany. As the purpose of derivative ac tions is to promote the interests of the c ompany, a personal dislike for the proposed defendants will not defeat suc h an applic ation unless the applic ation is merely an 


extension of that animosity and is not made with the intention to promote or protec t the c ompany’s interests. 

20     The derivative ac tion provisions in our Companies Ac t are modelled on the provisions in the Canada Business Corporations Ac t R.S.C. 1985, c. C–44. Sec tion 216A(2) and (3) of our Ac t are similar to s 239(1) and (2) of the Canadian ac t. For this reason, dec isions on the relevant Canadian provisions are useful guides to the c onstruc tion of our provisions. In _Intercontinental Precious Metals Inc. v Cooke_ [1994] 4 WWR 66, a dec ision of the British Columbia Supreme Court, Tysoe J ruled that the fac t that there is a shareholder battle does not lead to the inferenc e that an applic ation is motivated by bad faith. In _Primex Investments Ltd v Northwest Sports Enterprises Ltd_ [1996] 4 WWR 54, another dec ision of the British Columbia Supreme Court, Tysoe J held that in a situation where an applic ant was ac ting out of self-interest in wanting to prosec ute a derivative ac tion in the name of a c ompany, and the applic ant’s self-interest c oinc ided with the interests of the c ompany, the applic ant’s self-interest did not mean that his applic ation was made in bad faith. 

21     A derivative ac tion c an be struc k out if it is not prosec uted in good faith. In _Barrett v Duckett & Ors_ [1995] 1 BCLC 243 (“Barrett”), the English Court of Appeal struc k out a derivative ac tion brought by a shareholder of a c ompany against her former son-in-law and his wife by a subsequent marriage. Peter Gibson LJ found, at 245, that: 

 On its fac e it is an ac tion brought by a shareholder to right grievous wrongs done to the c ompany of whic h she is a shareholder. But unfortunately the c irc umstanc es in whic h the ac tion is brought and pursued inc lude a bitter matrimonial dispute between the plaintiff’s daughter and the primary defendant. That bitterness appears to have infec ted dec isions taken in relation to these proc eedings, added to whic h there has been a notable lac k of realism on the part of the plaintiff and her advisers. The litigation, even though it has not progressed beyond c ertain interloc utory steps, appears to have exhausted the financ es of the plaintiff and, while the amounts c laimed for the c ompany are large, to an objec tive observer the likelihood of signific ant rec overies seems very small indeed. The two individual defendants who have been served with the proc eedings are on legal aid. The result so far is that this litigation has been ruinous to the plaintiff and has c aused heavy c osts to be inc urred by the public purse. 

22     The learned judge found that personal rather than financ ial c onsiderations appeared to be impelling the plaintiff to pursue the ac tion, and he was c onvinc ed that the plaintiff was not pursuing the ac tion bona fide on behalf of the c ompany. He struc k out the ac tion with the c onc urrenc e of Beldam LJ and Russell LJ. 

23     In the present c ase, there is a history of hostility between the plaintiffs and the proposed defendants. However, the plaintiffs c annot be said to be motivated by personal rather than financ ial c onsiderations in pursuing their disputes with the proposed defendants and the c ompany. 

24     If the proposed ac tion suc c eeds, there will be benefits to the c ompany, and to them as shareholders of the c ompany. Their good faith in making the applic ation c annot be impugned by their grievanc es over the proposed defendants’ rejec tion of their c laims in respec t of the Lau Family Trust and the Family Assets. 

**The interests of the company** 

25     A derivative ac tion is in the interests of the c ompany when it is prosec uted for the benefit of the c ompany. The benefit should be real – in monetary or other terms – in order to justify the c osts 


and effort of pursuing the ac tion when the c ompany itself had not proc eeded with the ac tion. Towards this end, an applic ant should not only identify c auses of ac tion and allege breac h of fiduc iary duties, breac h of c ontrac t, negligenc e, etc , but also show that the c ompany had sustained or may sustain real loss or damage as a result of these failures and that there are some prospec ts of obtaining relief or redress through the proposed ac tion. 

26     It is therefore nec essary to look at eac h c omplaint set out in [5], and asc ertain if it is in the c ompany’s interests to have it litigated. I will refer to eac h c omplaint as it is enumerated in para 8 of the draft statement of c laim. 

_Complaint (a)_ 

27     This c onc erns a payment of $4,406,589.23 from the c ompany’s overdraft ac c ount to the fic titious Hawker Enterprise Ltd whic h the c ompany should not have made. This is a c laim in the interests of the c ompany. 

_Complaint (b)(i)_ 

28     The c omplaint is that out of a sum of $487,405.99 withdrawn in 2001 for payments to the first plaintiff and the three proposed defendants, the first plaintiff did not rec eive his share of $53,166.75. The c omplaint is also that $5,000 of the sum withdrawn was unac c ounted for. The first plaintiff has not deposed any affidavit or made any c omplaint to the c ompany that he did not rec eive the payment. Neither plaintiff referred to the $5,000 allegedly unac c ounted for in their respec tive affidavits. It is not in the interests of the c ompany to make a c laim so bereft of substanc e. 

_Complaint (b)(iii)_ 

29     This involves the use of $2 million of the c ompany’s monies to purc hase a property in Marsiling. The property was transferred to a c ompany, the shareholders of whic h were the sec ond proposed defendant and his brother. The property was subsequently sold for more than $18 million. It is in the c ompany’s interests to pursue this c laim. 

_Complaint (b)(iv)_ 

30     The plaintiffs are unhappy that the c ompany purc hased a property in Shenzhen without a proper valuation or the c ompany’s approval. There is no allegation that the c ompany sustained loss as a result of the purc hase. The plaintiffs have not shown that it is in the interests of the c ompany to pursue this matter. 

_Complaint (c)_ 

31     This c omplaint relates to false trades between the c ompany and Drilbo, whereby the c ompany made payments to Drilbo’s invoic es for these transac tions. It is in the c ompany’s interests to sue the proposed defendants over these payments. 

_Complaints (d) and (e)_ 

32     These c omplaints relate to false transac tions with two other c ompanies, Manfield and Aic hi. However, there are no allegations that the c ompany had made payments or inc urred any liabilities in these transac tions. For this reason, the plaintiffs have not shown that it is in the c ompany’s interests to sue the proposed defendants over these transac tions. 


_Complaints (f) (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (vi) and (vii)_ 

33     These were c omplaints c onc erning the forgery of the sec ond plaintiff’s signature on c ompany doc uments, the late payment of dividends to the sec ond plaintiff, the failure to notify the plaintiffs of c ompany meetings, the filing of the c ompany’s annual returns before the c ompany’s ac c ounts were approved by the c ompany and the failure to have the c ompany’s ac c ounts properly audited. The plaintiffs made no assertion that these ac ts and omissions had plac ed the c ompany in a position where it would be in its interests to sue the proposed defendants over these matters. 

_Complaint (f) (v)_ 

34     Complaint (f ) (v) differs from c omplaints (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (vi) and (vii). It relates to the first and sec ond proposed defendants’ use of c ompany funds to purc hase a property in Hong Kong and the proposed defendants’ failure to ac c ount for this property and the inc ome generated from it. A derivative ac tion on this matter is in the interests of the c ompany. 

_Complaint (g)_ 

35     This arises out of the c ompany’s involvement in tax evasion whic h resulted in the c ompany having to pay a c omposition fine of $4,573,167.33. Sinc e the c ompany inc urred loss, this c laim whic h may result in rec overy of the loss from the proposed defendants is in the c ompany’s interests. 

**Alternative remedy of winding up** 

36     In _Pang Yong Hock_ , the Court of Appeal did not authorise a derivative ac tion and upheld the trial c ourt’s ruling that the c ompany should be wound up instead. In its dec ision, the Court of Appeal referred to and agreed with Peter Gibson LJ’s statement in _Barrett_ (at 250) that: 

 if another adequate remedy is available, the c ourt will not allow the derivative ac tion to proc eed. 

37     In _Barrett_ , a winding up petition had been filed before the derivative ac tion. In _Pang Yong Hock_ , the winding up petition had not been filed when the trial judge had dismissed the applic ation. However, it was filed by the time the appeal c ame before the Court of Appeal. 

38     The c ompany in _Barrett_ was in a deadloc k bec ause of disagreements between the two parties, eac h of whom held 50% of the c ompany’s shares. The c ompany had c eased trading and was probably insolvent. In _Pang Yong Hock_ , there was a deadloc k in the c ompany bec ause two fac tions of shareholders were unable to c o-exist. The c ompany had not filed its statutory ac c ounts or held the statutory meetings. 

39     In the present c ase, no petition has been filed. In Dec ember 2006, the sec ond proposed defendant gave notic e for the direc tors of the c ompany to resolve that the c ompany be wound up voluntarily so that “all shareholders get their share in the c ompany fairly”, but the proposal was not taken up and no further ac tion was taken. The sec ond proposed defendant did not allude to this proposal in his affidavit, and the notic e c ame up in these proc eedings only as an exhibit in the sec ond plaintiff’s affidavit. The proposed defendants have not stated in their affidavits that they intend to wind up the c ompany, nor have they stated that winding up is an appropriate solution to the disputes between the parties. None of the parties in the present c ase has asserted that the c ompany is in deadloc k or insolvent; nor have they deposed that it has c eased to trade or that it may not be able to c ontinue to trade. 


40     While the winding up of a c ompany may be preferable to the prosec ution of derivative ac tions in _Barrett_ and _Pang Yong Hock_ , this does not apply to the present c ase. 

**Conclusion** 

41     Leave is granted to the plaintiffs to bring an ac tion on behalf of the c ompany against the proposed defendants on the c omplaints that I found are in the interests of the c ompany to pursue. Eac h party is to pay its own c osts in this applic ation. 

42     The plaintiffs are to have c onduc t of the ac tion inc luding any exec ution proc eedings. I will not make any order on the plaintiffs’ prayer that the c ompany pay the plaintiffs’ c osts in the ac tion on an indemnity basis. I will leave that to the trial judge, as the appropriate c osts order will have to take into ac c ount the manner in whic h the ac tion is prosec uted.
