12 August 2010 Judgment reserved. 

**Philip Pillai J:** 

1       This is an originating summons for, _inter alia_ : 

 a dec laration that the option to purc hase dated 27 Dec ember 2009 granted by the defendants for the purc hase of the property known as 242 Westwood Avenue, #14-50, Singapore 648365 (“the Property”) was duly exerc ised by the plaintiffs on 12 April 2010 and that there is a valid and binding agreement (“the Sale & Purc hase Agreement”) for the defendants to sell and the plaintiffs to purc hase the Property; 

 In the alterative, a dec laration that by an agreement (“the Option Agreement”) between the first plaintiff and the defendants made on 27 Dec ember 2009 the defendants agreed to issue the first Plaintiff an option to purc hase the Property for a sum of $888,000.00 whic h option to purc hase is to be exerc ised within 14 days of the issuanc e of the option to purc hase and the purc hase to be c ompleted within 14 weeks of the exerc ise of the option to purc hase; 

 an order for spec ific performanc e of the Sale & Purc hase Agreement or, alternatively, the Option Agreement; and 

 that the Registrar of the Supreme Court be empowered to exec ute all doc uments, deeds and instruments nec essary for the sale of the Property for and on behalf of the defendants under the Sale & Purc hase Agreement or, alternatively, under the Option Agreement. 

2       The parties were introduc ed by a property agent. After some viewing of the Property, the parties met on 27 Dec ember 2009 to disc uss the sale and purc hase of the Property. It is not in dispute that the first plaintiff was at the time under the mistaken impression that he was unable to take an option to purc hase in his name bec ause of the Housing Development Board’s (“HDB”) minimum oc c upation period requirement. It is also not disputed that, as a result, the agent proc ured the parties to sign three separate doc uments c onc urrently: (i) an Offer to Purc hase, signed by both 


defendants and the first plaintiff; (ii) an Option to Purc hase (“the Option”) signed by both defendants; and (iii) a handwritten side letter signed by both defendants and the first plaintiff (“the Side Letter”). 

3       The Option was granted to the first plaintiff’s mother, Ong Siah Liyo and/or her nominee(s) in c onsideration of the sum of $8,000 (“the Option deposit”). The Option provided that it was to be exerc ised upon the signing of the Option and the tender of $35,520 less the Option deposit being paid to the defendants’ solic itors. Critic ally for present purposes, the Option did not c ontain any expiry date. 

4       The Side Letter c ontained the following terms: 

 (1) The Seller [ ie , the defendants] is aware that buyer [ ie , the first plaintiff ] c an legally purc hase the house in 05/04/2010. The buyer would buy using the mother’s name (ONG SIAH LIYO S1148589H), upon 05/04/2010, we would prepare another option to purc hase for the legal c onveyanc ing. 

 (2) In the event if from this agreement date [ ie , 27 Dec ember 2009] till 05/04/2010, buyer were to c hange his mind and not proc eed with the purc hase, seller would have rights to forfeit the 1% option fees $8,880. 

 ... 

 (4) During this period till 05/04/2010, Seller c annot sell to anyone else exc ept for the above buyer. 

 (5) The buyer request to asc ertain that he c an purc hase this Floravale (EC) while still holding on to his HDB flat. In the event if c an’t hold the HDB, buyer would still go ahead with the purc hase of above premises. 

5       Read c umulatively, the three doc uments provide for the defendants to rec eive the option fee and not to sell to anyone else until 5 April 2010. They antic ipated the issue of a fresh option by 5 April 2010 in the event that the first plaintiff had problems with his HDB minimum oc c upation period. 

6       Upon further c hec king it emerged that the first plaintiff had no problems with respec t to HDB’s minimum oc c upation period arising from his obtaining the Option, whic h is distinc t from the exerc ise of an Option or the sale and purc hase of the Property. The relevant statutory provision is sec tion 49A of the Housing and Development Ac t (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed), whic h only prohibits a _sale_ , and not the mere holding of an option whic h is not exerc ised. 

7       The defendants were advised by the first plaintiff that he was travelling from 4–8 April 2010. Attempts for his agent to meet with the defendants on 5 April 2010 to proc eed further were abortive. On 12 April 2010 the plaintiffs purported to exerc ise the Option by signing the Option and paying the exerc ise deposit and delivered the same personally to the defendants. On 14 April 2010, the defendants’ lawyers returned the exerc ise c heque and doc uments, as well as the original Option deposit and informed the plaintiff’s lawyers that their c lients took the position that the Option had expired but they were still willing to sell the Property at a pric e of $1m. Negotiations thereafter oc c urred with respec t to a new pric e but no agreement materialised leading to the plaintiffs instituting this originating summons. 

8       The only c ritic al point of c ontention relates to 5 April 2010 whic h the defendants say was the

expiry date of the Option. There is no expiry date in the Option. 5 April 2010 is a date whic h appears in the side letter but even there it is not desc ribed as an expiry date but only as the date up to whic h the defendants c annot sell the Property to anyone else exc ept the first plaintiff. 

9       The plaintiff had informed the defendant that he would be travelling between 4-8 April 2010. The property agent had been urgently c ontac ting the defendants on the plaintiff’s behalf to proc eed as agreed and a meeting took plac e on 5 April 2010 between the defendants and the property agent and nothing further transpired. The defendants’ c onduc t evinc es an intention to resile from the agreements in order to hold out for a higher pric e. The defendants had not sold the property to any third party and had engaged in disc ussions after 5 April 2010 with the property agent and the plaintiff to negotiate a higher pric e, whic h did not eventuate in any agreement. The c onduc t of the defendants with regard to events before, during and after the exerc ise of the Option, in my view c onstitute c irc umstanc es similar to those c ontemplated by _Tai Joon Lan v Yun Ai Chin and another_ <span class="citation">[1993] 2 SLR(R) 596</span> whic h ac c ordingly merit the treatment of the exerc ise of the Option on 12 April 2010 to be valid and that the defendants be c ompelled to perform the Option and proc eed to c omplete the c ontrac t for the sale and purc hase of the property provided therein. 

10     I therefore grant judgment in the following terms: 

 The Option dated 27 Dec ember 2009 granted by the defendants for the purc hase of the property known as 242 Westwood Avenue, #14-50, Singapore 648365 (the “Property”) was duly exerc ised by the plaintiffs on 12 April 2010; 

 Order for spec ific performanc e of the Option; 

 The defendants be ordered to exec ute all doc uments, deeds and instruments to c omplete the transac tion within 14 weeks of the date of this Dec laration, failing whic h the Registrar of the Supreme Court be empowered to exec ute the same; and 

 Damages, interest and adjustments relating to any tenanc y to be assessed. 

11     The plaintiffs are entitled to c osts.
