_Contract_ – _Breach_ – _Contract for sale of land_ – _Buyer and seller to obtain consent from Jurong Town Corporation_ – _Consent not obtained_ – _Whether consent not obtained because of buyer's default_ – _Whether buyer in breach of contract_ 

: This is a c laim for damages and other reliefs for breac h of c ontrac t c ontained in an agreement in writing dated 10 Dec ember 1997 (`sale agreement`) for the sale by the plaintiff (`SIG`) to the defendant (`NS`) of its land in Jurong for $4. 28m. NS disputed the c laim and c ounterc laimed for a dec laration that the sale agreement had bec ome null and void and for the return of the deposit whic h had been paid to a stakeholder. There was c onc urrently an originating summons in whic h the stakeholder had obtained an order and paid the amount of the deposit in c ourt. At the c onc lusion of the trial in this ac tion I dismissed SIG`s c laim and allowed NS`s c laim for a dec laration and I stood over the c laim for payment out of the amount of the deposit to the hearing of the originating summons. SIG has given notic e of appeal and these are my written grounds. 

The land is desc ribed in the sale agreement as `the whole of Pte Lot A14567 ... together with the building(s) erec ted or to be erec ted thereon`. It is not disputed that all that SIG had was the benefit of an agreement dated 25 Oc tober 1996 (`JTC agreement`) with Jurong Town Corporation (`JTC`) to enter upon the land at Pte Lot A14567 and to c onstruc t c ertain buildings on it at its own expense and upon satisfac tory c ompletion of the c onstruc tion works to have the right to a lease for a term of 30 years from 1 June 1995. 

At the date of the sale agreement the c onstruc tion works had not been c ompleted. The JTC agreement provided for c ompletion of the c onstruc tion works within two years from 1 June 1995 but by letter dated 9 April 1997 a c opy of whic h was attac hed to the sale agreement between the parties as App III time was extended by JTC to expire on 31 Dec ember 1997. The sale agreement provides for an undertaking by SIG to apply to JTC for a further extension of time. 

Under the JTC agreement SIG agreed to perform and observe a large number of stipulations one of whic h was: 

 Not to assign charge create a trust or agency let sublet or underlet or grant a licence or part with or share his interest under this Agreement, or the possession or occupation of the said land, or any part thereof except that, subject to the[JTCs] prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, [SIG] may mortgage or charge his interest under this Agreement by way of assignment or debenture (as the case may be) to secure the repayment of such sum or sums as [SIG] may require for the purpose only of erecting or completing the building or other structure to be built on the said land ... 


The 30-year lease to be granted would also be subjec t to the c ovenants and c onditions set out in the sc hedule to the JTC agreement and anyone having any familiarity with JTC leases would expec t to see a c ovenant against assignment but for some unknown reason the sc hedule was not inc luded among the doc uments before me and no referenc e has been made to any suc h c ovenant. 

The stipulation against assignment or parting with any interest under the JTC agreement was unc onditional and unqualified. Under the JTC agreement SIG was granted a lic enc e to enter upon the land and to c onstruc t the buildings and `for the installation of equipment fixtures and fittings thereat for the purpose of manufac turing of double glazed insulating panels, laminated glass and tempered glass only in ac c ordanc e with the stipulations hereinafter c ontained and for no other purpose whatsoever`. This was not what NS intended to use the land for. 

Again the restric tion as to use would also be set out in the sc hedule whic h has not been produc ed. For the sale agreement to be c arried into effec t JTC`s c onsent was c learly nec essary and the c onditions referred to as spec ial c onditions provide: 

 1(a) The sale and purchase herein is subject to the written consent of [JTC] (hereinafter referred to as the JTC) being obtained by [SIG] for the sale and it is also subject to [NS] obtaining the written consent of the JTC and all other relevant authority to use the property for packing and storage of waste paper. [NS] warrants that they will comply with the URAs/JTCs requirement in utilising 60% of the gross floor area (GFA) for production and 40% of the GFA for storage and office space only. 

 1(d) [SIG] and [NS] agree and undertake to comply with all the terms and conditions that will be imposed by the JTC in respect of the sale and purchase and the proposed change of use provided always that [NS] shall have the right to rescind this agreement in the following circumstances: 

 (1) if JTC requires [NS] to invest more than $200 psm of the land area ($1,000,000. 00) on plant and machinery for the 30 year lease with effect from 1 June 1995; 

 (2) [SIG] is unable to assign the benefit of the investment on the building and civil works to [NS]; 

 (3) [NS] is required by JTC to undertake to apply and obtain the TOP and CSC which are [SIGs] responsibilities and obligations under the terms of this Agreement and [SIG] is unable to comply with JTCs requirement so as to enable [NS] to undertake to do so with JTC; 

 in which event(s) [SIG] shall return to [NS] all deposit paid free of interest herein in exchange for the withdrawal of caveats and all entries made against the property by [NS] or arising from [NS] and thereafter neither party shall have any claim against the other. Each party shall then bear their own solicitors costs and expenses. 

 2(a) In the event the consents mentioned in Clause 1(a) is not obtained or shall be refused for any reason whatsoever by 27th May 1998, the sale shall become null and void ... 


 2(b) In the further event that the JTCs consent in Clause 1(a) is not obtained or is refused due to the neglect and/or default of either party other than in respect of the representations and warranties herein, neither party shall be compensated for all losses, damages, costs, expenses and/or inconveniences incurred and suffered as a result of the defaulting partys act of default and/or neglect. 

Spec ial c ondition 2(b) appears here in the form as amended by the agreement of both c ounsel. I think `60% for produc tion and 40% for storage and offic e only` in spec ial c ondition 1(a) means not less than 60% to be used for produc tion and not more than 40% to be used for storage and offic e. 

Spec ial c ondition 1(a) c ontemplates the c onsent of JTC for the sale being obtained by SIG and the c onsent of JTC and `all other relevant authority` for c hange of use being obtained by NS. This is what it says and it is made c lear by spec ial c ondition 1(b) whic h refers to applic ations to be made for the two c onsents and spec ial c ondition 1(c ) whic h provides for the separate responsibility of eac h party for fees payable for the two c onsents. 

By letter dated 18 Dec ember 1997 SIG`s solic itors applied to JTC for its `approval` in respec t of the sale. The letter refers to SIG`s `applic ation form` but no doc ument has been identified as suc h. There was an error in the letter and this was c orrec ted by the solic itors` letter of 8 January 1998. 

NS also made an applic ation and for this purpose it c ompleted and submitted to JTC its standard form c onsisting of Pts I to IV and sec tions A and B. Parts I and IV c ontain information relating to NS and its business ac tivities inc luding financ ial statements and Pts II and III c ontain applic ations for c learanc e from the relevant authorities. Sec tion A identifies the seller but is otherwise not applic able and sec tion B identifies the buyer and gives the reasons for the purc hase and the c auses. 

On 18 Marc h 1998 JTC wrote to SIG`s solic itors: 

 Proposed Assignment of Lease on Pte Lot A14567 at Penjuru Rd 

 We refer to the above captioned. 

 2 We regret to inform that the application for assignment of the above mentioned lot has been unsuccessful. The reason being that the assignee is not able to meet our value-add and space utilisation requirements.  

A c opy of this letter was given to NS`s solic itors. It seems quite c lear that JTC has refused to give its c onsent to SIG for the sale and this is not in dispute. It is for SIG to obtain suc h c onsent and suc h c onsent has not been obtained or has been refused by 27 May 1998. 

On 20 May 1998 SIG`s solic itors wrote to NS`s solic itors to say that the parties had `agreed to mutually extend the c onsent period required under c l 2(a) to 27 July 1998` and requested their c onfirmation. This c onfirmation NS`s solic itors duly gave by letter dated 21 May 1998. 

On 20 May 1998 NS`s solic itors submitted a revised applic ation to JTC. In the first submission the 


financ ial statements related to the years to 31 Dec ember 1996 and 31 Dec ember 1997. In the sec ond submission they related to the years to 31 Dec ember 1997 and 31 Dec ember 1998. In the c ase of the financ ial years whic h were c urrent at the time of the submission the financ ial statements were estimates and projec tions. There were differenc es bec ause of the c hange in the ac c ounting years but in all other respec ts the forms as c ompleted were substantially the same. 

By letter dated 13 July 1998 JTC c alled for NS`s financ ial statements for the six months to 30 June 1998 and two letters of undertaking. These were duly supplied on 20 July 1998. On 24 July 1998 JTC wrote to NS`s solic itors: 

 Based on the balance sheet submitted, the half-yearly figures for Newspaper Seng Pte Ltd are S$5. 28m, but their projected figures for the year ended 1998 are S$17. 02m. In view of this, please advise us how your client can achieve the said figure of S$17. 02m.  

In the sec ond submission NS had projec ted sales of $17. 02m for the year to 31 Dec ember 1998 but in the first six months it had only ac hieved sales of $5. 28m. On 27 July 1998 NS`s solic itors replied to JTC. Its letter arrived by fax at about 1710 hrs. 

There is no evidenc e that SIG took any further steps to obtain JTC`s c onsent after JTC`s refusal or to appeal against suc h refusal. Nothing was heard about SIG having obtained the c onsent of JTC for the sale of the land or about JTC or any other authority having given its c onsent for the c hange of use and neither NS nor its solic itors heard anything further from JTC about its sec ond submission. On 6 August 1998 NS`s solic itors gave notic e to SIG`s solic itors to treat the sale agreement as having bec ome null and void and demanded the return of the deposit. 

This ac tion was c ommenc ed in Oc tober 1999. The statement of c laim alleges the sale agreement and states some of its terms. These terms appear to be different from what is stated in the sale agreement and c ounsel said that they were intended to be stated verbatim and not intended to represent SIG`s version of the terms or their intended meanings. The sale agreement is to be referred to for all its terms. 

The statement of c laim then proc eeds to allege implied terms and paras 6 and 7 state: 

 6 In the application to [JTC] for consent to the sale, [NS] stated in December 1997 that the annual value of its gross output for its last financial year (1996) from the sales of its manufactured or processed products (newspapers) was $12,732,320, and that the projected annual value for its gross output for the current financial year (1997) would be $13,483,489. 

 7 In March 1998, [JTC] declined to give consent to the sale for the reason, as set out in its letter dated 18 March 1998, that [NS] was not able to meet [JTCs] value-added and space utilisation requirements. 

Spec ial c ondition 1(a) provides that the sale is subjec t to the c onsent of JTC being obtained by SIG. It is for SIG to apply for and to obtain suc h c onsent. NS did make an applic ation as alleged in para 6 but the refusal alleged in para 7 was not a refusal of NS`s applic ation but of SIG`s applic ation. However in its defenc e NS admits the allegations in these paragraphs. 


Paragraph 8 of the statement of c laim states: 

 By an exchange of letters dated 20 May 1998 and 21 May 1998, [SIG] and [NS] agreed that the date of 27 July 1998 should be substituted for the date of 27 May 1998 referred to in Special Condition 2(a). The purpose of the extension was to enable [NS] to appeal to [JTC] for its consent to the sale. 

Counsel stated that the allegation was that the sale agreement had been varied as to the date only. No other agreement is alleged and no agreement is alleged as to an appeal to be made and that suc h appeal was to be made by NS. However the allegations in para 8 are also admitted by NS in its defenc e. 

Paragraph 22 of the statement of c laim states: 

 [NS] acted in breach of, and/or did not act in accordance with, its undertaking in Special Condition 1(d) and/or the implied obligation which has been pleaded. 

This is followed by five paragraphs of partic ulars whic h will be c onsidered in the order in whic h they have been pleaded. 

Mr Kasi referred to **Tan Soo Leng David v Wee, Satku & Kumar Pte Ltd & Anor** <span class="citation">[1994] 3 SLR 481</span> where Karthigesu JA (delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal) said at p 489: 

 ... in our view, there was a duty on the [vendors] to show that they had taken all reasonable steps to obtain the [developers] consent or that it was useless for them to pursue the matter with the [developers] after the initial withholding of consent because it would have been quite impossible for them to obtain the [developers] consent. 

He submitted that NS was in default in this respec t. 

In **_Tan Soo Leng David_** the agreement for sale made on 15 July 1992 (by the exerc ise of an option granted on 2 July 1992) provided that it was subjec t to the c onsent of the developers and that if suc h c onsent was refused or not rec eived by the c ompletion date (20 September 1992) the agreement for sale was deemed to have been resc inded. The vendors were the original purc hasers from the developers under an agreement (`princ ipal agreement`) whic h provided for a restric tion in the following terms: 

 The purchaser shall use the building unit(s) solely for his medical practice and shall not let or sublet, sell or assign or transfer (otherwise than by way of security) the same without the prior written consent of the vendor which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld if the intended letting or sub-letting, sale or assignment or transfer is to a medical practitioner (which expression shall include a body corporate) engaged in the practice of specialist medicine. 

The purc haser was engaged in the prac tic e of spec ialist medic ine. He was an ophthalmic surgeon in 


prac tic e as suc h sinc e 1976. 

The vendors applied to the developers for their c onsent and rec eived this reply: 

 We regret to inform you that our client is withholding its consent under cl (f) of the third schedule. 

Clause (f) of the third sc hedule is the c lause providing for the restric tion set out above. The vendors refused to proc eed with the sale and the purc haser sued. His statement of c laim was ordered to be struc k out as disc losing no reasonable or probable c ause of ac tion and it was an appeal against that order that c ame before the Court of Appeal. 

Karthigesu JA referred to **Brauer & Co (Great Britain) Ltd v James Clark (Brush Materials) Ltd** [1952] 2 All ER 497 where Denning LJ said at p 501: 

 ... this clause is a special exemption inserted in favour of the sellers. In order to enable them to take advantage of it they must show that, notwithstanding that all reasonable steps were taken by them, they could not obtain a licence to export during any part of the shipment period, or, alternatively, that it was useless for them to take any such steps, or any further steps, because it was quite impossible for them to obtain a licence. 

The c ontrac t was for sale of goods to be exported from Brazil and c ontained a c lause to the effec t that the c ontrac t was subjec t to any Brazilian export lic enc e. This was the c lause referred to in the passage of the judgment of Denning LJ c ited. Continuing Denning LJ said: 

 There is nothing to show that the licence could not have been obtained at some time during the shipment period. On the contrary, there is a specific finding that an export licence could have been obtained if the sellers had been prepared to pay a higher price for the goods to their Brazilian associates a price higher, that is, than the price at which they had contracted to re-sell them. Was that a step which they could reasonably be expected to take?This depends on how much was the price they had to pay to get the licence. If it was, to take the judges illustration, one hundred times as much as the contract price, that would be a fundamentally different situation which had unexpectedly emerged, and they would not be bound to pay it: see British Movietonews, Ltd v London & District Cinemas, Ltd [1952] AC 166. But if the price they had to pay was only the current market price, as we were told it was, then they ought to have paid it so as to get the licence. 

The sellers had merely stated that it was impossible for them to ship the goods at the pric es c ontrac ted owing to the intervention of the Brazilian authorities. 

In due c ourse **_Tan Soo Leng David_** c ame before Judith Prakash J who found that subsequent to the rec eipt of the developers` reply withholding c onsent the parties met with representatives of the developers and in the event the developers refused to give their c onsent. Her Honour also found that the c onsent had not been unreasonably withheld and dismissed the purc haser`s c laim against the vendors. 


I do not think there c an be any doubt that where as in this c ase the c ontrac t is subjec t to JTC`s c onsent being obtained and suc h c onsent is refused or not obtained by the time limited then the party seeking to rely on the failure of c onsent must show that it has taken all reasonable steps to obtain the c onsent or that it was useless for it to take any suc h steps or any further steps bec ause it is quite impossible to obtain the c onsent. Whether and what steps are reasonable will depend on the c irc umstanc es. Whether the c onsent may be refused unc onditionally or otherwise and what an applic ant for c onsent has to do to obtain it are relevant c irc umstanc es but it is not possible to list all the c irc umstanc es. I will now return to para 22 of the statement of c laim and c onsider eac h of the allegations of breac h of or failure to ac t in ac c ordanc e with the c ontrac t. 

**_`Prior to 24 July 1998, [NS] did not act as quickly as it could and should have done with a view to obtaining [JTC`s] consent to the sale in that`_** 

`after being notified by [JTC] on 20 Marc h 1998 that the applic ation had not been suc c essful bec ause of [NS] was not able to meet [JTC`s] `value added and spac e utilisation requirements` [NS] did not submit a new applic ation for c onsent until 20 May 1998` 

The sale was subjec t to the written c onsent of JTC being obtained by SIG. See spec ial c ondition 1(a). SIG applied to JTC for its c onsent on 18 Dec ember 1997. In the event that suc h c onsent was not obtained or should be refused for any reason whatsoever by 27 May 1998 the sale was to bec ome null and void. See spec ial c ondition 2(a). As alleged by SIG in its statement of c laim the c onsent had been refused by 27 May 1998. It was refused on 20 Marc h 1998. The c onsent that was refused was the c onsent applied for by SIG. Down to about 20 May 1998 there was nothing or nothing further to be done by NS to obtain the c onsent for the sale whic h SIG was to obtain. 

On or about 20 May 1998 the parties agreed to an extension of time. That would not by itself make any differenc e. If by 27 May 1998 c onsent had been refused it would still have been refused by 27 July 1998. It was not a c ase of the c onsent not having been obtained yet. The statement of c laim alleges that `the purpose of the extension was to enable [NS] to appeal to [JTC] for its c onsent to the sale` and this is admitted by NS in its defenc e. I think what this means is that when the extension of time was agreed upon the parties also agreed that the sale agreement was still in full forc e and effec t and that NS would appeal to JTC for its c onsent to buy from SIG and this c onsent would be the c onsent for the sale to be obtained by SIG under the sale agreement. I think the parties also agreed that the appeal would be made by NS making the sec ond submission whic h it did on 20 May 1998. 

It is not nec essary to say anything more but there are some letters among the doc uments whic h may be referred to. The reason given by JTC for not giving its c onsent was that NS was not able to meet its `value-add and spac e utilisation requirements`. By letter dated 23 Marc h 1998 SIG`s solic itors alleged that NS was in breac h of warranty as regards the 60%:40% spac e utilization requirement in spec ial c ondition 1(a). 

On 26 Marc h 1998 NS`s solic itors wrote to JTC to point out that the applic ation was made on the basis of 60% of the gross floor area for produc tion and 40% for storage and offic e spac e and that the details of floor spac e usage showed even a higher perc entage for produc tion. This is in ac c ordanc e with the warranty. As to meeting JTC`s `value-add` or added value requirements there is nothing that NS c ould reasonably do or be reasonably expec ted to do. In any c ase there is no evidenc e as to what those requirements were or in what way they were not met. 

On 11 April 1998 JTC wrote to advise that it was looking into the matter and would revert in due c ourse. On 19 May 1998 NS`s solic itors wrote to JTC to enquire as to the outc ome of the applic ation. 


On 20 May 1998 they wrote again and in addition made the sec ond submission. In my judgment NS was not in breac h of c ontrac t as alleged. 

`[NS] did not then request [JTC] to deal with its new applic ation with expedition` 

On 4 June 1998 JTC wrote to NS`s solic itors to advise that it was in the proc ess of `evaluating the proposal` and would get bac k to them as soon as possible. On 13 July 1998 JTC wrote to NS`s solic itors: 

 2 Please be informed that we require your client, Newspaper Seng Pte Ltd, to submit the following to us: 

 (i) a letter of undertaking that Newspaper Seng Pte Ltd will utilize 90% of the area for manufacturing/assembly/servicing purposes and 10% of the area for office space. 

 (ii) an unaudited or audited Statement of Accounts from 1/1/98 to 30/6/98. 

 (iii) a letter of undertaking that Newspaper Seng Pte Ltd will complete the building and fulfill all investment criteria as stipulated in the building agreement dated 25 October 1996, in particular with reference to cll 2(viii) and 4. 

 3 Looking forward to your reply soonest possible. Thank you. 

The letters of undertaking went beyond what was reasonable for NS to do (as between SIG and NS) and the ac c ounts were for a period just 13 days ended. Nevertheless these were provided on 20 July 

1998\. On 24 July 1998 JTC wrote to ask how sales of $17. 02m c ould be ac hieved for the year to 31 Dec ember 1998 and a c omplete reply was given on 27 July 1998. 

I do not see that in these c irc umstanc es there was any duty on the part of NS to request JTC to deal with the sec ond submission with expedition. In my judgment NS was not in breac h of c ontrac t as alleged. 

`[NS] did not respond to [JTC`s] requirement for further information and written undertakings, albeit that the requirement was c ommunic ated to [NS] on 13 July 1998, until 20 July 1998 (when it c ould and should have responded to it by 15 July 1998 at the latest)` 

I have set out the terms of JTC`s letter of 13 July 1998. Under spec ial c ondition 1(a) of the sale agreement NS warranted that it would c omply with a 60%:40% spac e utilization requirement. It was now required to give an undertaking to use not less than 90% of the spac e for produc tion and not more than 10% for offic e. Details of spac e utilization given in its solic itors` letter of 26 Marc h 1998 showed 77% for produc tion. 

I would have thought that it would be reasonable to allow some time for spac e utilization to be rec onsidered before giving an undertaking in terms required by JTC. The ac c ounting period ended 30 June 1998. Again some time would have to be allowed for the ac c ounts to be done. In the event NS took seven days to deliver the doc uments asked for. No evidenc e has been given that it c ould have c omplied with the requirements earlier or that it c ould have done so in two days as alleged by SIG. In my judgment NS was not in breac h of c ontrac t as alleged. 


**_`[NS] did not comply with [JTC`s] requirement, made on 24 July 1998, for an explanation as to the apparent discrepancy between its gross sales for the first half of 1998 and its projection for the whole of 1998`_** 

There was no disc repanc y apparent or otherwise. JTC`s letter of 24 July 1998 has already been given above. JTC asked NS to advise how it c ould ac hieve sales of $17. 02m for the year to 31 Dec ember 1998 (as projec ted in its sec ond submission made on 20 May 1998) when its ac tual sales for the six months to 30 June 1998 were only $5. 28m. 

NS was in the business of manufac turing c orrugated paper c artons, CPO (c omputer print-outs) and SOP (sorted offic e paper) from waste paper for export to Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines and Korea. It explained in its solic itors` letter that the projec tions had not been ac hieved in view of the ec onomic downturn whic h partic ularly affec ted these four c ountries. NS only managed $5. 28m in the first half of 1998 `through great effort` and was c onfident of ac hieving $2. 5m in the sec ond half. That would make $7. 78m for the year whic h still had more than five months to run. The letter c onc luded by saying that the position would be reviewed from time to time. It was an admission that the projec ted sales were not going to be or were unlikely to be ac hieved. 

Ms Lai Sin Yee is the c ustomer servic e manager of JTC and during the relevant time she was the senior lease management offic er. She said that towards the end of this c ase she was kept informed and she has had the benefit of going through JTC`s file rec ords. 

Ms Lai was referred to NS`s solic itors` letter of 27 July 1998 during examination in c hief. Her evidenc e was: 

 Q: PB-113. Complied with JTCs requirement? 

 (Note: PB-113 is a copy of the letter of 27 July 1998. ) 

 A: No. Data not sufficient. 

 (To c ourt): To us information not suffic ient. Cant see from rec ords if Miss Poh has ac tually asked from applic ant to re-submit whole of Part IV. Also no rec ord of any c ommunic ation to applic ant after PB

The information was not suffic ient for JTC but she did not say in what way it was not. I think it was in that sense that she said NS had not c omplied with JTC`s requirement. In fac t NS had c omplied. It admitted that the projec ted sales were not going to be or were unlikely to be ac hieved. It gave a revised projec tion of $7. 78m for the year to 31 Dec ember 1998. 

Later Ms Lai was referred to JTC`s letter dated 19 August 1998 to SIG`s solic itors. This was in reply to their letter of 14 August 1998 whic h stated: 

 ... please let us know the reason(s) for the Corporations delay in giving the 


 necessary consent to the parties application on an immediate basis. 

 We are however given to understand that you had requested from the purchasers the following two items: 

 (1) to submit the companys past audited account to show the companys turnover exceeding $17m as represented; and 

 (2) to resubmit the projection for 1998 taking into consideration the first half year unaudited account turnover of about $5. 2m 

 which are still outstanding from the purchasers. Please confirm. 

There is no evidenc e that JTC had requested the two items. Ms Lai c ould see no rec ord of this. NS had not represented sales exc eeding $17m. In its sec ond submission made in May 1998 it projec ted sales of $17. 02m for the year to 31 Dec ember 1998 whic h was then still c urrent. The statement was untrue. It was an impolite letter. It ac c used JTC of delay in giving its c onsent. It presumed without any basis that its c onsent would be given. 

JTC`s reply written by Ms Poh sated: 

 Please take note it is not that JTC has failed to give the necessary consent to the sale and purchase of the abovementioned property but we would require the re-submission of the projected 1998 figures before we can proceed further. 

It did not say that re-submission of the 1998 projec ted sales had been c alled for. Its letter of 24 July 1998 only asked to be advised how the projec ted sales c ould be ac hieved. This is wholly inc onsistent with a request for a re-submission. Suc h a request if any c ould only have been made after rec eipt of NS`s solic itors` letter of 27 July 1998. As Ms Lai said in evidenc e there was no reply to that letter and in any event time for obtaining JTC`s c onsent would have expired. In my judgment NS was not in breac h of c ontrac t as alleged. 

**_`[NS] could and should have provided [JTC] with that explanation before 1. 30pm on 27 July 1998`_** 

No evidenc e has been given in support of this allegation. Even if the explanation had been provided before 1. 30pm on 27 July 1998 there is no evidenc e that it would have served any purpose. 

On 21 Oc tober 1998 SIG`s solic itors (instruc ted in plac e of the previous solic itors) wrote to JTC and put a number of questions to it inc luding: 

 In the event that PK Wong & Advani or Newspaper Seng Pte Ltd had responded with (1) only the aforesaid clarification, (2) both the clarification and resubmission (whether simultaneous or otherwise), please confirm if you would have been in a position in each case to grant your consent to the assignment of the above property. 


PK Wong & Advani were NS`s solic itors. JTC`s answer in its letter of 29 Oc tober 1998 was: 

 In the event that PK Wong & Advani or Newspaper Seng Pte Ltd had responded with (1) only the aforesaid clarification, (2) both the clarification and resubmission (whether simultaneous or otherwise), we would not have been in a position to grant consent immediately as the application needed to be evaluated based on our list of criteria. 

Ms Lai was referred to JTC`s answer under c ross-examination and her evidenc e was: 

 Q: PB-157. Item 2(f). If defendant had re-submitted whole of Part IV revised between 24 and 27/7/98 JTC in a position to grant approval? 

 (Note: PB-157 is a copy of JTCs letter of 29 October 1998 and item 2(f) is the para stated above. ) 

 A: Assuming data correct and sufficient we would normally need 18 working days from full submission of data. 

On re-examination she said: 

 Q: Normally 18 working days. Difference to answer if applicant merely submitting additional data and not whole application? 

 A: If only some additional information required upon submission of data would take about three to five working days to give consent letter. 

 (To court): Depends on earlier submission. If shortly before would still require more time. Also depends on additional information required and information given. May require further investigation. May take more time. 

In my judgment SIG has not made good this allegation. 

**_`[NS] did not re-submit the said revised projection for 1998 as [JTC], to the knowledge of [NS],required [NS] to do in order to be in a position to grant written consent to the sale by 27 July 1998`_** 

JTC`s letter of 29 Oc tober 1998 whic h was also written by Ms Poh c ontains a statement that `resubmission of c omplete data` was requested byJTC verbally on 24 July 1998. This allegation was made earlier and was denied by NS in its solic itors` letter to JTC on 12 Oc tober 1998. JTC`s reply again written by Ms Poh stated: 

 According to our records, we did inform your client, Mr Louis from Newspaper Seng Pte Ltd, verbally on 24 July 1998 about the re-submission of complete data. We had required Newspaper Seng Pte Ltd to furnish a realistic figure to the original figure of S$17. 02m, which they pleaded was unattainable in your 


 letter of 27 July 1998, and to re-fill Part IV of the application form for the assignment to facilitate our evaluation. 

Ms Lai`s evidenc e is that there were no suc h rec ords. It seems quite c lear on a plain reading of the letter that if someone on behalf of JTC did in fac t make known to NS its requirement for NS to refill Part IV of the applic ation form that person would have done so after rather than before NS had `pleaded` that `the original figure ... was unattainable` in its solic itors` letter of 27 July 1998. 

Mr Kasi said that Ms Poh would be in c ourt on 27 January 2000 to testify. On 27 January 2000 Mr Kasi said he had spoken to her and he was unable to obtain an affidavit from her. He did not c all her and SIG c losed its c ase without her evidenc e. 

In my judgment it has not been proved that NS was informed or knew at any time before its solic itors` letter of 27 July 1998 was sent to JTC or at any time at all that JTC required it to resubmit a revised projec tion for 1998 or as alleged. 

**_`The projection of gross sales for 1998 as set out in [NS`s] letter to [JTC] dated 27 July 1998 was not a genuine projection, but was, as it was intended to be, an intentional understatement of the projected sales for 1998, made with a view to deterring [JTC] from granting consent to the sale`_** 

There is no evidenc e that any of the statements made in the letter of 27 July 1998 was untrue or inac c urate. There is no evidenc e as to the ac tual sales ac hieved for 1998. The evidenc e as to sales of $5. 28m for the six months ended 30 June 1998 was unc hallenged. The ec onomic downturn referred to in the letter is a matter of suc h notoriety that I may take judic ial notic e of it. I have not been c alled upon by NS to do so but I see no reason to believe that it did not exist. The estimate of $2. 5m sales for the six months to the end of the financ ial year does not appear to be anything other than a genuine estimate. 

In my judgment it has not been proved that the projec tion of sales for 1998 in the letter of 27 July 1998 was not a genuine projec tion. It has not been proved that it was an understatement of the projec ted sales or that NS had intended to understate suc h sales or had done so for the reason alleged. 

If JTC`s c onsent is not obtained by 27 July 1998 or is refused `for any reason whatsoever` the sale bec omes null and void. That is what spec ial c ondition 2(a) plainly says. 

JTC`s c onsent may fail without any default on the part of either party. It may also fail by reason of some default. It seems to me to be unlikely that `any reason whatsoever` in spec ial c ondition 2(a) will inc lude default on the part of the party seeking to treat the c ontrac t as null and void unless the c ontrac t c onstrued as a whole points to some other c onstruc tion. 

Spec ial c ondition 2(b) provides that `in the further event` that the JTC`s c onsent fails `due to the neglec t and/or default of either party other than in respec t of the representations and warranties herein` then neither party is to be c ompensated for loss and expenses suffered and inc urred as a result of the defaulting party`s ac t of default and/or neglec t. Quite c learly the parties intended to make spec ial provision for the partic ular c ase or `further event` of a failure of the c onsent whic h is due to neglec t or default. 


Under spec ial c ondition 2(b) where there is neglec t or default whic h c auses the c onsent to fail then exc ept as provided neither party is entitled to c ompensation for loss or expense. Suc h loss or expense c an only arise if the sale agreement c annot be c arried into effec t and it c annot be c arried into effec t without JTC`s c onsent. But it is not every kind of neglec t or default that has the effec t of c onferring exemption upon the party in default. Exc luded and expressly so exc luded is neglec t or default `in respec t of the representations and warranties [in the sale agreement]`. 

The sale agreement provides for the sale and purc hase of the land subjec t to the **_terms and conditions_** mentioned. Clause 8 of the sale agreement provides that the sale is subjec t to the **_special conditions_** whic h are set out. Clause 9 inc orporates the **_general conditions_** of sale known as `The Singapore Law Soc iety Conditions of Sale` in so far as they are not varied by or inc onsistent with the **_special conditions_** and **_other terms_** c ontained in the sale agreement. Spec ial c ondition 13 provides (as does spec ial c ondition 19 also) that the **_terms and conditions_** of the sale agreement remain in full forc e and effec t and do not merge with the transfer of the land on c ompletion. 

In these provisions the draftsman has employed the expressions `terms and c onditions`, `spec ial c onditions`, `general c onditions` and `terms`. In c ontrast spec ial c ondition 1(a) provides that NS **_warrants_** that it will c omply with the 60%:40% spac e utilization requirement. Spec ial c ondition 16 provides that SIG **_warrants_** that all additions and alterations to the buildings c onstruc ted on the land whic h are not in ac c ordanc e with plans approved by JTC have been c arried out with the approval of the relevant authorities. Spec ial c ondition 21(3) provides that SIG warrants that it has c omplied with and will c ontinue to c omply with the terms of the JTC agreement of 25 Oc tober 1996. Finally spec ial c ondition 24 provides that SIG warrants and represents that the land area is 4,964 sq m and the built up area of the buildings is 3,067. 63 sq m. Provision is also made for variation of the pric e in the event of variations in the areas. 

The sale agreement was negotiated between the parties and the form of the agreement was amended and finally settled between separate solic itors representing the parties. I think the expressions `representations` and `warranties` have been used to refer to those matters provided for in spec ial c onditions 1(a), 16, 21(3) and 24. The parties c learly attac h great importanc e to these matters and it appears that these are the sort of matters whic h would attrac t suc h attention. 

Mr Kasi submitted that there was no signific anc e in the c hoic e of expressions so that `warranties` in spec ial c ondition 2(b) meant no more than `terms`. I am unable to agree. `Neglec t and/or default of either party` must be neglec t or default in respec t of some provision of the sale agreement. If `warranties` means no more than terms then there would be no point in providing for neglec t or default and then exc luding neglec t or default in respec t of warranties. In plac e of the whole of spec ial c ondition 2(b) all that would be nec essary if that be the intention is to qualify `any reason whatsoever` in spec ial c ondition 2(a) by exc luding **_neglect or default_** of either party. 

The only warranty given by NS is to c omply with the 60%:40% spac e utilization requirement. This it has undertaken to do with JTC. Sinc e the utilization will not c ommenc e before JTC`s c onsent is obtained and the sale c ompleted an undertaking is all that c an be given at that stage. In any c ase it is not SIG`s c ase that there has been any default in respec t of this warranty. 

Mr Kasi submitted that NS was slow or delayed in submitting its applic ation and in responding to JTC`s request at various stages. He referred to **Selvadurai Pala Krishnan & Partners v Francis Adrian & Co Pte Ltd & Anor** SLR 403. I have found that NS was not in default or in breac h of c ontrac t as alleged and there is no evidenc e of tardiness or delay and even if NS was in default in this respec t it would not be liable to c ompensate SIG but in any c ase I do not see how **_Selvadurai Pala Krishnan & Partners_** assists. 


In that c ase the sale was subjec t to the approval of JTC to the purc hasers` applic ation for use of the property for **_manufacturing wooden container sleeves_** and the purc hasers were to apply within seven days for the approval. FA Chua J said at p 407: 

 The [purchasers] were under an obligation to take all reasonable steps to obtain such approval from JTC. 

 The evidence clearly shows that the delay in getting JTCs approval was due entirely to the [purchasers] trying to obtain approval for the storage of stuffed containers when it had been clear to them as early as 12 October 1983, that the JTC would not approve the application. 

The c ontrac t was made on 22 September 1983 and if the approval was not granted by 8 Dec ember 1983 then the c ontrac t was off. The purc hasers applied for approval to use the property **_for storage of stuffed containers_** and persisted in their applic ation down to 2 Dec ember 1983. Approval was not granted by the time limited or at all. That c ase has no applic ation to the c ase before me. 

The sale agreement has bec ome null and void as JTC`s c onsent for the sale was refused or was not obtained by 27 July 1998. The failure of the c onsent was not c aused by any neglec t or default on the part of NS but even if it was the neglec t or default was not in respec t of any representations or warranties within the meaning of spec ial c ondition 2(b) and SIG is not entitled to any c ompensation for any loss or expense suffered or inc urred as a result of the neglec t or default. 

The c ounterc laim of NS is for a dec laration. There will be judgment ac c ordingly. 

## Outcome: 

Plaintiffs` c laim dismissed; defendants` c ounterc laim allowed.
