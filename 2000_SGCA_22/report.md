(delivering the judgment of the court): This is an appeal against a decision of GP Selvam J given on 19 March 1999 where he set aside an ex parte interlocutory injunction which the plaintiff-appellants had on 8 January 1999 obtained against the defendant-respondent. 

**_The facts_** 

The appellants are manufacturers and distributors of, inter alia, the common backpacks under the brand name `hayrer`, the sort which we see carried by school children all over Singapore. The appellants` backpacks are distributed to shops in Singapore for sale to the public, including large department stores like Isetan and Carrefour. 

The respondent`s business was also in bags. In around November 1998, he started selling backpacks under the brand name, `devico`. In the past, he used to purchase some of the appellants` bags for resale. It was the sale by the respondent of the `devico` backpacks which gave rise to the appellants instituting this action in passing-off, as well as applying ex parte for an interlocutory injunction against the respondent. 

The appellants alleged that the respondent had damaged their goodwill by passing off his inferior `devico` bags as their bags, as the respondent`s bags had copied several features of the `hayrer` bags. It should be noted that the appellants` claim does not rest on the brand name `hayrer`. They also alleged that the respondent had breached their copyright in the warranty, which accompanied each of the `hayrer` bags, as the respondent`s warranty on his `devico` bags was in identical terms, except for the difference in the brand names. 

When the ex parte application first came up before the court on 7 January 1999, Lee Seiu Kin JC queried why the application was made ex parte. The following day, the appellants` general manager, Mr Low Yang Haw, filed an affidavit to explain the urgency and why the respondent should not be 


notified. Basically, what he said was that if notified, the respondent would most likely release all his poor quality stock into the market at an even lower price. Normally, during this period (between the date the schools re-opened for the New Year and before Chinese New Year) the sales of such bags would be high. The grant subsequently of an injunction would have been of no practical use as the losses suffered by the appellants, as a result of the damage to the goodwill, would be incalculable. 

Following that clarification, Lee Seiu Kin JC on the same day granted an interim injunction, the relevant parts of which read as follows: 

 1 An injunc tion is hereby granted restraining the defendant from selling, distributing, importing, manufac turing or otherwise dealing in bags bearing bar c ode prefix number 8887710 where suc h bags are not manufac tured by or originate from the plaintiffs until trial or further order. 

 2 An injunc tion is hereby granted restraining the defendant from passing off bac kpac ks and waist pouc hes bearing the label shown in Annex A not manufac tured by or originating from the plaintiffs until trial or further order. 

 3 An injunc tion is hereby granted restraining the defendant from infringing the plaintiffs c opyright in tags affixed to the plaintiffs bags by reproduc ing the c ontents of the said tags until trial or further order. 

Apparently, the appellants had difficulties serving the injunction order on the respondent, which they only managed to do five days later on 13 January 1999. Thereafter, the respondent filed an application to set it aside. The application to discharge the ex parte injunction was eventually heard by GP Selvam J on 19 March 1999. 

**_Decision below_** 

GP Selvam J, having heard the parties, lifted the injunction. First, he felt there was no `great urgency` for the appellants` application to be made ex parte. In his view, the peak period for the sales of such bags would be before the school term re-opened for the year 1999. Second, there was suppression of material facts on the part of the appellants, who had failed in their duty to make full and frank disclosure. As this duty to make full and frank disclosure is absolute, in the sense that it is `not based on a corresponding right of the (defendant)`, even a minor breach would ordinarily be a sufficient basis to set aside the order. Thirdly, where there has been a breach of that duty it would be wrong in principle to treat an application to set aside an ex parte order as a fresh hearing of an inter partes hearing. In any event, this was not a case to which an interlocutory injunction should have been granted. 

**_The alleged infringing features_** 

The appellants alleged that the respondent`s backpacks (bags) bore similar features to those of theirs as a result of which the public would think that the `devico` bags originated from the plaintiffs, and as the respondent`s bags were of poorer quality, the appellants` goodwill would suffer. The complaints of the appellants were broadly the following. The first related to the bar-code prefix number `8887710` which had been assigned exclusively to the appellants by the Singapore Article 


Number Council (SANC). The appellants said that this bar-code prefix number (BCP number) was assigned to them for the purpose of identifying them as the manufacturers of the product to which the BCP number was affixed. Because of that, retailers had come to regard goods bearing that particular BCP `8887710`, as being distinctive of goods manufactured by the appellants. However, the respondent`s backpacks also had on them a similar number. The appellants asserted that this constituted a grave and deliberate misrepresentation by the respondent that his goods were manufactured or originated from the appellants. 

Secondly, the design of the `devico` logo closely resembled that of the `hayrer` logo. Everything was the same except for the difference in the two brand names. They pointed out that the shape of the logo, the choice of colours, the typeface employed, the abbreviations `USA` and `R` and even the central position of the logo on the bags followed those of their `hayrer` bags, making the two logos confusingly similar. This was how the appellants described their `hayrer` logo: 

(i) a black rectangle enclosing; 

(ii) a red-lined oval enclosing; 

(iii) the brand name `hayrer` in white lower-case letters; 

(iv) which letters are outlined in red; 

(v) on a navy blue background; 

(vi) with the words `U.S.A` on the bottom right-hand corner; 

(vii) and a letter `R` signifying that the mark is registered as a trademark. 

Thirdly, the appellants alleged that the general colour and design of the respondent`s `devico` backpacks were visually the same as the colour and design of their `hayrer` bags. In particular, `devico` bags had the following characteristics, which the appellants claimed were distinctive of their `hayrer` bags (a) use of one primary dark coloured fabric for the side and rear panels contrasted with a secondary light coloured fabric on the front panels; and (b) use of rugged waterproof fabric material throughout. 

Fourthly, on each `hayrer` bag there was a hang-tag attached thereto on which was printed the BCP number 8887710, as well as a lifetime warranty which read as follows: 

 Water Proof Fabric 

 All hayrer produc ts are designed and manufac tured to provide maximum c arefree servic e, hayrer produc ts c arry a lifetime guarantee to be free of defec ts in materials or workmanship. This does not c over wear and tear or abuse. Ac c ordingly, hayrer will repair or replac e, without c ost to our c ustomers, any produc t whic h is defec tive in materials or workmanship promptly after its return to our sole agents. 

The respondent not only used the appellants` BCP number, he also copied the wording of the appellants` warranty with only a change in the brand name. 


The appellants claimed that through promotions and advertisements, their customers were aware of the lifetime warranty and did place reliance on that warranty when purchasing `hayrer` bags. By reproducing the same warranty, the respondent has misrepresented to the customers that the `devico` bags originated from the appellants. The public would assume that the respondent`s lifetime warranty was put forth by the appellants and would look to the appellants to honour that warranty. Furthermore, the respondent had infringed the appellants` copyright in the lifetime warranty, when he displayed the same on his bags. 

**_The defendant`s case_** 

The respondent stated that he was not a manufacturer of bags; he merely imported his products from manufacturers in China and Hong Kong. Indeed, he also said that the appellants themselves were not manufacturers of their `hayrer` bags. Like the respondent, the appellants are merely importers and distributors of the bags. The respondent claimed that he did not determine the design or get-up of the `devico` backpacks. Similarly, he had nothing to do with the wording of the warranty which were printed on a hang-tag attached to each bag. In any case, the two brand names were entirely different. There could not be any confusion. 

**_Issues_** 

Before us counsel for the appellants submitted that GP Selvam J should not have discharged the interim injunction as the appellants had more than established that there was a serious question to be tried in passing-off. Furthermore, in relation to the issue of balance of convenience, they claimed that they had amply shown that it should be resolved in their favour. 

As the learned judge below had in his grounds of decision dealt mainly with the questions whether in this instance, the application for an injunction should have been made on an ex parte basis and whether there had been a breach of the duty to make full and frank disclosure of material facts, we will address these issues first. 

**_Exparte application_** 

In reliance on **Griffin Steel Founderies Ltd v Canadian Association of Industrial, Mechanical & Allied Workers** [1977] 80 DLR (3d) 634, the learned judge felt that an injunction should be granted ex parte only where the circumstances establish extraordinary urgency and only for such period of time as is necessary to enable notice to be served on those to be enjoined. Applications for an ordinary interlocutory injunction should be treated differently from those which are in the nature of a Mareva injunction or an Anton Piller order, the latter being a class of their own. 

As mentioned before, the learned judge was very much troubled by the appellants` allegation that if notice were given to the respondent he would release all his stock at an even cheaper price. He noted that such backpacks were not items which people would buy for Chinese New Year. He thought that the peak period for the sale of such bags would have passed as the new school term had already started by 4 January 1999. The application was made on 6 January 1999. In his view, the allegation was `spurious if not absurd` and that it was something contrived to `blindfold the court`. He felt there was nothing to warrant the issue of an interlocutory injunction without the respondent being notified. 


Before we proceed further, we would, at this juncture, like to make an observation of a general nature. Where a judge hears an inter partes application to discharge an ex parte injunction, he is not sitting in appeal over the decision of the first judge who granted the order. He is to determine whether on the full facts and arguments presented by both parties before him, the injunction should be continued or discharged or a fresh injunction be issued. The question whether on the facts presented to the first judge urgency had been sufficiently demonstrated had already been determined by him when he made the order. In this case, the first judge did query why notice was not given to the defendant. An explanation was given and he was satisfied. If it is subsequently shown that there had been misrepresentations, suppression of material facts or material non-disclosure, in relation to the obtaining of that order, then the second judge hearing the discharge application may make such order as he deems fair and just in all the circumstances (see [para ] 21-34 below which discuss the issue of material non-disclosure and its consequences). 

Be that as it may, reverting to the present matter, the appellants contended before us that the views of the learned judge, that students would have bought their bags before school term re-opened for the year 1999, were not supported by the evidence. In our opinion, this criticism is valid. We note that not only had the respondent not challenged the appellants` claim that sales of such bags during the period between the time when the new school term re-opened and Hari Raya/Chinese New Year, would be brisk, the respondent himself had in December 1998 even ordered 9,000 such bags to be shipped to him in January 1999. So the sales in January of these bags must still be good. Since this point was the foundation upon which the learned judge held there was no urgency, and thus no justification for the ex parte application, it would follow that this aspect of his decision cannot hold good. 

**_Material non-disclosure_** 

It is trite law that there is a clear duty on the part of an applicant for an ex parte interlocutory injunction to make a full and frank disclosure: see **R v Kensington Income Tax Commissioners** [1917] 1 KB 486 at 504. The difficulty here is in determining what facts are material. Any definition of `materiality` has to be, by its very nature, general. In the words of Ralph Gibson LJ in **Brinks-MAT Ltd v Elcombe** [1988] 3 All ER 188 `material facts are those which it is material for the judge to know in dealing with the application.` It need not be `decisive or conclusive` per Warren LH Khoo J in **Poon Kng Siang v Tan Ah Keng** <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 562</span>. We would add that the duty to disclose applies not only to material facts known to the applicant but also such additional facts which he would have known if he had made proper inquiries. The extent of the inquiries which an applicant should make would have to depend on the facts and circumstances prevailing in the case. 

**_Location of Bar Code Prefix: No reliance was placed on the brand name: Distinctive get-up of `hayrer` bags: Design of `hayrer` logo: Appellants` practice of removing the hang-tag from some `hayrer` bags:_** GP Selvam J not only held that there was material non-disclosure, he also felt there was in fact deliberate suppression. Besides noting that the appellants were not truthful when they alleged that the respondent was a manufacturer, he identified five instances where he thought the appellants had misrepresented the facts or omitted material facts: 

(i) The appellants stated that the BCP number was affixed to the exterior of the bag and was plainly visible to the eye. The judge noted that it was in fact not printed on the bag itself but on a hang-tag attached to the exterior of the bag. On the tag, apart from the bar code, other matters were also stated thereon, including the lifetime warranty, the appellants` name, as well as their telephone and fax numbers. 


(ii) in respect of both the `hayrer` bags and `devico` bags, the brand names appeared on the outside and inside of the bags. No one could ever possibly confuse the `hayrer` bags with the `devico` bags. The learned judge felt that this was such an obvious fact that the appellants should have expressly stated that they were not placing any reliance on their brand name at all. 

(iii) The appellants had misrepresented that there was a single distinctive theme get-up for their `hayrer` bags. In fact the appellants` bags had several colour combinations besides the one which they alleged was copied by the respondent. In one design, there was only a single colour black. He also noted that other brand bags on the market displayed basically similar features from the `hayrer` bags. 

(iv) The appellants claimed that the `hayrer` logo was distinctive with specific characteristics. The impression given was that there was only one design of the `hayrer` logo for all their bags. The respondent had shown to the court below that the `hayrer` brand name was depicted in numerous different ways, colours and shapes. 

(v) One of the respondent`s witnesses, Mr Tan Yang Ming, deposed that when she made a purchase of a `hayrer` bag from the appellants` own outlet, the sale staff tore off the `hang tag` before delivering it to her. She had no opportunity to peruse the bar code and the lifetime warranty. Neither was she given a substitute warranty. The learned judge found that `this made a nonsense out of the appellants` case based on the bar-code prefix warranty.` The appellants did not deny such a practice, but merely tried to explain it away by saying that they were doing stock-taking. 

On non-disclosure (i), while we recognise that what was set out by the appellants in their statement of claim and their affidavits could have been made clearer, too much should not be made out of this point as the judge hearing the ex parte application in fact had sight of the bags in question and he would have noticed that the BCP number appeared on a hang-tag. On non-disclosure (ii), again we do not think the appellants should be faulted for not expressly stating that their case did not depend on their brand-name. That was clearly unnecessary as the marks `hayrer` and `devico` are so obviously different that no case in passing-off could ever be made out based on just those two words. Their case was premised on the overall get-up of the bags. There was no assertion by the appellants that the respondent`s brand name was confusingly similar to the appellants` brand name. Their grounds for alleging passing-off were clearly set out in [para ] 9 of the first affidavit of the appellants` general manager. As the learned judge correctly observed in [para ] 30 of his grounds of decision, the appellants `pitched their case on the allegation that the `hayrer` bags had a unique get-up and common characteristics by reason of their shape, colour and design.` 

As regards the other three instances of non-disclosure, we agree with the learned judge that they were material: the fact that the appellants` `hayrer` bags came in various designs and colour schemes; the fact that there was in fact more than one way in which the `hayrer` logo appeared; and the practice of removing the hand-tag before handing a `hayrer` bag over to a purchaser these were facts which would be highly material to the determination whether prima facie there was any likelihood of passing-off, which in turn would affect the question whether an interlocutory injunction should be granted. It is not true that the distinctive colour scheme of the appellants` backpacks was `one primary dark coloured fabric for the side and rear panels contrasted with a secondary light coloured fabric on the front panels.` These were matters wholly within the appellants` knowledge and which they knew or should have known would be very important to the ex parte application. Yet they failed to disclose. 

Once material non-disclosure is established, the court has a discretion whether to discharge the interlocutory injunction without looking into the merits. All the more so, where a judge had, as in this 


case, found that the omissions were deliberate with a view to misrepresent. In the appellants` case, they did not really seek to explain these three instances of non-disclosure or misrepresentation, though they did explain with regard to the other two, on which we have held that there was no material omission or misrepresentation. With regard to the appellants` practice of removing the handtag, we ought to mention that although the appellants had explained that this was on account of stock-check being carried out, it is not clear why stocktaking should involve the removal of the handtag if the tag was for the protection of the buyer. 

An appellate tribunal should not disturb the discretion exercised by the judge below unless it is shown that the latter had erred in law or principle: see **QBE Insurance Ltd v Sim Lim Finance Ltd** [1987] SLR 15 [1987] 2 MLJ 656 , **Wright Norman & Anor v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd** <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR 710</span> and **Tang Siew Choy & Ors v Certact Pte Ltd** <span class="citation">[1993] 3 SLR 44</span>. 

In this case, the learned judge discharged the interlocutory injunction because in his view the duty to disclose was absolute and `even a minor breach will ordinarily be a basis to (set) aside the order`. We wish only to point out that in law the rule is not as strict as that. This is clearly set out in the judgment of Ralph Gibson LJ in **_Brink`s-MAT_** (supra) where, after reviewing the authorities, he said (at p 193): 

 (vi) Whether the fac t not disc losed is of suffic ient materiality to justify or require immediate disc harge of the order without examination of the merits depends on the importanc e of the fac t to the issues whic h were to be dec ided by the judge on the applic ation. The answer to the question whether the nondisc losure was innoc ent, in the sense that the fac t was not known to the applic ant or that its relevanc e was not perc eived, is an important c onsideration but not dec isive by reason of the duty on the applic ant to make all proper inquiries and to give c areful c onsideration to the c ase being presented. (vii) Finally, it is not for every omission that the injunc tion will be automatically disc harged. A locus poenitentiae may sometimes be afforded: see Bank Mellat v Nikpour [1985] FSR 87 at p 90 per Lord Denning, MR. The c ourt has a disc retion, notwithstanding proof of material non-disc losure whic h justifies or requires the immediate disc harge of the ex parte order, nevertheless to c ontinue the order, or to make a new order on terms ... 

Balcombe LJ, in the same case, after referring to the rule requiring full and frank disclosure as a judge-made rule said that that rule should not be allowed to become an instrument of injustice and he went on to explain (at p 194): 

 It is for this reason that there must be a disc retion in the c ourt to c ontinue the injunc tion, or to grant a fresh injunc tion in its plac e, notwithstanding that there may have been non-disc losure when the original ex parte injunc tion was obtained: see in general Bank Mellat v Nikpour [1985] FSR 87 at 90 and Lloyds Bowmaker Ltd v Britannia Arrow Holdings plc (Lavens, third party) [1988] 3 All ER 178, a rec ent dec ision of this c ourt in whic h the authorities are fully reviewed. I make two c omments on the exerc ise of this disc retion. (i) Whilst, having regard to the purpose of the rule, the disc retion is one to be exerc ised sparingly, I would not wish to define or limit the c irc umstanc es in whic h it may be exerc ised. (ii) I agree with the views of Dillon LJ in the Lloyds Bowmaker c ase [1988] 3 All ER 178 at p 187 that, if there is jurisdic tion to grant a fresh injunc tion, then there must also be a disc retion to refuse, in an appropriate c ase, to disc harge the original injunc tion. 


The third member of the quorum, Slade LJ, endorsed the analysis of the law made by Ralph Gibson and Balcombe, LJJ and went on to add that the practical difficulties encountered by a party making ex parte applications should not be overlooked: 

 Nevertheless, the nature of the princ iple, as I see it, is essentially penal and in its applic ation the prac tic al realities of any c ase before the c ourt c annot be overlooked. By their very nature, ex parte applic ations usually nec essitate the giving and taking of instruc tions and the preparation of the requisite drafts in some haste. Partic ularly in heavy c ommerc ial c ases, the borderline between material fac ts and non-material fac ts may be a somewhat unc ertain one. While in no way disc ounting the heavy duty of c andour and c are whic h falls on persons making ex parte applic ations, I do not think the applic ation of the princ iple should be c arried to extreme lengths. 

He even went further to introduce the element of proportionality in the consideration of the matter as follows: 

 Though in the present c ase I agree that there was some material, albeit innoc ent, non-disc losure on the applic ation to Roc h J, I am quite satisfied that the punishment would be out of all proportion to the offenc e, and indeed would c ause a serious potential injustic e if this c ourt were, on ac c ount of suc h nondisc losure, to refuse to c ontinue the injunc tion granted by Roc h J on 9 Dec ember 1986. 

Notwithstanding that the learned judge below seemed to have stated the law on the consequence of non-disclosure in terms broader than is justifiable by the authorities, it is clear to us that the nondisclosures enumerated in [para ] 22(iii) and (iv) above could not be viewed as minor. The learned judge felt that there was deliberate suppression. On this, looking at the matter fairly, we do not think we could disagree with him. Those non-disclosures, in our opinion, would have affected the decision of the judge hearing the ex parte application. They were directly relevant to the question of confusion. 

**_Issue of a fresh injunction_** 

An alternative argument put before GP Selvam J was that he could and should in the circumstances of this case treat the hearing as a fresh inter partes hearing and grant the injunction prayed for. Here the learned judge took much the same approach as he did in considering the question of the continuation of the existing injunction. As mentioned before, his basic premise was that the duty to make full and frank disclosure was an absolute obligation and `even a minor breach will ordinarily be a basis to (set) aside the order.` The court hearing an ex parte application was often short of time to scrutinize the matter closely and had to rely on the plaintiffs. Thus he concluded: 

 Unless the breac h of duty entails some effec tive sanc tion, human nature will tempt the applic ant to angle his c ase in his own favour. 

 For the same reason it is wrong in principle to treat an application to set aside an ex parte order as a fresh hearing of an inter partes hearing and 


 ignore the principles outlined above. However, in a c ase where there is ample justific ation for an ex parte applic ation, a different proc edure would naturally be followed. 

It will be seen that the learned judge seemed to be of the view that because of the non-disclosure of material facts, that fact per se excluded the appellants from applying for the issue of a fresh injunction. However, the last sentence of his, quoted above, would appear to indicate that his refusal to make a fresh interlocutory injunction had something to do with the fact that in his opinion there was no urgency in the case that the application should have been made ex parte in the first place. As discussed above ([para ] 27 to 31), the court still retains, even where there is a material nondisclosure, a discretion to either continue the ex parte order or grant a fresh order. It depends on the nature of the non-disclosure and the circumstances of the case. We would hasten to add that while the learned judge did quote the passage of Ralph-Gibson LJ in **_Brink`s-MAT Ltd_** cited above, we are, however, left in some doubt whether he did fully appreciate that there was still a discretion in the court to continue the ex parte injunction or grant a fresh injunction, even where there had been a material non-disclosure. 

We would at this juncture refer to the case, **Yardley & Co & Ors v Higsons & Ors** [1984] FSR 304, which was concerned with an ordinary interlocutory injunction, to illustrate the application of a less rigid approach towards material non-disclosures. There, which was an action to prevent passing-off, it was held that even though there had been a material non-disclosure when the plaintiffs first obtained a three-week interim injunction, that did not preclude the plaintiffs from seeking a second interim injunction against the defendants after full disclosure. It was against this second injunction that the defendants had appealed, arguing that as the plaintiffs had failed to disclose material facts to the judge who granted the first injunction, no further equitable relief should be granted to the plaintiffs. The Court of Appeal demurred and held that the fact that there had been non-disclosure of a material fact to the first judge did not prevent the grant of further relief at a subsequent application when that fact was fully before the court. Lawton LJ said: 

 I do not find it nec essary to go into the law about this matter in any way, bec ause it is c lear that in c ases of injunc tions, even if there has to be a disc harge of one injunc tion bec ause there has not been proper disc losure, that does not prevent a further applic ation for an injunc tion being made. I will ac c ept for the purposes of my judgment that before Nourse J there was a failure to make as full disc losure as should have been made and that the omissions were material omissions. But after that there was a further applic ation, and when the matter c ame before Goulding J on the further applic ation he was apprised of all the material fac ts ... 

**_Our decision_** 

In the light of the fact that the statements of principle enunciated by the learned judge below regarding the continuation of an existing interlocutory injunction or the grant of a fresh injunction on account of material non-disclosures are not entirely in line with modern authorities, it thus behoves us to determine afresh whether in this instance the existing interlocutory injunction should be continued or a fresh injunction should be granted. The learned judge had found that there was some deliberateness in the non-disclosure amounting to suppression. On this ground alone we are of the view that the interlocutory injunction granted on 8 January 1999 should be discharged. It is 


necessary to drive home to the parties and their solicitors the point of the serious consequences of non-disclosure. Where there is suppression, instead of innocent omission, it must be a special case for the court to exercise its discretion not to discharge the ex parte injunction. 

The next question is whether a fresh injunction should have been granted by GP Selvam J, since all the facts were before him. In **_Brinks-MAT_** that jurisdiction was recognised. In **Lloyds Bowmaker Ltd v Britannia Arrow Holdings** [1988] 3 All ER 178, Glidewell LJ said. 

 ... even though a first injunc tion is disc harged bec ause of material nondisc losure, the c ourt has a disc retion whether to grant a sec ond Mareva injunc tion at a stage when the whole of the fac ts, inc luding that of the original non-disc losure, are before it, and may well grant suc h a sec ond injunc tion if the original non-disc losure was innoc ent and if an injunc tion c ould properly be granted even had the fac ts been disc losed. 

We ought to mention that in **_Lloyds Bowmaker_** Dillon LJ went a step further when he said (at p 187): 

 There is no doubt that there is jurisdic tion to grant a fresh injunc tion, even though there has been c ulpable non-disc losure when the original injunc tion was applied for. 

We agree there is this jurisdiction. 

While we do not think that culpable non-disclosure would ipso facto disentitle the party who is in breach thereof to a fresh injunction, if the circumstances would otherwise warrant it, it is nevertheless a very significant factor to be taken into account by the court, always bearing in mind that there are degrees of culpability and the relative importance of the omitted fact or facts. However, in relation to the circumstances of the present case, we are not inclined to hold that the learned judge below should have granted a fresh injunction not only because the non-disclosures (iii) and (iv) were significant, but also because having seen the various samples that were placed before us, we do not seriously think there would be any real likelihood of confusion. While there are common features between the backpacks of the appellants and the respondent, there are also differences. In fact, in the market place such backpacks are common and they have been around for quite a while and they come in various brands. Equally important to note is the fact that even the appellants` backpacks come in various designs; similarly their logo. We see that the particular logo design of `hayrer` which the appellants alleged the respondent copied is in fact similar to those of other third party brands (eg `Outdoor`, `Classa`). In our view, what distinguishes the appellants` backpacks from similar backpacks of other importers/manufacturers is really their name or mark. On this there can be no dispute that `devico` is entirely different from `hayrer` and no confusion can conceivably arise on account of that. 

As for the point about the similar BCP numbers, there is nothing to indicate that the consumers were aware of the significance of that. All the more so, the consumers would not think they were the same, when the further six numbers that followed the BCP numbers were different from those of the appellants. As for the retailers, while they would know the significance of the BCP numbers, they would not likely be misled. The invoice from the respondent, plus the different brand name, would have alerted the retailer that he was dealing with a different importer/manufacturer. A phone call would have straightened out any misconception. 


There is another factor which this court is entitled to take into account in determining whether we should grant a fresh injunction. The object behind the grant of an interlocutory injunction is to protect the plaintiff`s rights and to prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiff during the period up to the trial. We note that since the decision of GP Selvam J to lift the ex parte injunction a year ago, no steps had been taken by the appellants to move the action along, other than asking for further arguments before the learned judge on his decision to lift the injunction. If steps were taken, the trial of the action would probably have been completed some time ago. The appellants took 21 days to file their notice of appeal. Neither did they apply for an expedited hearing of the appeal. If they were suffering because of GP Selvam J`s refusal to grant a fresh interlocutory injunction we would have expected them to move the case to trial with due despatch. However, no urgency was shown at all. The impression created by their conduct is that there is no real risk of irreparable harm. 

In the Canadian case **Havana House Cigar & Tobacco Merchants Ltd v Naeini** [1998] 79 CPR (3d) 496 the following remarks of Rothstein J are germane (at pp 500-501): 

 After rec eiving a negative dec ision on their first interloc utory injunc tion applic ation, one would think that if the plaintiffs had a serious c ase to pursue and are suffering harm with the passage of time, whether irreparable or not, they would have attempted to move the c ase forward to trial with expedition. 

### ... 

 The c ourt will take a dim view of a sec ond interloc utory injunc tion applic ation when a plaintiff has not aggressively been advanc ing the c ase toward trial. 

It is pertinent to note that a similar principle is also applied in the analogous situation where a plaintiff has obtained an interlocutory injunction but failed to advance the case to trial expeditiously. In **_Newsgroup Newspapers Ltd v Mirror Group Newspaper_** (1986) Ltd [1991] FSR 487 Hoffmann J said (at pp 489-490): 

 An interloc utory injunc tion is an order whic h restric ts a defendants liberty at a time when there has been no finding of wrongdoing by the c ourt. It is done in order to preserve the position, pending a determination of the merits, in c ases when the c ourt thinks that justic e so requires. In my judgment it is inc umbent upon a plaintiff whose position has been protec ted in that way by an interloc utory injunc tion to proc eed with the ac tion with due diligenc e so as to limit as far as possible the period during whic h the defendants liberty is restric ted without there having been any determination of the merits. 

### ... 

 A plaintiff who has obtained an interloc utory injunc tion is not in my view entitled simply to rest upon that injunc tion, to assume, as the plaintiff in this c ase expressly said he assumed, that in the absenc e of c omplaint the defendant is c ontent to treat the injunc tion as permanent without any further steps having to be taken and to wait until the defendant finds the situation suffic iently burdensome to prompt him to make an applic ation for variation of its terms. 


In all the circumstances of the case, and applying the test of the `lower risk of injustice` pronounced by this court in **Chuan Hong Petrol Station Pte Ltd v Shell Singapore (Pte) Ltd** <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR 729</span> at 743, we do not think that the appellants have demonstrated that there would be a `lower risk of injustice` if we should grant an injunction. In fact, we think that the reverse is probably true. The appellants have also asserted that the respondent`s bags were of a poorer quality. This was a bare assertion without any objective evidence in substantiation. 

**_Copyright infringement_** 

There is a related point about copyright infringement which we must address. The respondent was by the order of 8 January 1999 restrained from infringing the appellants` copyright in the wording of the lifetime warranty of the appellants. This action instituted by the appellants is for passing-off, to protect their alleged goodwill in the backpacks. The similarity in the wording of the lifetime warranty was one of several aspects relied upon by the appellants to substantiate the claim of passing-off. While the wording of the lifetime warranty of the appellants is in a broad sense a piece of literary work, it really cannot subsist on its own as a literary work. In itself, the warranty as a literary work is hardly consequential. Really, it is de minimis. Thus, we do not think that any injunction should be granted solely on account of this alleged infringement. 

**_Miscellaneous observations_** 

Before we conclude this judgment, we think it necessary to comment on a few general observations made by the learned judge below. First, he seemed to think that there is a clear distinction between interlocutory injunction and interim injunction, the former to be made only `on an inter partes application after full affidavit evidence and in appropriate cases, after it is tested on the anvil of cross-examination,` and the latter `on the basis of less than full evidence and arguments` and it is to be operative until full evidence and arguments could be heard leading to the making of an interlocutory order. Secondly, relying upon the opinion of O`Sullivan JA in **_Griffin Steel Founderies_** (supra), he said that an ex parte injunction, which is an interim injunction granted without notice to the defendant, should never be granted for an indefinite period. 

In our opinion, the terms `interim injunction` and `interlocutory injunction` are not terms of art, and in their ordinary sense, an interim injunction means an injunction made in the meantime and until something is done, eg the final disposal of the matter; and an interlocutory injunction means an injunction made prior to the final disposal of the suit or action, ie at the interlocutory stage of the suit or action. An interim injunction is an interlocutory injunction, and vice versa. We do not think that there is any material difference between the two. 

Even in the **_Supreme Court Practice 1999_** the two terms are used interchangeably. As illustrations, we will quote the following passages: 

 Paragraph 29/1A/ 

 Where an injunc tion is c laimed in a partys writ, originating summons, etc , and an interloc utory injunc tion is granted in similar terms that injunc tion may be desc ribed as an interim injunc tion 

 Paragraph 28/l/ 


 The grant of an interloc utory injunc tion is a very important matter as a defendant c an be sent to prison for breac h ... When an applic ation is made for an interim injunc tion, the c ourt has a very diffic ult jurisdic tion to exerc ise. It is sometimes impossible to make an order whic h may not do some injustic e to one party or the other ... The proc edure to be adopted by the c ourt in hearing applic ations for interloc utory injunc tions, and the tests to be applied were laid down by the House of Lords in ... 

A clear exposition of the two terms is also set out in the book **_David Bean on Injunctions_** (7th Ed) as follows: 

 Injunc tion may be further c lassified ac c ording to the period of time for whic h the order is to remain in forc e. A perpetual injunc tion is a final judgment, and for that reason is usually only granted (exc ept by c onsent of the defendant) after a trial on the merits. An interlocutory injunc tion, by c ontrast, is a provisional measure taken at an earlier stage in the proc eedings, before the c ourt has had an opportunity to hear and weigh fully the evidenc e on both sides. It is generally expressed to c ontinue in forc e until the trial of this ac tion or further order. An interim injunc tion is still more temporary, and remains in forc e only until a named day, eg until 10.30am on Tuesday 4 Oc tober (or so soon thereafter as c ounsel may be heard). The terms interim and interlocutory are often used interc hangeably. 

Turning to the second point, we must point out that our courts have in the last ten years or so adopted a practice different from that advocated by O`Sullivan JA in **_Griffin Steel Founderies_**. It is true that previously our courts had granted ex parte interim injunctions until the next Motion Day when counsel would move for the continuation of the injunctions. This resulted in a situation where on each Motion Day there were numerous applications for continuation of the interim injunctions. For this reason, a practice had developed and been adopted by practically all the judges, though no formal discussion or decision was taken on it, to grant an interim injunction, even if it is ex parte, until trial or until further order and sometimes with an express provision (not that it is absolutely necessary), giving liberty to the defendant to apply to court to have the ex parte order set aside. 

**_Judgment_** 

In the result, we would dismiss the appeal with costs, with the usual consequential orders. 

## Outcome: 

Appeal dismissed.
