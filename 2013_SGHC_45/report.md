**Introduction** 

1       In this suit, the plaintiff, Cavenagh Investment Pte Ltd (“the Plaintiff”), c laims against the defendant, Dr Rajiv Kaushik (“Dr Kaushik”), damages for trespass to land. These c laims inc lude a sum amounting to $352,704, being what the Plaintiff says is the market rent of the property for the period of 1 Dec ember 2008 to 6 Oc tober 2011 while Dr Kaushik was alleged to have wrongfully oc c upied and trespassed on the property, as well as a sum amounting to $12,000 for what it says is the c ost of reinstatement for damage to the property. On the sec ond day of the trial before me, c ounsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Ernest Balasubramaniam (“Mr Balasubramaniam”) said that it was no longer pursuing the sec ond c laim. 

2       At issue before me is therefore, whether Dr Kaushik had c ommitted the tort of trespass to land, and, if so, whether and to what extent he is liable to pay the Plaintiff damages. 

**The factual background** 

3       The bac kground to the present dispute is fairly unc omplic ated in so far as the undisputed fac ts are c onc erned. 

**_The characters_** 


**_The characters_** 

4       The main subjec t matter of the present suit, 132 Tanjong Rhu, #15-10, Pebble Bay, Singapore 436919 (“the Property”) is owned by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff desc ribes itself as an “investment c ompany” and is one of several c ompanies whic h together form what is loosely known as the Lee Tat group of c ompanies. The Plaintiff, like most of the other c ompanies in the Lee Tat group, has as its sole shareholder and direc tor, Madam Ching Mun Fong (“Madam Ching”). Also like most of the other c ompanies, it has no employees. The Plaintiff’s only assets are the Property and another unit also at the same Pebble Bay c ondominium development (“Pebble Bay”). The properties of the Plaintiff and the other property-holding c ompanies in the Lee Tat group are managed by Lee Tat Property Management Pte Ltd (“Lee Tat Property”), a c ompany run by Madam Ching and several employees. 

5       Dr Kaushik is a New Zealand c itizen and was at the material time the President and a direc tor of 

a c ompany known as I^2 MS.Net Pte Ltd (“I^2 MS.Net”). Pursuant to the terms of his employment with 

the c ompany, I^2 MS.Net provided him and his family with ac c ommodation in Singapore. 

6       Another important c harac ter to bac kground of the present suit is a man known as Mohamed Razali bin Chic hik (“Razali”) who was an employee of Lee Tat Property at the material time. 

**_Dr Kaushik’s occupation of the Property_** 

_The c irc umstanc es leading to Dr Kaushik’s oc c upation of the Property_ 

7       In or around September 2008, Dr Kaushik and his wife c ame ac ross an advertisement in the 

Straits Times newspaper seeking prospec tive tenants for the Property. [note: 1] As Dr Kaushik and his family were already staying in Pebble Bay under a lease in a different unit with another landlord, the 

advertisement piqued his interest. [note: 2] When he c alled the number listed on the advertisement, 

Razali answered and proc eeded to invite Dr Kaushik and his wife to view the Property. [note: 3] Dr Kaushik’s wife attended the first viewing. At the sec ond viewing, Dr Kaushik went with his wife. Dr Kaushik notic ed that Razali had all the keys and ac c ess c ards to the Property, and he seemed to be 

known to all the sec urity guards at Pebble Bay. [note: 4] 

8       Some deliberation and negotiations with Razali over the rent and rec tific ations to the fittings in 

the Property (whic h Razali took c are of ) then took plac e. [note: 5] As to these rec tific ations whic h involved c hanging the c urtains and doors of the Property, as well as repainting and c leaning, Dr 

Kaushik testified that Razali tended to them satisfac torily. [note: 6] Dr Kaushik then informed Razali 

that his employer I^2 MS.Net wanted to rent the Property for his family’s ac c ommodation. [note: 7] On 

23     Oc tober 2008, I^2 MS.Net rec eived a letter of intent bearing a letter head whic h read “Cavenagh 

Investment Pte Ltd” and whic h was signed by Razali. [note: 8] Dr Kaushik signed this letter on behalf of 

I^2 MS.Net. Razali asked for payment of the monthly rental to him. Finding this unusual, Dr Kaushik 

insisted on a letter of authority from the Plaintiff. [note: 9] On 31 Oc tober 2008, Razali produc ed a signed letter bearing the letter head of the Plaintiff stating that Razali was authorised to rec eive the 

monthly rental. [note: 10] Subsequently on 3 November 2008, Dr Kaushik asked his staff at I^2 MS.Net to do due diligenc e, and found that the Property was owned by the Plaintiff, and that its sole direc tor 

and shareholder was Madam Ching. [note: 11] As a result, Dr Kaushik requested Razali to obtain the 

signature of Madam Ching on the tenanc y agreement (“the Tenanc y Agreement”) before I^2 MS.Net 

would finalise the lease. [note: 12] On 1 Dec ember 2008, Razali attended at I^2 MS.Net’s offic e with a 


c opy of the Tenanc y Agreement bearing a stamp whic h read “Cavenagh Investment Pte Ltd”. It was 

purportedly signed by Madam Ching. [note: 13] The signature on this Tenanc y Agreement was the same as the one on the letter authorising Razali to rec eive payment. The Tenanc y Agreement was 

signed on behalf of I^2 MS.Net by its ac c ounts exec utive, Eileen. 

9       I^2 MS.Net paid a c ontrac tual deposit of $18,000 to Razali, and Dr Kaushik and his family moved 

into the Property after the purported lease c ommenc ed on 1 Dec ember 2008. [note: 14] 

_The lease extension_ 

10     In or around September 2010, when the first term of the purported Tenanc y Agreement was 

ending, Dr Kaushik indic ated to Razali that I^2 MS.Net wanted to extend the lease. [note: 15] Razali replied with a letter, again bearing the letter head of the Plaintiff, extending the lease by 2 years from 

1       Dec ember 2010 to 30 November 2012. [note: 16] 

11     For the entire period from Dec ember 2008 to Marc h 2011, I^2 MS.Net paid the monthly rent of $9,000 to Razali. The total sum paid amounted to $270,000 ($252,000 being rent for 28 months and 

$18,000 being the 2 months’ sec urity deposit). [note: 17] 

_Razali’s fraud unravels_ 

12     On 8 Marc h 2011, two employees of Lee Tat Property, one Lim Mui Wah (“Annie”) and another 

known only as Lynn, appeared at the Property and were surprised to find it oc c upied. [note: 18] Ac c ording to them, the Property was supposed to be vac ant. Lee Tat Property had found out that Razali was operating a fraud when a tenant of a property owned by another c ompany of the group c alled up Lee Tat Property for c larific ation after Razali had asked for future rentals to be paid to him 

direc tly. [note: 19] The alarm having been raised, Annie and Lynn were sent to inspec t the properties 

managed by Lee Tat Property. [note: 20] 

13     As it turns out, Razali had been ac ting on his own ac c ord and without the authority of the Plaintiff or Lee Tat Property. At trial, it emerged that the signatures on the Tenanc y Agreement, the let t er renewing the lease, and the letter authorising Razali to rec eive payment were not Madam Ching’s. The stamps on the Tenanc y Agreement were also not the stamps of the Plaintiff. 

_Negotiations between the parties and Dr Kaushik vac ating the Property_ 

14     Letters were exc hanged between the parties as regards their legal position. [note: 21] 

Meanwhile, I^2 MS.Net c ontinued to pay the monthly rent for the period from April 2011 to September 2011 (amounting to $54,000), but paid these monies to the Plaintiff instead. Dr Kaushik and his family moved out of the Property on 3 Oc tober 2011, and handed the keys to the Plaintiff on 6 Oc tober 

2011\. [note: 22] 

**The present suit** 

15     In the present suit, the Plaintiff c laims against Dr Kaushik for damages for trespass to land. The Plaintiff c laims the sum of $352,704, being what it c laims the Property would have fetc hed during Dr Kaushik’s oc c upation of the Property. It further c laims damages of $12,000 for the c ost of reinstatement of the Property. As I have noted at the outset, the Plaintiff dec ided not to pursue this 


latter c laim on the sec ond day of the trial. 

**The issues to be decided** 

16     The issues to be dec ided in this present suit may be summarised into the following: 

 (a) whether there was a valid lease binding on the Plaintiff suc h that Dr Kaushik’s oc c upation of the Property was not a trespass to land; 

 (b) whether any of the defenc es raised by Dr Kaushik apply; and 

 (c ) if there was trespass to land, whether and to what extent Dr Kaushik is liable in damages. 

**My decision** 

**_Whether there was a valid lease binding on the Plaintiff as a result of Razali acting as its agent_** 

17     Dr Kaushik’s defenc e is that there was a valid lease binding on the Plaintiff. Consequently, there c an be no trespass to land c ommitted as a result of his oc c upation of the Property. In advanc ing this defenc e, Dr Kaushik makes four main arguments. First, Dr Kaushik relies on the signed Tenanc y Agreement. Sec ond, he avers that Razali had the ostensible authority to enter into a lease on behalf of the Plaintiff. Third, Dr Kaushik relies on the princ iple in the English Court of Appeal dec ision of _First Energy (UK) Ltd v Hungarian International Bank Ltd_ [1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 194 (“ _Fir st Energy_ ”) to c ontend that Razali had the ostensible authority to c ommunic ate and represent to him the Plaintiff’s approval of the lease, thus binding the Plaintiff by doing so. Last, assuming all the above arguments fail, Dr Kaushik then argues that the Plaintiff had ratified the unauthorised ac ts of Razali, thus binding itself to the purported lease. I will deal with these arguments in turn. 

_The signed Tenanc y Agreement_ 

18     Relying on the signed Tenanc y Agreement, Dr Kaushik alleges that there was a valid lease. At the trial, it was not disputed that the signatures on the Tenanc y Agreement and the letter extending the lease were forged. While they were purported as having been signed by Madam Ching, it was in fac t not so. Likewise, the stamp purporting to be the c ompany stamp of the Plaintiff was a forgery. To this, the Plaintiff referred me to the dec ision of _Ruben and Another v Great Fingall Consolidated a nd Others_ [1906] 1 AC 439 at 443 for the proposition that a forged doc ument is a “pure nullity” whic h therefore c annot bind it. I ac c ept that this princ iple c overs the present c ase. As further explained by Brennan J (at [21] of his judgment) in the High Court of Australia in _Northside Developments Pty Ltd v Registrar-General_ (1990) 170 CLR 146 in respec t of c ases suc h as the present, whic h he c alls a “forgery in the stric t sense”: 

 ... A c ompany c annot give authority to fix a false seal and it is diffic ult to envisage a c ase in whic h there would be ostensible authority to write a false signature. 

19     Plainly, bec ause an agent c annot have authority, ac tual or ostensible, to c ommit forgery, a princ ipal c annot be liable on the basis of suc h a doc ument. Ac c ordingly, the existenc e of the forged Tenanc y Agreement purportedly signed by Madam Ching does not help Dr Kaushik. 

_Razali’s ostensible authority to enter into the lease on behalf of the Plaintiff_ 

20     Notwithstanding the fac t that the signature on the Tenanc y Agreement was forged, the 


Plaintiff may still be bound by the purported lease if there is evidenc e that Razali had the ostensible authority to bind it to suc h a lease. The doc trine of ostensible authority is founded on the notion of a representation by a princ ipal that an agent has authority to do c ertain things on its behalf whic h in fac t he does not. In the oft-c ited c ase of _Freeman & Loc kyer (a firm) v Buc khurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd and Another_ [1964] 2 QB 480 (“ _Freeman Loc kyer_ ”), Diploc k LJ explained (at 503–504): 

 An “apparent” or “ostensible” authority ... is a legal relationship between the princ ipal and the c ontrac tor c reated by a representation, made by the princ ipal to the c ontrac tor, intended to be and in fac t ac ted upon by the c ontrac tor, that the agent has authority to enter on behalf of the princ ipal into a c ontrac t of a kind within the sc ope of the “apparent” authority, so as to render the princ ipal liable to perform any obligations imposed upon him by suc h c ontrac t. To the relationship so c reated the agent is a stranger. He need not be (although he generally is) aware of the existenc e of the representation but he must not purport to make the agreement as princ ipal himself. The representation, when ac ted upon by the c ontrac tor by entering into a c ontrac t with the agent, operates as an estoppel, preventing the princ ipal from asserting that he is not bound by the c ontrac t. It is irrelevant whether the agent had ac tual authority to enter into the c ontrac t. 

 ... 

 The representation whic h c reates “apparent” authority may take a variety of forms of whic h the c ommonest is representation by c onduc t, that is, by permitting the agent to ac t in some way in the c onduc t of the princ ipal's business with other persons. By so doing the princ ipal represents to anyone who bec omes aware that the agent is so ac ting that the agent has authority to enter on behalf of the princ ipal into c ontrac ts with other persons of the kind whic h an agent so ac ting in the c onduc t of his princ ipal’s business has usually “ac tual” authority to enter into. 

21     To this end, the submissions of Mr Ian Lim (“Mr Lim”), c ounsel for Dr Kaushik, on the internal workings of Lee Tat Property, suc h as, whether the c ompany trusted Razali to do c ertain things, the extent of Razali’s responsibility within the c ompany, and the distribution of duties amongst the 

employees, [note: 23] were irrelevant to the present enquiry. These might well have been relevant if it was to prove that Razali had ac tual authority to bind the Plaintiff to the lease. In other words, this would be relevant if Dr Kaushik’s position was that the Plaintiff had legitimately entered into the lease through Razali, and is now, for whatever reason, c hanging its mind. However, whether there was ac tual authority, as noted in the above quote of Diploc k LJ, is irrelevant to the question of ostensible authority. In any event, over the c ourse of the trial, the parties bec ame _ad idem_ that Razali was a fraudster. This being so, any suggestion that Razali had ac tual authority to enter into the lease on behalf of the Plaintiff c annot stand. The pertinent question at hand for the purpose of whether there was ostensible authority, is, whether there was any representation (by c onduc t or otherwise) by the Plaintiff to Dr Kaushik that Razali had authority to enter into the lease on its behalf. 

22     In support of Dr Kaushik’s c ase, Mr Lim relies on two authorities in his submission that there was suc h ostensible authority in the present c ase. First, he c ites the dec ision in _Next of kin of Ramu Vanniyar Ravic handran v Fongsoon Enterprises (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2008] 3 SLR(R) 105</span> (“ _Fongsoon Enterprises_ ”). The Singapore High Court in _Fongsoon Enterprises_ found that Meera, a foreman of a site of a port terminal who was given free rein in the running of operations at the site, had the ostensible authority to engage the servic es of the dec eased on the behalf of respondent who operated the site. In c oming to that c onc lusion, Choo Han Tec k J c ited the above quote from _Freeman Loc kyer_ and explained that (at [20]): 

 ... The respondent, by entrusting Meera with the daily operations and with suc h great autonomy, 


 c an be said to have made a representation to others that Meera had the authority to make dec isions in regard to the running of the respondent's works at the Terminal (inc luding the hire of extra hands to c omplete the works), “by permitting the agent to ac t in some way in the c onduc t of the princ ipal's business with other persons”. 

Sec ond, Mr Lim c ites the High Court of Australia dec ision of _Pac ific Carriers Limited v BNP Paribas_ (2004) 218 CLR 451 (“ _Pac ific Carriers_ ”). The c ourt there found that the defendant bank was liable on two letters of indemnity signed by a bank offic er, who was not ac tually authorised to sign letters of indemnity. The dec ision was made on the basis that the bank offic er had the ostensible authority to do so. The c ourt there observed (at [38]): 

 A kind of representation that often arises in business dealings is one whic h flows from equipping an offic er of a c ompany with a c ertain title, status and fac ilities. ... The holding out might result from permitting a person to ac t in a c ertain manner without taking proper safeguards against misrepresentation. 

23     Was there any representation in the present c ase by the Plaintiff to Dr Kaushik? More importantly, was there a representation to the effec t that Razali was authorised to enter into the lease on behalf of the Plaintiff? As I have stated, the internal workings of Lee Tat Property are irrelevant – Dr Kaushik was never made aware of them until this suit and so they are not representations to Dr Kaushik c apable of supporting the existenc e of ostensible authority. The only reasonable representation by the Plaintiff to Dr Kaushik in the present c ase is the equipping of Razali with the keys and ac c ess c ards to the Property. Mr Lim argued that by doing so, the Plaintiff was representing to the world at large that Razali had the authority to enter into the lease on its behalf. 

24     I do not think suc h an argument suc c eeds in the present c ase. Although in _Fongsoon Enterprises_ and _Pac ific Carriers_ it was held that the c reation by the princ ipal of a c ertain state of affairs in respec t of an agent amounted to a representation that an agent had authority to do c ertain ac ts, thus triggering the operation of the doc trine of ostensible authority, those c ases were dec ided on their fac ts. Whether or not a state of affairs c reated by allowing an agent to ac t in a c ertain way amounts to a representation suffic ient to c reate ostensible authority is a question whic h must be dec ided and determined on the spec ific fac ts of eac h c ase. I am of the view that equipping an agent with the keys to a property does not amount to a representation that the agent has authority to enter into leases on the landlord’s behalf. Landlords in Singapore c ommonly hand property agents the keys to their properties for the purpose of c onduc ting viewings for prospec tive tenants and for other ministerial ac ts. I do not think that in doing so, these agents are therefore c lothed with the ostensible authority to enter into leases with third parties on behalf of the landlords. When all is said and done, a reasonable prospec tive tenant would be satisfied only if the landlord himself gives approval for a lease. Suc h was in fac t the c ase here. Dr Kaushik was not satisfied with Razali or anyone else signing the lease. He spec ific ally insisted that Madam Ching, whom he had identified as the direc tor of the 

true landlord, sign the Tenanc y Agreement. [note: 24] Dr Kaushik c annot now c ontend that the equipping of Razali with the keys and ac c ess c ards to the Property amounts to a representation by the Plaintiff of Razali’s authority to enter into the lease on its behalf, as Dr Kaushik himself did not at the relevant time read suc h a representation to be so. 

_Razali’s ostensible authority to c ommunic ate and represent the Plaintiff’s approval of the lease_ 

2       5 _First Energy_ is a dec ision whic h has drawn muc h c ritic ism and c omment. In partic ular, it is widely suggested that it goes against the established princ iple (illustrated by the House of Lords dec ision in _Armagas Ltd v Mundogas SA_ [1986] AC 717 (“ _Armagas Ltd_ ”)) that the law of agenc y does not rec ognise what may be desc ribed as a “self-authorising” agent. Dr Kaushik relies on _First Energy_ 


for the proposition that even if Razali did not have the ac tual or ostensible authority to enter into the lease on behalf of the Plaintiff, he had the ostensible authority to c onvey and represent the Plaintiff’s approval of the lease, and in doing so bind it. When the Singapore Court of Appeal in _Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branc h v Asia Pac ific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2011] 3 SLR 540</span> examined and c onsidered _First Energy_ , it suggested (at [58]– [59] and [61]) a possible reading of the c ase whic h would not be inc onsistent with what it c onsidered the orthodoxy in _Armagas Ltd_. The Court of Appeal suggested that in _First Energy_ , there was a spec ific finding made by the c ourt that the agent had ostensible authority to make the _spec ific_ representation that his princ ipal has approved a transac tion. Suc h ostensible authority was distinguished from the authority to make _general_ representations about the transac tion. The c ourt rec ognised that the effec t of finding that there was ostensible authority to make the _spec ific_ representation as to a princ ipal’s approval is akin to saying that he has authority to so bind the princ ipal. For that reason, in c onsidering whether the princ iple in _First Energy_ applies here, the question is an extremely spec ific one, _viz_ whether Razali had the ostensible authority to make the _spec ific_ representation as to the Plaintiff’s approval of the lease. 

26     For c hiefly the same reasons why I am of the view that Razali did not have the ostensible authority to enter into the lease on behalf of the Plaintiff (see [24] above), I am also of the view that Razali did not have the ostensible authority to spec ific ally c ommunic ate and represent the Plaintiff’s approval of the lease. This c onc lusion is again fortified by the evidenc e that Dr Kaushik spec ially insisted that Madam Ching sign the Tenanc y Agreement, and that he would not have been satisfied simply bec ause Razali told him the Plaintiff had approved it. Dr Kaushik argues that there was suc h ostensible authority in the present c ase bec ause it would have been “unreal” to have expec ted him to 

have c hec ked direc tly with Madam Ching. [note: 25] Unreal or not, the fac t of the matter is that although Dr Kaushik did not c hec k direc tly with Madam Ching, he did in fac t ask for her signature on the Tenanc y Agreement (notwithstanding that it ended up being forged). In the c irc umstanc es, I do not find that Razali had the ostensible authority to c ommunic ate and represent the Plaintiff’s approval of the lease nor do I find that Dr Kaushik had at that time thought or believed that Razali would have any authority to c ommunic ate and represent the Plaintiff’s approval of the lease. Neither did Dr Kaushik rely on suc h an ostensible authority, even if the state of affairs then existing allowed its c reation. 

_Whether the Plaintiff had ratified the lease_ 

27     In the alternative to the argument that there was a valid lease as a result of Razali’s ostensible authority, Dr Kaushik argues that the Plaintiff by its c onduc t had ratified the unauthorised ac ts of Razali, thus binding the Plaintiff to the lease. The effec t of ratific ation by a princ ipal is to make an ac t of an agent, whic h would otherwise be invalid for want of authority, valid and effec tual as though the original unauthorised ac t was done with authority. Ratific ation has thus been desc ribed as the retrospec tive c lothing of an agent with authority. A princ ipal would therefore be bound by the terms of any suc h transac tion. 

28     In this suit before me, Dr Kaushik seeks to rely on one event to argue that the Plaintiff had ratified the unauthorised ac ts of Razali. He says that in January 2010, the refrigerator in the Property broke down. He then c ontac ted Razali, and told Razali that he would be buying his own refrigerator 

and that Razali should remove the one that had broken down. Razali did so. [note: 26] Thereafter, 

I^2 MS.Net wrote a letter to inform the Plaintiff that the broken down refrigerator had been c ollec ted by Razali and so should be removed from the inventory of items in the Property. This letter, he says, was 

sent by post to the Plaintiff’s registered address and faxed to the Plaintiff’s fax number. [note: 27] Relying on this letter, Dr Kaushik argues that the Plaintiff bec ame aware of his purported tenanc y with 


the Plaintiff. By remaining silent and not ac ting on suc h knowledge, he says, the Plaintiff ac quiesc ed to it, thus ratifying Razali’s ac t of letting out the Property. 

29     At issue at the trial was whether or not I^2 MS.Net had sent the letter, and whether the Plaintiff had rec eived this letter. The Plaintiff disputed that this letter and its fax were rec eived bec ause they c ould not be found in the files kept by the Plaintiff c onc erning the Property. 

30     Even if the Plaintiff did rec eive the said letter and a c opy of it by fax, and then did not ac t on them, that in itself still may not amount to a ratific ation of the unauthorised ac ts of Razali. I do not doubt the proposition that in an appropriate c ase, silenc e or inac tivity c an amount to ratific ation. In fac t this proposition, found in the English High Court dec ision of _Yona International Ltd and Heftsiba Overseas Works Pte Ltd v La Réunion Franç aise Soc iété Anonyme d'Assuranc es et de Réassuranc es_ [1996] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 84 (“ _Yona International_ ”) at 106, was ac c epted by me in _Eng Gee Seng v Quek Choon Tec k and others_ <span class="citation">[2010] 1 SLR 241</span> at [35]. Mr Lim for Dr Kaushik c ites the following passage from _Yona International_ (at 106): 

 Ratific ation c an no doubt be inferred without diffic ulty from silenc e or inac tivity in c ases where the princ ipal, by failing to disown the transac tion, allows a state of affairs to c ome about whic h is inc onsistent with treating the transac tion as unauthorised. 

However, Mr Lim fails to c ite the next few lines in the passage: 

 That is probably no more than a form of ratific ation by c onduc t. Where there is nothing of that kind, however, the position is more diffic ult sinc e silenc e or inac tion may simply reflec t an unwillingness or inability on the part of the princ ipal to c ommit himself. For that reason it will not usually be suffic ient to evidenc e ratific ation ... 

31     In c onsidering whether silenc e or inac tivity c an amount to ratific ation, one must keep in mind the juridic al nature of ratific ation. In essenc e, ratific ation is akin to an assent by the princ ipal to the transac tion entered into by the unauthorised agent by adopting the agent’s otherwise unauthorised ac ts. To this end, the princ ipal’s inac tion must, when interpreted in the c ontext and c irc umstanc es, be of a nature whic h _unequivoc ally_ signifies suc h an assent. Here, even assuming the Plaintiff had rec eived the letter and the fax, its failure to ac t may well be attributable to other reasons, be it c arelessness, oversight, or otherwise. It would appear that Razali was the person put in c harge of handling inventory matters for the properties managed by Lee Tat Property and therefore, that letter and a faxed c opy of it, if rec eived might well have been direc ted to Razali to handle and ac c ordingly, it never c ame to the attention of Madam Ching herself, or for that matter, any other employee. In any c ase, it is not required that I dec ide the reason for suc h inac tion. All that matters is that the silenc e or inac tion in the c ase at hand is silenc e or inac tion that is of an equivoc al nature as to whether there was any assent by the Plaintiff. Ac c ordingly, I do not agree that the Plaintiff c ould be said to have ratified the unauthorised ac ts of Razali and c onsequently bound itself to the terms of the purported lease. 

32     In further support of Dr Kaushik’s c ase, Mr Lim also c ites the English Court of Appeal c ase of _Spiro v Lintern and Others_ [1973] WLR 1002 (“ _Spiro_ ”). In _Spiro_ , the first defendant, Mr Lintern, asked his wife to find a purc haser for his house, but gave her no authority to sell. The wife nevertheless purported to agree to a sale of the house to the c laimant. Mr Lintern knew about this and after meeting the c laimant, he permitted the c laimant to proc eed to get an arc hitec t and a gardener to work on the building and the garden without telling the c laimant that his wife did not have authority to sell. The Court of Appeal held that Mr Lintern c ould not deny that his wife had authority to sell the house. Mr Lim’s relianc e on _Spiro_ demonstrates how the c onc epts of ratific ation and estoppel c an 


very often be c onfused. _Spiro_ does not stand for the proposition that the silenc e of the first defendant amounted to a ratific ation of the unauthorised ac t of his wife. Instead, the dec ision of the Court of Appeal was made on the basis of an estoppel. Mr Lintern, in the c irc umstanc es, by his silenc e and inac tion, was found to have made a representation by c onduc t that his wife had the requisite authority. The c laimant having relied on the representation thereon and suffering a detriment as a result, Mr Lintern was estopped from denying the authority of his wife and the validity of the c ontrac t. 

33     The more pertinent issue in this c ase therefore is whether any estoppel has been raised against the Plaintiff denying the existenc e of a valid lease. I do not think so. Even if the Plaintiff had rec eived the said letter and the fax and thereafter remained silent and did not ac t, suc h that this c ould amount to a representation, I do not think that there was any relianc e thereon by Dr Kaushik. Dr Kaushik was c ontent to c arry on living in the Property, bec ause he was at all times under the impression (albeit wrongly) that he had, from the outset, a valid lease with the Plaintiff. As a result, the Plaintiff’s silenc e and inac tion upon rec eipt of the letter c annot be said to have ever played on Dr Kaushik’s mind at the relevant time. In c ontrast, in _Spiro_ , before the representations by silenc e and inac tion were made by Mr Lintern, the c laimant was labouring under a signific ant amount of doubt as to whether there was or was not a binding c ontrac t for the sale of the house bec ause he had found out that it was Mr Lintern and not Mrs Lintern who owned the house. On those fac ts, Mr Spiro c ould be said to have relied on those representations by silenc e and inac tion by Mr Lintern after the two finally met when he then instruc ted, to his detriment, an arc hitec t and a gardener to do the works. An estoppel was thus raised in _Spiro_ , but none arises here. 

_Whether the Plaintiff is bound by any lease_ 

34     Given all of the above, I find that there was no valid lease between the Plaintiff and Dr Kaushik. As a result, I find that Dr Kaushik has c ommitted the tort of trespass to land in wrongfully oc c upying the Property for the period between 1 Dec ember 2008 and 6 Oc tober 2011. 

**_Whether the defence of contributory negligence applies to the tort of trespass to land_** 

35     Amongst the various defenc es raised by Dr Kaushik against the Plaintiff’s c laim for damages for trespass to land was the defenc e of c ontributory negligenc e as found in s 3(1) of the Contributory Negligenc e and Personal Injuries Ac t (Cap 54, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the CNPIA”). To this end, Dr Kaushik c ontends that the damages in respec t of whic h the Plaintiff is c laiming was c aused wholly or at least largely by its own negligenc e. During the c onduc t of the trial, Mr Lim sought to show that the Plaintiff, Lee Tat Property, and its assoc iated c ompanies were run and managed in an indifferent, lax 

and c areless manner. [note: 28] These inc luded, amongst other things, the failure to keep trac k of or c hec k on properties, the failure to supervise Razali and the lac k of proper c ontrol and supervision by Madam Ching and the management of Lee Tat Property over the properties c ollec tively held by the group bec ause of the large number of properties involved. 

36     Mr Lim suggested that the defenc e of c ontributory negligenc e was applic able to the tort of trespass to land bec ause the tort is an “unintentional” tort. Mr Lim has misrepresented the tort, and has perhaps misapprehended the meaning of “intentional” or “unintentional” when used in respec t of c harac terising torts as suc h. Nevertheless, whether or not the defenc e in s 3(1) of the CNPIA applies to a partic ular tort does not depend on whether or not the tort c an be c harac terised as “intentional” or “unintentional”. Very rec ently, the English Court of Appeal in _Pritc hard v Cooperative Group Ltd_ [2012] QB 320 (“ _Pritc hard_ ”) was asked to determine whether the defenc e in s 1(1) of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligenc e) Ac t 1945 (c 28) (UK) (“the 1945 Ac t”), whic h is _in pari materia_ with our provision, applies to the torts of assault and battery. The Court of Appeal explained ( _per_ Aikens LJ at 


[61]–[62]) that the purpose of the 1945 Ac t was to provide relief to c laimants whose ac tions would have previously failed (bec ause the c ommon law inc arnation of the defenc e was a c omplete defenc e) by allowing the c ourts to apportion damages. Its purpose was not to reduc e damages whic h previously before the enac tment of the statute would have been awarded. Therefore, if the c ommon law defenc e did not apply to a tort pre-1945, the statutory defenc e would also not apply. The Court of Appeal held that bec ause it c ould find no c ase before 1945 whic h applied the defenc e to the intentional torts of assault and battery, the statutory defenc e likewise did not apply. 

37     Whether or not the statutory defenc e of c ontributory negligenc e applies to the tort of trespass depends on whether or not the c ommon law defenc e applied to it before the enac tment of the CNPIA. Although Mr Lim has taken the wrong approac h to determining whether the defenc e applies, he c ites in his submissions the Straits Settlements Supreme Court dec ision of _Brown v Attorney-General_ [1889] KY 4 (“ _Brown_ ”) for the proposition that the defenc e applies to the tort at hand. Unfortunately, Mr Lim’s reading of _Brown_ is mistaken. In fac t, in _Brown_ , Wood J did not apply the defenc e of c ontributory negligenc e, saying: 

 The exac t applic ation however of this princ iple whic h is embodied in the known legal maxim vigilantibus non dormentibus jura subveniunt , I c annot find to have been held to prevail in a c ase quite like the present. 

Wood J instead held in favour of the defendant there on the basis of a finding of fac t that there was no ac t of trespass. Ultimately, whether or not the defenc e applies will be a matter of legal arc haeology. On the basis of the dec ision in _Brown_ , and the fac t that I have not been able to find any other c ase before the enac tment of the CNPIA (or in fac t, the 1945 Ac t) applying the defenc e to the tort of trespass to land, I am of the view that the defenc e is not applic able here. 

38     I would only add that Dr Kaushik’s relianc e on the defenc e of c ontributory negligenc e presupposes that the Plaintiff owes him a duty of c are, whic h I am generally doubtful of, given the many c ommon law pronounc ements that property owners owe no general duty to look after their own property. 

**_Whether the Plaintiff was vicariously liable for Razali’s acts_** 

39     Another limb of Dr Kaushik’s defenc e runs as follows. [note: 29] Razali has c ommitted the tort of dec eit against him. The Plaintiff is vic ariously liable for the tort of Razali. As a result, Dr Kaushik is entitled to raise a set-off against any damages c laimed by the Plaintiff by relying on the damages the Plaintiff is liable to him. 

40     Creative as suc h the argument is, the first obstac le Dr Kaushik fac es is the fac t that Razali was in fac t not an employee of the Plaintiff. Instead, Razali was at all material times an employee of Lee T a t Property. Dr Kaushik ac knowledges this diffic ulty, and therefore goes on to suggest that as between the Plaintiff and Lee Tat Property, the c orporate veil should be lifted, suc h that the Plaintiff 

c an be held liable for Razali’s ac ts. [note: 30] In furtheranc e of his submission that the c orporate veil 

should be lifted, Dr Kaushik c ited the following fac ts. [note: 31] First, the employees of Lee Tat Property, Annie and Collin Tan were sometimes c onfused as to who their employers were – Lee Tat 

Property or the Plaintiff. [note: 32] Sec ond, Razali was at one instanc e wrongly identified by the Plaintiff’s solic itors as an employee of the Plaintiff, even thought he was in fac t an employee of Lee 

Tat Property. [note: 33] Third, during the trial, Collin Tan c ontinued to be c onfused in wrongly referring 

to Lee Tat Property when she meant the Plaintiff and _vic e versa_. [note: 34] Fourth, apart from Lee Tat Property, the rest of the c ompanies in the Lee Tat group owned by Madam Ching only owned 


properties and did not have any employees or their own offic es. Fifth, the other c ompanies all shared the same offic e with Lee Tat Property. Sixth, the administration of all the c ompanies was handled by Lee Tat Property. Seventh, all dec isions for c ompanies in the group were made by Madam Ching alone. She is the direc tor of all the c ompanies in the group, some of whic h are 99% owned by her, others 100%. Last, the Plaintiff’s letterhead bore a logo whic h showed the letters “L-T”, whic h stands for “Lee Tat”. 

41     I am not c onvinc ed that these fac tors are suffic ient for the c ourt to lift the c orporate veil. Dr Kaushik submits that the above fac tors show that the c ompanies were “run as a func tional whole with unity of ownership and/or c ontrol”, suc h that the c orporate veil ought to be lifted. It was surely with spec ific intent that Madam Ching arranged to have different c ompanies hold different properties, and to have them all managed by a different distinc t c ompany. The starting point is that eac h c ompany within what may be c alled a “group” remains a separate distinc t entity. In _Adams and Others v Cape Industries Plc and Another_ [1990] 1 Ch 433 (“ _Adams_ ”) , the English Court of Appeal c onfirmed that it is open for businessmen to struc ture their operations to insulate one part of a business from another (at 544, _per_ Slade LJ): 

 It is not suggested that the arrangements involved any ac tual or potential illegality or were intended to deprive anyone of their existing rights. Whether or not suc h a c ourse deserves moral approval, there was nothing illegal as suc h in Cape arranging its affairs (whether by the use of subsidiaries or otherwise) so as to attrac t the minimum public ity to its involvement in the sale of Cape asbestos in the United States of Americ a. ... [W]e do not ac c ept as a matter of law that the c ourt is entitled to lift the c orporate veil as against a defendant c ompany whic h is the member of a c orporate group merely bec ause the c orporate struc ture has been used so as to ensure that the legal liability (if any) in respec t of partic ular future ac tivities of the group (and c orrespondingly the risk of enforc ement of that liability) will fall on another member of the group rather than the defendant c ompany. Whether or not this is desirable, the right to use a c orporate struc ture in this manner is inherent in our c orporate law. ... 

Slade LJ’s statement was approved by the Singapore Court of Appeal in _The “Andres Bonifac io”_ <span class="citation">[1993] 3 SLR(R) 71</span>. Ac c ordingly, one c ommentator has noted that “the legitimac y of setting up ‘one-ship’ c ompanies in order to minimise the risk of sister-ship ac tions has been repeatedly affirmed in Singapore”: _Walter Woon on Company Law_ (Tan Cheng Han SC gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 3rd Rev Ed, 2009) at para 2.65. 

42     In the present c ase, Madam Ching was as a matter of law, fully entitled to struc ture her c ompanies the way they were and have separate c ompanies hold different properties. This was likely done so as to deal with situations suc h as the present. If Razali was guilty of c ommitting a tort, and his employer Lee Tat Property had to be liable to a c laimant, the intention was that the other c ompanies would be insulated from liability. As c learly set out by Slade LJ in _Adams_ , there is nothing illegal about suc h an arrangement. In the absenc e of c ompelling reasons suc h as the existenc e of fraud or serious abuse of the c orporate form (as was the c ase in _New Line Produc tions, Inc and another v Aglow Video Pte Ltd and others and other suits_ <span class="citation">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 660</span>, c ited by Dr Kaushik in his submissions), the c ourts will be slow to treat c ompanies in the same group as one legal entity merely bec ause it would be c onvenient for a c laimant’s c laim to do so. The Plaintiff is therefore not vic ariously liable for the alleged tort c ommitted by Razali. Dr Kaushik’s argument on this point fails. 

43     If at the c onc lusion of this suit Dr Kaushik finds that he has suffered some loss and suc h loss may be attributable to Lee Tat Property under the doc trine of vic arious liability for the ac ts of Razali, then its proper c ourse is to bring an ac tion against Lee Tat Property. Lee Tat Property is not a party to the present suit, so I will say no more on the issue. 


**_Damages for trespass to land_** 

44     The Plaintiff’s c laim in damages for trespass to land amounts to a sum of $352,704, being what it says is the market rent for the period Dr Kaushik was in oc c upation of the Property. Of c ourse, the Plaintiff has c larified through Mr Balasubramaniam that it will give Dr Kaushik c redit for the $54, already paid to it (see [14] above). The Plaintiff’s c laim is only for the wrongful oc c upation, as it had on the sec ond day of the trial dropped its other c laim for reinstatement for physic al damage to the Property. In any c ase, the Plaintiff unhelpfully says no more than simply asserting the c laim for market rent. The nature of damages for trespass to land must be unpac ked to understand what exac tly it c onstitutes. 

_The juridic al nature of damages for trespass to land_ 

45     The right to sue for damages based on the market rental value of a property wrongfully oc c upied is a princ iple well established in the law, and one whic h has been desc ribed by Nic holls LJ in _Stoke-on-Trent City Counc il v W & J Wass Ltd_ [1988] 3 All ER 394 as the “user princ iple”. In this regard, the English Court of Appeal c ase of _Swordheath Properties Ltd v Tabet and Others_ [1978] 1 WLR 285 is often c ited for the proposition that (at 288): 

 when [the plaintiff ] has established that the defendant has remained on as a trespasser in residential property, [he] is entitled, without bringing evidenc e that he c ould or would have let the property to someone else in the absenc e of the trespassing defendant, to have as damages for the trespass the value of the property as it would fairly be c alc ulated; and, in the absenc e of anything spec ial in the partic ular c ase it would be the ordinary letting value of the property that would determine the amount of damages. ... 

46     The exac t juridic al nature of damages for trespass to land lay largely unartic ulated for a long time. Lord Denning MR planted the seed for the rec ognition of the restitutionary analysis for damages for trespass to land in _Penarth Doc k Engineering Co Ltd v Pounds_ [1963] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 359 when he used (at 362) what may be desc ribed as “restitutionary language” in a c ase involving trespass to the c laimant’s doc k: 

 The Penarth c ompany would not seem to have suffered any damage so to speak of. They have not had to pay any extra rent to the British Transport Commission. The doc k is of no use to them: they would not have made any money out of it. But... in a c ase of this kind... the test of the measure of damages is not what the plaintiffs have lost, but what benefit the defendant has obtained by having the use of the berth. [emphasis added] 

However, it was only later in _Ministry of Defenc e v Ashman_ (1993) 66 P & CR 195 (“ _Ashman_ ”) that Hoffmann LJ dec ided to “c all a spade a spade”, and dec lared that a c laim for _mesne_ profit for trespass to land is a c laim for restitution. In doing so, Hoffmann LJ distinguished the c ompensatory and restitutionary bases of damages for trespass to land (at 200–201): 

 A person entitled to possession of land c an make a c laim against a person who has been in oc c upation without his c onsent on two alternative bases. The first is for the loss whic h he has suffered in c onsequenc e of the defendant’s trespass. This is the normal measure of damages in the law of tort. The sec ond is the value of the benefit whic h the oc c upier has rec eived. This is a c laim for restitution. The two bases of c laim are mutually exc lusive and the plaintiff must elec t before judgment whic h of them he wishes to pursue. [emphasis added] 

Admittedly, the judic ial opinion on the issue is not unanimous. In _Ashman_ itself, Lloyd LJ disagreed, 


taking the view that the c laim was simply c ompensatory. The defendant in _Ashman_ was a wife of a Royal Air Forc e offic er who had oc c upied the c laimant’s premises. Her husband subsequently moved out, leaving her and the c hildren. She refused to move out of the property, instead holding over. The c laimant thus c laimed damages for trespass to land. The issue whic h fell for the Court of Appeal to dec ide was whether these damages should be assessed by referenc e to the market rent for suc h premises, or by the subsidised rent whic h a servic eman would ac tually pay for the premises, or by some other measure. In taking the view that the damages are restitutionary in nature, Hoffmann LJ held that it was the market rent that was rec overable. In taking the view that the damages were c ompensatory, Lloyd LJ held that it was the subsidised rent that the c laimant c ould rec over. However, in _Inverugie Investments Ltd v Hac kett_ [1995] 1 WLR 713 (“ _Inverugie_ ”), an appeal from the Commonwealth of the Bahamas heard by the Judic ial Committee of the Privy Counc il, Lord Lloyd of Berwic k (having been elevated to the position of Lord of Appeal in Ordinary sinc e the dec ision in _Ashman_ ), dec lared (at 718) that the c laim for _mesne_ profits “need not be c harac terised as exc lusively c ompensatory, or exc lusively restitutionary; it c ombines elements of both”. 

47     The Singapore High Court in _Yenty Lily (trading as Ac c ess International Servic es) v ACES System Development Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2013] 1 SLR 577</span> (“ _Yenty Lily_ ”) rec ently took the opportunity to explore the juridic al basis of the user princ iple in the c ontext of damages for the wrongful detention of goods. After c onsidering a number of authorities on the issue, Judith Prakash J appears to have ac c epted (at [66]–[69]) the c onc lusion in _Inverugie_ that the user princ iple c omprised of _both_ c ompensatory and restitutionary elements. Prakash J’s retic enc e in adopting a pure restitutionary approac h appears (at [66]) to be bec ause it is thought that by adopting suc h an analysis, a defendant may argue that where he has not made any disc ernible use of the detained or misappropriated property, he had not derived any benefit and therefore c annot be made to pay the plaintiff the market rent as damages. Prakash J thus preferred to c harac terise the user princ iple as being a mix of both c ompensation and restitution. Ac c ordingly, she held that the rec ognition that the user princ iple may also c ontain elements of restitution does not lead to the c onc lusion that a plaintiff c annot rec over in a situation where the defendant has not made any disc ernible use of the plaintiff’s detained or misappropriated property unless ac tual damage is proved. What is important, Prakash J opined, may be the fac t that, by the detention or misappropriation, the defendant gains the opportunity to use the property c onc erned whilst simultaneously depriving the owner of suc h opportunity suc h that the defendant’s failure to exploit suc h opportunity is irrelevant. 

48     In _Inverugie_ , the defendant had wrongly ejec ted the c laimant from a hotel c omplex and exc luded them from it for a period of 15 years. Over this period, the oc c upanc y of the hotel was only about 35 to 40 perc ent. Fac ing a c laim for trespass to land, the defendant c onc eded that it was liable to pay the c laimant reasonable rent. The sole question for the Privy Counc il was how this should be assessed. The Privy Counc il held that the defendant had to pay the c laimant damages to be assessed by referenc e to the reasonable rent of all the apartments, and not with referenc e to only the 35 to 40 perc ent rate of oc c upanc y. As noted by Professor Graham Virgo (“Professor Virgo”) in Graham Virgo _, The Princ iples of the Law of Restitution_ (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2006) at p 468, the objec tion to c alling the result reac hed in _Inverugie_ as c onsistent with a restitutionary analysis is that the defendant was required to pay rent for the entire period despite the finding that it had not derived a benefit from the apartments all of the time. This appears to be the very same objec tion held by Prakash J in her analysis in _Yenty Lily_. However, as Professor Virgo goes on to explain in his text, the defendant’s use of the hotel c omplex throughout the period should be regarded as it having obtained an “objec tive benefit”, that is, the opportunity to obtain inc ome from the apartments. Whether or not in fac t the hotel was fully oc c upied is a matter whic h raises questions of subjec tive devaluation (the c onc ept of whic h is explained below at [54]–[56]), whic h, on the fac ts of that c ase, did not apply. Likewise, in an ac tion for wrongful detention of property, even if a defendant has not made any disc ernible use of the detained or misappropriated property, he has 


obtained an objec tive benefit, thus entitling the plaintiff to rec over damages measured by the market rent. Similar to the c ase in _Inverugie_ , it is arguable that the defendant in _Yenty Lily_ should not be permitted to subjec tively devalue the benefit rec eived (on the basis of the failure to make disc ernible use of the goods). When the plaintiff sought to c laim ownership over the detained goods, the defendant’s response was to deny the same and to refuse to return them. By refusing to return the property, the defendant must be taken to have freely ac c epted that benefit and is therefore not entitled to subjec tively devalue that benefit by saying that it had not made disc ernible use of the detained property. Seen from this perspec tive, a purely restitutionary analysis may not be c ontrary to the user princ iple. 

49     Why should a distinc tion be made between an award for c ompensation and an award for restitution in c laims suc h as the present? Different princ iples and different possibilities will flow from t h e different c harac terisations in different c ases. The distinc tion is not purely theoretic al. As Professor James Edelman (who has sinc e been appointed to the benc h of the Supreme Court of Western Australia) explained in James Edelman, _Gain-based Damages_ (Hart Publishing, 2002) (“ _Edelman_ ”) at p 66: 

 In c ases [of wrongs] where the wrongful transfer involves money, the transfer of value might sometimes be equivalent to the loss suffered. But the restitutionary damages award is not c onc erned with financ ial loss and opens other possibilities whic h will be seen below suc h as subjec tive devaluation of the award. Thus, even in c ases where the quantum of c ompensatory and restitutionary damages might be the same, it has been rec ognised that it is important to keep the two awards distinc t. [emphasis added] 

50     I do not see any reason why we ought not to rec ognise that where a distinc tion c an be made between a c ompensation-based c laim and a restitution-based c laim, a c laim for _mesne_ profit, market rent, under the “user princ iple”, or however one may c hoose to c all the c laim, is a c laim for a restitutionary remedy. 

_Is the Plaintiff’s c laim for c ompensation or restitution?_ 

51     Although the Plaintiff repeatedly asserts, and is not wrong, that a c laimant in an ac tion for trespass to land is entitled to market rent during the period of wrongful oc c upation by the defendant, as envisaged by the above statement in _Edelman_ (see [49] above), it is also nec essary in the present c ase to c onsider whether the present c laim is for c ompensatory damages or restitutionary damages. 

52     The evidenc e at trial showed that during the period of Dr Kaushik’s wrongful oc c upation of the Property, the Plaintiff was unable and unwilling to lease the Property to anyone else. The evidenc e was that the Plaintiff (and its c ontrolling mind Madam Ching) was unwilling to let the Property out for anything less than $10,000 bec ause it was “selec tive” of its tenants, and during the period of Dr Kaushik’s wrongful oc c upation, the Plaintiff did not rec eive a single offer satisfying the $10, 

minimum. [note: 35] Put simply, the Plaintiff was at all material times very happy to leave the Property unoc c upied. There was no indic ation that bec ause of Dr Kaushik’s oc c upation of the Property, the Plaintiff was prevented from letting the Property to another tenant and as a result had to forego rent it would otherwise have c ollec ted. Of c ourse, if this was the c ase, the Plaintiff would have to elec t between the c ompensatory measure and the restitutionary measure (suc h elec tion would likely be influenc ed by whic h is higher). Likewise, the Plaintiff’s c laim for reinstatement damages, whic h has sinc e been dropped, would have been a c laim for c ompensatory damages. If the Plaintiff had had to pay extra taxes bec ause of Dr Kaushik’s oc c upation, that would have been a c laim for c ompensation as well. I would only note that in these latter two examples, bec ause the c ompensatory c laim is not inc ompatible with the restitutionary c laim, the Plaintiff would not need to elec t and will be entitled to 


rec over both. However, in the c irc umstanc es, I would not c harac terise the Plaintiff’s present c laim of $352,704 as a c laim for c ompensatory damages; it is c learly c laiming restitutionary damages in the form of the gain Dr Kaushik enjoyed in oc c upying the Property. 

_The Plaintiff’s restitutionary c laim and the damages it is entitled_ 

53     Having c harac terised the Plaintiff’s c laim for damages for trespass to land as a c laim for a restitutionary remedy, what are the damages it is entitled? The measure of damages is the benefit enjoyed by Dr Kaushik as a result of the wrongful oc c upation of the Property. In its pleadings, the 

Plaintiff asserts that it is entitled to a sum of $352,704. [note: 36] This, it c laims, represents the market rent of the Property for the duration of Dr Kaushik’s oc c upation. It c laims that this sum is arrived at by multiplying the strata area of the Property by the rate of $4.07 per square foot, this figure being “as per URA data during the last quarter of 2008”. Aside from this bare assertion, the Plaintiff adduc ed no further evidenc e in support of its c ontention that the sum it was c laiming represented the market rent. I therefore find that the Plaintiff has not shown on a balanc e of probabilities that the market rent for the period of the wrongful oc c upation amounted to $352,704. 

However, given that Dr Kaushik was happy to have paid or to have c aused I^2 MS.Net to pay the sum of $9,000 every month to Razali as rent for the Property, I am satisfied that at the very least, the amount of $9,000 c an be taken to be the market rent of the Property during the period of the 

wrongful oc c upation. Mr Lim does not deny this in the submissions for Dr Kaushik. [note: 37] Ac c ordingly, I would ac c ept that the market rent of the Property for the relevant period of 34 months and 5 days (from 1 Dec ember 2008 to 6 Oc tober 2011) would be $307,451.61 and not $352,704 as c laimed by the Plaintiff. 

_Can Dr Kaushik “subjec tively devalue” the benefit he derived?_ 

54     As I have alluded to above, the c harac terisation of the present c laim for trespass to land as restitutionary leads to different possibilities flowing. 

55     Dr Kaushik submits that he is entitled to “subjec tively devalue” the benefit he derived from the wrongful oc c upation of the property. The phrase “subjec tive devaluation” was first used by Professor Peter Birks, and he explains the c onc ept in Peter Birks, _An Introduc tion to the Law of Restitution_ (Clarendon Press, 1985) at p 109 as suc h: 

 The c ritic al distinc tion is between money and benefits in kind. Where the defendant rec eived money, it will be impossible on all ordinary fac ts for him to argue that he was not enric hed. For money is the very measure of enric hment. By c ontrast benefits in kind are less unequivoc ally enric hing bec ause they are susc eptible to an argument whic h for c onvenienc e c an be c alled ‘subjec tive devaluation’. It is an argument based on the presmiss [ sic ] that benefits in kind have a value to a partic ular individual only so far as he c hooses to give them value. What matters is his c hoic e. The fac t that there is a market in the good whic h is in question, or in other words that other people habitually c hoose to have it and thus c reate a demand for it, is irrelevant to the c ase of any one partic ular individual. He c laims the right to dissent from that demand. Market value is not his value. Suppose that without his knowledge his c ar has been servic ed or his roof mended. There is a market in c ar servic ing and roof mending. It is easy to find the market value of work of that kind, what the going rate is between reasonable people. But he says that he had dec ided to go in for do-it-yourself or to take the risk of disaster by doing nothing. Indeed to make his point he does not even have to say that he had ac tually dec ided, let alone prove that he had dec ided, to dissoc iate himself from the partic ular demand. For his point is suffic iently made by saying that he has a c ontinuing liberty to c hoose how to apply his partic ular store of 


 value and that in the c ase of this c ar-servic ing or roof-mending he simply had not made his c hoic e. 

More rec ently, the c onc ept was put in the following simple terms by Lord Nic holls of Birkenhead in the House of Lords in the c ase of _Sempra Metals Ltd (formerly Metallgesellsc haft Ltd) v Inland Revenue Commissioners and another_ [2008] 1 AC 561 at [119]: 

 Here, as elsewhere, the law of restitution is suffic iently flexible to ac hieve a just result. To avoid what would otherwise be an unjust outc ome the c ourt c an, in an appropriate c ase, depart from the market value approac h when assessing the time value of money or, indeed, when assessing the value of any other benefit gained by a defendant. What is ultimately important in restitution is whether, and to what extent, the partic ular defendant has been benefited: see Burrows, The Law of Restitution , 2nd ed (2002), p 18. A benefit is not always worth its market value to a partic ular defendant. When it is not it may be unjust to treat the defendant as having rec eived a benefit possessing the value it has to others. In Professor Birks’s language, a benefit rec eived by a defendant may sometimes be subjec t to “subjec tive devaluation”: An Introduc tion to the Law of Restitution (1985), p 413. An applic ation of this approac h is to be found in the Court of Appeal dec ision in Ministry of Defenc e v Ashman [1993] 2 EGLR 102. ... [emphasis added] 

56     The c onc ept of subjec tive devaluation was applied by Hoffmann LJ in _Ashman_. There, after finding that the c laimant was ordinarily entitled to the market rent and not merely the subsidised rent (see above at [46]), Hoffmann LJ went on to hold (at 201) that the defendant c ould subjec tively devalue the benefit derived bec ause the benefit was in fac t “worth less to [the partic ular] defendant”. Hoffmann LJ found two c irc umstanc es whic h justified suc h a c onc lusion. First, the defendant and her erstwhile husband had been oc c upying the premises at the subsidised rate. Sec ondly, the defendant had no c hoic e but to stay in the premises until the loc al authority c ould rehouse her. These fac tors led Hoffmann LJ to c onc lude that the benefit derived by the defendant was only worth the subsidised rate to her. 

57     On the basis of the above, Dr Kaushik thus c ontends that by reason of him (or rather, his 

c ompany I^2 MS.Net) having paid the full rent of $9,000 to Razali, he is entitled to rely on the c onc ept 

of subjec tive devaluation, and should be taken as valuing the benefit he rec eived as nil. [note: 38] I do not think that Mr Lim fully grasps the c onc ept. Quite the c ontrary to his submission, the fac t that Dr 

Kaushik had paid (or c aused his c ompany I^2 MS.Net to pay) the sum of $9,000 every month to Razali does not show that he valued the benefit any less. What it in fac t does show, is that he _did_ value the benefit at $9,000, bec ause if that was not so, he would not have been so willing to part with that sum. 

**_The change of position defence_** 

_The applic ability of the c hange of position defenc e to a c laim in trespass to land for restitutionary damages_ 

58     Another c orollary flowing from the c harac terisation of the present c laim as restitutionary in nature is the applic ability of c ertain defenc es. Spec ific ally, the fac ts of the present c ase raise the possibility of the defenc e known as “c hange of position” being applic able. The defenc e was formally rec ognised in the English c ommon law in the speec h of Lord Goff of Chieveley in the seminal House of Lords dec ision in _Lipkin Gorman (a firm) v Karpnale Ltd_ [1991] 2 AC 548 (“ _Lipkin Gorman_ ”) at 579E–F: 

 ... where an innoc ent defendant’s position is so c hanged that he will suffer an injustic e if c alled 


 upon to repay or to repay in full, the injustic e of requiring him so to repay outweighs the injustic e of denying the plaintiff restitution. If the plaintiff pays money to the defendant under a mistake of fac t, and the defendant then, ac ting in good faith, pays the money or part of it to c harity, it is unjust to require the defendant to make restitution to the extent that he has so c hanged his position. ... 

The defenc e was ac c epted in Singapore in the c ase of _Seagate Tec hnology Pte Ltd and another v Goh Han Kim_ <span class="citation">[1994] 3 SLR(R) 836</span> (“ _Seagate Tec hnology_ ”) and then c onfirmed in _MCST Plan No 473 v De Beers Jewellery Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 418</span> (“ _De Beers_ ”) at [35] as requiring that: (a) the person enric hed had c hanged his position; (b) the c hange was _bona fide_ ; and (c ) it would be inequitable to require the person enric hed to make restitution or to make restitution in full. 

59     I would note that all of the c ases c ited above are c ases where the c laim was founded on unjust enric hment. In the realm of restitution for an unjust enric hment, one c an today c onfidently say that the c hange of position defenc e has been established as being a c entral and important defenc e. In the present c ase however, the c laim is not a c laim founded on unjust enric hment, but is a c laim for trespass to land in whic h restitutionary damages are sought, _ie_ a c ase of restitution for a c ivil wrong. This objec tion was raised by the Plaintiff in its submissions when it attempted to distinguish _Seagate Tec hnology_ by pointing out that the c ause of ac tion there was one for money had and rec eived. [note: 39] Whether the defenc e of c hange of position applies to a c laim in restitution for a c ivil wrong 

is an issue whic h has yet to be thoroughly c onsidered by judic ial opinion. 

60     Objec tion to the applic ation of the c hange of position defenc e to restitution for wrongs often begins with referenc e to a statement by Lord Goff in _Lipkin Gorman_ (at 580C) that “it is c ommonly ac c epted that the defenc e should not be open to a wrongdoer”. From this pithy line spawned the view that the defenc e is not available to c laims for restitution for wrongs, bec ause in suc h a c ase the defendant is nec essarily a “wrongdoer”. Judic ial opinion on the question of whether the defenc e applies to restitution for wrongs is sparse. _Obiter dic ta_ by Lord Nic holls of Birkenhead in _Kuwait Airways Corpn v Iraqi Airways Co (Nos 4 and 5)_ [2002] 2 AC 883 at [79] suggests that the defenc e is applic able to restitution for the tort of c onversion, although the pronounc ement is far from definitive. 

61     Neither is there any unanimity in the ac ademic writings on the issue. On the one hand, the weight of the ac ademic opinion is that there should not be a blanket rule barring the applic ation of the c hange of position defenc e to c ases of restitution for wrongs. Professor Andrew Burrows (“Professor Burrows”) in Andrew Burrows, _T he Law of Restitution_ (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 

2011) (“ _Burrows_ ”) at p 699 suggests that this is so, and lists the leading writers of the 7thedition of _Goff and Jones on The Law of Restitution_ , and others suc h as Professors Ric hard Nolan, Virgo and Andrew Tettenborn as holding the view that the defenc e applies to c ases of restitution for wrongs. In essenc e, the ac ademic opinion on this view starts from the premise that there are wrongs and then there are wrongs; not all wrongs are of the same quality. Where, therefore, the wrong was c ommitted innoc ently, they do not see any objec tion to the applic ation of the defenc e. The statement by Lord Goff was likely intended at wrongdoers who display a c ertain degree of moral turpitude and therefore are undeserving of the defenc e, although in suc h a c ase the defenc e would not be available in any c ase bec ause suc h a defendant c annot be said to have behaved in good faith. As Professor Andrew Tettenborn explains in Andrew Tettenborn, _The Law of Restitution in England and Ireland_ (Cavendish Publishing Limited, 2002) at p 278: 

 With respec t, [Lord Goff's statement] is a little diffic ult to understand; and indeed, whether suc h a blanket exc eption is either nec essary or desirable is rather doubtful. It is no doubt aimed at suc h unsympathetic c harac ters as the thief, or the agent who takes a bribe, who later tries to avoid disgorging his ill-gotten gains by saying he has spent them. But suc h people are unlikely to 


 be able to invoke the princ iple anyway, sinc e however muc h they may have c hanged their position, they c an hardly c laim to have done so in good faith. It is hard to see why he should not have the benefit of the defenc e if the c laimant c hooses to waive the tort and sue for money had and rec eived. [emphasis added] 

62     On the other hand, Professor Burrows himself disagrees, and holds the view that the defenc e should not apply to restitution for wrongs (see _Burrows_ at p 699–700). Professor Burrows takes the view that the defenc e of c hange of position is c onc erned with ensuring sec urity for rec eipt. He thus says that this is a c onsideration relevant to a c laim for unjust enric hment, whic h is a c laim for the reversal of a transfer of value. In c ontrast, bec ause in the c ase of a wrong the purpose of the law’s response is to “remedy” it, the c hange of position defenc e c annot operate to c ounter the response as the rationale for the defenc e c annot outweigh the polic ies justifying restitution for a wrong. 

63     I do not think that Professor Burrows’ stric t position is entirely justified. The law should not be so inflexible as to c ompletely exc lude the defenc e. It may be true that there may be c ertain kinds of wrongs whic h are of suc h a nature that the defenc e ought not to apply even to innoc ent wrongdoers. In suc h a c ase, the rationale of the defenc e simply c annot outweigh the polic y for remedying the wrong. However, this may not nec essarily be so for all kinds of wrongs. Professor Elise Bant (“Professor Bant”) adopts suc h a view whic h c an be desc ribed as more nuanc ed. In Elise Bant, _The Change of Position Defenc e_ (Hart Publishing, 2009) at p 171, she starts by saying: 

 We have seen in c ases of defendant-instigated c hanges of position, the c hange of position defenc e operates to protec t a defendant from a c laim in restitution where he has irreversibly c hanged his position in relianc e of his rec eipt. It prevents the defendant from being put in a worse (inc luding entirely different) position than he oc c upied prior to his rec eipt. In this way, the defenc e supports and reflec ts the restric ted aims of restitution. Restitution does not aim to impose loss on a defendant, to punish him or to require him to disgorge profits. Its aim is limited to reversing transfers of value so as to restore the parties to the status quo ante. In that c ontext, the defenc e operates to ensure that, in c irc umstanc es where a defendant’s position has irreversibly c hanged, restitution does not operate c ontrary to its underlying purpose. 

Then, applying the nuanc e Professor Burrows appears to have missed, she says: 

 Seen in this light, and subjec t to any overriding polic y c onsiderations , there is no reason why the defenc e should not apply to c laims for restitution arising from a stric t liability wrong or, for that matter, a c laim for restitution made to vindic ate a c laimant’s c ontinuing proprietary interest in a benefit transferred to a defendant. [emphasis added in italic s] 

What then are these polic y c onsiderations and when do they override? As examples, Professor Bant suggests two areas of law (at 210): 

 For example, as we saw earlier, allowing the c hange of position defenc e in c ases where the c laimant’s ac tion is based on their vested proprietary right to the benefit (suc h as c laims of c onversion, or c laims to vindic ate a pre-existing property right) may be regarded as undermining the law’s traditional protec tion of proprietary rights. Likewise, the overriding need to deter breac hes of fiduc iary duty may prec lude the applic ation of the defenc e, even where the breac hing fiduc iary ac ted with the best of intentions and ignorant of their breac h. 

She c onc ludes ac c ordingly: 

 In the absenc e of c lear evidenc e of a shift in judic ial attitude to the balanc e of polic y interests in 


 these c ases, it would be premature to say that the c hange of position defenc e should apply to these kinds of c laims. This c onc lusion does not mean that the defenc e c an never apply in respec t of c laims for restitution for wrongs, merely that eac h c ategory of wrong must be individually examined to determine whether permitting the defenc e would undermine or stultify the law’s prohibition. [emphasis added] 

64     I agree. I do not take the view that there should be a blanket ban on the defenc e of c hange of position applying to all c ases of restitution for wrongs. Where the wrong involves some moral turpitude, the defenc e would ordinarily not apply in any c ase bec ause suc h a defendant c annot be said to have ac ted in good faith. Where there is no moral turpitude, but the wrong involved is one whic h the law has presc ribed the remedy for a partic ular polic y reason, then the defenc e also ought not to apply, but this is a question to be determined when eac h partic ular c ase arises to be dec ided. 

65     In the present c ase, I do not see why the defenc e should not apply to a restitutionary c laim for trespass to land. If the c ase is one where the defendant displayed some moral turpitude, suc h as if he c ommitted the wrongful oc c upation with knowledge of and blatant disregard for the rights of the proprietor of the land, the defenc e would ordinarily fail for want of good faith. However, I do not think that there is any overriding polic y rationale requiring the remedying of the wrong of trespass to land with the award of restitutionary damages that would be stultified by the applic ation of the defenc e of c hange of position to it. I am therefore of the view that the defenc e of c hange of position is applic able to a c laim in trespass to land where the damages sought are of a restitutionary nature. 

_Does the defenc e of c hange of position apply in the present c ase?_ 

66     It is not disputed between the parties that during the period of Dec ember 2008 to Marc h 2011, 

I^2 MS.Net paid a monthly sum of $9,000 to Razali. This sum amounted to a total of $252,000 being 

what it thought was rent for 28 months. In addition to this, I^2 MS.Net paid to Razali a sum of $18, being what it thought c onstituted sec urity deposit of 2 months’ rent. From Dr Kaushik’s point of view, 

he was entitled to have his employer I^2 MS.Net pay for the lease of his ac c ommodation in Singapore, suc h entitlement being his right under his employment c ontrac t. Does, therefore, the fac t of the payment of these sums amount to a c hange of position by Dr Kaushik suc h as to disentitle the Plaintiff to the restitutionary damages it is trying to c laim in respec t of the wrongful oc c upation? For c onvenienc e, the elements of the defenc e as set out in _De Beers_ are set out as follows: 

 (a) the person enric hed had c hanged his position; 

 (b) the c hange was bona fide ; and 

 (c ) it would be inequitable to require the person enric hed to make restitution or to make restitution in full. 

67     Needless to say, there is a requirement of a c ausative link between the rec eipt of the gain (or benefit in kind) in question and the c hange of position. In _Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branc h v Asia Pac ific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and another suit_ <span class="citation">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 788</span> at [329] (upheld on appeal to the Court of Appeal), Belinda Ang J held that the c ausative test is a “but for” test: the defendant needs to satisfy the c ourt that but for the rec eipt of the benefit, it would not have c hanged its position. I am satisfied that the c ausative test is met in this c ase. The evidenc e is c lear that resulting from the rec eipt of the benefit in question, that is, the 

benefit of living in the Property, Dr Kaushik direc ted his employer I^2 MS.Net to pay a sum of $9,000 to Razali eac h month. Paraphrased, while Dr Kaushik had benefitted from his oc c upation of the Property, 


his position c hanged when his entitlement to having his ac c ommodation paid for by I^2 MS.Net was 

exhausted. By direc ting I^2 MS.Net to pay the $9,000 monthly rent, albeit to the fraudster Razali, Dr Kaushik c an be said to be exhausting his right under his employment c ontrac t. If not for the fac t that he had enjoyed the benefit of living in the Property, he would not have so direc ted the c ompany. The c ausative test is therefore plainly satisfied. In respec t of the Plaintiff’s c laim for damages for trespass to land for Dr Kaushik’s wrongful oc c upation of the Property for the period of Dec ember 2008 to Marc h 2011, I find that Dr Kaushik had c hanged his position by c ausing his c ompany to pay the sum of $9,000 monthly to Razali. 

68     The Plaintiff denies that Dr Kaushik in c hanging his position had done so in good faith. The Plaintiff pointed me to the _Seagate Tec hnology_ , where the Court of Appeal (at [32]–[34]), in c onsidering the meaning of good faith in the c ontext of the present defenc e, first ac c epted that knowledge of the fac ts entitling the plaintiff to restitution would bring the defendant’s _bona fides_ into question, thus disentitling him from relying on the defenc e. Then, the Court of Appeal drew referenc e from the different degrees of knowledge a defendant may have, and adopted Millett J’s analysis in _Agip (Afric a) Ltd v Jac kson_ [1990] Ch 265 (“ _Agip (Afric a)_ ”), a c ase on ac c essory liability for breac h of trust, that “the true distinc tion is between honesty and dishonesty”. I agree that dishonesty would be a state of mind whic h would disqualify a defendant from relying on the c hange of position defenc e. 

69     However, the meaning of “dishonesty” in the law of ac c essory liability for breac h of trust, or what is now known as dishonest assistanc e, was a matter of some c ontroversy and turbulenc e for some time. Following _Agip (Afric a)_ , the Judic ial Committee of the Privy Counc il dec ided _Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan_ [1995] 2 AC 378 in whic h the meaning of dishonesty was explored. Subsequently, in _Twinsec tra Ltd v Yardley and Others_ [2002] 2 AC 164 (“ _Twinsec tra_ ”), the meaning of dishonesty was thrown into further c onfusion, when Lord Hutton held (at 172) that test for dishonesty was a “c ombined test” whic h has both an objec tive and a subjec tive element, “and whic h requires that before there c an be a finding of dishonesty it must be established that the defendant’s c onduc t was _dishonest by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people_ and that _he himself realised that by those standards his c onduc t was dishonest_ ” [emphasis added]. Today, the authority for what c onstitutes bad faith for the purposes of the c hange of position defenc e is widely c onsidered to be found in the first instanc e judgment of MooreBic k J in _Niru Battery Manufac turing Co v Milestone Trading Ltd (No 1)_ [2002] 2 All ER (Comm) 705 (“ _Niru Battery_ ”) (upheld on appeal to the Court of Appeal in _Niru Battery Manufac turing Co v Milestone Trading Ltd_ [2004] 2 WLR 1415). In _Niru Battery_ , the c laimants, Bank Sepah Iran and its c ustomer Niru Battery paid the defendant bank Credit Agric ole Indosuez US$5.8m under a doc umentary c redit where a false bill of lading had been presented. MooreBic k J found that the defendant bank’s manager, one Mr Franc is, must have at least had strong suspic ion that the there was a mistake in the money being paid to it. Nevertheless, Mr Franc is paid the money away without making any further enquiries. The question thus arose whether the defendant bank had paid the money away in good faith for the purposes of the c hange of position defenc e. Counsel for the defendant bank in _Niru Battery_ argued that a lac k of good faith meant the same as dishonesty, and so the _Twinsec tra_ test should apply. In other words, the defendant should be entitled to the defenc e unless he has ac ted in a way whic h _he knows_ ordinary people would regard as dishonest, _ie_ c omprising a subjec tive element. Given the subjec tive element in the test of dishonesty in _Twinsec tra_ , MooreBic k J held that a lac k of good faith for the purposes of the c hange of position defenc e must enc ompass more than dishonesty in the _Twinsec tra_ sense, and explained (at [135]): 

 In the light of these observations, and having regard to the nature of the princ iples underlying the right to restitution in the c ase of a mistaken payment and the defenc e of c hange of position, I do not think that dishonesty in the sense identified in Twinsec tra Ltd v Yardley is the sole c riterion of the right to invoke the defenc e of c hange of position. I do not think that it is 


 desirable to attempt to define the limits of good faith; it is a broad c onc ept, the definition of whic h, insofar as it is c apable of definition at all, will have to be worked out through the c ases. In my view it is c apable of embrac ing a failure to ac t in a c ommerc ially ac c eptable way and sharp prac tic e of a kind that falls short of outright dishonesty as well as dishonesty itself. ... Where he knows that the payment he has rec eived was made by mistake, the position is quite straightforward: he must return it. ... Greater diffic ulty may arise, however, in c ases where the payee has grounds for believing that the payment may have been made by mistake, but c annot be sure. In suc h c ases good faith may well dic tate that an enquiry be made of the payer. The nature and extent of the enquiry c alled for will, of c ourse, depend on the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, but I do not think that a person who has, or thinks he has, good reason to believe that the payment was made by mistake will often be found to have ac ted in good faith if he pays the money away without first making enquiries of the person from whom he rec eived it. [emphasis added] 

70     Sinc e the dec isions in _Twinsec tra_ and _Niru Battery_ , the meaning of dishonesty in the c ontext of liability for dishonest assistanc e has been c larified by the Judic ial Committee of the Privy Counc il in _Barlow Clowes International Ltd (in liquidation) v Eurotrust International Ltd_ [2006] 1 All ER 333 (“ _Barlow Clowes_ ”). In partic ular, Lord Hoffmann made c lear that the test was an objec tive one, and one whic h does not require the defendant to have “reflec tions about what [the] normally ac c eptable standards were”. This largely objec tive test has been ac c epted by the Singapore Court of Appeal in _George Raymond Zage III and another v Ho Chi Kwong and another_ <span class="citation">[2010] 2 SLR 589</span> (“ _George Raymond Zage III_ ”) at [22], and the test for dishonesty is simply that “for a defendant to be liable for knowing assistanc e, he must have suc h knowledge of the irregular shortc omings of the transac tion that ordinary honest people would c onsider it to be a breac h of standards of honest c onduc t if he failed to adequately query them”. 

71     In light of the c larific ation in _Barlow Clowes_ , I am of the view that the meaning of lac k of good faith as eluc idated by MooreBic k J in _Nir u Battery_ is in fac t not inc onsistent with the meaning of dishonesty for the purposes of liability for dishonest assistanc e for breac h of trust. For that reason, I will adopt the _Barlow Clowes_ definition of dishonesty (as ac c epted in _George Raymond Zage III_ ) for the test of good faith for the c hange of position defenc e. A defendant will be held to have had a lac k of good faith if he ac ts in a c ommerc ially unac c eptable way, and suc h behaviour is made out if he fails to query the irregular shortc omings of the transac tion that ordinary honest people would so query. 

72     The Plaintiff suggests that Dr Kaushik in c ausing his c ompany to pay the moneys to Razali had not ac ted in good faith mainly, bec ause, it says, being a “streetwise and experienc ed c orporate professional”, he ought to have done more c hec ks into who Razali really was. I do not ac c ept that Dr Kaushik’s c onduc t in the present c ase amounted to bad faith so as to disentitle him from relying on the defenc e. In the present c ase, it was far from patently obvious that Razali was a fraudster, therefore, Dr Kaushik’s failure to do further c hec ks whic h perhaps would have revealed Razali’s fraud c annot be said to fall short of the standards of ordinary honest people. In fac t, Dr Kaushik c ould be said to have met the standards of honest and reasonable men when he performed searc hes on the Property and insisted that the Tenanc y Agreement be signed by Madam Ching herself, notwithstanding that it turned out that Razali forged the signature. Although it is possible to verify the signature by requesting for and c hec king against doc uments filed with the Ac c ounting & Corporate Regulatory Authority where direc tors’ signatures would appear, I do not think that that the law expec ts an honest and reasonable individual c onsumer suc h as Dr Kaushik to undertake suc h an extensive inquiry. Dr Kaushik had also requested a letter of authorisation from the landlord from Razali before agreeing to pay the monthly rent to him. Dr Kaushik honestly believed that he had obtained a valid lease from the Plaintiff. With hindsight, Dr Kaushik perhaps should have visited the Plaintiff at its 


registered offic e and verified the letter of authorisation or he should have c alled up the Plaintiff’s offic e number to c hec k with another person, who is not Razali, as to whether the lease was a valid lease granted by the Plaintiff. At its highest, all that Dr Kaushik’s c onduc t c an be desc ribed as is a suggestion that he was negligent. Negligent or c areless c onduc t does not amount to dishonesty, even applying an objec tive test. I do not think that Dr Kaushik’s c onduc t in the c irc umstanc es amounted to b a d faith. In any c ase, the authorities also c onfirm that a defendant’s negligenc e is generally regarded as irrelevant to the availability of the c hange of position defenc e: see _Dextra Bank & Trust Co Ltd v Bank of Jamaic a_ [2002] 1 All ER (Comm) 193 at [45]. 

73     In the result, I am satisfied that Dr Kaushik had c hanged his position as a result of the benefit he rec eived from oc c upying the Property for the period of Dec ember 2008 to Marc h 2011. He had 

done so when he c aused I^2 MS.Net to pay a monthly sum of $9,000 to Razali, suc h payment being his entitlement under his employment c ontrac t with the c ompany. His position c hanged from being entitled to ac c ommodation under his employment c ontrac t to having exhausted that entitlement through the payment of $9,000 for what he thought was a valid lease with the Plaintiff for the Property. He had also done so in good faith. Dr Kaushik was as muc h a vic tim of Razali’s fraud as the Plaintiff was. Given all the c irc umstanc es, I am of the view that it would be inequitable to require Dr Kaushik make restitution to the Plaintiff for the oc c upation of the Property for the said period. Ac c ordingly, although Dr Kaushik is liable in trespass to land for the wrongful oc c upation of the Property from Dec ember 2008 to Marc h 2011, the Plaintiff is not entitled to any restitutionary damages for this period. 

74     As to Dr Kaushik’s oc c upation of the Property from April to September 2011, he is not entitled to rely on the c hange of position defenc e. For this period, any monies whic h were paid were in fac t paid to the Plaintiff. In any event, by this time, Dr Kaushik had bec ome aware of the fraud of Razali, and so having suc h knowledge, even if there was a c hange of position, it c annot be c onsidered to have been a _bona fide_ c hange of position. Neither c an he rely on the $18,000 being the 2 months’ deposit he had paid to Razali in Dec ember 2008. There was no c ausative link between the payment of these deposit moneys to Razali in Dec ember 2008 and the benefit rec eived in the period of April to September 2011. The defenc e does not apply. The Plaintiff is entitled to the market rent for Dr Kaushik’s wrongful oc c upation of the Property during this period of 6 months: suc h market rent amounts to $54,000. However, in respec t of this $54,000, Dr Kaushik has already paid this sum to the Plaintiff (see [14] above). As c onfirmed by Mr Balasubramaniam, the Plaintiff will give Dr Kaushik c redit for this payment. Dr Kaushik c onsequently has already made restitution and does not remain liable to the Plaintiff for anything. 

75     There also remains Dr Kaushik’s oc c upation of the Property from 1 Oc tober 2011 to 6 Oc tober 2011 when he returned the keys to the Plaintiff. For Dr Kaushik’s oc c upation of the Property during this period, being a period of 5 days, he is also not entitled to rely on the defenc e of c hange of position. Neither has he already paid any money to the Plaintiff for this period of 5 days for whic h he should now be given c redit. To this extent, Dr Kaushik is liable to the Plaintiff in damages amounting to the market rent (at $9,000 per month) for these 5 days. This amounts to $1,451.61. 

**Conclusion** 

76     The tort of trespass to land is a tort whic h is ac tionable _per se_ ; damage need not be proven for the tort to be made out. Ac c ordingly, I find that Dr Kaushik had c ommitted the tort of trespass to land during the entire relevant period. However, for the reasons I have stated, I hold that he is only liable in damages to the Plaintiff in the sum of $1,451.61 and interest thereon. I will hear parties on c osts if these c annot be agreed.
