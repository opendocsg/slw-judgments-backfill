24 June 2015 Judgment reserved. 

**Belinda Ang Saw Ean J:** 

**Introduction** 

1       The plaintiff wife (“the plaintiff”) and the defendant husband (“the defendant”) were married on 12 April 2007. The parties lived apart some 19 months later. The plaintiff is aged 38 and the defendant is 48 years old. There is one female c hild of the marriage, aged 7 years (“the c hild”). 

2       The plaintiff, who is from Ukraine, was working and living in Germany when she met the defendant on the Internet. After a short c yberspac e c ourtship of about one month, she visited the defendant in Singapore in February 2007. The defendant proposed in Marc h 2007. The plaintiff left her job as a bank offic er, married the defendant on 12 April 2007 and reloc ated to Singapore in July 2007. The plaintiff bec ame pregnant shortly after the marriage. The female c hild of the marriage was born on 7 Marc h 2008. All in all, the parties’ virtual meeting, the plaintiff’s marriage to the defendant, reloc ation to Singapore, and pregnanc y happened almost impulsively in smooth suc c ession. Sadly but not surprisingly, the marriage was very short-lived. 

3       The parties lived apart sinc e 15 November 2008. At that point in time, the c hild was only eight months old. In the c ourse of the next five months, steps were taken to formalise their separation. Eventually, the parties signed a Deed of Separation dated 21 April 2009 (“the Deed”). The plaintiff initially filed for divorc e on 16 August 2011 c iting the defendant’s unreasonable behaviour as a ground for divorc e. The proc eedings were withdrawn by c onsent on 17 January 2012. The plaintiff subsequently c ommenc ed the present divorc e proc eedings on 3 February 2012 after three years separation and Interim Judgment was granted on 24 April 2012. 


4       Sinc e the separation of the parties, the plaintiff has been working part-time as a real estate agent and does some informal interpretation work. 

5       The defendant, a German, resides and works in Singapore. He has all along been the sole proprietor of a business that trades in raw materials. I shall refer to the business entity as “SS”. The defendant is also a direc tor and shareholder, _inter alia_ , of a private limited c ompany, whic h I shall refer to as “DFP”. As seen from DFP’s financ ial statements, the c ompany was dormant in the financ ial 

year ended Dec ember 2012. [note: 1] 

**The Deed** 

6       The terms in the Deed relevant to these proc eedings are set out below: 

 ... 

 1. Living Apart 

 1.1 With effec t from 15 November 2008, they have and shall c ontinue to live separate and apart from eac h other as if eac h were single and unmarried and free from the marital c ontrol (if any) of the other and neither of them shall molest, annoy, disturb, or interfere with the other of his or her relations, friends, or ac quaintanc es or in his or her profession or business. 

 ... 

 2. Divorce and Breakdown of Marriage 

 2.1 Either party may c ommenc e divorc e proc eedings on the ground of three years separation being three years from the date of separation herein, and the other party c onsents to a divorc e and/or a Final Judgment of Divorc e being granted. 

 3. Maintenance of Wife and [Child] 

 3.1 Subjec t to c lauses 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 herein, upon Final Judgement of Divorc e being obtained, the Husband shall pay the Wife SGD 40,000 (“the Divorc e Settlement”) for her c ontribution towards the marriage (if any and whic h c ontribution is denied by the Husband). In this respec t, the Husband had on 19 November 2008 paid in advanc e the sum of SGD 10,000 to the Wife as part of the Divorc e Settlement. 

 3.2 The Husband had proc ured an apartment at [address] (“the Apartment”) as the c urrent living ac c ommodation of the Wife and [the c hild] and had paid a deposit of SGD 5,400, whic h deposit the Wife may keep as part of the Divorc e Settlement when she moves out of the Apartment. For this purpose, the Husband shall inform the landlord in writing that the rental deposit without deduc tion shall be handed over to the Wife. 

 3.3 Following from c lauses 3.1 and 3.2 above, the Husband shall be required only to pay the Wife the balanc e of SGD 24,600 for the Divorc e Settlement upon a Final Judgment of Divorc e being obtained. 

 3.4 The Husband shall pay to the Wife a sum of SGD 2,700 per month being the rent of the Apartment until the Wife and [c hild] move out of said Apartment upon the expiry of the tenanc y of the Apartment on 14 November 2011. Thereafter, the Husband shall no longer be obliged to 


pay for the rent of any ac c ommodation for the Wife and [c hild] and shall only be responsible to pay maintenanc e as hereafter set out. The rent of maximum SGD 2,700 shall be paid up to and inc luding 14 November 2011. 

3\.5 The Husband shall pay to the Wife a sum of SGD 2,300 per month being maintenanc e for the Wife and [c hild]. The payments shall be made with effec t from Dec ember 2008 and thereafter 

on the 1st day of eac h subsequent month, until 15 November 2011. 

3\.6 From 15 November 2011 to the time [the c hild] reac hes the age of 13 years, the Husband shall pay the sum of SGD 1,500 as monthly maintenanc e for [the c hild]. 

3\.7 Upon [the c hild] attaining the age of 13 years, the maintenanc e sum to be paid by the Husband shall be inc reased to SGD 1,600 per month until [the c hild] is 17 years old. 

3\.8 Upon [the c hild] attainting the age of 17 years, the maintenanc e sum to be paid by the Husband shall be inc reased to SGD 1,800 per month until [the c hild] is 19 years old. 

3\.9 Upon [the c hild] attaining the age of 19 years, the maintenanc e sum to be paid by the Husband shall be inc reased to SGD 2,000 per month until the death of the Husband or until [the c hild] reac hes 21 years old or has c ompleted her tertiary educ ation, whic hever is later. 

3\.10 The Husband shall provide medic al insuranc e c overage whic h shall c over all medic al and hospitalisation expenses for [the c hild] to the maximum premium of SGD 1,200 per annum. 

**4**. **Custody of [the child]** 

4\.1 The Husband and Wife shall c ontinue to have joint c ustody of [the c hild] with c are and c ontrol to the Wife and liberal ac c ess to the Husband at least 3 times a week on Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 1p.m. to 6p.m. and on weekends on Sunday from 1 p.m. to 6p.m.. 

4\.2 The Wife may c hoose the c ountry whic h [the c hild] and herself shall live in. In the event that the Wife and [the c hild] [move] out of the Apartment or subsequently [c hange] ac c ommodation, the Wife shall immediately inform the Husband in writing of the loc ation of their new living ac c ommodation. 

**5**. **Assets** 

5\.1 Eac h party shall retain his/her assets in his/her name. 

5\.2 [The apartment in Singapore (“Property”)] was brought solely by the Husband before the marriage and during the marriage the mortgage over the property was paid solely by the Husband. The Wife agrees that the Property belongs solely to the Husband and she shall not make any c laim against the Husband for any share of the Property or its sale proc eeds should it be sold in the future. Pending the sale of the Property, the Husband may c ontinue to reside in the Property at his c hoic e. In turn, the Husband shall proc ure payment of living ac c ommodation for the Wife in ac c ordanc e with c lauses 3.2 and 3.4 herein. 

**6**. **Legal Costs** 

6\.1 Eac h party shall bear his/her own solic itors’ c osts in respec t of this Deed and the divorc e proc eedings to be filed by either party. 


 7. No Undue Influence/Legal Representation 

 7.1 The legal and prac tic al effec t of this Deed has been fully explained to eac h of the Parties and eac h of the Parties ac knowledges that the terms herein are ac c urate and fair and not the result of any fraud, distress or undue influenc e exerc ised by the other Party or any other Party or person upon either. 

 7.2 Eac h Party hereby warrants that it has entered into this Deed of its own free will, after having sought and rec eived full and c omplete independent legal advic e on the matters referred to in this Deed. 

 8. Full and Final Settlement 

 8.1 The terms and c onditions stated in this Deed represents the full and final agreement between the parties of all the matters stated herein and that save as stated herein, neither the Husband nor the Wife shall make any c laim against the other for any matter whatsoever and howsoever arising or against any of the parties’ respec tive assets, whether solely or jointly with another party. 

 8.2 All provisions of this Deed shall, so far as they are c apable of being performed or observed, c ontinue in full forc e and effec t notwithstanding the c ommenc ement of any divorc e proc eedings, Interim Judgment of Divorc e and a Final Judgment of Divorc e in respec t of those matters then already performed. 

 8.3 This Deed shall be in full and final settlement of all matrimonial and anc illary matters between the parties and shall also be embodied in an Order of Court in the divorc e proc eedings provided that if any parties does not observe or perform all or any of the aforesaid mentioned c ovenants, the other party shall be at liberty to apply for enforc ement of the same and the defaulting party shall not c ontest suc h enforc ement proc eedings, if any. 

7       It is evident from the terms set out above that the Deed purported to regulate the rights and liabilities of the parties at three different phases: (a) the first three years after separation and before divorc e proc eedings were ac tually filed; (b) the period between filing of divorc e proc eedings and grant of Final Judgment of Divorc e; and (c ) the period post Final Judgment of Divorc e. Indeed, rec ital (E) of the Deed made c lear the aims of the Deed whic h were to regulate the rights of the parties based on the terms thereof. Rec ital (E) reads: 

 The Husband and the Wife have agreed that whilst apart until they make other provisions for the matters herein mentioned or until the terms hereof are superseded by any Order of Court, the following provisions shall take effec t and regulate their rights and liabilities to eac h other. 

8       Henc e, pursuant to c l 5.1, eac h party would be able to retain the assets in his or her own name. The only major asset that was expressly referred to in the Deed was the matrimonial home _viz_ , the apartment whic h the parties lived in during the marriage. The parties c onsidered the matrimonial home as a matrimonial asset upon whic h the plaintiff would otherwise have a c laim in divorc e proc eedings. That said, the defendant did not, however, agree that the plaintiff had c ontributed to the marriage. Nevertheless, he settled this issue with a promise to pay $40,000 upon Final Judgment of Divorc e (see c l 3.1 of the Deed). As to whether this sum of $40,000 c ould be taken as representing a “division of a matrimonial asset” or, was simply a “pay-off” in exc hange for the plaintiff giving up her c laim to the matrimonial home in c l 5.2, this matter will be c onsidered later in the Judgment. 


9       In relation to maintenanc e, pursuant to c l 3.4, the defendant was obliged to pay rent for the plaintiff and the c hild for a period of three years following the separation. Similarly, the defendant was pursuant to c l 3.5 to pay maintenanc e to the plaintiff for the same period. 

10     More spec ific ally, in relation to the maintenanc e of the c hild, c ll 3.6 to 3.9 provide that the c hild was to be maintained (at an inc remental rate) until she reac hes 21 years old or has c ompleted her tertiary educ ation, whic hever is later. Pursuant to c l 3.10, the defendant was also required to provide medic al insuranc e c overage for the c hild to the maximum premium of $1,200 per annum. 

11     Lastly, the Deed also c overed the issue of c ustody, c are and c ontrol and ac c ess in c l 4.1. Broadly, the parties agreed to joint c ustody with c are and c ontrol to the plaintiff and liberal ac c ess to the defendant. 

12     As seen from the above outline, the Deed purported to c over all of the issues that a c ourt would have to c onsider in anc illary proc eedings. 

13     The plaintiff, however, has c hallenged the validity of the Deed. She asserted that the Deed should be set aside bec ause of undue pressure from the defendant who had pressured or c oerc ed her into signing the Deed. Besides examining the plaintiff’s allegations of undue influenc e as a vitiating fac tor, there are two preliminary issues that arise for determination. First, whether the Deed was an agreement that was binding on the parties, and sec ond, whether it was an agreement of the type spec ified in s 112(2)( _e_ ) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”). 

**Is the Deed binding?** 

14     It is c ommon ground that the Deed was exec uted under seal by the parties. The plaintiff did not dispute that the signature on the relevant exec ution page of the Deed was hers. In this c ase, the plaintiff signed the Deed under seal in the presenc e of her solic itor who witnessed her signing of the Deed on 3 April 2009. The exec ution page also c ontained an attestation c ertific ation of the plaintiff’s 

solic itor. It reads as follows: [note: 2] 

 On this 3rd day of April 2009 before me, [name redac ted], an Advoc ate and Solic itor of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Singapore prac tising in Singapore, personally appeared [the plaintiff ] who of my own personal knowledge I know to be the identic al person whose name “[signature]” is subsc ribed to the within instrument and ac knowledged that she had voluntarily exec uted this instrument at Singapore. 

15     The _prima facie_ evidenc e on the fac e of the Deed is that it was signed, sealed and delivered by the plaintiff on 3 April 2009. As for the defendant, he signed the Deed under seal in the presenc e of his solic itor who ac ted as a witness to his signing of the Deed on 21 April 2009. The Deed also c ontained his solic itor’s attestation c ertific ation. The _prima facie_ evidenc e on the fac e of the Deed is that it was signed, sealed and delivered by the defendant on 21 April 2009. 

**Are there vitiating factors to set aside the Deed?** 

16     As stated, the plaintiff argued that the Deed should be set aside bec ause of vitiating fac tors. In _TQ v TR_ <span class="citation">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 961</span> (“ _TQ v TR_ ”), Andrew Phang JA noted the fac tors that would vitiate a pre-nuptial agreement at [97]: 

 At the other end of the c ontrac tual spec trum are to be found the various vitiating fac tors. These inc lude standard c ontrac tual doc trines suc h as misrepresentation, mistake, undue influenc e, 


 duress, unc onsc ionability, as well as illegality and public polic y. In this last-mentioned respec t, there is also the possibility of "saving" that part of the prenuptial agreement that is objec tionable via the doc trine of severanc e (c f, though, the unsuc c essful attempt at invoking this doc trine in the English Court of Appeal dec ision of Bennett v Bennett [1952] 1 KB 249; the English High Court dec ision of N v N ([46]supra); and the Australian High Court dec ision of Brooks v Burns Philp Trustee Co Ltd (1969) 121 CLR 432; c f also s 7 of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Ac t (US) (adopted by 26 states and the Distric t of Columbia)). There has also been mention of the safeguard relating to the availability of independent legal advic e (and see, in the US c ontext, Allison A Marston, "Planning for Love: The Politic s of Prenuptial Agreements" (1997) 49 Stan L Rev 887 at 909-916). We would pause to observe that this partic ular fac tor is in fac t an integral part of the fac tors that the c ourts would generally take into c onsideration in any event (partic ularly in the c ontext of the applic ation of the doc trines of undue influenc e, duress and unc onsc ionability). 

17     The c ourt in _Wong Kien Keong v Khoo Hoon Eng_ <span class="citation">[2012] SGHC 127</span> at [22] extended and applied these princ iples to a post-nuptial agreement, whic h extension was ac c epted by our Court of Appeal in _Lian Hwee Choo Phebe v Tan Seng Ong_ <span class="citation">[2013] 3 SLR 1162</span> at [18] (“ _Lian Phebe_ ”). 

18     On the evidenc e, the plaintiff’s signature on the fac e of the Deed must _prima facie_ be taken to have the intended effec t on the signatory. In this regard, c l 7.2 of the Deed (at [6] above) is instruc tive. It c ontained the plaintiff’s ac knowledgment that she c hose to sign the Deed of her own free will and with the benefit of legal advic e. The plaintiff c onfirmed in c l 7.1 that the legal and prac tic al effec t of the Deed had been explained to her and that there was no “undue influenc e exerc ised” by the defendant or any person (see [6] above). 

19     Notably, there were two e-mails to the plaintiff that supported the defendant’s c ontention that 

he did not forc e her to sign the Deed. The first e-mail dated 25 January 2009 reads: [note: 3] 

 ... 

 I have attac hed the revised [Deed] and have stressed my proposition! This is, however, my very last proposition!!! Read it through. No one is forcing you to sign it. However, after this, I would not adhere muc h longer to my propositions, in c ase you think that you are not getting enough. This is a better offer than what you are legally entitled to! Even in Germany, you would be entitled to less... [emphasis added] 

20     In the sec ond e-mail dated 22 January 2009, the defendant rejec ted the plaintiff’s c ounter 

proposal for more money. He wrote: [note: 4] 

 I have made you a very respec table offer, whic h lies within my financ ial means, and you are not getting enough!!! Now, I have to fight too, and in addition to that, the leasing c ontrac t will expire c ome August. After whic h, I would be fac ing more financ ial problems, and if I do not rec eive any applic ation by then, I would be forc ed to sell the apartment, whic h would mean that I would inc ur a loss. This loss would be inc orporated in our c ombined marital assets, and I would then only pay you what you are entitled to! 

 The attac hed proposition must be signed by 31 Marc h. Please inform me if you would be signing it or not, as it needs to be then properly edited and straightened out!!??? I would not entertain any further revisions or c hanges from you. You can merely choose whether you want to sign it or not! [emphasis added]. 

21     The plaintiff adduc ed e-mails to highlight that she voic ed her unhappiness with c ertain portions 


of the Deed [note: 5] and to evinc e that she “[had] neither energy nor money to fight against [the 

defendant]” [note: 6] in relation to the terms of the Deed. In my view, the sentiments expressed by the plaintiff were c onsistent with the meaning and her understanding of the defendant’s e-mails set out above: she c ould c hoose not to sign the Deed if she did not ac c ept his proposals. The point that she had neither the energy nor the money to fight the defendant was proffered (c ontemporaneously) as her reason for signing the Deed and not to suggest that she had been pressured or c oerc ed by the defendant to sign the Deed. 

22     An important point to note from Phang JA’s observations at [16] above is that the availability of independent legal advic e at the material time is a key fac tor the c ourt would c onsider in dec iding if a pre-nuptial agreement or post-nuptial agreement (“marital agreement”) should be set aside. This is bec ause it is normally the c ase (as in the present) that parties to a marriage would invoke the doc trines of undue influenc e or duress to set aside a marital agreement, given the emotionally c harged c irc umstanc es in whic h suc h agreements are normally negotiated and exec uted. The existenc e of independent legal advic e would normally be a strong indic ation of informed c onsent, whic h would undermine arguments relating to undue influenc e or duress. 

23     In the present c ase, I note that both parties were legally advised in the entry into the Deed, whic h took five months to negotiate. I am satisfied on the evidenc e that there was no undue influenc e and that the so-c alled pressure felt by the plaintiff at the time of entry into the Deed was not of suc h quality as to undermine her c onsent so as to vitiate the Deed. It is natural for parties to feel some pressure in the run up to negotiating a marital agreement. However, the pressure felt and fac ed by the plaintiff, as evinc ed by the e-mail exc hanges between herself and the defendant (and herself and her solic itor), would not satisfy the stringent legal requirements for vitiating a marital agreement. Additionally, the plaintiff did not state onc e in her e-mails to her solic itor that she was pressured to sign the Deed. The five-month period taken to finalise the Deed was also indic ative of the fac t that eac h party would have had the opportunity to review the offers and to make c ounter proposals. Indeed, I note that the plaintiff did propose some amendments to drafts of the Deed that were eventually ac c epted and inc orporated. She had also asked for more money but on that matter the defendant was not prepared to give in. 

24     In support of her assertion of undue influenc e, the plaintiff’s mother deposed an affidavit to suggest that her daughter was pressured into signing the Deed. I also find the affidavit filed by the plaintiff’s mother to be both self-serving and unreliable seeing that it was based on evidenc e c ommunic ated to her by the plaintiff. 

25     Counsel for the defendant, Mr Ranjit Singh (“Mr Singh”), pointed out that the plaintiff had previously stated in an affidavit filed to oppose proc eedings brought by the defendant for sole c ustody and c are and c ontrol of the c hild under the Guardianship of Infants Ac t (Cap 122, Rev Ed 1985) (“GIA”) in 2010 that the Deed was “negotiated at arms’ length” and that the defendant’s 

applic ation was c ontrary to c l 4.1of the Deed. [note: 7] He argued that the plaintiff must not be allowed to blow hot and c old and take inc onsistent positions: she had previously adopted the position that the Deed was valid and negotiated at arm’s length in an attempt to bind the defendant to c l 4. of the Deed. Yet in these proc eedings, she adopted a c ontradic tory position in her c hallenge that the Deed was invalid and that it should be set aside bec ause of, _inter alia_ , undue influenc e. 

26     The defendant further pointed out that plaintiff’s c omplaint lac ked c redibility, as she c hose to ac c ept payments due to her under the Deed. The defendant performed his obligations under the Deed for three years before divorc e proc eedings were filed and the plaintiff was c ontent until these proc eedings were c ommenc ed to rec eive the payments under c ll 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 of the Deed 


27     The plaintiff argued that she was kept in the dark about the defendant’s assets and his financ ial position at the time the Deed was signed. She c laimed that the defendant had not told her about his financ ial resourc es and did not make full and frank disc losure of his assets and means when 

she signed the Deed. [note: 8] Counsel for the plaintiff, Ms Bernic e Loo (“Ms Loo”), argued that the Deed was not valid bec ause of the defendant’s failure “to make full and frank disc losure/material disc losure of his financ ial resourc es when he entered into the Deed”, and she argued that that “alone 

is a fac tor whic h mitigates against the notion that the Deed was entered into ‘at arm’s length’.” [note: 9] Not only was there no spec ific assertion of any misrepresentation, Ms Loo did not refer me to any 

authority in support of her proposition that the non-disc losure of the defendant’s financ ial resourc es is a vitiating fac tor rec ognised in law. 

28     Judith Prakash J in _Tiong Swee Eng v Yeo Khee Siang_ <span class="citation">[2015] SGHC 116</span> (“ _Tiong Swee Eng_ ”) noted at [58] that the law makes a distinc tion between misrepresentation and non-disc losure. This distinc tion has been explained by John Cartwright in his book _Misrepresentation, Mistake and NonDisclosure_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2012) (“ _Cartwright_ ”) at para 16-03 in the following manner: 

 ... In the c ase of a misrepresentation, [the c laimant] alleges that it was the defendant’s misrepresentation that c aused him to make the mistake: the defendant’s words or c onduc t c ommunic ated information on whic h the c laimant relied in dec iding to enter into the c ontrac t. But in the c ase of non-disc losure the defendant has done nothing to c ause the mistake or to give rise to the c laimant’s assumptions as to the c irc umstanc es surrounding the c ontrac t; he failed to give the c laimant relevant information whic h would have c orrec ted the mistake or false assumption. A c laim of non-disc losure therefore falls between mistake and misrepresentation: the c laimant is not simply relying on his own mistake or misunderstanding; but nor does he say that the defendant c aused it. He claims that the defendant should have told him something to correct the mistake or to inform him better about the circumstances relevant to his decision to enter into the contract, and that he is entitled to a remedy in consequence of the defendant’s failure to fulfil his duty. [emphasis added] 

29     Additionally, the general princ iple and starting point at c ommon law is that there is no prec ontrac tual obligation on the part of parties negotiating a c ontrac t to disc lose information even when the party is aware that the said information would influenc e the dec ision of the other. This princ iple rec ognises that parties are normally negotiating as adversaries prior to entering into a c ontac t and has been outlined both in _Cartwright_ at para 16-02 and the dec ision of the English Court of Appeal in _Banque Financiere de la Cite SA (formerly Banque Keyser Ullmann SA) v Westgate Insurance Co (formerly Hodge General & Mercantile Co Ltd)_ [1990] 1 QB 665 (“ _Westgate Insurance_ ”). The c ourt in _Westgate Insurance_ noted as follows at 798: 

 ... There are c ountless c ases in whic h one party to a c ontrac t has in the c ourse of negotiations failed to disc lose a fac t known to him whic h the other party would have regarded as highly material, if it had been revealed. However, ordinarily in the absenc e of misrepresentation, our law leaves that other party entirely without remedy. ... 

30     Now that mere pre-c ontrac tual non-disc losure does not amount to misrepresentation at law, the plaintiff here who is seeking to argue that the Deed should be vitiated on the ground of nondisc losure of the defendant would have to first establish that the c ase falls within a rec ognised exc eption to the general rule, suc h that there is an obligation of disc losure imposed on the defendant. 

31     I note that the c ommon law imposes an express pre-c ontrac tual duty of disc losure in c ertain narrow c irc umstanc es. These c irc umstanc es typic ally arise in c ontrac ts of utmost good faith and this 


oc c urs in the insuranc e c ontext. I note that Chapter 17 of _Cartwright_ sets out the situations where the c ourts have imposed a pre-c ontrac tual obligation of disc losure, and a post-nuptial agreement is not highlighted as one suc h situation. 

32     In the present c ase, no authority has been c ited by the plaintiff in support of her argument that the law imposes an obligation of disc losure on parties when entering into a post-nuptial agreement. In any c ase, the position in Singapore law as set out in _Tiong Swee Eng_ at [63] is that there is no general pre-c ontrac tual obligation of disc losure imposed on parties to a post-nuptial agreement, as a post-nuptial agreement is subjec t to ordinary princ iples of c ontrac t law and is like any ordinary c ontrac t. I am of a similar view and also highlight that the position in _Westgate Insurance_ (set out at [29] above) should form the starting point for any analysis relating to suc h prec ontrac tual disc losure obligations. The c ourt in _Tiong Swee Eng_ nevertheless highlighted that although there is no general obligation of disc losure on parties when entering into a post-nuptial agreement, the c ourt may dec ide to ac c ord less weight to a valid post-nuptial agreement (as part of its analysis pursuant to s 112(2)( _e_ ) of the Charter) if it finds that the non-disc losure by one party led to a less than equitable division of matrimonial property. 

33     I make a few observations on _Tiong Swee Eng_. In that c ase, the parties entered into a postnuptial agreement where they, _inter alia_ , divided the matrimonial assets. The husband made an express representation as to his asset position in an assets list (“Assets List”) and omitted a c ertain property from the said list. The c ourt found that the husband had misrepresented his position in the Assets List and that the wife relied on the ac c urac y of the Assets List in entering into the postnuptial agreement. Though the c ourt found ac tionable misrepresentation, it refused to resc ind the separation agreement and awarded the wife damages of $1000. 

3       4 _Tiong Swee Eng_ is distinguishable on the present fac ts. First, there was no list of assets that was tabulated by the parties as part of entry into the Deed. In the absenc e of any express representation on his assets by the defendant in the Deed, as in _Tiong Swee Eng_ , it is not possible for the plaintiff to argue that she relied on the defendant’s asset position in entering into the Deed. Therefore, even if the plaintiff ran an argument based on misrepresentation, she would not have suc c eeded. The plaintiff would also not be able to argue without more that the defendant had breac hed a c ommon law obligation, as there would have been no general obligation of disc losure on him at c ommon law. Sec ond, as I will disc uss shortly, the plaintiff was broadly aware of the asset position of the defendant. In the premises, there is nothing to the plaintiff’s argument that the Deed 

should be set aside on the basis that she was kept “in the dark” [note: 10] about the defendant’s financ ial position. 

35     As regards the plaintiff’s allegation that she was kept in the dark about the defendant’s financ ial position, the defendant disagreed with this. He stated in his affidavit that the plaintiff was aware when she signed the Deed that, besides the matrimonial home, he owned two other private properties, a yac ht and old model Merc edes c ar and that he was the sole proprietor of a business. [note: 11] 

36     I note the plaintiff’s c onc ession in her submissions that she was aware of the existenc e of most of the assets owned by the defendant exc ept for c ertain bank ac c ounts (some of whic h related to 

SS). [note: 12] Besides, on the plaintiff’s own c ase, if her averments that she was involved in c ollating the rec eipts for SS and helping the plaintiff in his administrative work were true, she would have some 

sense of the defendant’s financ es in SS. [note: 13] In any c ase, I am of the view that if the plaintiff needed more information before ac c epting the terms of the Deed, her solic itor was there to guide her in her quest for information. I note that the Deed took five months to negotiate and the plaintiff c ould 


have (through her solic itor) asked the defendant for a list of all his assets if she indeed needed more information. 

37     For all the reasons stated, the Deed is a binding doc ument in the absenc e of any vitiating fac tors to set it aside. I am satisfied that the Deed was entered into by the plaintiff freely and voluntarily. On the overall evidenc e, I agree with the defendant that the plaintiff’s arguments relating to the presenc e of vitiating fac tors were afterthoughts. 

**Is the Deed an agreement within the meaning of s 112(2)(** **_e_** **) of the Charter?** 

38     I now turn to disc uss the sec ond preliminary issue: whether the Deed was an agreement within the meaning of s 112(2)( _e_ ) of the Charter. In this regard, the Court of Appeal in _Lian Phebe_ noted at [17] as follows: 

 To determine whether an agreement of the type spec ified in s 112(2)( e ) of the Charter exists, two elements must be met: first, there must have been an agreement with respec t to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets; and sec ond, the aforesaid agreement must have been “made in c ontemplation of divorc e”. 

39     The defendant’s c ase is that the Deed should be given full weight (as its terms were fair and equitable) in whic h c ase, an order adopting the terms of the Deed should be granted exc ept for c l 4. of the Deed now that the defendant wanted shared c are and c ontrol of the c hild. In c ontrast, the plaintiff’s position is that little or no weight should be given to the Deed. In this regard, the plaintiff argued that the terms of the Deed regarding division of matrimonial assets were ambiguous as well as not equitable. 

40     In these c urrent proc eedings, Ms Loo did not spec ific ally submit that the Deed was not an “agreement between the parties with respec t to the ownership and division of matrimonial assets”. Her c ontention, however, was that the Deed was ambiguous thereby giving rise to unc ertainty in the division of matrimonial assets. Put another way, there was arguably no division of matrimonial assets in the Deed given its ambiguity. Ms Loo in her reply submissions filed on 16 Marc h 2015 highlighted some drafting disc repanc ies that c reated the ambiguity that led to unc ertainty. She pointed out that the sum of $40,000 desc ribed as “the Divorc e Settlement” in c l 3.1 of the Deed was for the plaintiff’s c ontribution towards the marriage whic h the defendant denied. But the heading of c l 3 was entitled “MAINTENANCE OF WIFE AND [CHILD]”. Ms Loo also relied on c l 5.2 (at [6] above) whic h was a provision under the heading entitled “ASSETS”. Ms Loo argued that the c ombined effec t of c ll 5.2 and 3.1 c oming under different subjec t headings was far from c lear and was thus ambiguous. She 

submitted as follows: [note: 14] 

16\. It is not c lear from Clause 5.2 and Clause 3.1 what the Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets pursuant to the Deed would be. In fac t, it is arguable that pursuant to the Deed, the Wife would effec tively, (1) not rec eive any share of the matrimonial assets save for keeping her own assets, and (2) the payment of S$40,000 under Clause 3.1 of the Deed was intended to be a lump sum maintenanc e payment for the Wife and [the c hild] (although [the c hild] is entitled to additional maintenanc e at Clauses 3.5-3.9 of the Deed). 

41     In her submissions, Ms Loo treated the sum of $40,000 as “lump sum maintenanc e” whic h does not sit well with the text of c l 3.1 of the Deed and the other sub-c lauses that made provision for the plaintiff’s ac c ommodation and maintenanc e for three years. 

42     Ms Loo questioned c ll 3.1 and 5.2 of the Deed and their effec t whic h left the plaintiff without 


any share of the matrimonial home, her argument ended there and did not press the point that there was no “division” as suc h, although she labelled the $40,000 as lump sum maintenanc e. Nevertheless, her point leads on to the broader question of whether the terms of c ll 3.1 and 5.2 c onstituted an agreement with respec t to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets within the meaning of s 112(2)( _e_ ) of the Charter. 

43     Clause 5.2 is made up of three parts. The first part reiterated the position that the plaintiff made no financ ial c ontribution to the ac quisition of the matrimonial home and that it was the defendant who had bought it before the marriage and made all the financ ial c ontributions towards the ac quisition of the property and the mortgage repayments during the marriage. The sec ond part c onc erns the plaintiff. Not only did she ac knowledge the defendant’s ownership of the matrimonial property, she also expressly agreed “not to make any c laim against the [defendant] for any share of the [matrimonial property] or its sale proc eeds should it be sold in the future”. A sale of the matrimonial property was being c ontemplated at the time of the Deed. The last part of c l 5.2 dealt with the defendant’s use of the matrimonial property as his abode “pending the sale of the [matrimonial home]”. It also dealt with alternative ac c ommodation for the plaintiff and the c hild. 

44     In one respec t, I agree with Ms Loo that c ll 3.1 and 5.2 c ould have been better drafted and organised methodic ally. As a disc rete point, the sec ond part of c l 5.2 would not be given effec t in determining this threshold issue ( _ie_ , whether the Deed qualifies as an agreement under s 112(2)( _e_ )) if it attempted to c ontrac t out of the plaintiff’s share of the matrimonial home by ignoring her indirec t c ontributions so that the sum of $40,000 was nothing more than a “pay off”. It is trite law that in suc h matters, the parties c annot by agreement oust the c ourt’s jurisdic tion to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset in suc h proportions as the c ourt thinks just and equitable. 

45     Clause 5.2 has to be read together with c l 3.1 of the Deed in order to understand the phrase “her c ontribution towards the marriage” in c l 3.1. The word “c ontribution” in c l 3.1 was intended to refer to non-financ ial c ontributions of the plaintiff to the marriage. This interpretation is c onsistent with the plaintiff’s ac knowledgment that the defendant made all the financ ial c ontributions towards the matrimonial home in c l 5.2 and the undisputed fac t that the plaintiff did not work during the marriage and there was no suggestion that she made any indirec t financ ial c ontributions to the marriage. The Deed sought to asc ribe in c l 3.1, a monetary value to the plaintiff’s indirec t c ontributions towards the marriage at the figure of $40,000. As to the defendant’s express denial in c l 3.1 that the plaintiff had c ontributed to the marriage, I would liken his position to someone who had c onc luded a settlement of a disputed issue without admission of liability and on a without prejudic e basis. This interpretation of the Deed is buttressed by the defendant’s c onc ession at the hearing that the matrimonial home was available for division subjec t to proof of indirec t c ontributions in these proc eedings as noted at [56] below. 

46     For c ompleteness, I should add that the Deed was made in c ontemplation of divorc e, as evinc ed by c l 2.1 of the Deed. As explained earlier, the three phases of the Deed at [7] above c overed the different situations of the parties as they go through separation, divorc e and postdivorc e. 

47     In the premises, the Deed was an agreement that is within the sc ope of s 112(2)( _e_ ) having satisfied the requirements set out in s 112(2)( _e_ ) (see observations in _Lian Phebe_ at [17] reproduc ed at [38] above). 

**Just and equitable division** 

**_The law_** 


**_The law_** 

48     An agreement c oming within the meaning of s 112(2)( _e_ ) of the Charter c annot in and of itself be enforc eable bec ause suc h an agreement c annot oust the c ourt’s jurisdic tion to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset in suc h proportions as the c ourt thinks just and equitable (see _AOO v AON_ <span class="citation">[2011] 4 SLR 1169</span> at [19]). It was similarly noted in _Wong Kien Keong v Khoo Hoon Eng_ <span class="citation">[2014] 1 SLR 1342</span> (“ _Wong Kien Keong (2014)_ ”) at [18] that even when a marital agreement has been effec tively entered into and is not set aside by the c ourt, the c ourt has the overriding power to sc rutinise the terms of the said marital agreement so as to dec ide on the weight that should be ac c orded to it. As noted in _Wong Kien Keong (2014)_ at [31]: 

 How muc h weight the c ourt ac c ords to a marital agreement depends on the division under the agreement as well as the fac ts of the c ase, whic h means that not only the terms but also the parties' c onduc t surrounding the making and the exec ution of the agreement would be sc rutinised. ... 

49     Chao Hic k Tin JA in _AQS v AQR_ <span class="citation">[2012] SGCA 3</span> at [35] remarked: 

 In any c ase, an agreement between the parties made in c ontemplation of divorc e c ould not be dec isive. It is only one of the fac tors listed in s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter that the c ourt must take into ac c ount as part of its overarc hing duty to reac h a just and equitable division in light of all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase. This Court affirmed in TQ v TR and another appeal <span class="citation">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 961</span> at [75] that even though post-nuptial agreements c ould be ac c orded more weight than pre-nuptial agreements how muc h weight was to be alloc ated to a post-nuptial must ultimately depend on the prec ise c irc umstanc es of the c ase. ... 

50     While marital agreements are normally broadly c lassed into pre-nuptial and post-nuptial agreements, the Court of Appeal in _Surindar Singh s/o Jaswant Singh v Sita Jaswant Kaur_ <span class="citation">[2014] 3 SLR 1284</span> (“ _Surindar Singh_ ”) made the following (and further) distinc tion between typic al postnuptial agreements and separation agreements (at [52]): 

 ... Postnuptial agreements may be made when the husband and wife are still together and intend to remain together, or when they are at the point of separating or have already separated, in whic h c ase, the postnuptial agreement may be c alled a “separation agreement”. A separation agreement is made when the marriage has failed and when the parties have either gone their separate ways or are proposing to do so. The separation agreement is meant to c ater to the immediate needs and desires of the parties, instead of some future possibility of breakup whic h the c ouple neither want nor expec t to happen. Therefore, as a general proposition, where the parties enter into a separation agreement, especially after divorce or separation proceedings have already commenced, such a separation agreement will, in our view, generally carry significant weight. ... [emphasis added]. 

51     The Court of Appeal then stated at [54] as a general proposition that where parties had properly and fairly c ome to a marital agreement with the benefit of legal advic e, the c ourt would generally attac h signific ant weight to that agreement unless there were good and substantial grounds for c onc luding that to do so would be unjust. Before dec iding to give weight (whether signific ant or otherwise) to the agreement, the c ourt will first sc rutinise the agreement. This approac h is c onsistent with s 112(2) of the Charter. I would like to highlight the following observations of the Court of Appeal at [56]: 

 We are of the view that giving significant weight to a separation agreement, unless there are good and substantial grounds for concluding that an injustice will be done , is not inc onsistent 


 either with the approac h in TQ v TR ([20] supra) or with s 112 of the Charter. This does not mean that in every c ase signific ant weight will be given to suc h an agreement. Whilst the court may incline to give significant weight to a separation agreement which the parties have freely and voluntarily arrived at with the benefit of legal advice , the c ourt will always (c onsistently with s 112(2)) examine the prec ise c irc umstanc es before it to determine whether in the instant c ase it would be unfair to do so. In determining whether such unfairness exists, the court will not accord great significance to the fact that it might have made a different distribution than that agreed to. The grounds for disregarding suc h a separation agreement would have to be more substantial than a slight differenc e of opinion on the fairness of the distribution provided for by the agreement. [emphasis added]. 

52     The holding in _Surindar Singh_ however must be applied in a nuanc ed manner. The Court of Appeal is suggesting that where the c ourt is satisfied that the parties have fac tored all the c ontributions of eac h party and arrived at a division in a marital agreement, a c ourt should be slow to vary the marital agreement on the ground that it would have given a different perc entage taking into ac c ount those _very same contributions_ made during the marriage whic h are typic ally assessed retrospec tively. 

53     However, the position is different where there are prospec tive and c ontinuing indirec t c ontributions of the other to the marriage and suc h c ontributions are expec ted to subsist by reason of obligations under the marital agreement until a final judgment of divorc e. As will be seen in this c ase, it would generally be inequitable for one party to not suffic iently rec ognise those indirec t c ontributions. Suc h c ontributions when rec ognised, will align the legal position in this c ase with situations where the c ourt assesses indirec t c ontributions in the absenc e of a matrimonial agreement (see generally _ARX v ARY_ <span class="citation">[2015] 2 SLR 1103</span>). 

**_Parties’ choice of assets_** 

54     As mentioned earlier, the plaintiff based her princ ipal objec tion to the Deed on the defendant’s non-disc losure of his assets. Her c ontention is that $40,000 was not fair and equitable given the defendant’s wealth. In the c ourse of these proc eedings, the plaintiff obtained disc overy against the defendant to c rystallise the value of his entire asset pool. Through disc overy, the plaintiff found that the total value of the defendant’s assets amounted to about $6,522,608.07 (see Annex A ( _Table 1_ ) for a detailed breakdown of the net asset position of the defendant). The plaintiff argued that the defendant’s assets would qualify as matrimonial assets within the meaning of sub-sec tions ( _a_ ) and ( _b_ ) of s 112(2)(10) of the Charter. Therefore, the Deed should not be ac c orded weight as her share of the matrimonial assets under the Deed was a paltry 0.62% of his known wealth of $6.6m (ac c ording 

to the plaintiff’s tabulation). [note: 15] 

55     I make two points. First, the marriage was a very short one and a binding separation agreement ( _ie_ , the Deed) was signed five months after the parties lived apart. By the terms of the Deed, the parties were to live separate lives as c l 1.1 made c lear. The intention was to file for divorc e after three years separation. It was also evident from the Deed that the parties no longer intended to partic ipate in the defendant’s ac c umulation of wealth. Consequently, c l 5.1 set out the parties’ agreement that eac h party was to retain his/her assets in his/her name. The sec ond point whic h follows from the first is that the agreement c ontemplated assets available as at 21 April 2009, the date of the Deed. The defendant was ten years older than the plaintiff and was already a businessman before he married the plaintiff, and it was c onc eivable that most of his assets were amassed before marriage. Thus, the most valuable asset that would qualify as a matrimonial asset was the matrimonial home, and that was what the parties foc ussed on disc ussing in the Deed. 


56     In the present c ase, the parties dec ided that eac h party would retain the assets held in their sole names pursuant to c l 5.1. I find this arrangement to be fair as the marriage only lasted for 19 months and the plaintiff made no direc t financ ial c ontributions in relation to any of the defendant’s assets listed in Annex A ( _Table 1_ ). The assets held in the respec tive names of the plaintiff and defendant (exc ept the matrimonial home, whic h I will go on to disc uss) were therefore exc luded from division. I repeat, of all the assets, the matrimonial home was the most appropriate asset where the c ontributions of the plaintiff as a wife and mother to the c hild of the marriage were likely to be rec ognised monetarily. I make two points. First, I would not have given weight to the sec ond part of c l 5.2 (see [43] above) if it meant depriving the plaintiff of a share of the matrimonial home where there is evidenc e of her indirec t c ontributions to the marriage and welfare of the family. Sec ond, the defendant through his c ounsel c onc eded at the hearing that $40,000 was for division of matrimonial 

assets. [note: 16] In other words, notwithstanding the broader position of the defendant in relation to c ll 5.1 and 5.2 of the Deed, the defendant through his c ounsel was willing to c onc ede that the matrimonial home should in princ iple be the primary asset available for division in these proc eedings if 

there was evidenc e of the plaintiff’s indirec t c ontributions towards the marriage. [note: 17] Mr Singh also submitted that the matrimonial home, CPF monies of the defendant and a German flat would ordinarily fall in the pool of assets for division. As the princ ipal asset by value would be the matrimonial home with a net value of $1.6m, and the plaintiff made no financ ial c ontributions to any of the assets, the sum of $40,000 was not far off the 3% benc hmark amount that the c ourt would have 

given in any c ase. [note: 18] 

**_Division_** 

57     I now turn to c l 5.2 read together with c l 3.1 of the Deed. As noted, Mr Singh ac c epted that the matrimonial home formed the basis for arriving at the amount of $40,000 for the plaintiff’s c ontributions during 19 months of the marriage. The plaintiff was therefore given about 2.5% of the net value of the matrimonial home based on $1.6m. 

58     Is this amount fair and equitable seeing that she was expec ted under c l 4.1 to be the primary c aregiver of an eight month old baby from the date of the Deed to Final Judgment? In other words, the plaintiff’s indirec t c ontributions to the welfare of the c hild were expec ted to c ontinue even after the breakdown of the marriage and extend beyond the date of the Deed. I should make c lear that the fairness of the monetary figure has to be assessed at the date of the Deed. 

59     The present c ase demonstrates the exac t situation desc ribed at [53] above. It is c lear that the Deed was looking at the indirec t c ontributions of the plaintiff up to the date of the Deed in asc ribing the sum of $40,000 and did not take into ac c ount the prospec tive (and c ontinuing) indirec t c ontributions of the plaintiff as a c aregiver to the c hild of the marriage until the point where Final Judgment will be entered. 

60     I am of the view that her indirec t c ontributions as desc ribed had to be rec ognised not only from the perspec tive of the plaintiff c aring for the c hild of the marriage after the Deed but also from the option she was given in c l 4.1 to start a new life with the c hild in Singapore or in any other c ountry when the needs of the young c hild are also taken into ac c ount under s 112(2)( _c_ ) of the Charter. Viewed as suc h, a sum of $40,000 would not be a fair and equitable division. 

61     The defendant in his affidavit explained that the plaintiff did not make any indirec t c ontributions to the marriage. His evidenc e is that her lac kadaisic al attitude towards the welfare of the family was a c ause of the breakup. While the plaintiff made no direc t financ ial c ontributions to the marriage, she was nevertheless a homemaker during the marriage and was the c aregiver of the c hild whilst she was 


living with the defendant and even after the Deed was entered into. Even though the defendant had liberal ac c ess to the c hild and spent a fair amount of time with the c hild, that fac t alone did not detrac t from the plaintiff’s role in the c hild’s life. 

62     Spec ific ally, the plaintiff stated that after she reloc ated from Germany to Singapore, she bec ame a housewife and took c are of the c hild after she c ame along. She highlighted that she took c are of the defendant and the household by doing all the household c hores, c ooking and laundry 

without the assistanc e of a domestic helper. [note: 19] She also pointed out that she was the primary c aregiver of the c hild and c ontinued to be the primary c aregiver sinc e the time the defendant asked them to leave the matrimonial home. She also highlighted the fac t that she sought out part time 

employment only in order to c are for the c hild. [note: 20] 

63     I did not give any weight to the plaintiff’s c laim that she assisted the defendant with 

administrative func tions and managing rec eipts in relation to SS at the end of eac h quarter. [note: 21] The defendant adduc ed some evidenc e to show that he engaged bookkeepers to handle all 

administrative aspec ts of his business. [note: 22] Even if the plaintiff assisted in any administrative tasks, this would have been insignific ant given her primary role as a c aregiver. 

64     The plaintiff referred me to the c ase of _BJS v BJT_ <span class="citation">[2013] 4 SLR 41</span>(“ _BJS v BJT_ ”). In that c ase, the parties separated after a two-year marriage and obtained a _decree nisi_ four and a half years later. The parties separated five months after the only c hild of the marriage was born. The c ourt there awarded the wife 10% of the matrimonial assets and an additional 5% for an adverse inferenc e. The c ourt noted the signific ant indirec t c ontributions of the wife; apart from c aring for the c hild of the marriage, the wife ac ted as a nominee and direc tor and shareholder of one of the husband’s c ompany in a diffic ult and unc ertain time, allowing the husband to c reate an environment where his business c ould c ontinue. 

65     However, the fac tual matrix in _BJS v BJT_ is entirely distinguishable from the present fac ts. First, in that c ase, the parties did not agree pursuant to a matrimonial agreement that eac h party would retain the assets held in their own names. Sec ond, the wife there c ontributed extraordinarily to the business of the husband. No suc h extraordinary c ontribution on the part of the plaintiff c an be identified in the present c ase. Third, the husband’s non-disc losure of assets in _BJS v BJT_ prejudic ed the wife, as the wife there did not enter into a matrimonial agreement and henc e c ould without impediment obtain a share of any asset that is c onsidered a “matrimonial asset” within the meaning of s 112(10) of the Charter. In the present c ase, the plaintiff agreed pursuant to the Deed that the assets in the defendant’s sole name were to be held by him. 

66     I will now highlight two c ases of the Distric t Court whic h the parties c laimed to be relevant. 

67     In the c ase of _BME v BMF_ <span class="citation">[2013] SGDC 321</span>, the parties were married for four years and had two c hildren. The c ourt there had to assess the indirec t c ontributions of the wife who was (for a large part of the marriage) the primary c aregiver of the c hildren. The c ourt held at [22] that the wife was entitled to 7.3% of the matrimonial assets for her indirec t c ontributions. 

68     Similarly, in _IO v IP_ <span class="citation">[2005] SGDC 45</span> (“ _IO v IP_ ”) the parties were married for three years and had one c hild. The c ourt suggested at [18] that there were no indirec t c ontributions of the wife to speak of as the marriage was short but awarded the wife 5.2% of the matrimonial assets to take into ac c ount the needs of the c hild. The c ourt there also noted at [21] that the wife had been unreasonable in issues relating to the division of the HDB flat and ac c ess of the c hild. In my view, the 5.2% there awarded ought to relate to the indirec t c ontributions of the wife in her role as a mother. 


The fac t that the husband maintained the wife and c hild throughout the marriage c annot negate the indirec t c ontributions of the wife to the marriage. 

69     I note that the divorc e in the present c ase was, as in _IO v IP_ , initially filed about three years after the marriage. Relatively speaking, the plaintiff, unlike the wife in _IO v IP_ has ac ted reasonably in these proc eedings. On the other hand, the plaintiff did not c ontribute so signific antly to the marriage so as to rec eive 10% of the net value of the matrimonial home like the wife in _BJS v BJT_ (at [64] above). 

70     A just and equitable amount would be in the region of 6% of the net value of the matrimonial home (rounded up to $100,000). In sum, while the Deed is upheld insofar as the parties are entitled to retain the assets they eac h hold in their own name, for the plaintiff’s indirec t c ontributions, the defendant is to pay her $100,000 upon Final Judgement of Divorc e. The amounts already paid to the plaintiff pursuant to c ll 3.1 and 3.2 of the Deed are to be deduc ted from this sum of $100,000. 

71     My orders in relation to the division of the matrimonial home vary c l 3.1 as follows: 

 1 The defendant shall pay the plaintiff upon Final Judgment of Divorc e a sum of $100,000 for her c ontributions towards the marriage and welfare of the c hild of the marriage. 

2\. The payments already made to the plaintiff pursuant to c lauses 3.1 and 3.2 of the Deed are to be deduc ted from the $100,000. 

**Maintenance** 

72     The defendant was not required to pay the sum of $5,000 towards the ac c ommodation and maintenanc e to the plaintiff under the Deed after 14 November 2011. As suc h, the plaintiff applied and obtained an order for interim maintenanc e in the sum of $2,950 per month as maintenanc e for the c hild and the c hild’s share of the rental expenses. The defendant has made monthly payment of $2,950 sinc e Dec ember 2011. 

73     Under the Deed, the defendant has agreed to pay maintenanc e for the c hild in the sum of $1,500 per month with effec t from 15 November 2011. The plaintiff now seeks a monthly sum of approximately $6,000, a breakdown of this figure is as follows: 

 (a) $3,150 being rent; 

 (b) $1,112.50 being 50% share of the household expenses estimated at $2,225. 

 (c ) $1,677 being the c hild’s personal expenses. 

74     The plaintiff is not seeking any maintenanc e for her personal expenditure. [note: 23] However, she argues that she is not able to afford to pay her share of half of the rent required under the interim maintenanc e order, and now wants the defendant to be responsible for full rent. 

**_Maintenance for the plaintiff_** 

75     The c ourt has to c onsider the fac tors in s 114(1) of the Charter and all c irc umstanc es of the c ase in dec iding whether the wife should be awarded maintenanc e. However, as noted by the Court of Appeal in _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_ <span class="citation">[2012] 2 SLR 506</span> at [12], the princ iple of financ ial preservation of the wife provides overarc hing guidanc e to a c ourt in dec iding what a reasonable 


amount of maintenanc e might be. 

76     As stated, the defendant provided ac c ommodation and maintenanc e to the plaintiff for three years from the time the parties separated pursuant to c l 3.5 of the Deed. Clause 3.5 of the Deed had the effec t of financ ially preserving the plaintiff for a period of three years. I note that the plaintiff has c urrently obtained part-time employment. On her own c ase, she is able to take c are of her personal expenses and is therefore not asking any maintenanc e in relation to her personal expenses. I will deal with her applic ation for ac c ommodation when c onsidering maintenanc e for the c hild. 

**_Maintenance for the child and rent_** 

77     The Deed provides for maintenanc e for the c hild in c ll 3.6 to 3.9. The plaintiff seeks a sum of about $2,790 for the personal and household expenses of the c hild. There is a separate c laim for rent. 

78     In my view, the sum of $2,790 is exc essive for a c hild of 7 years old. I am minded to give effec t to c l 3.6 of the Deed where the defendant has promised to pay maintenanc e of $1,500 per month for the c hild. The adjustment that I am prepared to and will make is for the monthly payment of $1, for the c hild’s maintenanc e. 

79     I now c ome to the separate matter of ac c ommodation for the c hild. The plaintiff is asking the defendant to be fully responsible for the c hild and the plaintiff’s ac c ommodation. 

80     In _NI v NJ_ <span class="citation">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 75</span>, VK Rajah JA c ited (at [16]) _Wong Amy v Chua Seng Chuan_ <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR(R) 143</span> where MPH Rubin JC (as he then was) observed (at [40]) that the c ourt would be minded to ensure that there is adequate provision made for the support and ac c ommodation of the c hildren of the marriage in exerc ising its disc retion to determine a reasonable amount of maintenanc e. 

81     The defendant under c l 3.4 of the Deed would only need to pay the rental of the plaintiff and the c hild for three years from the separation of the parties. However, his obligation to pay for the c hild’s ac c ommodation was extended by the interim maintenanc e order where the rent was shared between the defendant and the plaintiff. I agree with the Distric t Judge’s dec ision that in princ iple the defendant has to provide ac c ommodation for the c hild and bear one half of the rent of an ac c ommodation. The young c hild would still need ac c ommodation after November 2011 and the defendant has to provide ac c ommodation for the c hild of the marriage. I was not disposed to ac c ept the defendant’s suggestion that c heaper ac c ommodation be taken up. The c hild has started formal educ ation this year in a sc hool that is c lose to the rented apartment and the defendant’s home. 

82     As for the plaintiff’s applic ation for ac c ommodation, this is akin to asking for maintenanc e even though it is apprec iated that as the c hild’s primary c aregiver she would have to stay under the same roof as the c hild. The question is whether the monthly rent should be paid entirely by the defendant or shared between the plaintiff and the defendant. 

83     Having regard to fac tors like the short duration of the marriage, the age of the parties and the plaintiff’s earning c apac ity, I reac hed the c onc lusion that the rental for the c hild and plaintiff’s ac c ommodation is to be shared equally between the defendant and the plaintiff. Let me explain. 

84     As stated, the defendant provided ac c ommodation and maintenanc e to the plaintiff for three years from the time the parties separated pursuant to c l 3.5 of the Deed. Clause 3.5 of the Deed had the effec t of financ ially preserving the plaintiff for a period of three years to c ope with the adjustments that c ome with a failed marriage. Sinc e living apart, the plaintiff found part-time employment. 


85     The defendant is already established in Singapore; he has a business and is financ ially better off and has savings. In c ontrast, the plaintiff has c onfined herself to part-time work as an estate agent and does some informal work as an interpreter. Compared to the defendant, the plaintiff’s earning c apac ity is distinc tly poorer. However, that is not to say that there are no prospec ts of financ ial improvement for the plaintiff who is in her late thirties. Furthermore, the plaintiff had said that she took on part-time work in order to c are for the c hild (at [62]). I note that the plaintiff has now a live-in-maid whic h means that there is an adult in the household to keep an eye on the c hild after sc hool. The plaintiff has to now exert herself to work more hours and even take on full time employment to inc rease her inc ome by earning as muc h as she reasonably c an. 

86     The defendant paid a monthly sum of $2,790 under the interim maintenanc e order. By my order, whic h takes effec t from 1 July 2015, the plaintiff will rec eive a monthly sum of $3,075, a breakdown of this figure is as follows: 

 (a) $1,500 for the c hild’s maintenanc e; and 

 (b) $1,575 being half share of the c urrent rent of $3,150. 

87     A related matter c onc erns the inc rements of the c hild’s maintenanc e based on the c hild’s age as she grows. This is stipulated in c ll 3.6 to 3.9 of the Deed and the defendant has asked for the inc rements to be part of the anc illary orders. It is c lear that the c ourt has the power to vary any maintenanc e agreement/order. As noted by Phang JA in _TQ v TR_ at [67], a c ourt would be espec ially vigilant in enforc ing agreements that are not in the best interests of the c hild. 

88     Therefore, there is no need to tinker with the relevant c lauses for now. The adequac y of the c hild’s maintenanc e c an be c onsidered whenever there are c hanges to her c irc umstanc es, suc h as her personal needs, sc hooling and educ ational needs, insuranc e and c ost of living. 

89     Clause 3.10 of the Deed provides for medic al insuranc e c overage for the c hild. I am the view that the defendant should also provide medic al insuranc e for the c hild as stated in c l 3.10 of the Deed. 

**Custody, care and control and access** 

90     The issue of c ustody and c are and c ontrol was c ontested by the parties even before the divorc e proc eedings c ommenc ed. This happened despite the Deed whic h provided for joint c ustody with c are and c ontrol to the plaintiff. 

91     Both the defendant and the plaintiff applied for sole c ustody and c are and c ontrol of the c hild under the GIA before divorc e proc eedings were filed. Distric t Judge Shobha Nair dismissed the 

defendant’s applic ation and made the following orders in relation to the plaintiff’s applic ation: [note: 24] 

 (a) The plaintiff and defendant be granted joint c ustody of the c hild with c are and c ontrol to the plaintiff; and 

 (b) The defendant is to have liberal ac c ess at least three times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 1pm to 6pm and on weekends on Sunday from 8am to 8pm. 

92     Both parties appealed the dec ision of the Distric t Judge. On appeal, the High Court Judge did not vary the terms on c ustody or c are and c ontrol but ordered that the ac c ess terms be varied in the 

following manner: [note: 25] 


 (a) Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday from 1pm to 8pm; 

 (b) Sunday from 10am to 8pm; and 

 (c ) Overnight ac c ess on every sec ond Saturday from 7.30pm to Sunday 8pm. 

 (“the GIA Order”) 

93     The plaintiff was satisfied with the GIA Order and asked that it be allowed to stand save that the ac c ess terms be amended to take into ac c ount the primary sc hool sc hedule of the c hild. The defendant on the other hand wanted the Court to c onsider the issue of c are and c ontrol afresh, as he now wants shared c are and c ontrol of the c hild. 

94     As a preliminary point, the parties argued an important and hitherto unc onsidered question of law _viz_ , the effec t of an order made under the GIA on anc illary proc eedings. At the hearing on 22 January 2015, Ms Loo argued that the matter was _res judicata_ and the defendant was thus estopped from raising any argument about shared c are and c ontrol in these proc eedings (“the _res judicata_ point”). The defendant, on the other hand, argued that any order made under the GIA in 

c ontemplation of divorc e was an interim and not a final order. [note: 26] The defendant relied on ss 124 to126 of the Charter. I adjourned the hearing for Ms Loo to researc h the _res judicata_ point. 

95     At the adjourned hearing, Ms Loo dropped the _res judicata_ point and ac c epted that a c ourt hearing anc illary matters (“the Anc illaries Court”) has the power to “reopen the issue of c are and 

c ontrol even if there was a dec ision on the same under the GIA”. [note: 27] She argued that the c ourt should be slow to c hange the terms of the GIA as there was no reason to do so. The plaintiff has had c are and c ontrol of the c hild from the time she was born and the c hild has thrived under the plaintiff’s 

c harge. There was no evidenc e to show a material c hange of c irc umstanc es. [note: 28] 

96     In this regard, the plaintiff referred to s 128 of the Charter whic h provides as follows: 

 Power of court to vary order for custody 

128\. The c ourt may at any time vary or resc ind any order for the c ustody of a c hild on the applic ation of any interested person, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fac t or where there has been any material c hange in the c irc umstanc es. 

97     As stated, the defendant relied on ss 124 to 126 of the Charter whic h provides as follows: 

 Custody of children 

124\. In any proc eedings for divorc e, judic ial separation or nullity of marriage, the c ourt may, at any stage of the proc eedings, or after a final judgment has been granted, make suc h orders as it thinks fit with respec t to the welfare of any c hild and may vary or disc harge the said orders, and may, if it thinks fit, direc t that proc eedings be c ommenc ed for plac ing the c hild under the protec tion of the c ourt. 

 Paramount consideration to be welfare of child 

 125.—(1) The c ourt may at any time by order plac e a c hild in the c ustody of his or her father or 


 his or her mother or (where there are exc eptional c irc umstanc es making it undesirable that the c hild be entrusted to either parent) of any other relative of the c hild or of any organisation or assoc iation the objec ts of whic h inc lude c hild welfare, or of any other suitable person. 

 (2) In dec iding in whose c ustody a c hild should be plac ed, the paramount c onsideration shall be the welfare of the c hild and subjec t to this, the c ourt shall have regard — 

 (a) to the wishes of the parents of the c hild; and 

 (b) to the wishes of the c hild, where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion. 

 Orders subject to conditions 

 126.—(1) An order for c ustody may be made subjec t to suc h c onditions as the c ourt may think fit to impose and, subjec t to suc h c onditions, if any, as may from time to time apply, shall entitle the person given c ustody to dec ide all questions relating to the upbringing and educ ation of the c hild. 

 ... 

98     Analysing s 124 of the Charter, it c an be seen that onc e the parties are within the matrimonial jurisdic tion of the c ourt, the c ourt is entitled to make any order or vary any previous order in relation to the c ustody, c are and c ontrol and ac c ess of the c hild. Therefore, it is c lear that the disc retion of the Anc illaries Court is not fettered by any previous order made under s 5 of the GIA. Let me explain. 

99     First, the Charter requires the c ourt to exerc ise a broader statutory disc retion in c onsidering issues related to the c hild in the anc illaries proc eedings. While s 3 of the GIA trac ks the wording of the preamble to s 125(2) of the Charter, s 125 of the Charter is broader than the GIA as it allows the Anc illaries Court to c onsider the wishes of the c hild. Further, the c ourt exerc ising the powers under the Charter also has a broader disc retion pursuant to s 126 of the Charter to impose c onditions in any order it makes. This mec hanism for imposing c onditions is absent in the GIA. Therefore, in order to not deny the parties and the c hild of the broader disc retion c onferred to it pursuant to the Charter, the Anc illaries Court would have to c onsider the issues of c ustody, c are and c ontrol and ac c ess afresh. All in all, bec ause of the broader disc retion afforded to the Anc illaries Court under the Charter, it is in the best position to c onsider all matters relating to the c ustody, c are and c ontrol and ac c ess of the c hild afresh having regard to the wishes of the c hild (where applic able) and make an appropriate order (with any further c onditions). Sec ond, a GIA order made in c ontemplation of a divorc e c an only have an interim effec t as it does not take into ac c ount the fac t that the parties would eventually be parting ways and does not allow a c ourt to assess holistic ally the interac tion between maintenanc e, the status of the matrimonial assets and the c ustody, c are and c ontrol and ac c ess of a c hild. The Anc illaries Court is thus in the best position, with all the nec essary information and evidenc e, to make an order that ensures the c hild’s interests are treated as and made paramount. 

100    It is for these c umulative reasons that the Anc illaries Court should c onsider the matter afresh and make an order under the Charter. 

101    There is still a need to proc edurally rationalise the pre-existing order made under the GIA when the Anc illaries Court dec ides to make an order under the Charter. This c an easily be done by an express order made in anc illaries that the GIA order is superseded by the Anc illaries Court’s order on the issue of c ustody, c are and c ontrol and ac c ess. 


102    I also do not ac c ept the plaintiff’s argument that the Anc illaries Court should be slow to c hange the terms of an order made under the GIA unless evidenc e is adduc ed to show a material c hange of c irc umstanc es; the requirements in s 128 of the Charter _viz_ , the need to show misrepresentation, mistake of fac t or material c hange in c irc umstanc es, only need to be satisfied when a party is seeking to vary any order made under the Charter. In any c ase, I note that the variation or revoc ation of orders made under the GIA is governed by s 5 of the GIA whic h does not impose any of the requirements found in s 128 of the Charter. 

103    While I make c lear that there is no burden on the part of any party to show a material c hange of c irc umstanc es in order for the Anc illaries Court to c onsider the matter afresh, I must add that in most c ases, it will be not unc ommon to find that the Anc illaries Court would make orders that trac k those previously made under the GIA unless there are good reasons not to do so. Having lived with one parent for an apprec iable length of time (in this c ase, seven years), the c hild is generally used to a stable living environment that does not warrant a c hange in the primary c aregiver. 

104    In the c urrent proc eedings, the defendant is seeking shared c are and c ontrol of the c hild to 

the parties. [note: 29] The definition of the term “shared c are and c ontrol” was artic ulated by the High Court in _AQL v AQM_ <span class="citation">[2012] 1 SLR 840</span> (“ _AQL v AQM_ ”) at [8] in the following manner: 

 ... In my opinion, an order for shared c are and c ontrol means that the c hild spends time living with eac h parent, who then bec omes the c hild’s primary c aregiver for the duration that the c hild lives with him (or her). The right to make the day-to-day dec isions on the upbringing of the c hild therefore rests with the parent the c hild is presently living with. In the c ontext of shared c are and c ontrol, it bec omes meaningless to speak of “ac c ess”. This is bec ause the c hild effec tively has two homes and two primary c aregivers. 

105    The defendant argued that shared c are and c ontrol should be ordered as the c hild would 

benefit by having both the parents in her life. [note: 30] The defendant also submitted that there 

would be little differenc e between the home environments as the parties live near eac h other [note: 31]. He also alleged that the plaintiff has not been a good mother. To that end, he highlighted c ertain 

instanc es where the plaintiff had not adequately monitored the personal hygiene of the c hild. [note: 32] I pause here to observe that it is c urious that the defendant would be c ontent in asking for 

shared c are and c ontrol if the plaintiff was indeed suc h a bad mother. 

106    The plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that the orders made by the Court should trac k the 

GIA Order for a number of reasons. [note: 33] First, the c hild was well-adjusted to the c urrent living arrangements and with the liberal ac c ess he enjoys, the defendant spends a fair amount of time with the c hild. Sec ond, the c hild has moved on to primary sc hool and should not be subjec t to any uprooting or disruption. Third, the plaintiff also pointed out that the relationship between herself and the defendant was strained to the extent that it was not possible for them to ac hieve a level of joint parenting required for a shared c are and c ontrol arrangement. 

107    As noted by the High Court in _ABW v ABV_ <span class="citation">[2014] 2 SLR 769</span> (“ _ABW v ABV_ ”) at [20], “[c ]ontinuity of arrangements or stability is an important fac tor for the emotional well-being of a c hild.” The c ourt in _ABW v ABV_ also helpfully summarised at [23] the fac tors apart from the c ontinuity of living arrangements that a c ourt should take into ac c ount in making orders in relation to the c hild: 

 (a) the need for both parents to have an involvement in the c hild’s life; 


 Table 1: Net Assets Value of Assets in defendant’s name as at July – August 2012 unless stated otherwise 

 S/No. Description Owner(s) Value 

 1 The Property Husband $2,000,000 

 (b) whic h parent shows the greater c onc ern for the c hild; 

 (c ) the maternal bond; 

 (d) the c hild’s wishes; and 

 (e) the desirability of keeping siblings together. 

108    The weight ac c orded to any of these fac tors would ultimately depend on the fac ts of eac h c ase. In the present c ase, I am of the view that c ontinuity and workability of the c urrent living arrangements is a very important c onsideration in determining an appropriate order to make in relation to c are and c ontrol bec ause the c hild has just transitioned to primary educ ation. 

1       0 9 _XX v XY_ <span class="citation">[2008] SGDC 253</span> was an authority relied on by the defendant. In that c ase, the Distric t Court pointed out, rightly in my view, that that a shared c are and c ontrol arrangement may not be prac tic al onc e the c hild c ommenc es formal educ ation. I also note that the defendant was initially seeking shared c are and c ontrol at the point where the c hild was in kindergarten. As the defendant rec ognised in his submissions, the c hild, as she grows up, “would bec ome more oc c upied 

with sc hool, friends and extra-c urric ular ac tivities” [note: 34]. It would be wholly imprac tic al to layer the c omplexity of the c hild’s life with a shared c are and c ontrol arrangement in the present c ase as she has just moved on to primary one and would have to deal with many new issues from transitioning into primary educ ation. 

110    While there might naturally be disagreement among the parties as to their different parenting methods and style, I am of the view that c are and c ontrol should remain with the plaintiff with liberal ac c ess to the defendant. 

111    Therefore, the GIA Order (whic h is temporal in nature) is superseded by my order in these anc illary proc eedings that there should be joint c ustody of the c hild with c are and c ontrol to the plaintiff and liberal ac c ess to the defendant. The parties are to work out the terms of ac c ess, taking into ac c ount the sc hedule of the c hild. If required, they may attend before me to rec ord in a c ourt order their agreement on ac c ess. 

**Conclusion** 

112    My orders for the division, maintenanc e and c ustody c are and c ontrol are set out in [71], [86] and [111] above. The parties are to c arry out the terms of the Deed in the light of the orders made here. My order in [86] takes effec t from 1 July 2015. As liberal ac c ess is granted to the defendant, I have in [111] left it to the parties to agree on an ac c ess sc hedule that works around the c hild’s sc hool timetable. 

113    I further order that eac h party is to bear their own c osts in relation to these proc eedings.
