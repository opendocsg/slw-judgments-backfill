Lai Siu Chiu J 

1       The plaintiff Reindeer Developments Inc. is the owner of a flat situated at No 11 Ardmore Park #05-01, Singapore 259957 (“the property”) while the defendant Mindpower Innovations Pte Ltd was the party who was allegedly given an option on or about 6 February 2007 (“the Option”) to purc hase the property at the pric e of $6.3m (“the offer pric e”). The sale to the defendant was aborted by the plaintiff and the defendant responded by lodging a c aveat no. IA/602678N (“the Caveat”) on 13 February 2007 against the title of the property. 

2       The plaintiff filed the above originating summons (“the plaintiff’s applic ation”) praying _inter alia_ for an order that the defendant remove the Caveat and for a dec laration that the defendant had not been granted a valid and enforc eable option to purc hase the property. I dismissed the plaintiff’s applic ation and the plaintiff has filed a notic e of appeal (in Civil Appeal No. 98 of 2007) against my dec ision. 

**The facts** 

3       The fac ts hereinafter set out are extrac ted from the affidavits filed by the parties. The plaintiff filed six affidavits with two by its direc tor c um shareholder Lana Yuen Shiu Kinoshita (“Yuen”) and the remaining four by its solic itor Madan Assomull (“Assomull”) while the defendant filed three affidavits of whic h two were by its business c onsultant Lek Kee Meng (“Lek”) who was its representative in the transac tion. 

4       In her first affidavit, Yuen desc ribed the defendant as an intending purc haser who had made an 


offer to purc hase the property at the offer pric e. At the material time, Yuen (who resides in Hong Kong) had appointed Homelodge Realty Consultants (“Homelodge”) as her marketing agents in partic ular its sole -proprietor Tey Song Kiem (“Tey”) while Pauline Chen & Co (“the law firm”) were her solic itors who were to ac t for her in the sale. 

5       Yuen deposed that Homelodge and the defendant entered into negotiations on the terms of the proposed sale and a draft option was prepared by Homelodge (whic h she exhibited to her first affidavit). On or about 5 February 2007, the defendant issued a c heque in the plaintiff’s favour in the sum of $63,000 (“the option money”) being the 1% option fee based on the offer pric e. She c laimed that as the parties failed to reac h an agreement on the terms of the intended sale and purc hase, no option was granted to the defendant and on 15 February 2007, she instruc ted Assomull to return the option money to the defendant whic h he did, by forwarding the law firm’s c heque for the option money to the defendant’s solic itors. 

6       Notwithstanding her return of the option money, Yuen c omplained that the defendant had failed and or refused to withdraw the Caveat that it had lodged against the property on 14 February 2007, despite a letter from her solic itor on 23 February 2007 to the defendant’s solic itors that the Caveat had been wrongly lodged. 

7       In Lek’s first affidavit, the defendant gave an entirely different ac c ount of events from Yuen’s version. Lek deposed that at end January or early February 2007, he had represented the defendant in its purc hase of two properties at Ardmore Park. The agent who brokered the sales was Tey. In the c ourse of c onversation, Lek understood from Tey that she (Tey) was also marketing the property with $6m being the plaintiff’s asking pric e (“the asking pric e”). 

8       A few days later, Tey told Lek that she had sec ured the property for the defendant at the asking pric e. On 5 February 2007 however, Tey informed Lek that the plaintiff wanted a higher purc hase pric e from the defendant than the asking pric e; she inquired if the defendant was willing to meet the offer pric e as that was what the plaintiff wanted. 

9       Lek felt that even at the offer pric e, the purc hase of the property was still a good investment due to the rising property market. After seeking and obtaining the permission of the defendant’s managing direc tor, he informed Tey that he agreed to and ac c epted the offer pric e on the defendant’s behalf. 

10     After disc ussions, Lek deposed that he and Tey agreed on the following terms of sale for the property: 

 (a) the purc hase pric e would be $6.3m; 

 (b) the option fee would be 1%; 

 (c ) the option period would be 2 weeks; 

 (d) a further 4% of the purc hase pric e would be paid on the exerc ise of the option: 

 (e) c ompletion of the sale would be 10 weeks from the exerc ise of the option; 

 (f) the property would be sold subjec t to existing tenanc y; 

 (g) the option would be issued to the defendant and/or its nominee. 


Tey informed Lek that the solic itor Pauline Chen (“Pauline”) of the law firm had seen and approved the same terms as set out above in an earlier option prepared for the plaintiff and Yuen had agreed to the same. 

11     Consequently, on the afternoon of 5 February 2007, Lek handed to Tey a c heque for the option money; he had written on the reverse of the c heque the terns set out in (b), (c ), (d) and (e) above. On the same evening, Tey telephoned Lek to c onfirm that Tey had obtained Yuen’s c onsent to the sale of the property on the terms set out in [10] and that Tey had handed the defendant’s c heque for the option money to the law firm. 

12     Tey subsequently informed Lek that the defendant’s c heque had been c leared. (Bank statements produc ed by the defendant showed its c heque was c leared on 6 February 2007). On 6 February 2007, Tey informed Lek she had prepared the Option and that the doc ument had been c ouriered to Hong Kong for signature by Yuen. He was advised by Tey on 9 February 2007 that the Option had arrived in Hong Kong but Tey c ould not c onfirm that the doc ument had been signed as Yuen was not in Hong Kong. 

13     On 13 February 2007, Lek telephoned Tey as he was c onc erned the Option was still not given to the defendant although it had paid the option money. He then learnt that Pauline had c alled Tey earlier to say that Yuen wanted to refund the option money to the defendant. Lek asked Tey to obtain an explanation from Pauline. At the same time, he instruc ted the defendant’s solic itors to demand that the plaintiff exec ute the Option immediately and also to lodge a c aveat against the title to the property whic h they did. 

14     Lek asserted that as the defendant’s c heque for the option money had been presented for payment and c leared, a valid and binding agreement had been made on 5 February 2007 for the plaintiff to issue the Option and the defendant was able, willing and ready to exerc ise the Option. 

15     Tey filed an affidavit in support of the defendant. She c orroborated Lek’s affidavit in all material respec ts. Tey further deposed in her affidavit that she had been the plaintiff’s property agent for more than ten years. The property was initially bought from the developers in the name of Yuen who subsequently transferred the title to the plaintiff. Sinc e its purc hase, the property had been rented out under Tey’s management and she liaised solely with Yuen who was the plaintiff’s representative. Tey would also meet Pauline to ensure all nec essary paperwork was prepared for Yuen’s exec ution. Tey said the arrangement was that all legal doc uments would be vetted by Pauline and if Pauline approved, the doc uments would likewise be ac c epted by Yuen. 

16     Tey deposed that Yuen had in fac t wanted to sell the property in or around April 2006 but bec ause Tey managed to find her a good tenant, Yuen c hanged her mind. Around 20 January 2007, Yuen telephoned Tey to inform Tey that Yuen had rec eived an offer for the property at the asking pric e ($6m) from another property agent. Tey advised Yuen that as property pric es were rising, Yuen should not be too hasty to sell. Tey inquired and was told by Yuen that she had not ac c epted the offer at the asking pric e. 

17     As Yuen seemed keen to sell, Tey dec ided to sec ure buyers for the property. About a week later, Tey found a Korean buyer who offered the asking pric e and handed a c heque for $60,000 as the 1% option fee to Tey. Not being able to c ontac t Yuen in Hong Kong, Tey spoke to Pauline. As Pauline was aware that Yuen had rec eived an offer at the asking pric e, Pauline advised Tey to prepare whic h she did, an option to sell the property at $6m. 

18     Tey faxed the draft option to the law firm on 30 January 2007 for Pauline’s approval. The 


following day, she was told by Pauline that the draft was in order. Tey then c ouriered the option to Hong Kong. 

19     However, when Tey c ontac ted Yuen in Hong Kong on 4 February 2007, she was told that Yuen was no longer prepared to sell the property at the asking pric e (even though the option in favour of the Korean buyer had been c ouriered to her and Tey was holding the Korean buyer’s c heque for the 1% option fee). Yuen informed Tey she had rec eived the offer pric e from another buyer and would be willing to sell the property to the Korean buyer if the latter paid the offer pric e. 

20     Although Tey had informed Yuen that the Korean buyer was unlikely to agree to the offer pric e, Tey nonetheless c onveyed Yuen’s offer to the Korean buyer. The Korean buyer was unwilling to pay the offer pric e so Tey returned the Korean buyer’s c heque for $60,000. 

21     It was thereafter that Lek c ame into the pic ture on the defendant’s behalf. Tey c orroborated the c ontents of Lek’s affidavit as set out in [7] to [8], [10] to [13] above. Tey further deposed that on 5 February 2007, she had c alled on the law firm after rec eiving from Lek the defendant’s c heque for the option money. To save time, Tey telephoned Yuen from the law firm to c onfirm she (Tey) had sec ured a buyer for the property at the offer pric e and had a c heque for the option fee. She passed the telephone to Pauline who, in Tey’s presenc e, inquired of Yuen whether she (Yuen) wanted to sell the property at the offer pric e on terms similar to those set out in the option Tey had prepared for the Korean buyer. Yuen c onfirmed she did and that she would proc eed with the sale to the defendant. Pauline further inquired of Yuen if she wanted Pauline to ac c ept and bank-in the defendant’s c heque; Yuen gave her c onfirmation again. 

22     After her telephone c onversation with Yuen, Pauline repeated Yuen’s instruc tion to Tey who then handed over the defendant’s c heque to Pauline. Tey was told to amend the draft option Tey had prepared for the Korean buyer to reflec t the defendant as the buyer as well as the c onsideration at the offer pric e. Tey c arried out Pauline’s instruc tions and that same evening she faxed to the law firm the draft of the Option. Tey was subsequently informed by Pauline that the defendant’s c heque had been c leared. 

23     On 6 February 2007 Tey c ouriered the Option to Hong Kong. That same morning, Pauline telephoned Tey to say Yuen had wanted to stop the defendant’s c heque. Pauline told Tey she had advised Yuen it was too late – the defendant’s c heque had been presented for payment, it had been c leared and the deal was done. 

24     Thinking that Yuen would proc eed with the sale to the defendant in view of what Pauline had said, Tey dec ided to wait for Yuen to return the duly exec uted Option. 

25     On Friday 9 January 2007 Tey tried to but c ould not c ontac t Yuen at her residenc e as the latter had left Hong Kong the previous day. Tey informed Lek ac c ordingly. 

26     Tey was surprised when Pauline informed her on 13 February 2007 that Yuen had instruc ted Pauline to refund the option money to the defendant. Tey was asked to c ollec t the c heque from the law firm. When this turn of events was c onveyed to Lek after he c alled Tey to find out the status quo, Lek was unhappy and wanted an explanation. 

27     Tey then c ontac ted Pauline to find out why Yuen had c hanged her mind. Pauline informed Tey that Yuen had been advised by another housing agent not to ac c ept the defendant’s offer. Tey was further told that Yuen had expressed unhappiness over two terms in the Option _viz_ (i) the fac t that the Option was issued to the defendant ‘and/or nominee’ and (ii) that the deposit payable was only 


5% and not 10% of the offer pric e. Tey understood from Pauline that she had explained to Yuen the two provisions were c ommon in private property deals. 

28     Tey herself c ontac ted Yuen a few days later to inquire why the latter had dec ided against selling the property to the defendant. Yuen explained she had fully intended to sign the Option whic h she rec eived late on 7 February 2007. However, on the following day when she flew to Taipei, Yuen met some property agents at an exhibition there of Singapore properties and they told her property pric es were on the rise. Henc e, she c hanged her mind. 

29     Tey c onc luded her affidavit by saying that although she stood to gain financ ially had the sale to the defendant proc eeded, she was deposing to the truth. 

30     In reply, Yuen’s sec ond affidavit merely c ontended that the defendant did not have a valid and/or enforc eable option to purc hase the property. She denied that the defendant’s c heque for the option money was evidenc e of the existenc e of a valid option to sell the property as well as the allegations made in the affidavits of the defendant. Yuen dismissed the c onversations set out in the affidavits of Lek and Tey as of “no relevanc e” and deposed that in any c ase the plaintiff was not admitting to the same. 

31     On 29 May 2007, the defendant filed summons no. 2344 of 2007 (“the defendant’s applic ation”) for an order to c onvert the plaintiff’s applic ation into a writ. 

32     In his (sec ond) affidavit filed in support of the defendant’s applic ation, Lek deposed that as there were disputes of fac ts whic h c ould not be resolved without c ross-examination of key witnesses _viz_ himself, Tey, Yuen and Pauline, it was nec essary to c onvert the plaintiff’s applic ation into a writ ac tion. He pointed out a glaring omission in Yuen’s affidavits. If as Yuen c ontended, she did not agree to the terms of the Option that Tey prepared for her to issue to the defendant, Yuen had failed to explain why she instruc ted the law firm to ac c ept and bank-in the defendant’s c heque for the option money. He noted that Yuen did not admit to the various c onversations set out in his and in Tey’s affidavits. That only made c ross-examination even more nec essary to determine the verac ity of the allegations made by Lek and Tey in order to resolve the issue of whether a valid option had been agreed to be issued by Yuen to the defendant albeit not exec uted. 

33     As I said earlier at [3], c ounsel for the plaintiff filed four affidavits on its behalf. In his third affidavit (para 4), Assomull responded to Lek’s sec ond affidavit with the c omment that the plaintiff’s applic ation was a straightforward c ase and there were no material dispute of fac ts whic h nec essitated the same being c onverted into a writ. He deposed that as the terms of the draft option were not settled, there was no option and/or agreement for the sale of the property within s 6(d) of the Civil Law Ac t (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the CLA”). Counsel added that the fac t the plaintiff c redited the defendant’s c heque for the option money did not c onfer any rights in the property on the defendant nor was it a waiver on the part of the plaintiff (whic h c omment I did not understand). 

34     In the fourth affidavit he filed on the plaintiff’s behalf, Assomull exhibited his exc hange of c orrespondenc e with the offic e of the Offic ial Assignee (“the OA”), having disc overed that Lek was adjudged a bankrupt on 18 June 2001. Assomull informed the OA that Lek had affirmed affidavits on behalf of the defendant in these proc eedings and inquired whether Lek had been given permission by the OA’s offic e to be involved in the management of the defendant, c iting s 148 of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). The OA replied that its rec ords showed that Lek was employed as a business c onsultant with the defendant, as per his affidavits. 

**_The arguments_** 


35     The plaintiff submitted that the defendant did not have a c aveatable interest based on its ground of c laim in the Caveat as an intending purc haser _viz_ “arising from payment of the option fee and ac c eptanc e of the option fee by the registered proprietor”. Relying on _Sim Kwang Mui Ivy v Goh Peng Khim_ <span class="citation">[1995] 1 SLR 186</span>, Assomull submitted that there was no valid option. He added that payment (of the option money) _per se_ with ac c eptanc e was no justific ation for lodgement of the Caveat. Moreover, no affidavit had been filed by any direc tor or sec retary or manager of the defendant but only by Lek who was indirec tly partic ipating in the management of the defendant and thereby c ontravened s 148(1) of the Companies Ac t as well as s 131 of the Bankruptc y Ac t (Cap 20, 2000 Rev Ed), c iting _Asia Commercial Finance (M) Bhd v Pasadena Properties Development Sdn Bhd_ [1991] 1 MLJ 111. Consequently, the Caveat must be removed. 

36     Counsel for the defendant (Mr Kumar) on the other hand submitted that the plaintiff’s arguments were misc onc eived. This c ase was different from the fac ts in _Sim Kwang Mui Ivy v Goh Peng Khim_. There, Kan Ting Chiu J found against the c aveator/defendant bec ause no option money was paid, only ‘earnest money’. In this c ase, the defendant had paid the full option money, the terms of the Option were agreed between the parties’ agents (Tey for the plaintiff and Lek for the defendant) and the Option was c ouriered to Yuen in Hong Kong on the basis she would exec ute the doc ument on the plaintiff’s behalf in exc hange for the option money whic h had been ac c epted by the law firm and whic h c heque of the defendant in payment thereof was c leared. 

37     Mr Kumar pointed out that although Yuen denied the fac ts as given by Lek and her own agent Tey, she had failed to give her own version of events. It was even more signific ant that nowhere in her affidavits did Yuen dispute that Pauline had her authority to bank-in the defendant’s c heque for the option money. Indeed, Yuen’s first affidavit filed in support of the plaintiff’s applic ation c ompletely omitted mention of her ac c eptanc e of the defendant’s c heque. It was not for Assomull as the plaintiff’s solic itor to make the statement he did in para 10 of his third affidavit (at [33] above). How would he know why Yuen ac c epted the defendant’s c heque? It was Yuen who should but had failed to, explain. 

38     Mr Kumar added that c ontrary to the submissions tendered by the plaintiff, there was nothing wrong in Lek, even as a bankrupt, from affirming affidavits on the defendant’s behalf. Where was the evidenc e from the plaintiff that he was involved in the management of the defendant and had c ontravened s 148 of the Companies Ac t and s 131 of the Bankruptc y Ac t? Lek filed affidavits for the defendant bec ause he had direc t knowledge of matters; there was no legal prohibition against him doing so and Lek had the express approval of the defendant’s managing-direc tor (see para 9 of his first affidavit) to proc eed with the purc hase of the property. 

39     Finally, even if the Caveat was set aside, Mr Kumar reminded the c ourt that the defendant had a c ounterc laim against the plaintiff, as set out in para 26 of Lek’s first affidavit – the defendant had asked for a dec laration that the parties had entered into a valid and binding option on 5 February 

2007\. Consequently, the defendant was entitled to file the Caveat. 

**_The decision_** 

40     I disagreed with the submission of Assomull and the affidavit ( _supra_ [33]) he deposed to the effec t that this was a straightforward c ase without material disputes of fac ts. On the c ontrary, the fac ts involved were highly c ontentious and the only way to determine who was telling the truth was to have Lek, Tey and Yuen c ross-examined on their affidavits, whic h was the order I made when I refused to grant the plaintiff’s applic ation. 

41     I had pointed out to Assomull that had Yuen been in Singapore at the time the defendant’s 


c heque for the option money was handed over to the law firm, the plaintiff would have had to deliver to the defendant the exec uted Option in exc hange thereof. In suc h a sc enario whic h is c ommon to c onveyanc ing prac tic e in Singapore, the plaintiff would not on or after 6 February 2007, have been able to c hange her mind on selling the property to the defendant at the offer pric e. The plaintiff would instead have been bound by the terms of the Option. I saw no differenc e between suc h a sc enario and what transpired in this c ase, merely bec ause the vendor’s representative (Yuen) was not in Singapore to exec ute the Option on the plaintiff’s behalf. Equity looks on that as done whic h 

ought to be done (see _Snell’s Equity_ 31 st edition p 107 para 5-25). 

42     I turn now to the relevant legislation. Sec tion 115(1) of the Land Titles Ac t (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) states “Any person c laiming an interest in land...may lodge with the Registrar a c aveat in the approved form...” while “interest” was defined under s 4 thereof “in relation to land, means any interest in land rec ognised as suc h by law and inc ludes an estate in land”. The question that arose for my c onsideration was, did the defendant have an interest in the property rec ognised by law? In my view it did. In this regard, Mr Kumar had referred the c ourt to _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ ( reissue vol 14) p 209 para 170.0239 whic h stated that persons who may c aveat their interests in land inc luded an option holder. 

43     I agree that in this c ase, the signed Option was not handed to the defendant but that was for the geographic al reason set out in [41] above. The lac k of an exec uted option did not in my view detrac t from the fac t that a c ontrac t had c ome into being. The offer pric e from the defendant and the defendant’s performanc e of the c ontrac t by tendering the option money had been ac c epted by the plaintiff through its agent the law firm. There was offer and there was ac c eptanc e. The fundamental requirements of a c ontrac t had been fulfilled. 

44     As it was relied on in the plaintiff’s arguments, it would be appropriate at this junc ture to refer to s 6(d) of the CLA. The sec tion states: 

 No ac tion shall be brought against ― 

 (d) any person upon any c ontrac t for the sale or other disposition of immovable property, or any interest in suc h property 

 unless the promise or agreement upon whic h suc h ac tion is brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, is in writing and signed by the party to be c harged therewith or some other person lawfully authorised by him. 

45     In my view, there was a “note in writing” and suffic ient c omplianc e with the above sec tion as Lek had written on the reverse of the defendant’s c heque the following partic ulars: 

 (a) being 1% option fee to purc hase property known as Blk 11 #05-01, Ardmore Park; 

 (b) 2 weeks option to exerc ise option by paying 4% as stakeholders; 

 (c ) c ompletion 10 weeks. 

It seemed to me that the requisite three Ps (see JT Farrand’s _Contract and Conveyance_ fourth edition at pp 38-39) for a c ontrac t for a sale of land had been fulfilled as the property, the pric e and the parties were known. The property was identified on the reverse of the defendant’s c heque in (a) above. As the c heque amount of $63,000 was stated as 1% of the sale pric e, it meant that the pric e ($6.3m) was also known while the parties to the c ontrac t were reflec ted on the c heque itself _viz_ the 


payee/vendor (the plaintiff) and the drawer/purc haser (the defendant). 

46     My view is reinforc ed by the learned authors of _Principles of Singapore Land Law_ (Sec ond edition) and Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston’s _Law of Contract Second Singapore and Malaysian Edition_. The following extrac ts appear in _Principles of Singapore Land Law_ : 

 At p 312: 

 There are no formal requirements for a c ontrac t for the sale of land. All that is needed for a c ontrac t to c ome into existenc e is known as ‘the three Ps’ – the property, the pric e and the parties. But in order that the c ontrac t be enforc eable, sec tion 6(d) of the Civil Law Ac t must be c omplied with. 

 At p 313: 

 The first point to note is that the contract itself need not be in writing. So if the parties have c ome to an oral agreement, there c ould be a valid c ontrac t between them.... (emphasis mine). 

47     Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston’s _Law of Contract Second Singapore and Malaysian Edition_ expressed the same view on s 6(d) of the CLA in the following passage (at p 366): 

 1 The c ontents of the ‘note or memorandum’ 

 The agreement itself need not be in writing. A ‘memorandum or note’ of it is suffic ient, provided that it c ontains all the material terms of the c ontrac t. Suc h fac ts as the names or adequate identific ation of the parties, the desc ription of the subjec t matter, the nature of the c onsideration, c omprise what may be c alled the minimum requirements. 

48     I should add that although s 4 of the Statute of Frauds 1677 was repealed and replac ed by s 6(d) of the CLA, it does not appear that the equitable doc trine of part-performanc e has been abolished, to whic h I alluded to in [43]. In this regard, I refer to The Applic ation of English Law Ac t (Cap 7A, 1994 Rev Ed). Sec tion 3(1) thereof states: 

 The c ommon law of England (inc luding the princ iples and rules of equity) so far as it was part of the law of Singapore immediately before 12 November 1993, shall c ontinue to be part of the law of Singapore. 

The authors of Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston’s _Law of Contract Second Singapore and Malaysian Edition_ also appeared to ac c ept (at p 374-375) that the doc trine of part-performanc e c ontinues to apply in Singapore. 

49     The following passage whic h appears at p 258 of _Principles of Singapore Land Law_ (Sec ond edition) is also helpful: 

 Where there is a valid and binding c ontrac t for sale of land, the equitable interest vests in the purc haser and so he has an interest in land that will support a c aveat. 

50     Assomull’s fourth affidavit appeared to be an attempt to disc redit Lek. With respec t, I c ould not see how Lek’s bankrupt status was relevant to the issue of whether there was a valid option or agreement for sale. Indeed, there was nothing wrong and/or illegal for a bankrupt to work as a business c onsultant for a c ompany suc h as the defendant partic ularly when Lek did so with the knowledge if not blessings, of the OA’s offic e. A business c onsultanc y is also a job. Bankrupts should 


work in order to earn a living to support themselves and/or their families and to pay off their c reditors. If indeed Lek was direc tly or indirec tly partic ipating in the management of the defendant in c ontravention of s 148 of the Companies Ac t, it was for the plaintiff to prove that allegation on whic h it failed. 

51     Sec tion 148(1) of the Companies Ac t states: 

 Every person who, being an undisc harged bankrupt (whether he was adjudged bankrupt by a Singapore Court or a foreign c ourt having jurisdic tion in bankruptc y), ac ts as direc tor of, or direc tly takes part in or is c onc erned in the management of, any c orporation, exc ept with the leave of the Court or the written permission of the Offic ial Assignee shall be guilty of an offenc e and shall be liable on c onvic tion to a fine not exc eeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exc eeding 2 years or to both. 

52     Counsel had also c ited s 131 of the Bankruptc y Ac t whic h states: 

 Where a bankrupt has not obtained his disc harge ― 

 (1) he shall be inc ompetent to maintain any ac tion, other than an ac tion for damages in respec t of an injury to his person, without the previous sanc tion of the Offic ial Assignee.. 

Again, I do not see the relevanc e of this sec tion to our c ase. The defendant not Lek was the party sued by the plaintiff. 

53     The plaintiff’s applic ation was a c laim for equitable reliefs. It is trite law that he who c omes into equity must c ome with c lean hands (see _Snell’s Equity supra_ [41] p 98 para 5-15). The plaintiff’s direc tor c um shareholder Yuen did not c ome to c ourt with c lean hands. To my mind, she wanted to renege on the plaintiff’s agreement to sell the property to the defendant at the offer pric e bec ause she felt that she c ould obtain a higher pric e in a rising property market. Yuen ec onomised on the truth in her affidavits. She ought to be c ross-examined (like Lek and Tey) on her affidavits and generally. 

54     Consequently, although I made no order on either the plaintiff’s or the defendant’s applic ation, I direc ted that the deponents should be c ross-examined on their affidavits and that the c osts of both applic ations should abide the outc ome of the c ross-examination exerc ise. Meanwhile, the Caveat should remain on the register of the Singapore Land Authority.
