**The prosecution’s case** 

3       In the early morning of 18 January 2008, offic ers of the Central Narc otic s Bureau (“CNB”) 


attended briefings on an operation whic h was to take plac e later that morning. Two CNB offic ers were detailed to look out for Yip, who was staying in a rented room at 103 Lorong N, Telok Kurau, Singapore, as the CNB had rec eived information that he would be delivering a c onsignment of heroin to Leong in the vic inity of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8 later that morning. The two CNB offic ers proc eeded to Yip’s plac e of residenc e and saw his c ar (a blac k Mitsubishi Lanc er with registration plate SGR 7235R) (“Yip’s c ar”) parked in the c ompound of the house there. At about 8.30 am, Yip drove his c ar out of the c ompound and made his way to Ang Mo Kio housing estate. 

4       In the meantime, another team of CNB offic ers arrived in the vic inity of Ang Mo Kio Avenues 8 and 10 to look out for Leong who was residing at Bloc k 420 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 #12(“Leong’s flat”). At about 8.30 am, Leong was seen walking from Bloc k 420 to a c offeeshop at Bloc k 421 where he bought some food and a pac ket of beverage. Leong left the c offeeshop and walked down a flight of steps leading to the pavement under the Mass Rapid Transit (“MRT”) trac k running parallel to Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8. Leong then walked along the pavement towards a bus stop near Bloc k 405 and sat on a stone benc h behind the bus stop. 

5       At about 8.55 am, Yip drove his c ar into the c arpark near Bloc k 456. A short while later, he drove out of the c arpark and proc eeded to another c arpark near Bloc k 413. Around that time, Leong started walking bac k along the pavement towards Bloc k 420. At about 9 am, he met Yip along the pavement near Bloc k 413. Yip was c arrying a white plastic bag and a red plastic bag in his left hand. The two of them walked very slowly side by side in the direc tion of Bloc k 420 and along the way, Yip handed the two plastic bags to Leong. The two men then parted ways with Yip going up the steps leading to Bloc k 413 while Leong c ontinued walking towards Bloc k 420 with the two plastic bags. 

6       The CNB offic ers moved in to arrest both Yip and Leong. Yip was searc hed and found to have on his body his identity c ard, his wallet, his mobile phone, a key pouc h with a c ar key and a bundle of c ash. Yip’s c ar was loc ated and guarded by CNB offic ers. Leong was found to be c arrying one big red Da Wang Bao pac ket (exhibit E) and one white plastic bag (exhibit F),whic h c ontained a small yellow pac ket of Boogie BBQ snac ks (exhibit F1). Leong was handc uffed and esc orted to a CNB vehic le parked nearby where he was searc hed and found to have with him his identity c ard, a bunc h of keys and a mobile phone. 

7       A little later, a team of CNB offic ers led by SSSG Tony Ng arrived at the said CNB vehic le and took over c ustody of Leong. Another team of CNB offic ers led by SSI Khong Chung Leong arrived to take over c ustody of Yip. 

8       SSSG Tony Ng and his team brought Leong up to Leong’s flat. They gained ac c ess by using one of the keys found on Leong. Inside the flat, Leong surrendered a pair of blac k striped pants to SSSG Tony Ng. Its right rear poc ket c ontained a plastic pac ket with a bundle wrapped in newspapers. The bundle c onsisted of several small pac kets of white powdery substanc e while its left rear poc ket c ontained a small c ylindric al plastic c ontainer whic h in turn c ontained a long straw and eight short straws of white powdery substanc e and a small pac ket of white powdery substanc e. 

9       The CNB offic ers opened the Da Wang Bao pac ket (seized earlier at the time of arrest) and found 30 smaller pac kets of white powdery substanc e therein. The Boogie BBQ snac ks pac ket (also seized earlier) was found to c ontain a hongbao (or red auspic ious pac ket for presenting gifts of money to others). Inside the hongbao, there was a small pac ket of white powdery substanc e and a $ note. The individual finds were plac ed bac k in their original pac kaging and eac h exhibit was then kept in separate transparent ziploc k plastic bags. 

10     While in Leong’s flat, SSSG Tony Ng rec orded a statement from Leong regarding the c ontents of 


the Da Wang Bao, the white plastic bag and the things found in the poc kets of the pair of pants. The CNB offic ers then disc overed a big yellow “MAMEE” noodle pac ket in the flat’s kitc hen. When that was opened up in Leong’s presenc e, it was found to c ontain six smaller pac kets of white powdery substanc e. They were returned to their original pac kaging and plac ed in another ziploc k plastic bag. A sec ond statement was then rec orded from Leong regarding this sec ond find. SSSG Tony Ng then plac ed all the exhibits, whic h were in their original pac kaging and in separate ziploc k bags, into a bigger CNB exhibit bag and they esc orted Leong to CNB Headquarters in town. 

11     In the meantime, SSI Khong Chung Leong and his team of offic ers went with Yip to Yip’s c ar. In the boot of the c ar, they found a “Giant” supermarket plastic bag c ontaining three red Da Wang Bao pac kets (exhibits A1, A2 and A3), one small empty yellow “Mini Toons” plastic bag and two small pac kets purportedly c ontaining groundnuts. They also found a big red plastic bag c ontaining three red Da Wang Bao pac kets (exhibits B1, B2 and B3). One of the Da Wang Bao pac kets was opened up in Yip’s presenc e. It c ontained a sealed plastic bag inside whic h were many small pac kets of white granular substanc e. 

12     Yip was then brought to the bac k seat of a CNB vehic le whic h had been driven to the lot next to Yip’s c ar. There, SSI Khong Chung Leong took the Da Wang Bao pac ket whic h had been opened up earlier and opened up the said sealed plastic bag that was inside. There were 30 small pac kets of white granular substanc e inside. Everything was then plac ed bac k into the original pac kaging. The CNB offic ers then brought Yip in his c ar to his rented room in Lorong N, Telok Kurau. 

13     Nothing inc riminating was found inside the rented room. The CNB offic ers then opened the remaining five Da Wang Bao pac kets seized earlier from Yip’s c ar. There was a sealed plastic bag c ontaining small pac kets of white granular substanc e inside eac h of them. The two small pac kets that were supposed to c ontain groundnuts were eac h found to have a pac ket of c rystalline substanc e. All the exhibits were returned to their original pac kaging and kept by one of the CNB offic ers. A bundle of c ash amounting to $3,000 was found in Yip’s trousers poc ket. At two points of time while they were in the rented room, SSI Khong Chung Leong rec orded two statements from Yip. The CNB offic ers then brought Yip to CNB Headquarters. 

14     At the c arpark of CNB Headquarters, a thorough searc h was made of Yip’s c ar in the presenc e of the investigating offic er, ASP Soh Choon Hoc k (“ASP Soh”). Inside the boot, the CNB offic ers found a white “Tesc o c lubc ard” plastic bag c ontaining two small pac kets purportedly c ontaining groundnuts and one small yellow pac ket of Boogie BBQ snac ks. Yip was then brought up to the CNB offic e. 

15     There, photographs were taken first of the exhibits found in Yip’s c ar followed by those that Yip had handed over to Leong. Different CNB offic ers held on to the exhibits that were seized from Leong and his flat and those seized from Yip’s c ar. Leong and Yip remained silent throughout the photography session. 

16     The exhibits were then brought to another room where they were weighed in the presenc e of Leong and Yip. After Leong and Yip signed in the book in whic h the respec tive weights had been rec orded, the exhibits were kept in ASP Soh’s safe. Leong’s urine samples were then taken. In the afternoon that day, a third statement was rec orded by SSI Khong Chung Leong from Yip regarding the exhibits found in Yip’s c ar boot during the searc h at the CNB c arpark. 

17     The 31 small pac kets of substanc e whic h Yip had handed to Leong were analysed and found to c ontain not less than 18.43 grams of diamorphine (or heroin), the subjec t of the c harges. Leong’s urine samples were also analysed and found to be negative for drugs. 


18     Two c autioned statements under s 122(6) of the Criminal Proc edure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) and three statements under s 121 of the CPC were rec orded by ASP Soh from Leong with Wu Nan Yong (“Wu”) interpreting in and from Hokkien. The voluntariness of the statements was not c hallenged. However, during the trial, Leong alleged that the statements were not ac c urately rec orded as Wu did not interpret properly what Leong had said in Hokkien. Wu had unfortunately passed away by the time of the trial. ASP Soh however is a Hokkien and c ould speak and understand the dialec t. He was therefore able to testify that Wu interpreted Leong’s words ac c urately. 

19     In the statements, Leong admitted that he sold heroin for a living. He said that he obtained the drug supplies from a Malaysian syndic ate and would usually order a minimum of 30 small pac kets of heroin. He rec eived the heroin from Yip on at least three oc c asions before 18 January 2008, the date of the present inc ident. The drugs would c ome in pac kets of “MAMEE” noodle snac ks. For the inc ident in question, he had plac ed an order for 30 small pac kets of heroin for the pric e of $7,500 two or three days before the inc ident. That morning, Yip telephoned him and they arranged to meet at 8am at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8. Leong brought only $3,000 with him. That day, the drugs c ame in a Chinese New Year red plastic pac ket with Chinese words (Chinese New Year in 2008 fell on 7 and 8 February). 

20     Three statements under s 122(6) of the CPC and four statements under s 121 of the CPC were rec orded from Yip by ASP Soh in January 2008. Yip spoke in English. On 3 Oc tober 2008, Inspec tor Lee Chai Hwa, who had taken over the c ase from ASP Soh, rec orded another statement from Yip under s 121 of the CPC. In these statements, Yip said he was working as a drug c ourier in order to earn a living and to c lear his debts. He began by delivering small quantities of Ketamine and Erimintablets to the c ustomers of a c ertain Jeffrey within Singapore. Later, he c ollec ted larger quantities of these drugs from one Ah Neng, Jeffrey’s supplier, in Malaysia, and brought them into Singapore. After Jeffrey was arrested, Yip started working for Ah Neng and Ah Boy (Ah Neng’s boss). Yip would go to Malaysia to c ollec t the drugs whic h were usually pac ked in “MAMEE” noodle snac ks pac kaging and deliver them to Ah Boy’s c ustomers in Singapore. Leong was one of those c ustomers. Yip also c ollec ted the payments for the drugs whic h he would hand over to his bosses in Malaysia on his next drug run. 

21     The statements went on to say that on 17 January 2008, Yip drove to Malaysia to c ollec t more supplies of drugs. Ah Neng put a red plastic bag and another white one c ontaining a total of seven red c oloured pac kets on the rear seats of Yip’s c ar. Ah Boy then told Yip to deliver one of the seven pac kets to Leong together with a small yellow titbit pac ket that was left over from the previous delivery. On the morning of 18 January 2008, Yip telephoned Leong to c onfirm the meeting plac e. Yip was late. After Yip handed over the two pac kets, Leong passed him a bundle of c ash and told him it was $3,000. 

**The case for the two accused** 

22     Leong testified that he dealt in and ordered only the drugs Erimin-55 and Dormic um-15 from the Malaysian suppliers and not heroin. He therefore did not know and had no reason at all to suspec t that Yip was delivering heroin to him that morning. However, no Erimin or Dormic um pills were found when the CNB went with him to his flat. Leong also raised the possibility of c ross c ontamination between the drugs that he had rec eived from Yip that morning and those found in his flat after his arrest by the CNB offic ers. The amount of heroin alleged to have been rec eived by him from Yip that morning might therefore not be ac c urate. 

23     Leong agreed that he was a drug traffic ker and that his only sourc e of inc ome in the last quarter of 2007 was from suc h illegal ac tivity. He also agreed that he had ordered heroin from his Malaysian supplier before and that heroin (in 14 small pac kets, one long straw and eight short straws) 


was found in his flat. He c laimed to have c onsumed part of the heroin from previous deliveries and that it followed that he would have c onsumed part of the heroin in question here too, thereby lowering the weight of the drug for traffic king to less than 15gm. He c laimed that he c onsumed heroin for three days c onsec utively, then stopped for the next three or four days before repeating the c yc le again. He said he c onsumed more than one sac het of heroin per week. On 18 January 2008, he had not c onsumed heroin for about four days, i.e. it was at the tail end of his abstinenc e period. However, no drug c onsumption paraphernalia were found in his flat. Leong’s urine samples also showed no trac es of drugs. 

24     Leong c laimed that he ordered 50 slabs of Erimin-55 and 100 slabs of Dormic um-15 from the Malaysian syndic ate for delivery on 18 January 2008. In fac t, he said, the drugs suppliers had asked him to get heroin from them but he told them that he did not want to deal in heroin. He thought the Da Wang Bao pac ket handed over by Yip c ontained Chinese New Year titbits and that the yellow Boogie BBQ pac ket c ontained the two drugs that he ordered. When asked whether the small yellow pac ket looked like it was c apable of c ontaining the 150 slabs of the drugs that he ordered, Leong explained that the suppliers might not deliver the exac t quantity ordered eac h time. He ac tually had more than $9,000 with him that morning but handed only $3,000 to Yip. It was supposed to have been Leong’s final transac tion with the drug syndic ate. 

25     Leong alleged that the rec orders of his statements did not faithfully rec ord everything he said. He also alleged that the interpreter (the late Wu) who assisted the rec ording offic ers did not interpret ac c urately his words suc h as the Hokkien words “tok” or “yeok”, whic h c ould mean merely drugs and not nec essarily heroin. 

26     Yip said that he did not know and had no reason to believe that the Da Wang Bao and the Boogie BBQ pac kets c ontained heroin. He thought the c ontents were either Ketamine or Erimin-5 pills. He also alleged that the drugs in question c ould have been mixed up with the other heroin exhibits that were seized from Leong’s flat or from the boot of his c ar. 

27     Yip agreed that he was in debt in 2007 and in January 2008. He got to know Jeffrey in late 2006 and bought the c ar in question in February 2007. Initially, Yip planned to c all Jeffrey as a defenc e witness but c hanged his mind subsequently in the c ourse of the trial. This was bec ause the prosec ution had not put to Yip that his testimony about Jeffrey was untrue. Jeffrey paid him $10 to $20 for eac h delivery of Ketamine and Erimin to Jeffrey’s c ustomers. Sometime in mid-2007, he went with Jeffrey to Malaysia where he was introduc ed to Ah Neng and instruc ted to c ollec t the said drugs from Ah Neng in future. Thereafter, Yip would drive his c ar between Singapore and Malaysia on the drug runs on behalf of Jeffrey. Yip was paid $50 by Jeffrey for eac h trip. 

28     Subsequently, Jeffrey was arrested and imprisoned. Ah Neng then telephoned Yip and asked him to go over to Malaysia. When Yip went to Ah Neng’s house in Malaysia in September 2007, he told Ah Neng about his financ ial woes. Ah Neng introduc ed Ah Boy to Yip and asked him whether he wanted to bring “things” into Singapore. When he asked what “things” they were, Ah Boy told him not to ask too muc h if he was interested in doing the job for whic h he would be paid $300 per pac ket of “things” delivered to Singapore. Yip knew that the “things” referred to drugs and that the delivery would be on a bigger sc ale than his jobs for Jeffrey as he would be paid so muc h more. Yip then agreed to work for Ah Boy. 

29     A few weeks later, Ah Neng told Yip to go to Malaysia to c ollec t the “things”. Yip dec ided not to know what the “things” were as he needed money quic kly. He drove his c ar to Ah Neng’s house where he was handed two big pac kets of titbits. Ah Neng plac ed the pac kets on the rear seats and told him not to hide them so as not to arouse suspic ion from the authorities. Yip would deliver the 


pac kets, usually pac ked as “MAMEE” noodle snac ks, to c ustomers in Singapore. 

30     One of the c ustomers was Leong, variously referred to as Ah Yee, Er Zai or Ah Ang. Yip delivered drugs to Leong at least six times before 18 January 2008 when they were arrested. Most of the deliveries took plac e in Ang Mo Kio, whic h was why Leong was listed as “Bros Ang” in Yip’s mobile telephones. From about end Oc tober 2007, Yip would also c ollec t money from Leong besides delivering drugs to him. He would hand the money to his bosses in Malaysia on his next trip there. 

31     In the afternoon of 17 January 2008, Yip drove his c ar to Malaysia. Ah Neng plac ed the “Giant” supermarket plastic bag and the big red plastic bag on the rear seats. There were a total of seven Da Wang Bao pac kets. These were left within sight so that the Singapore authorities would believe that they were nothing more than food items. 

32     After driving into Singapore without inc ident, Yip moved the pac kets to the boot. When he spoke to Ah Boy, he was told that Leong had ordered one pac ket of drugs and was instruc ted to deliver the relevant items to Leong at 8.30am on 18 January 2008. 

33     On 18 January 2008 morning, Yip took the white “Tesc o c lubc ard” plastic bag c ontaining two small yellow pac kets of Boogie BBQ snac ks from his rented room and brought them to his c ar. These were left over from his previous delivery. After c onfirming the loc ation of delivery with Leong, Yip drove his c ar to Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10. In a c arpark there, he took out one of the two yellow pac kets and plac ed it in a white plastic bag. Ah Boy had instruc ted him to pass this to Leong as a Chinese New Year gift. He then drove to the c arpark near Bloc k 413, parked his c ar there and went to meet Leong with one Da Wang Bao pac ket and the small yellow pac ket. When he met Leong, he handed over the pac kets to him, telling Leong that the small yellow pac ket was a Chinese New Year gift from Ah Boy. Leong said he was aware of it. After c ollec ting $3,000 from Leong, they parted ways. Yip was arrested as he was making his way bac k to his c ar. 

**The decision of the court** 

34     Under s 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Ac t (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), Leong and Yip are presumed to know that the 31 small pac kets in question c ontained diamorphine as they were in possession of the same at the material times. The presumption in s 17(c ) of the MDA deems Leong to have in possession of the drugs for the purpose of traffic king as he was proved to have had in his possession more than 2 grams of diamorphine. This latter presumption applies only if possession of the drugs is proved rather than presumed by law (see Ramis A/L Muniandy v PP <span class="citation">[2001] 3 SLR 534</span>). 

35     The c onduc t of Leong and Yip showed that they knew that what they had transac ted in on 18 January 2008 was heroin and not some other substanc e. Leong did not utter anything, whether in shoc k or in protest, when the two pac kets in question were opened up in his flat to reveal 31 small pac kets of white powdery substanc e. Erimin and Dormic um pills would have looked quite different from the white powdery substanc e. He also remained silent during the photography session and the weighing of the drugs in CNB. Similarly, if Yip only dealt with Ketamine and Erimin, he did not express any surprise or horror when one of the six Da Wang Bao pac kets found in the boot of his c ar was torn open to reveal its c ontents. Subsequently in his rented room, he showed the same nonc halanc e when the other five Da Wang Bao pac kets were opened up in his presenc e to reveal white powdery substanc e. He also remained silent during the photography and the weighing sessions in CNB. 

36     Although Leong c laimed to be a seller of Erimin and Dormic um and not heroin, it was only heroin that was found in his flat. It was quite obvious from the size of the yellow Boogie BBQ pac ket that it c ould not c ontain 150 slabs of the drugs that he purportedly ordered. If there was only partial 


delivery, no evidenc e was led on how many were supposed to have been delivered that morning. Further, Leong had admitted in his statements that the Da Wang Bao and the yellow pac kets c ontained heroin sac hets and that he intended to sell eac h sac het for $300. In his statements, no mention was made of Erimin and Dormic um. The only Chinese New Year gift from the drug suppliers for Leong was the extra sac het of heroin and the c ash c ontained in the hongbao inside the sealed yellow pac ket. 

37     Despite Leong’s attempts at disc rediting the statements, I was satisfied that ASP Soh had no diffic ulty understanding what he was saying in Hokkien and that the interpreter was not remiss in his duties. The statements were also properly read bac k to Leong before he was asked to sign them. 

38     Yip admitted in his statements that he had delivered drugs to Leong on a number of oc c asions before 18 January 2008. Yip’s passport and the c all details of Yip’s and Leong’s mobile phones indic ated that whenever Yip spoke to Ah Boy and Leong on the same day on six oc c asions, Yip would go to Johor and return to Singapore the same day. On two other oc c asions, Yip talked to Ah Boy over the mobile phone, went to Johor and returned the same day but c ontac ted Leong the following day. On one oc c asion, Yip talked to Ah Boy and then went to Johor that day but returned to Singapore the following day, when he then c ontac ted Leong. This evidenc e supported what Yip said in his statements about having delivered drugs to Leong on a number of oc c asions before 18 January 2008. Further, Leong also admitted in his statements that Yip had been delivering heroin to him. 

39     Yip admitted that he lied in his first statement where he denied knowledge of the c ontents of the six Da Wang Bao pac kets found in his c ar. He did not inform the rec ording offic ers at any time that he thought he was delivering Ketamine or Erimin on 18 January 2008. In any event, no suc h drugs were found on Leong and Yip or in Yip’s c ar or in their respec tive plac e of residenc e. 

40     Both Leong and Yip raised the possibility of a mix-up in the drug exhibits. This, they submitted, was a c ruc ial matter as eac h sac het of heroin weighed about 0.6gm and it would take only a differenc e of about six sac hets to bring the total weight of the heroin in question to 15gm or less, thereby rendering the death penalty inapplic able. Yip submitted that the CNB offic ers had been lac kadaisic al in the gathering of evidenc e partic ularly bec ause they had failed to notic e two other pac kets purportedly c ontaining groundnuts and one other Boogie BBQ pac ket in the boot of Yip’s c ar when they first searc hed it at the c arpark in Ang Mo Kio. On this allegation of a possible mix-up of the drug exhibits found in the various loc ations, I was satisfied that the CNB offic ers in question had assiduously ensured that the drugs exhibits seized were properly identified and kept in separate resealable plastic bags even though some of these bags were then c arried together in a larger exhibits bag bac k to the CNB. The photography session at the CNB was also c arried out metic ulously to avert any c hanc e of a mix-up of the drug exhibits. The same attention was given to the exhibits when they were weighed in another room. 

41     Based on the c onduc t of Leong and Yip (see [34] above) and their respec tive statements, it was c lear beyond reasonable doubt that both of them knew what drug they were dealing with on 18 January 2008. Yip knew that he was delivering illic it drugs and suspec ted at the very least that they c ould be heroin bec ause of the large amounts of money involved in the transac tions and bec ause of the higher pay-outs by his bosses for the work done. He c hose not to enquire further as he wanted the delivery work. Suc h wilful blindness is regarded as being equivalent to ac tual knowledge and c annot exonerate Yip here (Tan Kiam Peng v PP <span class="citation">[2008] 1 SLR 1</span>). All the evidenc e pointed to their knowledge of the c ontents of the Da Wang Bao and the Boogie BBQ pac kets whic h Yip handed to Leong in the morning of 18 January 2008. 

42     Leong was not able to rebut the presumption in s 17(c ) of the MDA (see [33] above) on a 


balanc e of probabilities. He c laimed to have c onsumed part of previous batc hes of heroin and logic ally therefore would have c onsumed part of the heroin in question here too. That c ould result in the total amount of heroin falling below the level at whic h the mandatory death penalty bec omes applic able. However, as pointed out earlier, there was no drug c onsumption equipment found in his flat. Further, his urine samples showed no evidenc e of any drug c onsumption. In my opinion, his alleged c onsumption pattern [see [22] above] was c ontrived to meet the prosec ution’s evidenc e that there was no trac e of heroin in his urine samples and, at the same time, to c reate the impression that he c onsumed a fair amount of heroin every week. It was muc h too c oinc idental that he was arrested at a time when he had not c onsumed heroin for some four days. There was also no evidenc e of any drug withdrawal symptoms after his arrest. It was also plain from his statements that the heroin in question was for the purpose of selling to others. 

43     I therefore found that the prosec ution had made out its c ase against both Leong and Yip beyond reasonable doubt and I c onvic ted both of them on their respec tive c harge. The mandatory death sentenc e provided in the MDA was passed on them ac c ordingly.
