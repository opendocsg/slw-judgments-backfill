**Synopsis of the case** 

1       The plaintiffs are the proprietors of various trademarks worldwide c onsisting of the word “Aman” or the prefix “Aman”, inc luding Amanusa, whic h is, however, not a Singapore trademark at the material time. Amanusa is the name of one of the plaintiffs’ exc lusive resorts in Bali, Indonesia. 


2       The defendant is a developer of real estate in Singapore. Sometime in early 2006, it began marketing for sale a residential projec t undergoing c onstruc tion at Yio Chu Kang Drive in the northc entral part of Singapore. The projec t was also c alled Amanusa. 

3       The plaintiffs alleged passing-off and a fraudulent intention to dec eive on the part of the defendant. They also c laimed, in the alternative, that Amanusa and/or Aman were well-known trademarks whic h were entitled to protec tion pursuant to s 55 of the Trade Marks Ac t (Cap 332, 2005 revised edition). 

4       At the c onc lusion of the trial, I held that there was passing-off but I was not satisfied that there was a fraudulent intention to dec eive. I also held that the plaintiffs’ trademarks were well known trademarks and that the plaintiffs were entitled to an injunc tion (with c onsequential direc tions) to restrain the defendant from using them, in partic ular, Amanusa, in relation to any form of ac c ommodation. The injunc tion was c onfined to the plaintiffs’ trademarks and did not extend, as pleaded by the plaintiffs, to all words whic h inc luded the prefix “Aman”. I did not order an inquiry as to damages or an ac c ount of profits as there was no immediate damage suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of the use of the name Amanusa. The plaintiffs were awarded 90% of the c osts of the ac tion, the deduc tion being in respec t of the issues on whic h they failed. No c ertific ate for c osts for more than two solic itors was ordered under O 59 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5) 

**The plaintiffs’ case** 

5       The plaintiffs’ evidenc e was adduc ed princ ipally through their direc tor, Gregory Sirois. The 1st plaintiff is a c ompany inc orporated in Hong Kong, whic h is a party to the Paris Convention and is a 

member of the World Trade Organisation. It is represented in Singapore by the 2nd plaintiff, a c ompany inc orporated here. The plaintiffs’ International Corporate Offic e and International Reservations Offic e are loc ated in Singapore. Both plaintiffs are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Silverlink Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands c ompany, and operate under the umbrella of the Amanresorts group c onsisting of more than 80 c ompanies. The Amanresorts group was founded in the mid-1980s by Adrian Zec ha, a Javanese-born Dutc h national and businessman. The plaintiffs operate many exc lusive, ultra-luxurious boutique resorts situated at beautiful loc ations around the world, c atering to the upper end of the tourist market by emphasizing privac y and impec c able servic e. They are the proprietors worldwide of trademarks c onsisting of the word “Aman” and/or c ontaining the prefix “Aman”, suc h as Aman, Amanresorts, Amandari, Amanpuri and Amanyara, for a wide range of goods and servic es, inc luding the provision of resorts and ac c ommodation. In respec t of Amanusa mark, the plaintiffs own the trademark in Brunei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines. There used to be a Singapore Amanusa trademark between 1998 and 2001 but that was not renewed following a shift in the plaintiffs’ c ommerc ial strategy at that time. The plaintiffs also c laimed to be the owners of the reputation and goodwill in the said trademarks, partic ularly Amanusa, both in Singapore and worldwide,. 

6       The defendant is a Singapore c ompany inc orporated in May 2005. It is part of the Novelty group of c ompanies, a family-owned business involved in the development and sale of residential properties and in the hotel and resort business. 

7       The plaintiffs’ first resort was the Amanpuri, whic h opened in 1988 in Phuket, Thailand. The sec ond resort was the Amandari in Bali, Indonesia. In 1990, the plaintiffs built their first real estate development of 31 villa homes at the Amanpuri in Phuket. These homes provided long-term ac c ommodation. While the resort hotel business was c entral to their business, the plaintiffs also c onsidered the development of suc h long-term ac c ommodation as a signific ant part of their c ore 


business. In addition, the plaintiffs also offer high-value experienc es for their guests, suc h as Aman Cruises, Aman Weddings and Amanusa Golf Experienc e. 

8       In 1992, the Amankila and the Amanusa opened in Bali. These were the sec ond and the third of the plaintiffs’ resorts on that island. The arc hitec ts who designed the resort won an award in 1993 for its design. From 1988 to 2006, 16 Aman-prefixed resorts sprung up all over the globe but with most in Asia. The plaintiffs also ac quired two resorts whic h operated under their trade name and house mark “Amanresorts”. These were the Hotel Bora Bora, Frenc h Polynesia, in 1989 and the Amanresorts Le Melezin, Courc hevel, Franc e, in 1992. 

9       The plaintiffs have also, with various partners, developed and marketed long-term residential ac c ommodation at some of their resorts, whic h gradually bec ame known as Aman Villas. The development of suc h branded real estate projec ts was part of a worldwide trend whereby luxury hotel groups would develop and manage branded long-term residential projec ts. Conversely, developers of houses and c ondominiums have also started building hotels and resorts. There was therefore an ongoing c onvergenc e of the two erstwhile separate industries. In Singapore, for example, the ShangriLa Hotels and Resorts manage the ShangriLa Residenc es, a branded residential c ondominium development, and the ShangriLa Apartments, a projec t involving branded servic ed apartments. Similarly, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide would be managing the six-star St Regis Hotel together with the St Regis Residenc es. 

10     The plaintiffs have rec eived many requests from developers to use the Aman brand name for their projec ts in return for a branding fee. Suc h an arrangement would inc rease the prestige and pric e of the projec ts. The plaintiffs would typic ally c harge a branding fee of 10% of the pric e of the units in the projec ts and would be responsible for the design of the projec ts and, for another fee, their management upon c ompletion of c onstruc tion. The plaintiffs are c urrently developing residential projec ts bearing the Aman brand in various parts of the world, for instanc e, USA, Bahamas, Greec e and India. Their joint-venture partner has also ac quired land for developing Amanusa villas adjac ent to the Amanusa resort. Suc h branded developments were not nec essarily c onfined to villas in remote areas. The plaintiffs have signed agreements for high-rise developments in Tokyo and New York. 

11     Worldwide sales for the plaintiffs’ goods and servic es ranged from about USD39m in 1995 to around USD86m in 2006. The annual promotional and marketing expenditure inc urred by the plaintiffs worldwide ranged from USD1.9m in 1995 to about USD3m in 2006. The plaintiffs have a website at [http://www.amanresorts.c](http://www.amanresorts.c) om registered in Dec ember 1996 whic h, for the past several years, has attrac ted millions of “hits”. The plaintiffs also own the domain name, [http://www.amanusa.c](http://www.amanusa.c) om and many other domain names bearing the names of the various resorts. Sinc e 1994, they have been distributing newsletters on the Aman resorts and their related ac tivities in Singapore and elsewhere, with subsc ribers worldwide numbering about 100,000 and those in Singapore numbering more than 2,000. Broc hures for all the Aman resorts are available at their International Corporate Offic e and International Reservations Offic e here. 

12     The plaintiffs’ resorts have rec eived numerous awards and ac c olades in the travel and hospitality industries in eac h year of operation. They have also been featured in international and regional magazines and newspapers both in Singapore and elsewhere in the world. In one suc h journal, the name Aman was desc ribed as one that “inspires hushed awe”. Celebrities suc h as Elizabeth Taylor and Mic k Jagger were reportedly frequent visitors of the resorts, desc ribed variously as “superexc lusive, superb-luxury hotels”, “usually the preserve of a very wealthy few”, “the c oc oon of luxury” and “aimed at a more disc erning c lass of traveller (never a ‘tourist’) who are c ash-ric h, stylec onsc ious”. It has even been written that “a new international c ult of Aman junkies has arisen” (referring to people who have visited at least one Aman resort or those who stay at Aman hotels 


around the world, travelling to a new one every time it opens) and that their numbers exc eed 130,000. The emphasis is on quality, not quantity. The plaintiffs’ 18 resorts worldwide have only 626 rooms to offer. 

13     The plaintiffs also produc ed statistic s to show that a large number of Singaporeans visit Bali every year, with more than 35,000 annually for the years 2003 to 2005. More than 300,000 have gone to Bali between 1995 and 2005. Some 1382 Singaporeans visited the Amanusa resort in Bali between 1995 and 2005. 

14     By virtue of all the above, the plaintiffs c laim to have substantial reputation and goodwill in Singapore and worldwide in the names Aman, Amanusa and/or any words with the prefix “Aman” when used in relation to resorts and ac c ommodation suc h that they have c ommon law rights to the exc lusive use of the same as indic ators of the sourc e and/or quality of the goods and servic es offered by them. 

15     Ac c ording to Tevy Eliazaar, the 1st plaintiff’s Area Financ ial Controller, an Indonesian by rac e and nationality and someone who is fully c onversant in Bahasa Indonesia, the word Aman meant “peac e” or “peac eful” and the word “Nusa” meant “island” or “isle”. The phrase “Aman Nusa” was not a c ommon one in Bahasa Indonesia as it was grammatic ally inc orrec t. In that language, the adjec tive ought to follow the noun and the c orrec t rendition of the phrase should have been “Nusa Aman”. The word Amanusa was an invented word. There is no other plac e in Bali known as Aman Nusa or Amanusa other than the Amanusa resort in Nusa Dua, Bali. 

16     Sometime in February 2006, the plaintiffs realised that the defendant was advertising and offering for sale a residential projec t undergoing c onstruc tion c alled the Amanusa loc ated at Yio Chu Kang Drive, Singapore (“the Yio Chu Kang projec t”). The Yio Chu Kang projec t c omprises 36 freehold three-storey terrac e houses in a c luster with c ommon amenities suc h as c asc ading pools. On 

14 February 2006, the 1st plaintiff issued a letter of demand to the defendant asking it to c hange the name of the Yio Chu Kang projec t. As the defendant refused to do so, this ac tion was c ommenc ed on 3 May 2006. 

17     The plaintiffs c laimed that as a result of their extensive use of the Aman and Amanusa names, many developers were trying to ride on these names in order to give their projec ts an air of exc lusivity sinc e the said names were assoc iated with high-end, top quality, exc lusive resorts. The defendant was not the only developer seeking to ride on the Amanusa name. In Marc h 2006, a residential projec t in Indonesia was named Amanusa Regenc y. Following an exc hange of c orrespondenc e between the plaintiffs’ solic itors and the developer of the Indonesian projec t, the name was c hanged to Anugraha Regenc y. 

18     The defendant’s Yio Chu Kang projec t’s name was identic al to the plaintiffs’ trademark, Amanusa (not registered in Singapore). It also bore the prefix Aman and was therefore identic al with or otherwise similar to the plaintiffs’ various Aman trademarks in essential aspec ts. The plaintiffs have also been involved in the business of promoting and selling real estate in assoc iation with their Aman resorts. Both the plaintiffs and the defendant were therefore providers of identic al or similar servic es (in real estate and ac c ommodation). 

19     Three of the plaintiffs’ luxury resorts are in Bali. In addition, the plaintiffs’ Amanwana resort is loc ated on Moyo Island whic h is near to and ac c essed through Bali. The defendant’s sales broc hure and newspaper advertisements in February 2006 desc ribed the Yio Chu Kang projec t as having a Balinese-inspired retreat that inc luded a water-themed bac kdrop. The advertisements also desc ribed the said projec t as “exc lusive”, a “private hideaway” with luxury fittings. This was similar to the way 


the plaintiffs’ Aman real estate and resorts were desc ribed. Further, the name Amanusa had no natural c onnec tion with the defendant but was strongly assoc iated with the plaintiffs sinc e 1992. The adoption of that invented word would give the impression that the Yio Chu Kang projec t was c onnec ted to the plaintiffs. The c onfusion c aused would be a c ontinuing one as the units in the said projec t c ould be sold by the present buyers to others, inc luding foreigners (subjec t to approval from the authorities). In 2006, foreigners formed about 23% of buyers of private properties in Singapore. Many of the plaintiffs’ c ustomers or potential c ustomers were foreigners and there was a strong likelihood that they would be c onfused into believing that the Yio Chu Kang projec t was c onnec ted to the plaintiffs. 

20     The use of the name Amanusa by the defendant would lead to the gradual whittling away and eventual erosion of the uniqueness and exc lusivity assoc iated with the plaintiffs’ Aman trademarks and lessen their c apac ity to identify and distinguish the plaintiffs’ goods and servic es from others. Other third parties c ould also dec ide to do the same, thereby c ausing further whittling away and erosion. Members of the public in Singapore would no longer assoc iate the Aman brand with a standard equivalent to other prestigious developments here, suc h as the Four Seasons Park and the St Regis Residenc es. There would also be loss of branding fees as other developers would see no need to pay for the exc lusive use of the Aman brand for their projec ts. The plaintiffs would suffer further damage in not being able to use the name Amanusa or other Aman-prefixed name for their own real estate developments in Singapore or elsewhere due to possible c ustomer c onfusion, given the globalised nature of the plaintiffs’ real estate market. 

21     Two private investigation agenc ies were employed by the plaintiffs to c onduc t investigations in relation to the Yio Chu Kang projec t. On 26 Marc h 2007, Leong Chee Wing (“Leong”), general manager of Pan Intel Investigation & Consultants, visited the defendant’s sales offic e c um show flat in the vic inity of Balestier Road. There he met Jerry Koh (“Jerry”) of Huttons Residential Pte Ltd (“Huttons”), the marketing agents for the Yio Chu Kang projec t. Jerry explained to him the details of the projec t and handed him a hard-c over sales broc hure. Leong asked Jerry about the name Amanusa and was told that it was an Indian name, “it is like a resort, there is a resort c alled Amanusa. It is a very famous resort”. Jerry explained further that a searc h on the Internet would show the Indonesian resort. Jerry’s c olleague added that the name meant “quiet, safe, native”. 

22     Kelley Teo (“Kelley”), a private investigator employed by Commerc ial Investigations LLP, visited the sales offic e for the Yio Chu Kang projec t on 30 Marc h 2007. She spoke to Jason Cai (“Jason”) of Huttons and was given a hard-c over sales broc hure. When she mentioned that the development looked “kind of like exc lusive”, Jason said that was bec ause it was named after a very well-known holiday resort and that the c onc ept of the Yio Chu Kang projec t was resort living. Jason was unable to say where that famous resort was loc ated. 

23     The pleaded partic ulars of the defendant’s alleged fraudulent intention to dec eive were: 

 (a) the defendant and/or its representatives and agent involved in the development of the Yio Chu Kang projec t knew of the Aman group of resorts and its other Aman properties; 

 (b) the defendant deliberately c hose the word Amanusa for the name of its c ondominium development, a name identic al to the plaintiffs’ Amanusa resort in Bali; 

 (c ) the defendant intended to use the Amanusa name to market the Yio Chu Kang projec t as one with an exc lusive and luxurious Balinese resort-style c onc ept; and 

 (d) the use of the name Amanusa was intended to show a c onnec tion between the plaintiffs’ 


 Amanusa resort and the Yio Chu Kang projec t. 

24     The plaintiffs c laimed a dec laration that their Amanusa trademark and/or their Aman trademarks were well known trademarks in Singapore and, pursuant to s 55(3)(a) of the Trade Marks Ac t, an injunc tion to restrain the defendant from using a trade name, trademark or business identifier inc luding the prefix or word Aman in relation to any form of ac c ommodation. The plaintiffs also sought an injunc tion to restrain the defendant from passing off any form of ac c ommodation as that of the plaintiffs by the use of the trademark Amanusa or any word with the prefix Aman or otherwise. They sought an order for delivery up and destruc tion, at the defendant’s expense, of all goods and doc uments, the use of whic h by the defendant in the c ourse of trade would be a breac h of the said injunc tions and an order for the removal of the name Amanusa or any word with the prefix Aman from any infringing goods whic h c ould not be delivered up. The plaintiffs also asked for an inquiry as to damages or an ac c ount of profits for the unauthorised use of Amanusa and/or passing off the Aman trademarks, interest and c osts. 

**The defendant’s case** 

25     The defendant averred that the Yio Chu Kang projec t was targeted at homeowners in Singapore, unlike the plaintiffs’ resorts and ac c ommodation whic h foc used on visitors, tourists and c orporate c onvention partic ipants. It c laimed that there was no likelihood of, or no, c onfusion or dec eption and no likelihood of, or no, damage to the plaintiffs’ interests. 

26     Manoj Dharmadas Kalwani (“Manoj”), a direc tor of the defendant, testified that besides the Yio Chu Kang projec t, the defendant and its sister c ompanies had developed many other residential projec ts in Singapore, suc h as The Tai Pan, Tai Pan Jade, Tai Pan Regenc y, Bluwaters, Platinum Edge, Iridium and Vanadium. These projec ts were suc c essful bec ause of reasonable pric ing, c onvenient loc ations and, in partic ular, quality finishes and furnishings for whic h the defendant was well known. The purc hasers of the units were mostly Singaporeans wishing to own a home or to upgrade. 

27     In July 2005, the defendant bought the 56,355 sq ft site on whic h the Yio Chu Kang projec t now stands. It was then a vac ant plot of land with lush greenery and thic k foliage all round, nestled in a quiet residential neighbourhood and near a nature reserve. The defendant disc ussed with its arc hitec ts on how to c apitalise on the site to ensure a suc c essful residential projec t. It was dec ided that the Yio Chu Kang projec t would c omprise a c luster of 36 three-storey terrac e houses with basement c ar park and roof garden. The projec t would also harmonize with its surroundings and provide a peac eful and soothing plac e of abode for its oc c upants. There would also be high-quality fixtures and equipment in the units. Bec ause of the vision to provide an oasis or a sanc tuary, the arc hitec ts suggested the name Amanusa whic h meant “peac eful island” in Malay. The defendant agreed, without then knowing about the Amanusa resort in Bali or other Aman resorts and hotels. 

28     On 1 September 2005, the arc hitec ts applied to the Street and Building Names Board to name the Yio Chu Kang projec t as Amanusa. Approval was given within a week. This reinforc ed the defendant’s view that the name was appropriate for the projec t. This was bec ause the said board rejec ted an applic ation in Dec ember 2004 in respec t of another projec t (at Jalan Loyang Besar) whic h the defendant had proposed to name “Paradise Waters” on the ground that it c ould c reate the wrong impression that the development was loc ated next to the sea. At that time, the defendant was still ignorant about the plaintiffs’ resorts. 

29     The defendant then engaged Debenham Tie Leung (SEA) Pte Ltd (“DTZ”) to market the Yio Chu Kang projec t. Manoj spoke to some of the visitors at the show flat and learnt that most of them were Singaporean families wishing to own landed property or to upgrade from their c urrent homes, mainly 


public housing. They did not give him the impression that they were there bec ause they thought the Yio Chu Kang projec t was related to the plaintiffs’ resorts. He paid attention to all this bec ause the defendant had rec eived the plaintiffs’ letter of demand dated 14 February 2006 alleging passing-off. 

30     The defendant’s solic itors responded to the said letter of demand. The defendant denied that 

the 1st plaintiff had extensive reputation or goodwill in Singapore in respec t of Aman or Amanusa. The defendant stated that the Street and Building Names Board would not have approved the name for 

the Yio Chu Kang projec t if it was distinc tive and assoc iated in Singapore with only the 1st plaintiff. The defendant also did not believe that many Singaporeans had heard or were aware of Aman or Amanusa. Any suc h knowledge, it argued, would be c onfined to a very small and selec t group of Singaporeans. It also argued that Aman was a c ommon and desc riptive Malay word meaning “peac e” and that Nusa meant “motherland” and that “peac eful motherland” was an appropriate name for the projec t with its serene environment. The defendant denied any likelihood of c onfusion between the Yio Chu Kang projec t and the plaintiffs’ resorts. Further, the developer was c learly stated in the sales broc hures as the Novelty Group. The residential housing projec t was also c learly different from the 

“temporary holiday ac c ommodation” provided by the 1st plaintiff overseas. The ac tual and potential c ustomers were different. The defendant’s c ustomers would only purc hase a unit after lengthy and c areful c onsideration and evaluation and would not be c onfused. 

31     In another letter (dated 6 Marc h 2006), the defendant’s solic itors reiterated that the “c omposite word” Amanusa meant “peac eful motherland” and that the c omponent words were c ommon desc riptive ones whic h the c ourts were loathe to allow anyone to monopolise. 

32     As a result of the plaintiffs’ letter of demand, the defendant started issuing questionnaires to potential purc hasers of the Yio Chu Kang projec t from July 2006. Some of the questions asked were, “What were your reasons/fac tors for c hoosing the Amanusa development?”, “Would you have c hosen the Amanusa development if it were c alled by some other name? (Please state reason(s) for your “yes” or “no” or any other answer)” and “Does the name/word “Amanusa” mean anything to you? If so, please indic ate its meaning to you”. There were 51 responses and these did not bear out the plaintiffs’ allegations of c onfusion. As at 5 Marc h 2007 (more than a year after marketing began), only 11 of the 36 units in the Yio Chu Kang projec t were sold, unlike some of the defendant’s other projec ts whic h sold out within 6 to 8 months of their launc h. (At the time of the trial, only one unit remained unsold.) The defendant submitted that the name Amanusa therefore did not help in driving the sales. 

33     From the plaintiffs’ sales broc hures and other promotional materials and their trademark c ertific ates (relating to their Aman-prefixed marks), it was c lear that the plaintiffs were not in the business of building residential and c ommerc ial properties for sale or lease to homeowners. The plaintiffs were in the business of providing leisure, retreat, rec reational, spa and other suc h servic es within the luxurious and expensive resorts and hotels owned or operated by them. The ac c ommodation provided by them was short-term stay in the resorts and hotels. 

34     The plaintiffs’ business c atered to very well-to-do and high net worth individuals. The room rates for Amanusa in Bali were between USD700 and USD 1,500 per night, not inc luding 10% servic e c harge and 11% government tax. The range of room rates for the plaintiffs’ other resorts in Bali was similar to Amanusa’s. Out of the 1,382 guests from Singapore between 1995 and 2005, many were probably repeat guests (the so-c alled “Aman junkies”). The plaintiffs’ villas and homes were adjac ent to and were part of the relevant resorts, enjoying the same amenities suc h as tennis c ourts and fitness c entres. They were owned by others but managed by the plaintiffs and c atered to a different c ategory of guests from those in the resorts, suc h as those with large families or those who want 


their privac y. The rates for the villas were similarly very high. It was thus evident that the plaintiffs and the defendants c atered to different market segments and different c lientele. 

35     Purc hasers of real estate in Singapore would generally be disc erning and c autious, c onsidering other fac tors suc h as pric e, loc ation, amenities and the reputation of the developer before making a c ommitment. Ordinary Singaporeans wishing to travel overseas for holiday were highly unlikely to find themselves in the Yio Chu Kang projec t thinking that they were in the midst of the plaintiff’s luxurious Amanusa resort. The plaintiffs’ fear of c onfusion or dec eption was unfounded or imaginary. This was borne out by three of the defendant’s purc hasers who testified at the trial that when they bought their respec tive units in April 2006 and in April 2007, they had not heard of the plaintiffs’ resorts and did not dec ide to buy bec ause of the name Amanusa. One of them was an Indonesian businessman who travelled frequently between Jakarta and Singapore. Another, a Singaporean lady, testified that her husband did some researc h on the Internet about the Yio Chu Kang projec t before buying a unit and c hanc ed upon the plaintiffs’ website, [http://www.amanresorts.c](http://www.amanresorts.c) om, and the Amanusa resort. However, the sales agent marketing the Yio Chu Kang projec t merely said that he had heard of a resort somewhere having the same name and did not c laim any c onnec tion between the Yio Chu Kang projec t and the Amanusa resort. 

36     Chan Sze Chin (“Chan”) of JGP Arc hitec ture (S) Pte Ltd, the arc hitec ts for the Yio Chu Kang projec t, explained how the name Amanusa was eventually c hosen for the said projec t. His c olleagues and the defendant’s other c onsultants met for brainstorming sessions for a suitable name for the projec t, keeping Chan informed of the progress as he was its c onc ept arc hitec t. They were all aware of the guidelines set out by the Street and Building Names Board that the c hoic e of name should reflec t and reinforc e the Singaporean c harac ter of the loc ality of the site. They c onsidered “Casc ading Waters” and “Tropic al Waters” but dec ided that these were too mundane and lac ked appeal. From experienc e, they knew that using a non-English name, suc h as “Les Jardins de Hollande”, c ould help to drive sales. However, as the projec t had a tropic al theme, Frenc h names were inappropriate. They then turned to the dominant languages in south-east Asia, namely, Bahasa Indonesia and Malay. 

37     They dec ided to leverage on the tranquillity of the projec t’s surroundings and “peac eful” c ame to mind. Two possible equivalent words in the said dominant languages for “peac eful” were “aman” and “sentosa”. The latter was rejec ted as it would be assoc iated with our southern island bearing that name. Having dec ided on Aman, they c onsidered words that c ould c apture the setting as well. They c ame upon the term “nusantara” meaning “arc hipelago”. However, the word was too long and it was dec ided that it would be shortened to “Nusa” meaning “island”, whic h would c onvey the impression of an oasis and sanc tuary, the very ambienc e they were seeking to c reate. 

38     After dec iding on the two c omponents, they had to dec ide on the order of the two words in a way that c ould be easily pronounc ed and remembered. Amanusa was preferred over Nusa Aman as the former “rolled off the tongue more easily”. One of the “n”s was dropped bec ause the double “n” would c ause the reader to pause before pronounc ing the word as it would be very diffic ult to pronounc e. Sinc e it was a name, it would be easier to have one word instead of two. For instanc e, in one projec t, the two Malay words “tanah” and “merah” were c ompressed into “tanamera”. It was felt that the name would adequately c apture the design c onc ept for the Yio Chu Kang projec t. The brainstorming team members were not aware of the plaintiffs’ Amanusa resort then although Chan had heard of Amanpuri in Phuket, Thailand. However, he foresaw no diffic ulty as that resort was c ompletely different in many aspec ts from the Yio Chu Kang projec t and it never c rossed his mind that any sensible person would objec t to the use of the name Amanusa on the ground of c onfusion with Amanpuri. The c hoic e of name was therefore not influenc ed in any way by the plaintiffs’ Aman resorts and hotels. 


39     On 8 September 2005, the Street and Building Names Board approved the name Amanusa unc onditionally and stated that no request for a c hange of name would be entertained. Chan and his team were aware that the said board would not approve a proposed name if it was identic al with or substantially similar to the name of an existing development here or elsewhere suc h that there was a likelihood of c onfusion. For instanc e, the defendant had originally wanted to name its Bluwaters residential development as Twin Waters but that name was rejec ted as there was a resort known as Twin Waters in Australia, something Chan and his team were not aware of. That earlier unsuc c essful applic ation showed that the said board did c hec ks with names of developments and resorts in other c ountries. 

40     When Chan was asked by the c ourt whether the team c hec ked the c oined word Amanusa on the Internet, he replied that it did not bec ause it knew that the proposed name would have to be approved by the Street and Building Names Board and there would therefore be some form of c hec king already. The team thought the name sounded nic e and was quite c omfortable with it. 

41     Huttons took over the marketing of the Yio Chu Kang projec t from Marc h 2007. Jerry (see [21] above) testified that he and the other sales agents of Huttons were briefed by their projec t direc tor on the Yio Chu Kang projec t. They were told spec ific ally that the said projec t was not related to or assoc iated with the Amanusa in Bali in any way. They were also instruc ted not to link the projec t to the Bali resort. In addition, all purc hasers of units in the said projec t would have to sign a dec laration form ac knowledging and agreeing that their request for an option to purc hase and their subsequent exerc ise of the same “do not c onfer upon me/us any right or interest in respec t of the name “Amanusa” and that the name does not and will not c onstitute a c onsideration influenc ing my/our dec ision to exerc ise the option to purc hase”. Jerry understood this to mean that the purc hasers would be informed thereby that the Yio Chu Kang projec t was not related to the Amanusa resort in Bali. Jerry did not know the reason behind the “unprec edented step” although he had heard rumours there was a legal dispute regarding the projec t’s name. It did not matter to him as he knew from experienc e that Singaporeans did not usually c are about the name of housing developments unless it sounded inauspic ious. 

42     Jerry c omplied with the above instruc tions in all his dealings with prospec tive purc hasers. On 26 Marc h 2007, when the private investigator, Leong (see [21] above), and his c ompanion visited the sales offic e, Jerry did not volunteer any information about the name Amanusa. His only referenc e to “resort living” was when he wanted to illustrate his point that having a home in the Yio Chu Kang projec t would resemble resort living. It was only when Leong talked about the name of the projec t that Jerry replied that he was aware of a resort of that name. However, Jerry did not suggest any linkage between the projec t and the Amanusa resort. No other prospec tive purc haser showed any interest in the name of the projec t. 

43     Another of Huttons’ sales agents, Jason (see [22] above, whose ac tual name is Sua Ting Kuang), c onfirmed the instruc tions spelt out by Jerry above. When he met Kelley and her c ompanion at the sales offic e on 30 Marc h 2007, towards the end of his sales pitc h, the private investigators c ommented that the Yio Chu Kang projec t looked exc lusive. Eager to make small talk, Jason replied that “it was bec ause the projec t was named after the resort”. As prospec tive purc hasers were generally not interested in the name of a projec t, he had not bothered to do any researc h about the resort “other than what [he] had heard from [his] c olleagues”. When pressed further about the resort, he therefore hazarded a guess that it must be an expensive resort in some western c ountry. At no time did he say that the projec t was linked to the Amanusa resort, whic h he had not heard of then. Like Jerry, Jason was also of the view that prospec tive purc hasers of property in Singapore were not interested in a projec t’s name unless it happened to sound inauspic ious. He believed it to be highly unlikely that anyone would c onfuse the Yio Chu Kang projec t with the Amanusa in Bali. 


44     By 30 Marc h 2007, the defendant had modified its hardc over sales broc hure. For instanc e, on the outer c over, a thatc hed roof at the top right c orner and a water spout featuring a mythic al c reature were erased in the later version. In the write-up inside, the word “Balinese” was omitted from the sentenc e “Borrowing from a hybrid of modern and tropic al arc hitec tural style, Amanusa, whic h translates to “peac eful isle”, sets the sc ene for a true Balinese experienc e”. 

45     Bharat Dharmadas Kalwani (“Bharat”), brother of Manoj (see [26] above), a direc tor of the defendant and the group president and c hief exec utive offic er of the Novelty Group, affirmed an affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief whic h was admitted in evidenc e without the deponent being c alled as there was no c hallenge to his evidenc e. His evidenc e addressed the statement by the plaintiffs’ Gregory Sirois that the defendant had links with the hotel and resort business bec ause of Bharat’s involvement with a c ompany c alled Royal Woods Resort Pte Ltd (“Royal Woods”) whose business ac tivities were listed as “c ountry and golf c lubs” and “real estate ac tivities on a fee or c ontrac t basis”. 

46     Bharat stated that there were only three c ompanies within the Novelty Group whic h were involved in the hotel or resort business. One of these (Royal Woods Resort Pte Ltd) bought land in Australia in 1995 for the purpose of building a residential development. However, before it c ould build, the property market there suffered a downturn. It then dec ided to build and market the development as a time-share resort. Shortly thereafter, suc h resorts rec eived bad public ity in the media and so, around the year 2000, the c ompany started leasing the units on short-term tenanc ies as vac ation ac c ommodation. The time-share memberships that were already issued c ontinued alongside the said tenanc ies. 

47     Bharat was not involved in the daily operations of that c ompany although he was one of its direc tors as he had many other c ompanies to take c are of. The c ontrol and management of that c ompany and the resort were entirely in the hands of his sister. 

**The decision of the court** 

48     In _CDL Hotels International Ltd v Pontiac Marina Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 550</span> (“the _Millenia_ c ase”), our Court of Appeal said (at [86]): 

 In c onc lusion, it would be helpful to remind ourselves of the essential elements of the tort of passing off. Lord Oliver in Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc (supra) gave the following summary at p 406: 

 The law of passing off c an be summarised in one short general proposition – no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More spec ific ally, it may be expressed in terms of the elements whic h the plaintiff in suc h an ac tion has to prove in order to suc c eed. These are three in number. First, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attac hed to the goods or servic es whic h he supplies in the mind of the purc hasing public by assoc iation with the identifying ‘get-up’ (whether it c onsists simply of a brand name or a trade desc ription, or the individual features of labelling or pac kaging) under whic h his partic ular goods or servic es are offered to the public , suc h that the get-up is rec ognised by the public as distinc tive spec ific ally of the plaintiff’s goods or servic es. Sec ondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or servic es offered by him are the goods or servic es of the plaintiff. Whether the public is aware of the plaintiff’s identity as the manufac turer or supplier of the goods or servic es is immaterial, as long as they are identified with a partic ular sourc e whic h is in fac t the plaintiff. For example, if the public is ac c ustomed to rely upon a 


 partic ular brand name in purc hasing goods of a partic ular desc ription, it matters not at all that there is little or no public awareness of the identity of the proprietor of the brand name. Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in a quia timet ac tion that he is likely to suffer, damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant’s misrepresentation that the sourc e of the defendant’s goods or servic es is the same as the sourc e of those offered by the plaintiff. 

 These pronounc ements were made with referenc e to the business of sale of goods in that c ase but they are equally applic able to the business of provision of servic es, suc h as in the instant c ase. The respondents had suc c essfully showed that the three elements of passing off were present: goodwill, misrepresentation and probability of damage. ... 

49     The plaintiffs’ brand name Amanusa is distinc tive bec ause it is a portmanteau word invented through the c lever use of intentional syntax error c oupled with sync opation by dropping one “n”. Inc identally, the _Millenia_ c ase also c onc erned a dispute over a word (Millennia) whic h had one of its “n”s omitted (to bec ome Millenia), like the word Amanusa here. There is no suc h word as Amanusa in the Indonesian language. This was not in dispute. The brand name Aman, although a desc riptive word (meaning “peac e” or “peac eful”) standing by itself, is also a fanc y mark when used in relation to hotels and resorts as it is not merely desc ribing the plaintiffs’ goods and servic es. Aman hotel and Aman resort c an be and are as distinc tive as the Hotel de la Paix (“paix” being the Frenc h word for “peac e”) and the Peac e Hotel in Shanghai, China. 

50     The plaintiffs’ brand names Aman and Amanusa did have goodwill in Singapore (before 2006), as evidenc ed by their nearly two dec ades of history, their huge sales revenue worldwide (more than 35% of whic h is attributable to its Singapore offic e) and their substantial promotional and marketing expenditure. The fac t that there is no Aman resort in Singapore is immaterial (see _Sheraton Corp of America v Sheraton Motels Ltd_ [1964] RPC 202). Although the plaintiffs did not advertise through the traditional media of newspapers and television, they have asserted their presenc e through other means, suc h as their promotional materials to travel agents, c ollaboration with airlines and c redit c ard c ompanies in targeting high net worth individuals, their newsletters to c ustomers in Singapore and elsewhere and their more than 20 domain names over the Internet (all of whic h are hosted here). 

51     In luxury markets suc h as this, an artic le in a periodic al about the Aman resorts may build their reputation more effec tively than paid advertisements in the usual media. As the trial judge in the _Millenia_ c ase, Chao Hic k Tin J (as he then was), said (see <span class="citation">[1997] 3 SLR 726</span> at [50]): 

 Advertising in the press and other media is of c ourse an obvious means and perhaps the most expeditious means. But if there are reports in the media extolling the virtues or exc ellenc e of a servic e I fail to understand why that should be disregarded. I would have thought the important thing is what is the message that is being c onveyed, not whether the owners pay for the media’s spac e or time. It is the message that c ounts. If the press or a periodic al should do a write-up on RCMS arguably, in terms of goodwill, that c ould even be better than a paid advertisement. The public ation of broc hures and material c ould also generate goodwill. The launc h of the Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore on 17 Oc tober 1994 c ould just as muc h help to establish goodwill, at least among those invited guests, who were people from the industry or people who had an interest in the projec t or were influential. 

The plaintiffs have adduc ed in evidenc e many independent public ations, foreign and loc al, desc ribing the Aman resorts and the Amanusa with superlatives. These were not c onfined to spec ialist travel magazines or public ations targeted at well-to-do readers. They inc luded periodic als of general interest and mass appeal suc h as Female, Time and Her World. 


52     In the _Millenia_ c ase, a hotel whic h was in the proc ess of c onstruc tion suc c eeded in its c laim that it had goodwill in its name. In the instant c ase, the first Aman resort has been in operation sinc e 1988, the Amanusa has been in existenc e sinc e 1992 and the plaintiffs’ International Reservations Offic e has been operating here sinc e 2001. The plaintiffs did allow their Amanusa trademark registration in Singapore in respec t of international c lasses 3, 16, 25 and 42 to lapse for ec onomic reasons but c learly, there was never any intention to stop usage of the Aman and Amanusa brand names here. 

53     Some 1382 Singaporeans visited the Amanusa resort in Bali between 1995 and 2005. This resort is just one out of three Aman resorts on that island. The number of visitors to the Amanusa may not be astronomic al (espec ially if, as the defendant suggested, a number of these are repeat visitors) but that is largely due to the fac t that Aman resorts are not numbers-oriented. For example, the Amanusa has only 35 villas and the Aman resorts worldwide have only 626 rooms. In the same way that ultraluxury c ars are not produc ed nor purc hased in large numbers, the statistic s merely reinforc ed the exc lusivity and uniqueness of the resorts. I am of the view therefore that the plaintiffs did have goodwill and reputation here in its Aman resorts in 2006, when the Yio Chu Kang projec t was marketed to the public , and even earlier. The Aman and Amanusa names were and are wholly distinc tive of the plaintiffs. 

54     Where misrepresentation is c onc erned, _The Law of Passing-Off_ by Christopher Wadlow, 2004 Ed, has this to say (at paragraphs 1-9, 5-5 and 5-8): 

 The misrepresentation in passing-off is almost always c onveyed by the defendant adopting for his own goods or business some material suc h as a name, mark, get-up or other sign whic h is dec eptively similar to material distinc tive of the c laimant. The misrepresentation is deemed to be made as soon as suc h goods are released into c irc ulation, even if the immediate rec ipients are traders who are not themselves dec eived. 

 ... 

 The misrepresentation need not relate to goods, but may be to the effec t that the businesses of the c laimant and the defendant are the same, or have merged, or that one is a branc h, agenc y, subsidiary of the other; or, more generally, that the defendant has any c onnec tion with the c laimant that is likely to c ause damage ... 

 ... 

 Most importantly, the misrepresentation in passing-off need not be made fraudulently or with any intention to dec eive: “c alc ulated” in Lord Diploc k’s speec h in Advocaat means likely rather than intended. The only c ontinuing importanc e of fraud is for its evidential value. 

55     Our Court of Appeal in the _Millenia_ c ase said (at [72]) that in an ac tion where one party is seeking to prevent an apprehended misrepresentation by another, the test is whether there is a real risk that the defendant’s representation would dec eive a substantial number of persons of the relevant sec tion of the public into believing either that the goods or servic es of the defendant are those of the plaintiff or that there is a business c onnec tion between the plaintiff and the defendant in relation to the goods or servic es provided by them. The Court of Appeal went on to state (at [73]): 

 Whether there is a ‘substantial number of persons among the relevant sec tion of the public ’ depends on the partic ular c irc umstanc es of eac h c ase. A ‘substantial number’ does not nec essarily mean a large proportion of the public. In Neutrogena Corpn v Golden Ltd 


 [1996] RPC 473, the suc c essful plaintiffs did not have a huge perc entage of the market. Its produc t, namely, shampoo, only had 0.25% of the market, but it was held that a substantial number of members of the public would be misled into thinking that the defendants’ produc ts were those of the plaintiffs. 

56     The _Millenia_ c ase was c onc erned about the similarity between the words ‘Millenia’ and ‘Millennium’, eac h of whic h appeared with some other words to identify a partic ular hotel. In the present c ase, we are dealing with two developments bearing exac tly the same name – nothing more, nothing less than Amanusa. It matters not that different fonts or c olours are used by the parties in setting out the name. Amanusa, in whatever font or hue, will still be pronounc ed the same way and any name searc h on the Internet will present both the Bali resort and the Yio Chu Kang projec t in the results. The plaintiffs’ burden is therefore lightened to the extent that they do not have to demonstrate the visual or aural similarities between their name and that used by the defendant. 

57     The relevant sec tion of the public in the present c ase would enc ompass Singapore c itizens or residents who have visited the Aman resorts onc e or more times or are prospec tive visitors to the resorts, foreign individuals and c orporations here intending to visit the resorts or seeking to invest in high-end properties (and there is a substantial number of foreign entities here) and developers and hoteliers interested in bec oming lic ensees of the Aman brand names. Conc eivably, there would also be a portion of the more than 300,000 Singapore visitors to Bali sinc e 1995 who have read about or heard of the three Aman resorts there. As stated earlier, when dealing with luxury goods and servic es c atering to those who think nothing of spending USD700 or more per night, it should not be surprising that the number of people patronising Aman resorts or who are familiar with their goods and servic es is a relatively small one. That does not detrac t from the reality that those goods and servic es are well known to those for whom they are designed. 

58     Although the risk of c onfusion will inc rease if the parties are in mutual c ompetition, it is settled law that they need not be in c ommon fields of enterprise (see The _Millenia_ c ase at [63]). It must be borne in mind that today’s businesses tend not only to expand geographic ally, there is also a perc eptible trend that brand names do not c onfine themselves to the original produc ts or servic es whic h made them famous, even though suc h produc ts or servic es may remain their c ore c ompetenc e, but may diversify into other areas, whether related or not. For instanc e, Dunhill has long c eased to be only a famous brand of tobac c o. The parameters of different industries are also being c onstantly redrawn by c onvergenc e and re-definition. Convergenc e of erstwhile disparate areas in elec tronic s is already an established fac t. 

59     Similarly, the dividing line between purely residential developments and luxury hotel/resort developments is no longer pronounc ed. The law should rec ognise suc h c hanging business prac tic es and c onditions. Here, the defendant’s Yio Chu Kang projec t bears the same c oined name as the plaintiffs’ Bali resort. That nexus in itself is bad enough. Further, the Yio Chu Kang projec t is also being billed as having the atmosphere of a Bali resort and has features of Balinese arc hitec tural style. There is a signific ant body of persons in Singapore who have heard of the Aman resorts, partic ularly Amanusa in this c ase. The use of an identic al name for the Yio Chu Kang projec t would give them the impression that it is somehow related or c onnec ted to the plaintiffs, perhaps by way of lic enc e to use the name or that the development has the plaintiffs’ endorsement and will in future be managed by them. It may even c onvey the wrong impression that the plaintiffs are involved as developers. The prec ise nature of suc h relationship or c onnec tion is not material and the degree of c onnec tion would depend on the partic ular fac ts of eac h c ase. The husband of one of the defendant’s witnesses (a purc haser of a unit in the Yio Chu Kang projec t) c ertainly drew suc h a c onnec tion when he asked the marketing agent whether the Yio Chu Kang projec t had anything to do with the Amanusa resort in Bali. Another of the defendant’s purc hasers ac knowledged that, if he had heard about the Aman 


resorts, he would have to c hec k whether the Yio Chu Kang projec t was related to them. 

60     It is no answer to an allegation of misrepresentation in suc h a c ase to say that one c ould easily c hec k the fac ts with the defendant or its agents or through its sales broc hures (whic h would indic ate the name of the developers for the projec t) or otherwise c hec k with the plaintiffs or other independent sourc es. The defendant should also not be allowed to say that the relevant sec tion of the public in this c ase would tend to be more intelligent and would verify matters whic h they are not c ertain about. The fac t that suc h c hec king or verific ation is required is itself evidenc e of c onfusion. Even if the defendant were to publish a disc laimer of any c onnec tion to the Aman resorts, that would not help dispel future c onfusion bec ause the Amanusa name will remain in doc uments relating to addresses and will, in all probability, be displayed at the main gate of the Yio Chu Kang projec t. On this point, it should also be noted that it is not nec essary to show any c onfusion oc c asioned by the misrepresentation although c onfusion is of great evidential value in determining whether or not there has been misrepresentation (see The _Millenia_ c ase at [71]). 

61     I therefore ac c epted that there was misrepresentation in the c irc umstanc es. What I did not ac c ept was the allegation that suc h misrepresentation was fraudulent on the part of the defendant in that it had a “fraudulent intent to dec eive” (see the pleadings set out at [23] above). There is no monopoly in a partic ular c ountry’s style of arc hitec ture or theme (for instanc e, Balinese style or Japanese Garden). The defendant or its agents did not deliberately and dec eptively portray the Yio Chu Kang projec t as being c onnec ted to the Amanusa resort. There may have been passing remarks that there is a resort by that name in Bali or elsewhere but that is still far from fraudulently c laiming or implying a c onnec tion between the two. There may also have been some plagiarism in that some nic e-sounding, laudatory phrases used in literature to desc ribe the Amanusa resort were used in the defendant’s sales broc hure to desc ribe the Yio Chu Kang projec t but, again, that falls short of fraud. 

62     However, I did not ac c ept the defendant’s evidenc e as to how the Yio Chu Kang projec t’s name was given birth to by the c reative invention of inversion of two words. It would be muc h too c oinc idental that the defendant c hanc ed on the same two foreign words and dec ided to fuse them in exac tly the same way as the plaintiffs did some 15 years earlier in respec t of a resort whic h also had a Balinese theme. This is reinforc ed by the defendant’s initial c laims in the c orrespondenc e that the name meant “peac eful motherland” when its ac tual meaning was already in the sales broc hure. In this Internet age, it is also hard to believe that no searc h whatsoever was made to see if the invented word ac tually existed in some language and, if so, whether it c ould possibly mean something quite unintended or even untoward. This is espec ially so when the defendant ac knowledged that it was aware that the Street and Building Names Board would not permit a name to be used if it was similar to a development here or elsewhere. The members of the brainstorming team would surely want to do some researc h so that their proposed name would not be rejec ted outright on this ground, thereby c ausing a delay in the launc h of the Yio Chu Kang projec t for want of a name. The reluc tanc e to ac knowledge that a searc h was c onduc ted on the Internet was most definitely bec ause any suc h searc h would have shown the name was that of the plaintiffs’ resort in Bali. I believe that the defendant’s arc hitec t was inspired by the Amanusa resort whic h he must have read about or seen pic tures of in the c ourse of his work or researc h and that he tried to replic ate the ambienc e of a Balinese resort and, at the same time, pay the sinc erest form of c ompliment by c opying the famous name. 

63     The plaintiffs do not have to prove ac tual damage to suc c eed in this ac tion. A probability of damage suffic es but the ac tual or probable damage must be to their goodwill in respec t of their trade or business ( _Nation Fittings (M) Sdn Bhd v Oystertec Plc and anor_ <span class="citation">[2006] 1 SLR 712</span>). The plaintiffs c laimed the following heads of damage: 


 (a) loss of lic ensing opportunity or inc ome (see Lego System Aktieselskab v Lego M Lemelstrich [1983] FSR 155); 

 (b) inferiority of the defendant’s goods and servic es (see Rolls-Royce Motors Ltd v Zanelli [1979] RPC 148); 

 (c ) likelihood of damage should the defendant get into financ ial, legal or other trouble (see British Legion v British Legion Club (Street) Ltd (1931) 48 RPC 555); 

 (d) misappropriation of the plaintiffs’ goodwill and reputation (see Lloyd’s v Lloyd’s (Southampton) Ltd (1912) 29 RPC 433); 

 (e) restric tion on the plaintiffs’ natural expansion into residential real estate (see Eastman Photographic Materials Co Ltd v Griffiths (John) Cycle Corp Ltd (1898) 15 RPC 105); 

 (f ) loss of exc lusivity and erosion of distinc tiveness (see Taylor Bros v Taylor Group [1988] 2 NZLR 1); 

 (g) dilution of the brand name (see the Millenia c ase). 

64     The evidenc e shows that none of the purc hasers of units in the Yio Chu Kang projec t did so on the misunderstanding that it was related to the Aman group or to Amanusa resort. Ac tual damage was therefore not shown. It is also unlikely that future purc hasers (by sub-sale or re-sale) would buy on the basis of suc h misunderstanding. This is bec ause purc hasing real estate is not quite the same as buying a shirt or a handbag. The former would invariably involve some preliminary work or researc h and further disc ussions or even viewing before a deal is finalised. Any misunderstanding would be dispelled by suc h ac tivities (although, as stated at [60] above, this is no answer to an allegation of misrepresentation). 

65     For a c ase like the present, the most potent form of likely damage is the intangible loss that may be oc c asioned by the insidious proc ess of dilution suc h that the famous name loses its uniqueness or, worse, suc h that the name whic h inspired hushed awe c ould in future evoke suppressed laughter bec ause of the assoc iation with projec ts that do not quite exude the same luxury and c lass or quality of upkeep, espec ially when residential projec ts have begun to show their age. As experienc e shows, this is partic ularly true for developments whic h c ontain shared c ommon property. I find the following c omments of our Court of Appeal in the _Millenia_ c ase (at [84]) to be highly appropriate for this c ase, bearing in mind of c ourse that the parties in that c ase were both in the hotel industry: 

 The c onc ern here is the public ’s perc eption that RCMS, Millenia Tower and Millenia Walk are assoc iated with or related to the Millennium hotels of the appellants and suc h assoc iation would be likely to result in a dilution of the respondents’ goodwill in their business. The respondents have ac quired goodwill in their business at the Millenia c omplex whic h is inextric ably assoc iated with the use of the name ‘Millenia’. In so far as the hotel industry is c onc erned, RCMS symbolises world c lass quality and prestige with top-of-the-range servic es and amenities. The appellants’ hotels in Singapore are of a lower c lass and quality and are more ec onomic ally pric ed. Hotel guests pay a premium to stay at RCMS. It would be c ommerc ially damaging for a business of a super deluxe ‘five-star’ hotel, as RCMS is, to be assoc iated with that of a ‘four-star’ hotel, whic h the appellants’ hotels admittedly are. 

Visitors to Aman resorts, like the guests at RCMS (The RitzCarlton, Millenia Singapore), pay a 


premium to stay at the resorts. On the other hand, as emphasized by the defendant and its c ounsel, the Yio Chu Kang projec t’s target buyers were people looking for reasonably-pric ed landed property (the listed pric es for most of the units ranged from $1.3m to $1.45m, with the most expensive unit pric ed at $1.8m). Although the defendant did assert that its projec ts were well known for their high quality finishes and imported fixtures, I doubt the Yio Chu Kang projec t would be c apable of replic ating the ambienc e and spac iousness of the plaintiffs’ resorts. I quote the words of one of the visitors to the defendant’s sales offic e, who responded to the defendant’s questionnaire asking whether the word Amanusa meant anything to him by answering, “means spa; alone; serene – but the development is totally opposite to its meaning. Very c rowded” (emphasis in original)(see page 302 of Manoj’s affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief). 

66     I also ac c epted that the plaintiffs would be deprived of lic ensing revenue if developers were permitted to appropriate the Aman names for their residential projec ts. As shown in evidenc e, the defendant has named its other projec ts using names with a c ommon theme, for example, the Taipan series and the “metal” series. The plaintiffs were rightfully wary that the defendant, if not stopped in its trac ks now, would start an Aman series, using the names of its various resorts. The plaintiffs would also be prejudic ed in any future c ommerc ial plans to expand into residential developments here, whether alone or in partnership with others, if they did not seek to protec t their Aman names now. 

67     The sec ond aspec t of the plaintiffs’ c laim is that their trade marks are well known marks within the meaning of s 55 of the Trade Marks Ac t, the relevant portions of whic h provide: 

 (1) A well known trade mark shall be entitled to protec tion under this sec tion – 

 (a) whether or not the trade mark has been registered in Singapore, or an applic ation for the registration of the trade mark has been made to the Registrar; and 

 (b) whether or not the proprietor of the trade mark c arries on business, or has any goodwill, in Singapore. 

 ... 

 (3) Subjec t to subsec tions (6) and (7), the proprietor of a well known trade mark shall be entitled to restrain by injunc tion the use in Singapore, in the c ourse of trade and without the proprietor’s c onsent, of any trade mark whic h, or an essential part of whic h, is identic al with or similar to the proprietor’s trade mark, in relation to any goods or servic es, where the use of the trade mark 

 (a) would indic ate a c onnec tion between those goods or servic es and the proprietor, and is likely to damage the interests of the proprietor; or 

 (b) if the proprietor’s trade mark is well known to the public at large in Singapore – 

 (i) would c ause dilution in an unfair manner of the distinc tive c harac ter of the proprietor’s trade mark; or 

 (ii) would take unfair advantage of the distinc tive c harac ter of the proprietor’s trade mark. 

 ... 


 (11) For the purposes of this sec tion and sec tions 55A, 56, 57 and 59, “use”, in relation to a trade mark, means use within the meaning of sec tion 27(4). 

The plaintiffs are relying on only s 55(3)(a) for their c ase. 

68     Sec tion 2(1) of the Trade Marks Ac t defines “well known trade mark” as: 

 (a) any registered trade mark that is well known in Singapore; or 

 (b) any unregistered trade mark that is well known in Singapore and that belongs to a person who – 

 (i) is a national of a Convention c ountry; or 

 (ii) is domic iled in, or has a real and effec tive industrial or c ommerc ial establishment in, a Convention c ountry, 

 whether or not that person c arries on business, or has any goodwill, in Singapore. 

69     Sec tion 2(7), (8) and (9), whic h are also c onc erned with well known trade marks, provide: 

 (7) Subjec t to subsec tion (8), in dec iding, for the purposes of this Ac t, whether a trade mark is well known in Singapore, it shall be relevant to take into ac c ount any matter from whic h it may be inferred that the trade mark is well known, inc luding suc h of the following matters as may be relevant: 

 ( a ) the degree to whic h the trade mark is known to or rec ognised by any relevant sec tor of the public in Singapore; 

 ( b ) the duration, extent and geographic al area of – 

 (i) any use of the trade mark; or 

 (ii) any promotion of the trade mark, inc luding any advertising of, any public ity given to, or any presentation at any fair or exhibition of, the goods or servic es to whic h the trade mark is applied; 

 ( c ) any registration or applic ation for the registration of the trade mark in any c ountry or territory in whic h the trade mark is used or rec ognised, and the duration of suc h registration or applic ation; 

 ( d ) any suc c essful enforc ement of any right in the trade mark in any c ountry or territory, and the extent to whic h the trade mark was rec ognised as well known by the c ompetent authorities of that c ountry or territory; 

 ( e ) any value assoc iated with the trade mark. 

 (8) Where it is determined that a trade mark is well known to any relevant sec tor of the public in Singapore, the trade mark shall be deemed to be well known in Singapore. 

 (9) In subsec tions (7) and (8), “relevant sec tor of the public in Singapore” inc ludes any of the following: 


 ( a ) all ac tual c onsumers and potential c onsumers in Singapore of the goods or servic es to whic h the trade mark is applied; 

 ( b ) all persons in Singapore involved in the distribution of the goods or servic es to whic h the trade mark is applied; 

 ( c ) all businesses and c ompanies in Singapore dealing in the goods or servic es to whic h the trade mark is applied. 

The fac tors set out in s 2(7) are guidelines and not pre-c onditions for determining whether a mark in question is a well known trade mark. They do not prec lude the c onsideration of other matters not listed therein whic h may be found to be relevant in a partic ular c ase, whether by themselves or in c ombination with the listed fac tors. 

70     The defendant submitted that the “relevant sec tor of the public in Singapore” must refer to the ac tual and/or potential c onsumers of the defendant’s goods and not the plaintiffs’. If it were otherwise, it argued, it would be very easy for a mark to be well known bec ause it would obviously be rec ognised by those who use, distribute or deal with those goods. Alternatively, the defendant c ontended that the relevant sec tor ought to be the “buying public who are ac tual and potential c onsumers of hotel and resort servic es, not the plaintiffs’ ac tual and potential c ustomers”. However, a c areful reading shows that “ _the_ trade mark” in s 2(7), (8) and (9) all relate to _a_ trade mark whic h is alleged to be well known and that the goods or servic es in s 2(9)(a) to (c ) are all qualified by “to whic h _the_ trade mark is applied”. The phrase must therefore refer to the plaintiffs’ goods or servic es, sinc e the trade mark in question would be the plaintiffs’ and would be applied to the plaintiffs’ goods or servic es and not those of the defendant. The c ategories in s 2(9) are also not exhaustive as seen in the use of the word “inc ludes”. Sec tion 2(7)(a) requires the _degree_ of rec ognition by the said relevant sec tor to be c onsidered as well. 

71     As indic ated earlier, the Aman brand name in respec t of high-end hotel and resort servic es was well known in Singapore to its ac tual and potential c ustomers as well as the people in the travel and leisure industry before 2006, when the defendant started marketing the Yio Chu Kang projec t. The plaintiffs have used the name Aman and its trade marks c ontaining the prefix Aman for their resorts and servic es. They have also used suc h names at promotional events, for donations to c haritable func tions and on broc hures. The Aman resorts have a wide geographic al reac h. They are spread over 12 c ountries, inc luding South-East Asian ones like Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. Further, the plaintiffs are involved in new ac c ommodation in many c ountries. Their resorts have been lauded as the best resort c hain by periodic als here and elsewhere. 

72     The plaintiffs also have trade mark registration for their names in various c lasses of the International Classific ation of Goods and Servic es and, until a few years ago, were proprietors of the Amanusa trade mark in Singapore. Administrative panels of the World Intellec tual Property Organization, in 2 dec isions pertaining to domain name disputes, have ac knowledged that the plaintiffs were well known as Amanresorts and that the Aman group was well known in the premium end of the hotel and resort market. All relevant fac tors point to the fac t that the Aman names are well known in Singapore. The relevant sec tor of the public here would c learly have a high degree of rec ognition of the exc lusive Aman names too and, by virtue of s 2(8) of the Trade Marks Ac t, they are deemed to be well known in Singapore. 

73     In s 2(1) of the Trade Marks Ac t, “trade mark” means any sign c apable of being represented graphic ally and whic h is c apable of distinguishing goods or servic es dealt with or provided in the 


c ourse of trade by a person from goods or servic es so dealt with or provided by any other person and “sign” inc ludes any word, name or brand. Names of buildings may be registered as trade marks under c lass 6 (“buildings of metal”) and c lass 19 (“buildings, not of metal”) of the International Classific ation of Goods and Servic es. The defendant has “used” the sign Amanusa within the meaning of s 27(4) by applying it to its “goods” (the Yio Chu Kang projec t) and offering the development for sale under that name. There is also no dispute that the defendant has “used” Amanusa in advertising (in the media, in its sales broc hure and in direc tional signs to its sales offic e). Suc h use was in the c ourse of trade (i.e. for c ommerc ial purposes) and without the plaintiffs’ c onsent. 

74     In my view, the tests to be adopted for “c onnec tion” and “is likely to damage the interests of the proprietor” in s 55(3)(a) of the Trade Marks Ac t are no different from those enunc iated in c ase law on passing-off. I have already indic ated my findings in respec t of the “c onnec tion” (see [59] and [60] above) and the likely damage to the plaintiffs’ interests (see [63] to [66] above). They are equally applic able to the c laim under s 55(3)(a). In _The TRIPS Agreement: Drafting History and_ 

_Analysis_ by Daniel Gervais, 2nd Ed (2003)(at paragraph 2.171), it is said that the test “likely to damage” (in s 55(3)(a)) should be given a liberal interpretation sinc e a simple likelihood of damage suffic es and that suc h likelihood should be established objec tively and supported by evidenc e. In the _Joint Recommendation Concerning Provisions on the Protection of Well-Known Marks_ , adopted by the Assembly of the Paris Union for the Protec tion of Industrial Property and the General Assembly of the World Intellec tual Property Organization, published in 2000, the Notes on Artic le 4 (whic h is about Conflic ting Marks) state: 

 4. 2 Paragraph (1)(b) is applic able irrespec tive of the nature of the goods and/or servic es to whic h the c onflic ting mark applies. ... 

 4. 3 Item (i). Under this item, a c onnec tion between a well-known mark and a third party’s goods or servic es may be indic ated, for example, if the impression is c reated that the owner of the well-known mark is involved in the produc tion of those goods, or the offering of those servic es, or that suc h produc tion or offering was lic ensed or sponsored by him. The interests of the owner of the well-known mark c ould be damaged if the goods and/or servic es with whic h the c onnec tion is established have a down-market image, thereby reflec ting negatively on the goodwill of the well-known mark. 

The said paragraph (1)(b) and item (i) refer to a rough equivalent of our s 55(3)(a) c ontaining the phrase, “and would be likely to damage his interests”. I believe the findings disc ussed earlier are c onsonant with the approac h advoc ated in respec t of s 55(3)(a) in these quotations. 

75     In the light of all the above, I held that the plaintiffs suc c eeded in their c laims in passing-off (but not in respec t of their allegation as to fraudulent misrepresentation) and under s 55(3)(a) of the Trade Marks Ac t. I granted a dec laration that the plaintiffs’ trade marks are well known trade marks in Singapore and granted an injunc tion to restrain the defendant and anyone ac ting on its behalf from using the plaintiffs’ trade marks, in partic ular, Amanusa, in relation to any form of ac c ommodation. The injunc tion is c onfined to the plaintiffs’ trade marks and does not extend, as c laimed by the plaintiffs, to all words whic h inc lude the prefix Aman bec ause eac h c ase should be dealt with on its fac ts. The defendant highlighted in the c ourse of trial that a c ondominium c alled Amaninda already exists here without protest from the plaintiffs. 

76     I also ordered the defendant to stop distributing any material whic h desc ribes the Yio Chu Kang projec t as Amanusa. However, I did not think it was nec essary to order the delivery-up of suc h material for destruc tion unlike the c ase of c ounterfeit goods whic h should never have c ome into existenc e in the first plac e. The offending ac t was in using the name and onc e that has stopped, the 


likelihood of damage c eases. 

77     There was no immediate damage suffered by the plaintiffs. The damage is only prospec tive and that likelihood should no longer exist with the orders that I have made. There was therefore no need to order an inquiry as to damages or an ac c ount of profits. 

78     The defendant was further ordered to apply to the Street and Building Names Board for a c hange of name for the Yio Chu Kang projec t and to inform the said board about my orders within 4 weeks from the date of pronounc ement. Although the board had indic ated in its letter to the defendant that no c hange of name would be entertained (after approval was given for the name of the projec t), that c ould not mean that the board will not give regard to an order of c ourt. Similarly, approval by the board of any building name c ould not by itself c onfer immunity against infringement of intellec tual property. 

79     As the plaintiffs suc c eeded on most c ounts, I thought it appropriate to order the defendant to pay 90% of the c osts of this ac tion, the 10% deduc tion being in respec t of the issues on whic h the plaintiffs failed (partic ularly the fraudulent misrepresentation). In the c ourse of arguments on c osts, I dec lined to order a c ertific ate for two c ounsel pursuant to O 59 r 19 of the Rules of Court, the amendments made to that rule with effec t from 1 January 2007 apparently having slipped everyone’s mind then. I have sinc e c larified with the parties by way of c orrespondenc e that my dec ision was that I would not order a c ertific ate for _more than_ two c ounsel for the plaintiffs.
