**Lee Seiu Kin J:** 

1       The ac c used is a 52 year old male. On 22 September 2009, the ac c used pleaded guilty to two c harges as follows: 

 (1) That you, [ACI] , on 7th November 2008, at or about 1.30 p.m., on the 3rd floor of [XXX], Singapore, attempted to c ommit c ulpable homic ide not amounting to murder of one [B] (F/51 years old) and in the said attempt did ac ts towards the c ommission of the offenc e, to wit, you attac ked her with a c hopper and threw her over the 3rd floor c ommon c orridor parapet wall of the said bloc k, thereby c ausing her to plunge to the ground floor, with the intention and under suc h c irc umstanc es that if by the said ac ts you had c aused the death of the said [B] you would have been guilty of c ulpable homic ide not amounting to murder and by the said ac ts you did c ause grievous hurt to the said [B], and you have thereby c ommitted an offenc e punishable under sec tion 308 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. 

 (2) That you, [ACI] , on 7th November 2008, at or about 1.30 p.m., on the 3rd floor of [XXX], Singapore, did voluntarily c ause grievous hurt to one [C] (M/14 years old), to wit, by slashing his left wrist and left forearm with a c hopper, an instrument for c utting, thereby c ausing him to be, during the spac e of 20 days, unable to follow his ordinary pursuits, and you have thereby c ommitted an offenc e punishable under sec tion 326 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. 

2       The ac c used agreed to the following statement of fac ts tendered by the prosec ution: 

 The accused 

 1 The ac c used is [ACI], NRIC No: S[XXX], Male/52 years (DOB: XXX), a Malaysian holding Singapore permanent residenc y. At the time of the offenc e he was involved in selling bird nest produc ts jointly with [B] (“ Victim 1 ”), although the ac c used had managed c offee shops or worked as a c ook for most of his working c areer. The ac c used is married to [D], 53 years old, a Singapore c itizen now working as sales promoter. They have two c hildren; a son 


aged 21 years who is doing his national servic e in the Navy and a 23 year old daughter. 

2       Sometime in 2006, the ac c used began having an affair with Vic tim 1. The ac c used was then managing his own c offee shop business in Toa Payoh and, he was also supporting Vic tim 1 and her c hildren financ ially. However, after the ac c used’s c offee shop was repossessed by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) in 2007 for redevelopment, his financ ial support of Vic tim 1 and her c hildren dec reased and eventually c eased. After the repossession of his c offee shop, the ac c used took on the job of a c ook in c offee shops but was not happy working for others. At the time of the offenc es, the ac c used was selling bird nest produc ts that he obtained from Vic tim 1 on c redit. 

**The Victims** 

3 **Victim 1** is [B], a 51 year old (DOB: [XXX]) female Indonesian Chinese, and who is resident in Singapore on the basis of possessing a long-term soc ial visit pass. She had 2 previous marriages the first to an Indonesian man who passed away and the sec ond to a Singaporean, who also passed away in 2006. She has 2 c hildren from her first marriage, a daughter aged 16 years and a son aged 14 years who is also the sec ond vic tim ( **Victim 2** ) in this c ase. Both her c hildren are studying in Singapore. The ac c used started an affair with Vic tim 1 after the death of her Singaporean husband with whom the ac c used was ac quainted. To support herself and her c hildren, Vic tim 1 had engaged in the sale of birds nest produc ts that she obtained on c redit from an Indonesian supplier. 

4 **Victim 2** is [C], 14 years old at the time of the offenc e. He is the son of Vic tim 1 and a student of [XXX] Sec ondary Sc hool. 

5       At the material time, both the vic tims were residing in a 3-room flat at [XXX], Singapore, whic h the ac c used had rented for them. The ac c used also paid the rental for the flat during the initial months of the year long tenanc y. 

**Background to the relationship between Victim 1 and the accused** 

6       After Vic tim 1’s first husband had passed away in Indonesia in 2005, she married a Singaporean and moved to reside in Singapore. Subsequently, her Singaporean husband also passed away. The ac c used, who was ac quainted with Vic tim 1’s sec ond (Singaporean) husband, had known Vic tim 1 through him. After Vic tim 1’s sec ond husband passed away, the ac c used developed an intimate relationship with her. He also provided for Vic tim 1’s c hildren by giving them poc ket money and paying some of their sc hool expenses. Vic tim 1 was aware at that time that the ac c used was married and had a family of his own. In their disc ussions over their relationship, the ac c used promised to marry Vic tim 1 after divorc ing his wife. 

7       In November 2007, the ac c used rented the flat at [xxx] for the vic tim and her two c hildren. The ac c used c o-habited in the said flat with Vic tim 1 on c ertain days eac h week and also kept some of his c lothing there. At the time of the offenc es the ac c used was also helping Vic tim 1 in her bird nest sales business. He took stoc ks of bird nest produc ts from Vic tim 1 on c redit and sold it to his friends and ac quaintanc es. However, he failed to repay Vic tim 1 for some of the bird nest that he took. 

8       About 3 months before the offenc es, the relationship between the ac c used and Vic tim 1 


[started] to turn sour over the financ ial matters as well as over their personal relationship. The ac c used had stopped giving money to Vic tim 1 and her c hildren and also failed to pay the monthly rental of the flat that they were staying in. Vic tim 1 also felt that the ac c used was undependable and not genuine with his promise to divorc e his wife and marry her. 

**Events relating to the commission of the offences** 

9       Matters between Vic tim 1 and the ac c used c ame to a head on 6 November 2008 when the ac c used gave Vic tim 1 insuffic ient money to pay her supplier for the bird nest that she had obtained and part of whic h had been taken and sold by the ac c used. Vic tim 1 demanded that the ac c used give her more money but he told her that he would be able to give her more money only on the next day. On 7 November 2008, Vic tim 1 tried to c ontac t the ac c used several times but he did not respond initially. When she eventually c ontac ted the ac c used, she asked him to c ome to her flat. Vic tim 1 had the intention of ending their relationship. 

10     When the ac c used arrived at the flat after about 12.30 pm, he and Vic tim 1 proc eeded to the kitc hen to talk. During the disc ussions, disputes relating to both financ ial matters and personal issues arose between them. Vic tim 1 told the ac c used that she wanted to end her relationship with him. She also told the ac c used repeatedly to take his belongings from the flat and leave. They also quarrelled over the proc eeds of sale of a c ondominium flat in Batam to whic h the ac c used had c ontributed earlier in their relationship. The flat had been subsequently sold by Vic tim 1 at a loss. Their verbal quarrel agitated the ac c used and he tried to strangle Vic tim 1 with both his hands. However, Vic tim 2 who was then at home and playing on the c omputer in his room, heard his mother’s c hoking c ries for help and he c ame out of his room. Upon seeing the ac c used strangling Vic tim 1, Vic tim 2 pulled the ac c used away from Vic tim 1. Vic tim 1 then walked to the gate of the flat and shouted at the ac c used to leave the flat. In frustration, she also threw the padloc k to the grill gate onto a c abinet near to where the ac c used was standing and the padloc k fell to the floor. Although the padloc k did not hit the ac c used, this ac tion of Vic tim 1 further infuriated the ac c used who then went to the kitc hen c abinet, took a c hopper and went towards Vic tim 1 with the c hopper raised. Terrified by the ac c used’s ac tions, Vic tim 1 ran out of the flat towards the stairc ase and lift landing. The ac c used c hased her out of the house and almost immediately c aught up with Vic tim 1 along the c ommon c orridor, just outside the flat. 

11     Vic tim 1 c owered against the c orridor in a semi-squatting position with her bac k against the parapet wall of the c ommon c orridor. The ac c used then held her by her hair and used the c hopper to hac k at her head. Instinc tively, Vic tim 1 used her hands to c over her head defensively. Blows with the c hopper hit Vic tim 1 on her right hand as well as her head and she started bleeding from her injuries. Vic tim 2, who had run after them, saw the ac c used attac king his mother with the c hopper. He saw Vic tim 1's hands going limp and she was unable to protec t herself from the attac k. At the same time Vic tim 2 pleaded with the ac c used not to hurt his mother. However, the ac c used ignored him and c ontinued his vic ious assault on Vic tim 1. Out of desperation, Vic tim 2 tried to protec t his mother by raising his hands to stop the ac c used. The ac c used however did not stop c hopping away. Vic tim 2 saw his left forearm and wrist injured by the c hopper and his arm felt numb and weak. It also started to bleed profusely. 

12     The ac c used then threw down the c hopper along the c orridor and ac c ording to Vic tim 2, in a swift ac tion, the ac c used lifted Vic tim 1 by her upper thighs and threw her over the 

parapet by flipping her down the bloc k from 3rd storey c ommon c orridor. Vic tim 1 rec alled 


trying to grab onto the railing of the parapet as she was falling, but was unable to do so and fell to the ground floor. She landed on her heels and c ollapsed to the floor. In his statement to the polic e, the ac c used admitted that he had c hopped at Vic tim 1’s head a few times. 

13     Vic tim 2 then sought help from neighbours to c all for the Polic e before running down to attend to his mother (the Polic e Radio Division rec ords show that a total of seven “999” c alls were rec eived between 1.44 pm and 1.48 pm relating to this c ase). Along the way, and realising that the ac c used had gone bac k into the flat, Vic tim 2 pic ked up the c hopper that had been thrown by the ac c used and brought it along with him, to prevent the ac c used from using it against his mother and him again. He saw that the Vic tim 1 was lying less than a meter away from the parapet. Polic e investigations and the blood stain on the wall of the parapet fac ing the open c ar park also suggested that Vic tim 1 was thrown down from the parapet as opposed to her jumping off the parapet. 

14     In the meantime, the ac c used returned bac k to the flat to pac k up his belongings. He also took Vic tim 1’s hand phone that she had left in the flat and then left the sc ene and went into hiding from the Polic e. Despite the fac t that the ac c used was c ontac ted by the polic e on his hand phone to surrender immediately, he only surrendered to the polic e on 10 November 2008. Investigations revealed that while on the run, the ac c used c ontac ted a friend, one Mr. Kulip Singh, a retired polic e offic er and a former polic e prosec utor in the Subordinate Courts, and sought his assistanc e in getting legal representation and surrendering to the polic e. 

15     On 10 November 2008, at about 11.25 a.m., Mr Kulip Singh arranged the surrender of the ac c used at the Capitol Building. When the polic e arrived, he was in the c ompany of Mr Kulip Singh and his present c ounsel. He was plac ed under arrest and brought bac k to Ang Mo Kio Polic e station. 

**Medical Reports of the Victims** 

16     Both the vic tims were warded and treated at Tan Toc k Seng Hospital for their injuries. 

_Victim 1_ 

17     Vic tim 1 was attended to in the Emergenc y Department for her head lac eration and [was] referred to be examined and treated by Dr Gamaliel Tan Yu Heng, the orthopaedic surgeon. Dr Gamaliel Tan raised 2 medic al reports dated 3 Dec ember 2008 and 6 Marc h 2009 on Vic tim 1. They show that Vic tim 1 sustained the following injuries resulting from the assault by the ac c used: 

 a) Burst frac tures of L1, L3 and L4 spinal vertebrae with c auda c ompression; 

 b) Lac eration over her right hand about 8c m extending from midshaft of her metac arpal to the 2nd web spac e with c ut extensor tendon to middle finger and frac tures of her 3rd metac arpal and middle finger proximal phalanx; and 

 c ) Commuted left c alc aneal frac ture. 

18     Vic tim 1 underwent an emergenc y spinal surgery on the same day. The spinal frac tures were reduc ed and instrumented from T11 to S1. Her right hand injuries were addressed in 


the same operation with repair to the extensor tendon and fixation of the hand frac tures. The c alc anleal (heel) frac ture was operated upon on 14 November 2008 when the swelling had dec reased. Vic tim 1 was disc harged from hospital on 25 November 2008 with follow up by the orthopaedic c linic to assess frac ture healing. At present she is still undergoing physiotherapy and rehabilitation. 

19     In his further report dated 6 Marc h 2009, Dr Gamaliel Tan Yu Heng further opined that the frac tures sustained by Vic tim 1 are severe and will leave her with permanent defic its. He further c ommented that whilst it is unlikely that Vic tim 1 would have died from her bone injuries, it was fortunate that Vic tim 1 did not have any internal organ damage or internal bleeding. 

_Victim 2_ 

20     Vic tim 2 was examined and treated by Dr Bernard Lee Chee Siang, whose medic al reports dated 14 Dec ember 2008 and 10 February 2009. The first report states that Vic tim 2 sustained two lac erations c onsistent with defensive injuries over the left distal forearm: 

 a. 1 c m lac eration over the dorsoradial aspec t of the distal forearm, deep into musc les; and 

 b. 4 c m lac eration at the level of the wrist, extending c leanly all the way into the wrist joint whic h was totally exposed. The extensor tendons at the same level as the wrist lac eration were c ut. Vic tim 2 was unable to extend his fingers and was weak with wrist extension. He was sc heduled for surgery to repair the c ut struc tures. 

21     Dr Bernard Lee Chee Siang opined that the wrist lac eration and c ut tendon injuries suffered by Vic tim 2 are c onsistent with the alleged mec hanism of injury that is that of a slash wound with a sharp objec t. He further c ommented c onsiderable forc e would have been employed as the lac eration penetrated c leanly all the way into the joint through all the superfic ial struc tures. 

[22] Dr Bernard Lee Chee Siang further opined that Vic tim 2 may have residual weakness and stiffness of his wrist and fingers following this injury. Vic tim 2 was disc harged from hospital on 22 November 2008 and was given medic al leave given medic al leave [sic ] from 7 November 2008 to 6 Dec ember 2008 (ie. a period of 30 days during whic h he was unable to follow his ordinary pursuits). He is still undergoing therapy. 

_Victim 2’s Psychiatric report_ 

[23] Vic tim 2 [was] also referred to Child Guidanc e Clinic on 11 February 2009. Dr Cai Yi Ming, Senior Consultant Psyc hiatrist of Child Guidanc e Clinic attended to him and thereafter prepared and submitted a psyc hiatrist report dated 12 February 2009. Dr Cai Yi Ming opined that there was no evidenc e of any mental disorder from Vic tim 2, and that Vic tim 2 was able to give an ac c ount of himself as well as the inc ident relating to the alleged offenc e. Following the inc ident, Vic tim 2 was traumatised and had trouble sleeping for about 1 – 2 weeks. 

_The accused’s Psychiatric Report_ 

[24] The ac c used was examined by Dr Thong Jiunn Yew, Assoc iate Consultant of Institute 


 of Mental Health, whose psyc hiatrist report on the ac c used dated 26 Dec ember 2008. 

 [25] Dr Thong Jiunn Yew stated that at the time of the offenc es the ac c used suffered from a major depressive disorder (DSM IV-TR 296.3) as c harac terized by a 3 month history of depressed mood, diminished interest in appetite, insomnia and suic idal thoughts. Although the ac c used was not of unsound mind at the time of the alleged offenc e and was fit to plead, Dr Thong Jiunn Yew is of the opinion that the ac c used’s depressed state, ac c umulated stress over the months and subsequent alleged provoc ation by Vic tim 1 had c ontributed to the alleged ac t. 

 Conclusion 

 [26] Based on the fac ts set out above, the ac c used has c ommitted an offenc e of attempted c ulpable homic ide with hurt c aused to Vic tim 1, punishable under sec tion 308 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 and an offenc e of Voluntarily Causing Grievous Hurt by a dangerous weapon to Vic tim 2 punishable under sec tion 326 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. He is c harged ac c ordingly. 

 [emphasis in original] 

3       After I c onvic ted him of the two c harges, his c ounsel submitted the following written plea in mitigation: 

1\. Our c lient has pleaded guilty to two c harges; one punishable under Sec tion 308 of the     Penal Code and the other under Sec tion 326 of the Code. We would humbly urge Your Honour to c onsider the following fac ts in mitigation. 

 Background 

2\. Our c lient is 53 years old. He has 2 c hildren; the elder one is studying in Singapore and the younger son is c urrently doing his National Servic e. His wife is not working and is looking after the home and the c hildren. 

3\. Our c lient was running a c offeeshop and selling seafood there until the HDB repossessed the unit as part of their upgrading programme in Oc tober 2007. After that he tried to find a job to earn a living but the inc ome was very meagre and he found it hard to make ends meet espec ially as previously he had been doing quite well when he was doing his own business in the c offeeshop. 

4\. He first c ame to know the lady in question sometime in 2006. At that time she was married. Her husband passed away in 2006 and in that same year, she and our c lient began a relationship. He assumed the role of a financ ial support and provided for her and her 2 c hildren. 

5\. At this time his business was doing well and he was not only giving her monthly expenses but also bought a flat for her in Indonesia. He spent about S$23,000 for the flat.     As far as he knew, this flat was subsequently rented out and the lady kept the moneys rec eived as rental. 

6\. In addition, he also paid for the tuition fees for her two c hildren for an English c ourse and also their telephone bills. 


7\. He had also signed a bond with the Singapore Immigration for her c hildren. This was in 2006 and 2007. 

8\. Subsequently, the lady had to move out of her flat in Toa Payoh and our c lient rented a flat for her at Ang Mo Kio (where the inc ident oc c urred) and paid for the rental and utility bills. 

9\. However, when he lost his c offeeshop and had to take a job, he found it extremely diffic ult to be able to maintain the life style he had c reated for her and that is when the problems started to surfac e. 

10\. When he was unable to maintain her as he had before, she grew c old towards him and wanted him out of her life. 

11\. It was during this period that the ac c used bec ame very depressed as a result of the treatment he was rec eiving at her hands. Ac c ording to Dr Thong Jiunn Yew of the IMH, at the time of the inc ident, he was suffering from a major depressive disorder. Ac c ording to the doc tor, this together with other fac tors c ontributed to the impulsive ac t. 

12\. Dr Tommy Tan (a psyc hiatrist in private prac tic e) too is of the opinion that he was suffering from major depressive disorder. 

**Facts** 

13\. On the day in question, the lady had told our c lient to c ome to the [XXX] flat, if he was a man. 

14\. He had taken some bird nest produc ts to assist her in selling them. However, he had handed these produc ts to various people to sell them and had not rec eived payment yet. She demanded that he repay her immediately. 

15\. The day before he had ac tually borrowed money from an illegal moneylender and handed her $2,000/-. However, she demanded full payment immediately and told him to c ome to the flat and settle the differenc e if he was a man. 

16\. When he got there, there was a terrible row between them and she asked him to get out of the flat. At this point, he felt belittled and stupid and c ould not understand how she c ould just throw him out of her life and the flat he had rented for her. He felt very angry and lost c ontrol of himself very probably bec ause he was also suffering from a major depressive disorder. 

17\. He c annot understand or explain why he reac ted in the way that he did as he is not an aggressive person. 

18\. He had never wanted to injure the boy and was hitting out at her when the boy intervened and was c ut. 

**Mitigation** 

19\. In mitigation, we would humbly urge Your Honour to take into ac c ount the fac t that this was not a planned or premeditated attac k. It was, as Dr Tiong opined, an impulsive ac t 


 and oc c urred at the spur of the moment bec ause of the quarrel between the two and the fac t that she asked him to get out of the house. 

20\. Sec ondly, although he did not surrender himself immediately, he did so as soon as he was advised to do so. During the time before he was arrested, he also did not do anything to dispose of any evidenc e and when he was arrested, he still had the c lothes he had worn on that day whic h assisted the polic e during investigations. He did not try to dispose or wash away the blood stains on the c lothes he had worn that day. 

21\. Your Honour, he has absolutely no previous c onvic tions or antec edents of any nature whatsoever and this is his first brush with the law in every sense of the word. 

22\. He is already Your Honour, 53 years old. He realises that he fac es a period of time in prison but besieges [ _sic_ ] Your Honour to allow him to be reunited with his family as soon as possible. His wife and c hildren have stood by him in this trying time and this has taught him an important lesson about who really is interested and c onc erned about his welfare. It has been an expensive lesson but one that he has learnt well from. 

23\. From his c lean part and the fac t that this was really a one-off impulsive inc ident, he is not likely to re-offend. 

24\. Finally Your Honour, both the offenc es were c ommitted at almost the same time. 

25\. In respec t of the sec ond offenc e, the boy had been injured in the midst when the ac c used had hit the lady. It had oc c urred at almost the same time and we would humbly urge Your Honour to order the two term[s] of imprisonment [to] run c onc urrently from the date of his remand. He was first c harged on 12 November 2008. 

26\. In the c irc umstanc es, Your Honour, we urge you to temper justic e with merc y. 

4       The deputy public prosec utor, Mr Amarjit Singh (“Mr Singh”), tendered a written submission on sentenc e. The first point was that the c harge against the ac c used had been reduc ed from attempted murder under s 307 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) to one of attempted c ulpable homic ide under s 308 on ac c ount of the ac c used suffering from a major depressive disorder at the time of the offenc e. Therefore the fac t of the mental illness of the ac c used should not be relevant in the c onsideration of the appropriate sentenc e for the offenc e under s 308. With respec t, I do not agree with this submission. The c ourt must take into c onsideration all fac tors relevant to the c ase and the fac t of the mental illness of the ac c used at the time he c ommitted the offenc e must be a relevant one. The c harge against the ac c used may have been reduc ed by the prosec ution from attempted murder, but that is a dec ision of the prosec ution whic h may be made for a variety of reasons, inc luding the availability or otherwise of evidenc e to prove the c harge. The c ourt does not c onsider how the Public Prosec utor has exerc ised his disc retion on the c harge. In a trial, the c ourt may only look at the evidenc e before it in relation to the c harge to see if the offenc e is made out. In c onsidering the sentenc e the c ourt looks at the fac ts proved or agreed in the statement of fac ts, and imposes a sentenc e that is most appropriate on a c onsideration of all relevant fac tors in the c ase. 

5       Mr Singh’s next submission is that the punishment for s 308 Penal Code had, from 1 February 2008, been inc reased (where hurt is c aused) from a maximum of seven years’ imprisonment, with or without fine, to a maximum of 15 years, or fine, or c aning, or any c ombination thereof. He pointed out that the reason provided in Parliament by the minister at the sec ond reading of the amendment bill was that a maximum of seven years’ imprisonment was “grossly inadequate”. 


Mr Singh submitted that this meant that Parliament had intended that the sentenc es for suc h c ases should be inc reased ac c ordingly. If I ac c ept this submission, it would mean that if a person who had c ommitted an offenc e under s 308 before 1 February 2008 was sentenc ed to three years’ imprisonment out of a maximum of seven years, the same person, had that offenc e been c ommitted after 1 February 2008, would be sentenc ed to a higher term of imprisonment on ac c ount of Parliament inc reasing the maximum to 15 years. With respec t, I c annot see the logic in this submission and disagree that suc h was what Parliament had intended. This is not a regulatory offenc e in whic h the maximum sentenc e provides guidanc e as to its severity. It pertains to an offenc e under Chapter XVI of the Penal Code dealing with offenc es affec ting the human body. In my view, Parliament had intended to provide for a higher maximum imprisonment term in rec ognition of the fac t that a maximum of seven years is inadequate in the most egregious c ases, where the c ourt would be c onstrained to impose the maximum seven years. That the maximum of seven years is somewhat inadequate is obvious when this is c ontrasted to the maximum of ten years or life imprisonment provided in s 326 (before 1 February 2008) where an intention to kill is not a required element of the offenc e. 

6       In determining the appropriate sentenc e, I have to bear in mind the fac t that the punishment for an offenc e under s 308 Penal Code is imprisonment up to 15 years, or fine, or c aning, or any c ombination thereof. The salient fac ts are as follows. The ac c used had engaged in a quarrel with Vic tim 1 over money as well as over their sexual relationship, a volatile c ombination. Vic tim 1 threw a padloc k at the ac c used and although this missed him, it infuriated him to the extent that he lost c ontrol of himself. The ac c used went to the kitc hen, took a c hopper and approac hed Vic tim 1. She ran out of the flat and the ac c used c hased her, c hopper in hand. He c aught up with her and as she c owered against the parapet wall of the c orridor, the ac c used held her by the hair and hac ked her on the head with the c hopper. Vic tim 1 raised her hand defensively. She suffered deep c uts in her right hand as well as her sc alp as a result. Her son, Vic tim 2, pleaded with the ac c used not to hurt Vic tim 1 but was ignored. Out of desperation, Vic tim 2 used his hand to stop the ac c used from hac king Vic tim 

1\. But the ac c used was so intent on attac king Vic tim 1 that he c arried on hac king, as a result of whic h Vic tim 2 suffered two deep c uts on the forearm and wrist. Considerable forc e had been used to inflic t these injuries. The ac c used then threw down the c hopper and lifted Vic tim 1 by her upper thighs and flipped her over the parapet, from where she fell two levels to the ground below. Fortuitously Vic tim 1 managed to land on her feet, otherwise she c ould have died from the fall. Nevertheless, the injury was severe bec ause she had frac tures in three spinal vertebrae. She had to undergo emergenc y spinal surgery. After tossing Vic tim 1 over the parapet, the ac c used returned to the flat, pac ked his belongings, took Vic tim 1’s mobile phone and left the sc ene. He surrendered to the polic e three days later. 

7       The first point to be noted is that Vic tim 1 c ould easily have died from the fall. The degree of violenc e in this c ase is high: first the ac c used hac ked away at Vic tim 1 with a c hopper inflic ting deep c ut wounds on her head and wrist, ignoring Vic tim 2’s pleas to stop. He went about this with suc h single-minded intensity that he did not stop hac king even when Vic tim 2’s hands got in the way, as a result of whic h Vic tim 2 suffered two deep c uts. He then threw down the c hopper and lifted Vic tim 1 over the parapet to toss her off the third storey. This would have required c onsiderable effort as the ac c used is not of large build, and Vic tim 1 is not of small build. 

8       The next point to be noted is the severity of the injuries. The c uts c aused by the c hopper were deep, and had he c ontinued to hac k away, Vic tim 1 c ould have died from bleeding. For some reason he stopped hac king at her, perhaps due to Vic tim 2’s intervention, but dec ided to finish the task by tossing her off the balc ony. It is suc h an extreme ac t that the only inferenc e in the c irc umstanc es is that it was done with the intention to c ause death. 

9       A further fac tor is that after the ac c used threw Vic tim 1 off the balc ony, he was not overc ome 


with remorse by the realisation of what he had done. Instead he returned to the flat to pac k his belongings, and even had the presenc e of mind to take Vic tim 1’s mobile phone as he left. It took him three days to surrender. 

10     The main fac tor in the ac c used’s favour is the fac t that he was suffering from a major depressive disorder at the time. This had started some three months before the inc ident, due to the pressures of the situation he landed himself in – he had ac quired a mistress whom he had to support along with her c hildren, he had to keep this affair a sec ret from his wife, his business had turned bad and Vic tim 1 started pressuring him not only for money but also to marry her. As a result, he bec ame depressed, soc ially withdrawn, suffered loss of appetite and entertained thoughts of suic ide. He turned to alc ohol to drown his sorrows. 

11     Mr Singh c ited the following prec edents for the offenc e under s 308 Penal Code: 

 ( a ) Public Prosecutor v Chot Saik Kam (“ Chot Saik Kam ” ) [1990] SLR 756, in whic h the ac c used pleaded guilty to one c ount of c ulpable homic ide not amounting to murder under s 304(a) Penal Code and one c ount of attempted c ulpable homic ide not amounting to murder under s 308. He was sentenc ed to ten years’ imprisonment in respec t of the c harge under s 304(a) and three years’ imprisonment for the s 308 c harge. Both sentenc es were ordered to run c onsec utively. The ac c used there, who had been diagnosed with depression not amounting to unsoundness of mind, stabbed his two female flatmates after a quarrel with one of them. After the initial quarrel with one of the vic tims, the ac c used took a knife from the kitc hen and approac hed the room where the two vic tims were watc hing a video. When they opened the door for him, the ac c used attac ked the vic tims with the knife, one after the other. The surviving vic tim managed to loc k herself in the room when the ac c used turned his attention to the dec eased who was trying to esc ape. 

 (b) Public Prosecutor v Low Ah Fatt (“ Low Ah Fatt ”) (CC 36 of 1992, unreported), in whic h the ac c used was sentenc ed to 42 months’ imprisonment on a c harge under s 308 Penal Code. The ac c used was infuriated when he was handed an evic tion letter by the one of the two vic tims. He tried to attac k both vic tims with a knife but they managed to loc k themselves in the bedroom. He then poured flammable liquid through the bedroom door and lit it. One of the vic tims sustained 13% burns on his body. The prosec ution proc eeded against the ac c used on only one c harge with the other c harge taken into c onsideration for sentenc ing. 

 (c ) Public Prosecutor v A Aziz Bin A Wahid (“ A Aziz Bin A Wahid ”) (CC 37 of 2001, unreported), where the ac c used was c harged under s 308 Penal Code for stabbing his wife. The ac c used and his wife had been having matrimonial problems and on the day of the offenc e, the Syariah Court informed the ac c used that his wife would not be returning to him. The ac c used took a knife from his home and went to the plac e of work of his wife. There he stabbed her three times, inflic ting severe stab wounds. He was sentenc ed to three years’ imprisonment. 

 (d) Public Prosecutor v Ong Kim Geok (“ Ong Kim Geok ”) (CC 16 of 2002, unreported), in whic h the ac c used was c harged under s 308 Penal Code for throwing her 8-year-old daughter down the rubbish c hute from her fifth floor residenc e. The ac c used bec ame annoyed when she saw the vic tim c onsuming c old leftover food. The ac c used slapped the vic tim, c aned her and pinc hed her thigh and direc ted her to go bac k to sleep. However, the vic tim was unable to fall asleep as she was hungry. At about 5am, when the ac c used saw the vic tim awake, she dragged her to the kitc hen and threw her down the rubbish c hute. The vic tim was only resc ued from the base of the rubbish c hute at 8.00am by a c leaner c learing the rubbish c hute. In sentenc ing the ac c used to two years and six months’ imprisonment, the c ourt took into ac c ount the fac t that the ac c used 


 had been suffering from hypothyroidism, a c ondition c harac terised by markedly agitated and aggressive behaviour. In this c ase too, the prosec ution had proc eeded against the ac c used on only one c harge. A sec ond c harge under s 4(6) of the Children and Young Persons Ac t (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) was taken into c onsideration for the purposes of sentenc ing. 

 ( e ) Public Prosecutor v Kwong Kok Hing (“ Kwong Kok Hing ”) <span class="citation">[2008] 2 SLR 684</span>, in whic h the ac c used was c harged under s 308 Penal Code for pushing the vic tim, his ex-girlfriend, into the path of an onc oming train at a mass rapid transit (“MRT”) station. Fortunately, the vic tim landed on the trac ks in a c rouc hing position and managed to dash to safety on the other side of the trac k with less than a sec ond to spare before the train would have hit her. The ac c used, who was suffering from depression at the time of the offenc e, pleaded guilty and was initially sentenc ed to one year’s imprisonment in the High Court. On the public prosec utor’s appeal, the Court of Appeal enhanc ed the sentenc e of imprisonment to three years. 

12     In _Chot Saik Kam_ , in whic h the ac c used was sentenc ed to three years’ imprisonment on the s 308 c harge, the c ourt had c onsidered that he did not have the intention to c ause death or suc h bodily injury as is likely to c ause death – whic h is, in effec t, limb (b) of s 304 Penal Code. At [28] of his judgment, Punc h Coomaraswamy J said: 

 Sec tion 308 of the Penal Code c reates an offenc e whic h, where the vic tim had died, the offenc e would have been one under s 304. Eac h of paras (a) and (b) of s 304, refers to different and distinc t states of an ac c used’s mind. Notwithstanding the nature of the injuries, I gave the ac c used the benefit of treating him as having no intention to c ause death or to c ause suc h bodily injury as is likely to c ause death as in para (a) [sic ] of s 304. This is what led me to sentenc e him to three years’ imprisonment on the amended sec ond c harge although the maximum provided under s 308 is seven years or a fine or with both. 

There appears to be an error in the report as the limb in s 304 that pertains to a lac k of intention to c ause death is limb (b). In the present c ase I had c onsidered at [8] that the ac c used had intended to c ause the death of Vic tim 1. 

13     In _Low Ah Fatt_ , one vic tim did not suffer any physic al injury while the injury of the sec ond, who had 13% burns on his body, was not c aused by a direc t attac k by the ac c used but by his rec kless ac t of setting fire to the bedroom. The fire itself did not appear to be a large one as it took quite a while for them to be resc ued. It would appear that the sentenc e was based on limb (b) of s 304 Penal Code, as in _Chot Saik Kim_. In the present c ase, severe injuries were inflic ted direc tly by the ac c used on Vic tim 1 with a c hopper before he threw her off the balc ony. 

14     In _A Aziz Bin A Wahid_ , the ac c used inflic ted three stab wounds on the vic tim, who was his wife and with whom he was undergoing a divorc e. The stab wounds were serious and it was fortuitous that the inc ident took plac e at a hospital and immediate treatment was available. The main differenc es between this and the present c ase are that (a) the ac c used did not go further and throw the vic tim off a height, and (b) he did not injure any other person in the c ourse of c ommitting the c rime. 

15     _Ong Kim Geok_ involved a mother who threw her 8-year daughter down a rubbish c hute. On any analysis, this tragic c ase is spec ial on its fac ts. 

16     In _Kwong Kok Hing_ , the trial judge had taken into c onsideration the fac t that the vic tim’s physic al injuries were minor and, taking into ac c ount the other fac tors in the c ase, sentenc ed the ac c used to one year’s imprisonment. On appeal the Court of Appeal held that the word “hurt” in s 308 


Penal Code inc luded emotional trauma, whic h the vic tim had suffered greatly. The Court of Appeal also c onsidered that it was nec essary to impose a deterrent sentenc e as the inc ident took plac e in an MRT station. In enhanc ing the sentenc e to three years’ imprisonment, the c ourt said at [46]: 

 Ultimately, however, we dec ided on a sentenc e of three years’ imprisonment bec ause of two persuasive mitigating fac tors. First, we took into c onsideration the psyc hiatric c ondition of the respondent. We ac c epted the expert evidenc e that suggested the respondent was suffering from depression, and would have qualified for the defenc e of diminished responsibility if the vic tim had died and he had then been c harged with murder. This to some extent reduc es his level of c ulpability though it must be pointed out that he was aware of, and remained responsible for, the c onsequenc es of his ac tions. We were persuaded that with the right treatment and c are, the respondent c ould be rehabilitated and bec ome onc e again a useful member of soc iety. The issue of inc apac itation does not arise. In addition, we made an allowanc e for the fac t that the respondent had been released from prison c ustody before the sentenc e was enhanc ed. He has to now undergo a further prison sentenc e all over again for the same offenc e. In our opinion, suc h a situation justifies some disc ount to the final sentenc ing equation: see Fernando Payagala. This sentenc e of three years’ imprisonment would, in our view, give effec t to the relevant sentenc ing c onsiderations of deterrenc e, retribution and rehabilitation, and, at the same time, enc apsulate soc iety’s c ondemnation of the respondent’s c onduc t. 

17     Henc e it was based on two mitigating fac tors: (a) the potential for rehabilitation; and (b) the fac t that the ac c used had already served the one-year imprisonment imposed by the trial judge, had been released for more than six months and would have to undergo the trauma of returning to prison, that the c ourt imposed a sentenc e of three years. In the present c ase, although tossing a person off the third storey is as bad as pushing someone into the path of an inc oming train, there are two aggravating fac tors: (a) the ac c used had c aused severe injuries with a c hopper on Vic tim 1 as well as Vic tim 2 who tried to stop him; and (b) the ac c used had tossed Vic tim 1 off the balc ony, using great forc e to lift her off the ground in order to get her over the parapet. 

18     It is appropriate at this point to address Mr Singh’s submission that, following the dec ision in _Kwong Kok Hing_ , I should also impose a deterrent sentenc e. In determining the appropriate sentenc e, the c ourt bears in mind the princ iples of sentenc ing, whic h are generally c onsidered to be retribution, deterrenc e, prevention and rehabilitation (see _Kwong Kok Hing_ at [17]). The degree to whic h eac h of these princ iples affec ts the sentenc e depends on the nature of the offenc e and the partic ular fac ts of the c ase. In asking for a deterrent sentenc e, I took it to mean that I should give more weight to the deterrenc e fac tor in dec iding on the appropriate sentenc e, or that a sentenc e that is based mainly on the other fac tors, namely retribution, prevention and rehabilitation, would not result in a punishment that would deter like-minded persons from c ommitting similar offenc e. With respec t, I c annot see the logic of this submission for the present c ase. This is a c rime of passion, c ommitted without premeditation in the heat of a sudden quarrel. The ac c used had c aused grievous injury to Vic tim 1 in the c ourse of attempting to kill her. He must be punished appropriately for the gravity of his c rime and the degree of harm he had inflic ted on the vic tims. I c annot see how, by imposing a sentenc e harsher than what retributive princ iples would c all for, this c ould deter similar c rimes of passion. Suc h c rimes, by their very nature, do not involve c alm deliberation on the part of the perpetrators. General deterrenc e works well for offenc es where there is some degree of premeditation so that the threat of severe punishment c ould dissuade potential offenders from c ommitting them. Or it may be justified where detec tion is diffic ult or there is a prevalenc e of suc h offenc es and there is a need to stamp it out. In these instanc es there is a greater public good ac hieved in making an offender undergo a more severe punishment than what the gravity of the c rime would otherwise require. The point is that there must be a good basis for the c ourt to pronounc e a harsher sentenc e that what it 


would otherwise impose if the deterrenc e were not an important fac tor. To do so simply bec ause the offenc e is grave is not a good basis bec ause it does not address the need for the additional punishment. 

19     In Kwo _ng Kok Hing_ , the Court of Appeal c onsidered that a deterrent sentenc e was c alled for not bec ause of the nature of the offenc e but bec ause it was loc ated in an MRT station whic h requires spec ial c onsideration. The c ourt said at [39]–[41]: 

 39 In this c ase, there is plainly a need to send out a c lear message to the public that it is wholly unac c eptable to c ommit similar violent and dangerous ac ts, regardless of whether they are premeditated, rash or impulsive. The MRT plays a major role in the lives of many Singapore c ommuters. Ac c ording to the Land Transport Authority’s figures, the MRT had an average daily ridership of 1.435 million last year. Of the over 60 train stations c urrently in operation, over half – 35 – are above ground. Clementi station is one of them, and, extraordinarily, it has seen more than its fair share of inc idents. On 30 Oc tober 2006, just over a month after the respondent’s offenc e, a man was hit and killed by a train at Clementi, resulting in a delay that affec ted 11,700 c ommuters. Two months later, at the same station, a woman got her leg stuc k in the gap between the train and the platform, frac turing her leg in the proc ess. On 20 July 2007, another person was killed by an inc oming west-bound train at Clementi. Similar inc idents have rec ently taken plac e at other MRT stations. It should be pointed out, however, that a number of these inc idents were suic ides or ac c idents. 

 40 The spate of serious and fatal inc idents in rec ent times has undoubtedly left its mark on the train c ommuter’s psyc he, leading to widespread c alls from the public for platform sc reen doors to be installed at above-ground stations. On 25 January 2008, Mr Raymond Lim, Minister for Transport, announc ed plans to install suc h doors ... This squarely addresses the growing c onc ern about safety at above-ground MRT stations. Nevertheless, it bears mention that installation of these doors at all stations will only be c ompleted by 2012; in the meantime, there is a perc eption among some that danger c ontinues to lurk on every exposed train platform. 

 41 Potential offenders must be firmly disc ouraged from c ommitting offenc es in the vic inity of MRT trains or stations. Whether a person intends to kill or not, the ac t of pushing a helpless person off a train platform and onto the trac ks is an ac t so despic able and inherently dangerous that it must be unequivoc ally c ensured by the c ourts so as to deter others from even c ontemplating c arrying out similar ac ts, let alone ac tually c ommitting them. MRT trains are a c onvenient and affordable form of public transport for a large segment of the population. An unambiguous and robust message must be sent out that dangerous c onduc t similar to the respondent’s will not be c ondoned, and if it does oc c ur, the public must be reassured that the perpetrator will be treated both firmly and promptly. 

20     I return to my c onsideration of the prec edents. The three years’ imprisonment imposed in _Kwong Kok Hing_ was due to the spec ial c irc umstanc es there, in the absenc e of whic h a higher sentenc e would be c alled for. The sentenc es in _Low Ah Fatt_ and _A Aziz Bin A Wahid_ ranged from three to three and a half years, but the fac ts there were less aggravating than the present c ase. The ac c used here had launc hed a vic ious attac k with a c hopper on Vic tim 1, injured Vic tim 2 in the proc ess, before throwing Vic tim 1 off the balc ony. Vic tim 1 had merc ifully survived the fall but had sustained severe injuries. Taking into c onsideration the fac tors raised in the mitigation plea, I was of the view that the appropriate sentenc e would be a term of imprisonment of five years. 


21     In relation to the sec ond c harge under s 326 of the Penal Code, as I have pointed out in [5] above, it is c urious that it provides a maximum of life imprisonment or for a term up to 15 years, whic h is muc h more than that for s 308 even though an intention to c ause death is not an element of the c harge. In view of the fac t that the ac c used’s ac ts were direc ted at Vic tim 1 and that he had only injured Vic tim 2 when the latter tried to protec t her, I was of the view that a sentenc e of one year’s imprisonment would be appropriate. 

22     Mr Singh asked that the sentenc es be ordered to run c onsec utively. However both offenc es were c ommitted in the same transac tion. Indeed the sec ond offenc e under s 326 Penal Code was c ommitted inc identally to the first. Furthermore, I had c onsidered the fac t that the ac c used had single-mindedly gone about hac king Vic tim 1, in the c ourse of whic h he injured Vic tim 2, as an aggravating fac tor in the first offenc e. Finally, the princ iple of totality of sentenc e must be borne in mind and I was of the view that the appropriate punishment for the ac c used for both offenc es would be five years. I therefore ordered the sentenc es to run c onc urrently.
