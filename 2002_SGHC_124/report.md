## GROUNDS OF DECISION 

**Background** 

1\. This case arises out of the third phase of the construction of the Seletar Sew age Treatment Works (the project). The main contractor for the project w as Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co Ltd (Hyundai). Hyundai engaged Vatten International Pte Ltd (Vatten), the defendants, as their painting subcontractors and Vatten in turn appointed Chan Hong Seng Engrg & Const Pte Ltd (CHS), the plaintiffs, as their sub- subcontractors for almost the w hole of the painting w orks. Vatten w as, in effect, a one man company. They had no w orkers or even much expertise and they relied entirely on sub-sub-contractors like CHS to carry out their contractual obligations to Hyundai. 

2\. In the contract aw arded to Vatten, the price of the painting w orks w as fixed at $1,562,117.62. In the subcontract, the price of the w orks w as fixed at $1,253,113, a sum amounting to approximately 80% of the price Vatten w ould be paid. The subcontract sum w as based on a quotation sent by CHS to Vatten containing its rates for the various items that made up the painting w orks. 

3\. The subcontract w as evidenced by the letter of intent dated 11 January 1997 issued by Vatten. This w as almost identical to the letter of intent dated 28 December 1996 w hich Hyundai had issued to Vatten. For the purposes of the subsequent dispute, the most important term of the subcontract is clause 1 w hich reads as follow s: 

1\. TERMS OF PAYMENT 

 The "Cut Off Date for the application for Interim Payment shall be the 13th of each Calendar Month. 

 Payment shall be based upon CHS Application for Interim Payment for w ork done and for cost of materials on Site (suppliers invoices to be submitted) but w ill be revised in accordance w ith the amount of related monies received by VFI [ie Vatten] from HYUNDAI. Such payment shall be made w ithin 


 Ten (10) w orking days of receipt by VFI of such monies. 

 It is a Condition Precedent to the payment of any monies by VFI to CHS that CHS shall deposit a Performance Bond acceptable to VFI w ith VFP equivalent to Five (5) Percent of the Sub-Contract Price. 

 The payments by VFI to CHS shall be subject to Five (5) Percent Retention. 

4\. In accordance w ith the above term, CHS duly furnished Vatten w ith a performance bond from ING General Insurance International NV in the sum of $60,000. 

5\. Although the subcontract w as entered into in 1997, the painting w orks only commenced sometime in January 1999. Work continued until October 2000. At that stage, there w as a dispute betw een the parties. On or about 14 October 2000, Vatten called on the bond furnished by CHS and received payment of $60,000 thereunder. On 18 October 2000, Vatten terminated the subcontract on the basis that CHS had already repudiated it by stopping w ork. Whether CHS had in fact stopped w ork and if so, w hether they w ere justified in doing so, are tw o of the issues to be considered in this case. 

6\. This action w as commenced on 14 December 2000. By it the plaintiffs, CHS, are claiming: 

 (1) the sum of $560,392.24 (or such sum as the court may determine to be due) as the unpaid balance due in respect of w orks done under the subcontract; alternatively, the value of the w orks done on a quantum meruit and/or quantum valebat basis; 

 (2) the sum of $3,284.11 for loss of profit on the value of the remaining w orks; alternatively, damages to be assessed; 

 (3) the sum of $15,035 being the value of plant and materials belonging to the plaintiffs w hich Vatten, the defendants, took possession and control of; 

 (4) a declaration that Vatten deliver up to CHS the lorry w hich Vatten took possession and control of; 

 (5) damages to be assessed for the cost of rental of the said lorry from 1 December 2000 until the lorry is returned to CHS; and 

 (6) the sum of $60,000 by w ay of restitution or account being the money received by Vatten from the call on the performance bond. 

7\. Vatten is both contesting the claim and making a counterclaim. They allege that CHS did not carry out the subcontract w orks w ith reasonable skill and care and did not complete the w orks to the extent asserted. Vatten avers that they suffered loss and damage in order to rectify the breaches of CHS. They had to engage another contractor to complete and rectify CHS w ork. They had also overpaid CHS and are entitled to reimbursement of the amount overpaid. Vatten claims the return of these monies and damages to be assessed. 

**Issues** 

8\. In their closing submissions, CHS set out a list of the issues to be determined in this case. Vatten has 


accepted most of those issues as being the relevant ones w hile adding some of their ow n. In the result, the issues to be decided are: 

 (1) w hether there w as a change in the rates under the subcontract resulting from the change in the paint to be used for the internal plastered w alls (including beams, columns, staircases, etc) from Super V-Tex Emulsion to Aclose AA Emulsion; 

(2) w hether Vatten had breached their payment obligation to CHS; 

(3) w as Vattens termination of subcontract on 18 October 2000 w rongful; 

(4) w hat w as the value of the w orks done by CHS as at 18 October 2000; 

(5) w hether there w ere defects in CHS w orks in respect of w hich Vatten is entitled to a set-off; 

(6) w hether Vatten is entitled to charge CHS for the cost of spark tests carried out by Hyundai; 

 (7) w hether there w as an agreement that CHS w as to effect the textural painting of the digesters at the rate of $9 per square metre; 

(8) w hether Vatten seized plant and material belonging to CHS; 

 (9) w hether CHS is entitled to a restitution of and/or an account of monies paid to Vatten under the performance bond; and 

 (10) if the issues relating to termination of the contract are decided in Vattens favour, w hether Vatten is entitled to interlocutory judgment for damages. 

Issues (5), (6), (7) and (10) are issues arising from Vattens defence and counterclaim. 

**Issue 1 : change of rates for internal walls** 

9\. In the quotation that CHS submitted to Vatten, they had quoted the follow ing rates for painting internal surfaces: 

 Description of classes Quoted Rates (1) Prepare and apply one undercoat and two finishing 

 $2.20 per m 

 coats of acrylic emulsion paint internally, to plastered walls, beams, columns, etc (2) Ditto, to plastered w alls, beams, $1.80 per metre run columns etc of w idth not exceeding 300mm (3) Ditto, to plastered w alls, beams, $2.00 per metre run columns etc of w idth 300mm 1m 

In their final submissions, CHS asserted that these rates had by agreement been revised to $2.85 per m, $2.34 per metre run and $2.56 per metre run respectively. 

10\. Vattens submission w as that CHS w as not entitled to claim the higher rates for their w ork because first, they had not pleaded an agreed variation in the rates and, secondly, on the evidence no variation had in fact been agreed to. 


11\. I must first consider the pleadings. The re-re-amended statement of claim contains tw o paragraphs that are relevant to this issue. First there is 2 w hich simply states that "by a contract dated 11 January 1997, the defendants subcontracted the painting w orks for the project to the [plaintiffs] at a contract sum of $1,253,113". This paragraph does not contain any breakdow n of the w orks or the applicable rates. Subsequently in 15 the plaintiffs state that as at 18 October 2000 they had carried w orks to the value of $1,398,235.88, particulars of w hich are set out in Appendix 1. In Appendix 1 a description of all the w orks done is given and for the internal w orks the rates are stated as being $2.85 per m for the ceiling and w all finishes, $2.65 per metre run for the columns, and $2.45 per metre run for the beams. There is no express statement anyw here in the statement of claim that these rates are variations of originally agreed rates. 

12\. By 2 of the re-re-amended defence, the defendants admit 2 of the statement of claim except that they assert that CHSs quotation dated 11 June 1996 and the enclosed bill of quantities also form part of the contract. In 25 the defendants go on to state that 15 of the statement of claim is denied and by 27 (a) the defendants assert that "some of the rates used by the plaintiffs w ere not agreed upon". There is no other paragraph in the defence w hich deals w ith the rates or w hich identifies those rates w hich w ere allegedly not agreed upon. 

13\. CHS filed a re-amended reply and defence to counterclaim and by 2 of this pleading they aver that the rates set out in Appendix 1 of their statement of claim are the applicable rates. 

14\. Although the pleadings are not ideal, in my opinion they sufficiently disclose to the parties and the Court the dispute over the applicable rates. CHS had from the beginning indicated clearly w hat it considered these to be by specifying each rate in Appendix 1. Vatten had responded to the rates put forw ard by CHS by stating that some of these rates w ere not agreed. Whilst the defence did not specifically identify the items in dispute or assert w hat the correct rates for those items w ere, that inadequacy in the pleading, w hich could have been redressed by a request for further and better particulars, did not change the fact that issue had been joined as to w hether the rates claimed had been agreed. This issue w as made even more clear by the re-amended reply by w hich CHS reiterated the applicable rates being those set out in Appendix 1 of the statement of claim. In the premises I consider that Vattens objection to this issue that the pleadings do not raise the issue is not made out. The present case is distinguishable on its facts from the cited authority of _Tan Kia Poh v Hong Leong Finance Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1994] 1 SLR 270</span> on w hich Vatten relied. 

15\. I should also point out that Vatten w as fully aw are of exactly w hich rates w ere in dispute and no surprise w as occasioned by the raising of this issue. Vattens counsel cross-examined the managing director of the plaintiffs, Mr Tan Geok Chen (GC Tan), at length on this issue. Secondly, the body of evidence in respect of the change in the rates w as let in w ithout objection by the defendants. 

16\. The second question is w hether in fact any variation w as agreed to and, if so, the quantum of that variation. As noted above, the original rates for the three classes of w ork w hich involved internal painting w ere $2.20, $1.80 and $2.00. In Appendix 1 the respective rates for these three items w ere claimed to be $2.85, $2.45 and $2.65. In CHSs closing submissions how ever the revised rates w ere claimed to be $2.85, $2.34 and $2.56. The rates in the submissions w ere based on the figures found in a Sub-Contract Interim Certificate issued by Vatten in December 1999. CHS adopted the rates used by Vatten in this certificate and submitted that those rates w ere the best evidence available to prove the agreed revised rates. 

17\. The evidence of Mr GC Tan w as that w hen the original quotation for the painting w orks w as submitted to Vatten, CHS had quoted for the internal w orks on the basis that the paint to be used w ould be Super V- Tex Emulsion. After the painting w orks commenced some tw o years later, the paint for the internal plastered w alls w as changed to Aclose AA Emulsion w hich is a more expensive paint as it is a w eather- shield emulsion paint. Mr Tan stated that w hen the change in paint w as made he had a discussion w ith 


Jimmy Lim Chap Heng, Vattens alter ego, and the parties agreed to a corresponding change in the rates for the w ork. It w as agreed that 65 cents w ould be added to each of the originally quoted rates to obtain the new rates. That w as w hy CHS had subsequently billed for the w ork at the rates of $2.85, $2.45 and $2. instead of $2.20, $1.80 and $2.00. 

18\. The change in paint did not affect only the rates charged by CHS to Vatten. Mr Lim admitted during cross examination that Hyundai had agreed to adjust upw ards the rates that Vatten could charge it for the internal paint w orks. The interim certificate issued by Hyundai to Vatten for w ork done up to January 1999 show s that in respect of painting of the internal w alls the rates applied w ere $2.73, $2.23 and $2.48. The certificate Hyundai issued for the w ork done up to March 1999 show s that these three rates had subsequently been adjusted to $3.80, $3.10 and $3.45 respectively. 

19\. Although admitting that he had been able to obtain a change of rates from Hyundai to reflect the increase in the cost of paint to be used internally, Mr Lim denied that he had in turn agreed to an adjustment of CHSs rates for the same w ork. His denial that there w as any adjustment at all w as contradicted by a Sub-Contract Interim Certificate in respect of the plaintiffs w orks w hich Mr Lim himself prepared for the month of December 1999. In that certificate the rates applicable for the three classes of internal painting w ork w ere stated to be $2.85, $2.34 and $2.56 respectively. Mr Lim w as questioned about the certificate. Mr Lims explanation for w riting the rates this w ay w as that he had made a mistake in that he had follow ed the rates inserted in CHSs ow n claim dated 29 December 1999. How ever, as w as then demonstrated to the w itness, although CHSs claim of 29 December 1999 did contain the first rate of $2. it did not contain the other tw o rates of $2.34 and $2.56. When confronted w ith that, Mr Lim sought to explain that he had arrived at these other tw o rates by calculation. That w as an odd explanation since Vattens stand is that the original rates of $1.80 and $2.00 for these tw o classes are the applicable rates. If that w as the case there w ould have been no need of any recalculation. It is also notable that at an earlier stage in his evidence Mr Lim had said that he really did not know how he had come up w ith the rates of $2.34 and $2.56 and that he may "have keyed in the w rong figures". A simple mistake in keying in figures seems unlikely since the figures of $2.34 and $2.56 w ere not inserted only once but appear many times in Vattens Interim Certificate of December 1999. 

20\. In their closing submissions, Vatten submitted that the CHS claim in Appendix 1 w as not consistent w ith their closing submission on the applicable rates. The claim in Appendix 1 w as based on Mr Tans assertion as to the agreed rates w hereas the closing submission w as based on the certificate issued by Vatten itself. Vatten also referred to their letter of 24 January 2000 to CHS w herein Mr Lim had, among other things, informed CHS that they should ensure that their claimed prices w ere the same as their offered prices in the June 1996 quotation. Counsel sought to make much of the fact that CHS had not replied to this assertion a nd that originally they had had no objections to this letter being part of the agreed bundle but that just tw o days before the trial CHS had objected to admissibility of the letter. It w as submitted that CHS had tried to prevent the letter from being admitted because they knew that its contents w ere detrimental to their case as the letter w as clear evidence that Vatten had not agreed to the higher rates claimed by CHS. If there had been an agreement to vary the rates Vatten w ould not have reminded CHS to keep to the original rates. 

21\. Having considered the evidence, I think that there w as a change in the agreed rates for the internal painting w orks. It w as not in dispute that the original paint for the internal w orks w as a cheaper paint than the w eather-shield paint subsequently specified. Hyundai had recognised the extra cost of materials by adjusting the rates it paid Vatten and it is completely consistent w ith this extra cost that CHS should have made a demand on Vatten for an adjustment of its ow n rates. I also note that the original rates applied to the original paint i.e. Super V-Tex Emulsion. CHS w as not contractually obliged to supply Aclose AA Emulsion a t those rates. If Vatten w anted the paint changed it had to negotiate a change in rates as w ell. It is, accordingly, more than probable that the parties agreed to new rates for the new paint. In this regard, 


Vattens letter of 24 January 2000 is not relevant since the original quotation did not refer to Acclose AA Emulsion. Additionally, I w as not impressed w ith Mr Lims evidence relating to the preparation of his certificate of December 1999. There w as no reason for him to insert any rates other than those originally quoted if there had been no agreement on new rates. The very fact that the rates he typed in w ere different from those quoted show ed that he had agreed to changes in rates to reflect the change in paint. 

22\. The only question that remains is w hat the varied rates w ere. As pointed out earlier, in closing CHS adopted the figures in Vattens December 1999 certificate. They had no other evidence apart from their ow n December 1999 progress claim as to w hat the agreed rates w ere since they did not confirm these rates in w riting or even, after the issue of the Vatten December 1999 interim certificate, dispute in w riting the rates applied by Vatten. In these circumstances I think it w as correct of them to adopt the Vatten rates. Vattens certificate is evidence of Vattens agreement to those rates. I do not accept Mr Lims excuses for the insertion of those rates in the certificate. I do not think he made any mistakes in inserting those rates. He inserted them either because they had been agreed or because he believed that he could persuade CHS to accept them. Accordingly on the issue of the rates for the internal paint w ork I find in favour of CHS. 

**Issue 2: Had Vatten breached their payment obligations to CHS** 

23\. In 14 of the re-re-amended statement of claim the allegation w as that in breach of the subcontract, Vatten had persistently throughout the duration of the subcontract underpaid CHS in respect of their progress claims or in respect of the sums due to CHS from monies received by Vatten from Hyundai for the w ork carried out by CHS. Particulars of this allegation w ere given by w ay of the follow ing table.

## 19/11/99 $429,335.72 

24\. As can be seen from the table, from about July 1999 Vatten had received much more money from Hyundai than it had paid CHS. By 21 July 1999, CHS had submitted three progress claims totalling approximately $588,529.56; it had been paid $133,416.39; and Vatten had received $242,888.47 from Hyundai. There w as a difference of approximately $109,000 betw een the amount received by Vatten and the amount paid out by it. A month later, on 16 August 1999, Vatten received a further $171,884.29 and on the same day it paid CHS $10,000 and a further $150,000 four days later. By then therefore Vatten had

gap betw een payments received and payments made continued and by the beginning of September received over $414,000 and had paid out $293,416.39 increasing the difference to about $121,000. The



This in itself does not prove the plaintiffs case, how ever, since there w as a difference in the price that they quoted to Vatten and that w hich Vatten quoted to Hyundai and also there w ere certain parts of the painting w orks (although minor ones) w hich Vatten had not subcontracted to CHS. 

25\. The evidence of Mr CG Tan on this part of the claim w as that from time to time the CHS had submitted its progress claims to Vatten for payment. These claims w ere evaluated by Mr Tan follow ing measurements of the painting w orks carried out or completed from time to time. These measurements w ere taken by Mr Tan Ah San, another director of CHS and Mr CG Tans brother. Mr CG Tan conceded that the progress claims 

w ere not alw ays submitted by the 13th day of the month as had been agreed betw een the parties (in fact 

only one of the nine claims submitted bears a date falling before the 13th day of the month in question and the claims w ere not submitted at regular monthly intervals). He said that the delay in submitting the claims w as caused by delay of Mr Lim in attending the joint measurement session and also by the fact that 

sometime in April 1999 the submission date for the claims w as changed to the 25th day of each month at the request of Mr Lim. 

26\. Mr Tan w ent on to assert that Vatten had never objected to nor strictly insisted that progress claims be 

submitted by the 13th day of each month. Vatten continued to make payment to CHS notw ithstanding the late submission of the progress claims. What happened w as that after the submission of each claim, Mr Lim w ould call Mr Tan and ask that CHS render an invoice for the progress claim submitted in an amount dictated by Mr Lim. For example the amount claimed in progress claim No.6 dated 26 November 1999 w as $409,874.57 but Mr Tan w as asked to render an invoice for $73,000. He w as told that if such an invoice w as not rendered no payment w ould be made to the plaintiffs in respect of that progress claim. 

27\. From November 1999 onw ards Vatten did not pay any attention to the measurements taken by Mr Tan Ah San. Mr Lim w ould arbitrarily dictate amounts to be paid to CHS. The amounts w ere much less than the value of the actual w orks carried out but Mr Tan w as w arned by Mr Lim that if he did not accept the dictated amounts CHS w ould not be paid. Mr Tan kept asking Mr Lim for Hyundais certification of the w orks done from time to time. Mr Lim refused to entertain these requests. The gross underpayments by Vatten adversely affected CHS and caused them many problems in carrying out and completing the painting w orks. In substantiating his assertions of gross underpayment, Mr Tan referred to part of the table set out about ie that portion relating only to the progress claims and invoices made by CHS and the payments received by them from Vatten. 

28\. When it came to submissions, the plaintiffs case changed. Their new focus w as on the obligation by Vatten under the sub-contract to pay CHS related monies. It w as pointed out that Mr Lim had accepted this as a contractual obligation and that accordingly Vatten w as obliged to pay CHS a proportion of the monthly payments that Vatten itself received from Hyundai. CHS submitted that its payment claims w ere irrelevant for consideration of the amount due to it as this amount w as determined solely by w hat Hyundai had determined w as due to Vatten based on Hyundais calculation of the w ork done to date. 

29\. CHS submitted that that part of the subcontract dealing w ith the submission of progress claims by CHS on a monthly basis became redundant and had been w aived by Vatten as there w as already a mechanism in place to determine the quantity of w ork done at the end of each month. They relied on the follow ing evidence: 

(1) Mr Lims admission that progress claims w ere only estimates of the quantity of w ork done each month; 

(2) His further admission that the purpose of the submission by CHS of progress claims w as to enable Vatten to make similar submissions to Hyundai; 


(3) That in fact Hyundai had six quantity surveyors to survey and quantify the painting w orks done by CHS and that Vatten had left it to Hyundai to w ork out the monthly quantities. Mr Kim Suk Chul, a planning engineer employed by Hyundai w ho w as engaged in preparing interim certificates for the painting w orks for this project, testified that Vatten had left it entirely to Hyundai to w ork out the quantities and had thereafter accepted the quantities so calculated. Mr Lim had never disputed any of these quantities although he w as entitled under the contract to dispute them if he disagreed w ith t h e calculation. 

30\. CHS put their case on underpayment in the follow ing w ay. First they identified the three areas of additional w ork w hich had not been done by them, namely, the painting w orks for the chemical store, the digesters and the GRC fins. Then they noted that since the first evaluation of the w ork at the GRC fins w as done in September 2000 and it took tw o months after certification for Hyundai to pay Vatten, the payments made by Hyundai to Vatten before 18 October 2000 did not include the painting of the fins. Thirdly they relied on Mr Lims admission that in respect of payments for interim certificates Nos 1-14, the "related monies" received by Vatten from Hyundai w ere all in respect of the plaintiffs w orks. 

31\. Using the above points to evaluate the payments made by Hyundai to Vatten, CHS submitted that the amount of "related monies" received by Vatten from Hyundai in respect of the plaintiffs w orks in certificates Nos 10-18 w ere as follow s :

32\. CHS then stated that in December 1999 Vatten had w orked out the monies payable to CHS from the monies received from Hyundai and reflected these in a certificate of sub-contract interim payment. That certificate show ed that the payment due to CHS for w orks certified up to the end of November 1999 w as $624,877.68. During cross examination, Mr Lim agreed that if this amount of $624,877.68 w ere to be divided by the sum of $829,919.45 (the amount received by Vatten from Hyundai for w ork up to end November 1999), a factor of 0.7529 w ould be obtained. 

33\. CHS w ent on to argue that in respect of certificate No 18 and on the assumption that the revised rates for the three classes of w ork for the internal w alls applied, Mr Lim had w orked out the corresponding value of CHSs w ork as being $1,006,099.10. On that basis the "related monies" paid by Hyundai for certificate No 18 had been w orked out by the plaintiffs in the table at paragraph 33 above to be $1,296,236.83. If the corresponding value of $1,006,099.10 given by Mr Lim is divided by the "related monies" of $1,296,236. received from Hyundai, a factor of 0.7761 is obtained. 

34\. CHS then submitted that the corresponding value of their w orks from end November 1999 (certificate No 10) to end July 2000 (certificate No 18) w hen divided by the "related monies" received by Vatten from Hyundai must be a factor w ithin the bounds of 0.7529 and 0.7761. They then stated that if the low er factor of 0.7529 w ere to be adopted for certificates Nos 11-17 the value of the plaintiffs w orks w ould be as follow s :

35\. Using this same factor CHS w orked out the amount by w hich they had been underpaid. The detailed calculations w ere show n in Appendix 1 of the plaintiffs submissions and are summarised in the follow ing table:

36\. CHS concluded their submission on this point by stating that underpayment by Vatten had increased over time. In May 2000, the under payment w as in excess of $65,000. By July 2000 it w as in excess of $90,000 and by September 2000 it w as in excess of $118,000. Therefore there had been persistent underpayment by Vatten. 

37\. In response to the above submissions, the defendants drew the courts attention to the fact that the original claim made by CHS w as that Vatten had breached the contract by failing to pay CHS the amount of $220,666.47 contained in one progress claim, that of 20 July 2000. On the first day of the hearing, CHS amended their statement of claim and inserted the allegation in 14 that Vatten had underpaid them in respect of ten progress claims. Eight days later they applied to re-amend 14 so that it averred that the alleged underpayments related to either the progress claims or the related monies from Hyundai. By the time of the closing submissions CHS had abandoned the issue of the progress claims altogether and, as has been indicated earlier, relied only on the alleged underpayments in respect of the related monies. 

38\. Vatten submitted that the tw o amendments made in the course of the hearing supported their contention that the plaintiffs allegations w ere not based on facts but w ere motivated by the need to bolster a w eak case. They submitted that the table produced by CHS (reproduced in 36 above) show ing the amount of alleged underpayments by Vatten w as untenable as it w as based on projections obtained by using a "factor" of 0.7529 instead of being based on evidence. Further, the figures in that table had not been adduced in evidence by any of the plaintiffs w itnesses and Vatten had no opportunity to cross examine those w itnesses on the figures. Nor w as defence counsel able to put those figures to the plaintiffs w itnesses. In addition, since the figures in the table w ere not pleaded and w ere quite different from the amounts of the alleged underpayments in fact pleaded by the plaintiffs in the further and better particulars filed by them on 6 August 2001, the court could not, and should not, accept them as part of the plaintiffs case. 

39\. Before I can decide w hether there w as persistent underpayment by Vatten, I have to establish exactly w hat Vattens payment obligations under the sub-contract w ere. The relevant contractual term is cl 1. This provides, in part that payment shall be based upon CHS application for interim payment for w ork done and for cost of materials on site but w ill be revised in accordance w ith the amount of related monies received by Vatten from Hyundai. No direct submission on the meaning of this provision w as made by CHS. 

40\. Having considered the clause objectively, it appears to me that the intention behind it w as that CHS w ould submit a claim for payment at monthly intervals based on the w ork done on site during the previous month and on the materials purchased. Using this as a basis, Vatten w ould submit their ow n claim to Hyundai w ho w ould then calculate the amount due based on the rates w hich Vatten had quoted it and its ow n measurement and evaluation of the w ork done and materials on site. Hyundai w ould then pay Vatten 


in accordance w ith such assessment and, it appears to me, the clause contemplated that Vatten w ould be able to w ork out from the payment how the assessment had been made and revise the amount payable to CHS on the basis of CHSs rates for the w ork accepted by Hyundai. Contrary to the submission made on behalf of the plaintiffs, there w as nothing in the sub-contract w hich obliged Vatten to pay CHS a certain percentage of each payment received from Hyundai or to calculate the amount payable to CHS based on any particular factor. The only w ay that such an argument could w ork is if such an obligation w as implied by the use of the term related monies. The term related monies does not how ever have any particular legal meaning and no evidence w as given by CHS that as betw een the parties it w as understood to have a particular meaning in terms of the exact percentage of Hyundais payments that had to be passed on to CHS. 

41\. It therefore appears to me that in order to establish a claim for persistent underpayment, CHS w ould have to show w hat exactly it w as entitled to based on the w ork done as assessed and paid for by Hyundai. It did not do this. As I stated earlier an examination of the table in 14 of the statement of claim and reproduced in 23 above, show s that there w as at times quite a gap betw een w hat Vatten received and w hat it paid out. How ever, as I also stated earlier, this in itself did not prove the plaintiffs case because of the difference in prices betw een the main contract and the sub-contract. In this regard it w as Mr Lims evidence that his profit margin varied depending on the items of w ork: in some cases it w as 19% and in others it reached as high as 41%. As submitted by Vatten, it w as also notew orthy that the basis of the plaintiffs claim for underpayment in this action changed several times in the course of the action and ended up being based on a premise w hich had neither appeared during the trial nor been pleaded ie that payments from Vatten to CHS had to be made in accordance w ith a consistent factor of at least 0.7529. 

42\. The change in the plaintiffs case w as also evidenced by the affidavit filed by Mr CG Tan. I have set out his evidence at length above. There he referred to the progress claims and stressed his complaint that Vatten insisted on paying arbitary amounts w hich w ere much less than the value of the actual w orks carried out by CHS on site. He referred to a table show ing and comparing the progress claims submitted by CHS and the payments made by Vatten and said that it w as apparent from this that Vatten had alw ays grossly underpaid CHS. In court too, Mr Tan reiterated that the allegations of underpayment w ere made in relation to the progress claims submitted by CHS to Vatten because of the comparison as show n in the table. Mr Tan did not base his complaints on Vattens failure to pay CHS the related monies or any particular proportion of the payments they received from Hyundai. His evidence supported a case based on underpayment of the plaintiffs progress claims and not one based on underpayment of related monies from Hyundai. It is clear therefore that w hen his affidavit w as prepared the plaintiffs w ere proceeding on a different basis to that w hich they eventually adopted. CHS must, how ever, have realised in the course of the trial that it w ould be difficult to succeed on the original basis since Mr Tan admitted that all along the CHS progress claims w ere not accurate and w ere submitted simply for show and for Mr Lims approval. That must have been one of the reasons w hy the pleadings w ere amended and, in the final submissions, the issue of underpayment of progress claims w as dropped altogether. 

43\. In my judgment, the plaintiffs have not established their allegation of a persistent underpayment by the defendants nor any clear basis for such an allegation. 

**Issue 3: Was Vattens termination of the subcontract on 18 October 2000 wrongful?** 

44\. The plaintiffs submission that Vatten acted w rongfully in terminating the subcontract on 18 October 2000 is based on the follow ing propositions: 

(1) that Vatten had persistently underpaid them; and/or 

(2) Vatten had no ground to terminate the subcontract because CHS: 


(a) had not abandoned the w orks; or 

(b) had justified to Vatten the reason for not being able to carry out further w orks; or 

(c) had substantially completed the subcontract w orks. 

I do not need to deal w ith the first proposition as I have already found that the plaintiffs have not proved their allegation of persistent underpayment. 

45\. On 18 October 2000, Messrs Wee Tay & Lim, Vattens solicitors, w rote to CHS. The material part of this letter read: 

 We have been instructed that you w ere engaged by our clients as a sub-contractor to do the painting w orks for Seletar Sew age Treatment Works P h a s e III ("the Project"). 

 We have also been instructed that you have acted in breach of your obligations under the sub-contract and have stopped w ork. 

 Our clients therefore treat your refusal to complete the w orks as a repudiation of the sub-contract. Our clients accept your repudiation. They w ill engage another subcontractor to rectify your breaches and complete the w ork, and w ill seek damages against you. 

It is common ground that if CHS had indeed stopped w ork w ithout a sufficient justification, it w ould have acted in breach of the subcontract and Vatten w ould have been justified in terminating the subcontract. The dispute is over w hether CHS did stop w ork and secondly, if it did so, w hether it could justify its action as being caused by Vattens default. 

46\. According to Mr Lim, on 5 October 2000, the plaintiffs representative on site, Mr Tan Ah San, informed him that CHS had stopped w ork. Mr Tan did not give Mr Lim any reason for the stoppage. The next day, Mr Lim w rote to CHS stating that he w ished to put on record that he had been informed by their site representative Ah San on 5 October that CHS had stopped w ork at the project. Mr Lim said that he could not understand and could not see any reason for this action. He asked CHS to justify. Vatten sent this letter out by fax and received tw o replies both w ritten on the bottom of their ow n letter w hich w as faxed back to them. The first one, w ritten on 7 October, stated in English: 

Sir, 

 We have to stop w ork because w e had not received the progress payment dued (sic) from you in time. Our w orks and material suppliers are all w aiting for their payment. 

W e w ill resume w ork once the payment is made. 

W e w ish you to look into this urgent matter closely. Thank you. 

The second reply w as w ritten in Mandarin and dated 10 October 2000. It said: 

You are the boss. 

 Give money, start w ork straightaw ay. Because no money to pay w ages. (No money 


 to buy materials) Make payment everything can, O.K. (No money to buy papers to issue invoices.) 

In cross-examination, Mr GC Tan w as show n both these replies and he confirmed that by them, CHS had explained to Vatten that they had to stop w ork because they had not received the progress payment in time. He also confirmed that in the second reply, that w ritten on 10 October, there had been no denial that the plaintiffs had stopped w ork on the project. 

47\. Initially, the plaintiffs position in relation to the w ork stoppage w as not in conflict w ith that of the defendants. In the statement of claim endorsed on the w rit, CHS asserted that the refusal by Vatten to make full payment of their progress claim dated 20 July 2000 for the sum of $220,666.47 had severely affected their ability to carry on w ork on the project. In the original 10 CHS stated that they had had to stop w ork because of this as they w ere unable to make corresponding payments to their paint supplier, Messrs DNT Singapore Pte Ltd and their ow n w orkers. This w as an admission on the part of CHS and this admission w as repeated in the follow ing paragraph w hen CHS averred that by their letter of 7 October 2000 they informed Vatten that they had to stop w ork because of Vattens failure to make payment and that they had assured Vatten that w ork could resume once payment w as received. 

48\. Six months later, how ever, on the first day of the hearing, CHS applied to amend 10 of the statement of claim. The amendment in effect retracted the admission that w ork had been stopped because it stated that the w ork that w as stopped w as w ork in new areas and did not include touch-up w ork w hich the plaintiffs continued to do until they w ere forcibly ejected from the site on 18 October 2000. 

49\. Along w ith the amendments to the statement of claim came amendments to the affidavits of evidence- in-chief of both Mr GC Tan and his brother, Mr Tan Ah San. In the original version, both men had stated that on 18 October 2000, although the plaintiffs w ere hampered in their ability to carry out painting w orks on new areas, w hile three w orkers of the plaintiffs w ere on their w ay to carry out minor touch-up w orks on the door frames at Batteries A&B area, the defendants had forcibly ejected the w orkers from the site. In the amended version, the three w orkers w ere not on the w ay to do the touch-up w orks but w ere actually doing touch-up w orks at a different location, the Inlet Area, w hen they w ere forcibly ejected from the site. In the w itness box, Mr GC Tan explained that w hen he had made his affidavit he had not asked his w orkers w hat had actually happened. Subsequently, he had clarified the date w ith them and found out that on 18 October they w ere at the Inlet Area w hereas they had been around Batteries A&B on 16 and 17 October 

2000\. Mr Tan Ah San stated that the change in the evidence w as because of a misunderstanding on his part as to w hat he had been told by the w orkers. He had passed the misinformation on to his brother and that w as w hy Mr GC Tans first affidavit had the w rong data. This w as only corrected w hen Mr Tan Ah San asked the w orkers again as to w hat had happened. He confirmed that his evidence w as based on w hat the w orker Ponniah Arumugam had told him. 

50\. In support of the amended version of the facts, CHS called their w orker, Mr Ponniah Arumugam. He stated that he w as a painter w orking on the project from 15 March 1999 to 18 October 2000. He confirmed that in the month of October 2000, he did painting w orks at the site everyday (except perhaps on 1 and 6 October 2000 w hich w ere Sundays) w ith tw o other w orkers. The painting w orks w ere mainly touch-up w orks. Specifically, on 15, 16 and 17 October 2000, the three men had carried out touch-up w orks at the Inlet Area from about 8 am in the morning until about 7 pm at night. On 18 October at about 8.30 am w hile the three w ere w orking at the Inlet Area, they w ere stopped by security personnel and asked to leave the site. They w ere then escorted to the security post at the entrance to the site. From the post, Mr Ponniah called Mr Lim on the telephone and told him w hat had happened. Mr Lim said that the painting w orks w ere finished already and asked Mr Ponniah to leave the site immediately. Mr Ponniah had no choice but to leave the site. 


51\. The oral evidence that CHS had continued w ork at the site after 5 October by sending three w orkers to do touch-up w orks at various locations w as inconsistent w ith the tw o hand-w ritten notes sent by CHS to Vatten on 7 and 10 October. If Vattens allegations w ere w rong and CHS had not stopped w ork, the natural response w ould have been for CHS to deny the allegation and set the record straight. How ever, CHS did the opposite: they confirmed that they had stopped w ork. 

52\. Secondly, the first tw o replies w ere hand-w ritten ones and, perhaps, could be explained aw ay as having been w ritten or dictated by Mr GC Tan in ignorance of w hat w as actually happening on site as he did not visit the site but relied on his brother for information. Surely, how ever, the true position w ould have become know n w ithin a reasonable time thereafter especially since Vatten used the alleged w ork stoppage as their reason for terminating the subcontract. It is interesting in this context that CHS did not take the opportunity to set the record straight until the beginning of the trial some eight months later. 

53\. After the termination letter, many letters w ere w ritten by CHS to Vatten on various issues and on their claims against Vatten. The dates of these letters w ere 27 October, 3 November, 7 November, 14 November, 17 November, 22 November and 1 December 2000. In none of these letters did CHS deny Vattens allegation that they had stopped w ork on the project. In fact in the 1 December letter, CHS referred to their earlier reply of 7 October 2000 and repeated verbatim the w ords of that reply. Whilst specifically affirming that they had stopped w ork, CHS did not either in this letter or in any other assert that the stoppage of w ork w as in relation to new areas only and that they had had three w orkers doing touch-up w ork in the old areas until these w orkers w ere forcibly ejected from the site. 

54\. I think that the contemporaneous correspondence must be given its due w eight. The letters that CHS w rote after the termination w ere not prepared by either of its directors: neither of them w ere fluent in English. Instead, Mr GC Tan sought the help of one Francis Teo Teng Siu in the preparation and presentation of the plaintiffs claim against Vatten. Mr Teo is a quantity surveyor and also a qualified law yer. He has been admitted to the Bar in both England and Singapore. He is the sole proprietor of Messrs Francis Teo & Associates, a firm engaged in quantity surveying and contractual claims for construction projects. Mr Teo w as called by the plaintiffs as their expert w itness in this action and, on their behalf, review ed the evaluation of the plaintiffs w orks at the project that had been prepared by Vatten. In court, Mr Teo confirmed that he had w ritten all the letters that I have mentioned in 53 above and had advised Mr GC Tan i n general on the plaintiffs claim. Interestingly, Mr GC Tan in his evidence denied that Francis Teo had assisted him in drafting those letters. He even w ent so far as to say that Mr Teo had not given him any advice in respect of any of the letters and that in late 2000 Mr Teo had not advised CHS on their claim against Vatten. 

55\. I do not accept Mr Tans evidence that the letters w ere w ritten not by Mr Francis Teo but by some friend of his also w ith the surname Teo w hom he asked to help because Mr Tan himself did not know how to w rite in English. Mr Tan w as not able to give the full name of the other Teo or any other details about him. I find it significant that in these letters w ritten by a quantity surveyor w ith legal training w ho w ould have appreciated the consequences of an unjustified stoppage of w ork by a contractor, it w as never asserted that there w as no full stoppage and that w ork continued in some sort of fashion until the plaintiffs w orkers w ere forcibly removed from the site. 

56\. I do not accept the evidence of Mr Ponniah and the tw o Tan brothers that Mr Ponniah and his co- w orkers w ere on the site until 18 October 2000. Sending the w orkers to the site w ould have been totally inconsistent w ith the stand taken by CHS in their letters of 7 and 10 October. Tellingly, CHS did not protest in w riting after their w orkers w ere allegedly illegally ejected from the site. Further there w as no independent evidence of the presence of these w orkers on the site. On the contrary, such independent evidence as there w as supported Vattens stand that after 5 October none of CHS w orkers did any w ork on the project. A joint site inspection took place on 13 October 2000. It w as attended by one Johnny Choo 


Seow Meng, a technical inspector for DNT Singapore (DNT), the paint supplier. Mr Choos evidence w as that during the tw o to three hours he spent on the site that day, he did not see any w orkers carrying out painting w ork on site. Whilst Mr Choo admitted that he could not have covered every single part of the site during the inspection, it is likely that if there had been three men painting, he w ould have noticed them. Another person w ho attended the joint inspection w as Mr Choy Wai Kong of Tech 3 International, the contracting firm that w as employed by Vatten to take over the plaintiffs w ork. Mr Choy also testified that he did not see any painters during the site inspection. 

57\. Tech 3 Internationals w orkers started w ork on the project on 17 October 2000. According to Mr Choy, he did not see any other painters on the site after his w orkers commenced w ork. Neither did he receive reports from his w orkers of other painters. Further, CHS itself did not complain to Vatten on either 17 or 18 October that w orkers from another subcontractor w ere carrying out painting w orks. If CHS w as on the site and had not stopped w ork, it is likely that they w ould have complained of someone else trying to muscle in on their w orks. The entry of other subcontractors could not but interfere w ith the plaintiffs w orks and affect their claim and thus any such entry w ould almost automatically have draw n objections. 

58\. I find therefore that on 5 October 2000, CHS had stopped w ork. The next question is w hether they w ere justified in doing so or w hether the stoppage constituted a repudiatory breach of the subcontract. 

59\. CHS submitted that even if it w as found that they had in fact stopped w ork altogether on 5 October, they w ere entitled to rely on the defence that Vatten had persistently underpaid them to excuse themselves from further performance of the subcontract on the ground that such underpayments by Vatten constituted a repudiatory breach of the subcontract by Vatten. They w ent on to submit that even if in such circumstances their stoppage w as a breach, since Vattens persistent breaches in the form of underpayment had preceded and caused the plaintiffs breach, it w as the plaintiffs and not Vatten w ho had the right to terminate the subcontract. Since Vatten did not have the right to terminate the subcontract, they w ere in repudiatory breach w hen they issued their termination letter. Since I have found that CHS has not proved persistent underpayment by Vatten, the arguments based on that allegation must fail. 

60\. The alternative justification that CHS gave for stopping w ork w as that as stated in their reply of 7 October. They had to stop w ork because they had not received the progress payment in time. Their w orkers and suppliers w ere w aiting for payment and w ork w ould be resumed once payment w as made. CHS asserted that they had not absolutely refused to carry out the w ork as they had stated in their reply that they w ould resume w ork once payment w as made. By terminating the subcontract w ithout w arning and w ithout regard to the justification given by CHS, Vatten themselves w ere in repudiatory breach of the subcontract. 

61\. CHS relied on the follow ing proposition of law from _Keating on Building Contracts_ (6th Ed) to support their arguments: 

 Where one party has failed to perform a condition of the contract, the other party cannot rely on its non-performance if it w as caused by his ow n w rongful acts. (at p 168) 

62\. CHS had pleaded in 10 of their re-re-amended statement of claim that they had had to stop w ork because they w ere unable to make corresponding payments to the paint supplier and to their ow n w orkers. This pleading w as a reiteration of w hat w as w ritten in CHS reply of 7 October. In their submissions CHS quoted this reply once again. The question is w hether that position w as the true position. 

63\. To support the plaintiffs stand that they w ere not able to pay their paint supplier due to underpayment by Vatten, they produced a letter from DNT dated 24 August 2000 referring to the latters account of the 


same date for the sum of $449,299.19 out of w hich $412,884.56 w as due for immediate payment. DNT stated that the account w as long overdue and gave CHS notice that unless they received payment of the amount due w ithin 14 days, they w ould commence legal action. 

64\. In court, Mr Tan w as referred to this statement of account. He confirmed that many of the items on the statement did not relate to the project. Instead they w ere in respect of paint supplied for other projects that CHS had been w orking on concurrently in 1999 and 2000. Mr Tan further agreed that despite the threat in DNTs letter, the latter in fact trusted CHS and allow ed them to accumulate a large outstanding bill. This trust w as also show n by the fact that up to 18 September 2000, CHS w as still ordering paint from DNT and DNT continued to supply the paint ordered. Mr Tan confirmed that DNT had fulfilled all CHS orders and that their letter of 24 August 2000 had only been a w arning. DNT trusted CHS because CHS ordered paint from them for all their projects. When it w as put to Mr Tan that it w as not true that CHS had to stop w ork because they could not make payment to DNT, his answ er w as If you dont pay me the money, I cant survive. Workers w ages, everything, w e need to pay. It w ould appear that w hilst CHS did ow e DNT a substantial amount of money, much of this w as for material supplied for other projects and that CHS w as not, as at 5 October 2000, in imminent danger of being sued by DNT for non-payment. 

65\. CHS did not produce any evidence of their inability to pay their w orkers. Mr Ponniah Arumugam w ho w as w orking for them in October 2000 w as still employed in May 2001 w hen he gave evidence in court. That fact is some indication of the plaintiffs ability to hold on to their w orkers and inconsistent w ith an inability to pay their w orkers. Overall, the evidence does show that CHS w as experiencing some cash flow problems around August to October 2000 but not to the extent that continuing w ork on the project w ould have pushed them over the edge financially. According to a schedule produced by CHS, betw een January 1999 and September 2000, they had bought paint costing some $534,000 from DNT for the project. During that period, they had also been paid, according to their ow n calculations, $863,236.23 by Vatten. That sum w as enough to settle, if not all, a substantial part (at least half) of their paint bill. The outstanding sum of $449,299.19 payable to DNT could not therefore be attributable entirely or even substantially to underpayment by Vatten. 

66\. In any case, difficulty in settling ones suppliers and w orkers bills w ould not justify breaching the subcontract by stopping w ork unless that difficulty w as caused by a pre-existing breach in its payment obligations by Vatten. CHS accepted that one or tw o failures on the part of Vatten to make payment of amounts due w ould not justify a w ork stoppage. That is w hy they had submitted that there had been persistent underpayment and that the cumulative effect of such underpayment w as a breach on the part of Vatten indicating an intention to repudiate the subcontract. Since that assertion of persistent underpayment w as not established, any difficulty that CHS experienced w ith payments to their w orkers and suppliers could not be laid at Vattens door. I find that CHS has not justified its w ork stoppage. 

67\. The consequence of my findings up to this stage is that by stopping w ork on 5 October 2000, CHS w as repudiating the subcontract and therefore Vatten w as entitled to terminate it after CHS failed to resume w ork. The next point raised by CHS that in fact their w ork stoppage could not be considered a repudiation since by the time it occurred, the w orks under the subcontract had been substantially completed, can be conveniently considered in conjunction w ith the fourth issue w hich relates to the value of the plaintiffs w orks as at 18 October 2000. 

**Issue 4: What was the value of CHS work as at 18 October 2000 and had they by then substantially completed the subcontract works?** 

68\. As an alternative, CHS asserted that the w ork stoppage did not constitute a repudiatory breach of the subcontract because they had already substantially completed their w orks. It appears to me from _Keating_ 

_on Building Contracts_ (6th Ed, pp 78 84) that the doctrine of substantial performance in building contracts 


applies to lump sum contracts and usually relates to w hether the contractor can claim payment of the lump sum price although he has not completed the w orks or w hether he has to make a claim for payment on a quantum meruit basis. It is not usually applied to the issue of w hether the contractor w as entitled to stop w ork before finishing all that had to be done. In my view , if the contractor stops w ork and indicates that he is not prepared to continue w ith the w ork although there is still w ork to be done, he w ould be in breach of contract even if the outstanding w ork remaining incomplete is only a small percentage of the total w ork under the contract, since someone has to do that w ork. 

69\. In discussing w hat is meant by substantial completion, Keating states that One test to be applied is w hether the w ork w as "finished" or "done" in the ordinary sense even though part of the w ork w as defective. Here, it w as the plaintiffs case in their closing submissions that they had completed about 98% of the subcontract w orks by 18 October 2000. This submission has to be contrasted w ith Mr Tans assertion during cross-examination that the amount of w ork completed w as 95% and the evidence adduced by the defendants on the amount of outstanding w orks. 

70\. As regards value, it is the plaintiffs case that as at 18 October, they had carried out painting w orks in the quantities show n in the table annexed to their letter of 27 October 2000 to Vattens solicitors. This show ed the total value of w ork done to be $1,398,235.88. It w as w orked out on the basis of the plaintiffs pleaded rates for the internal painting w orks. Using the revised rates of $2.85, $2.34 and $2.86, the value of the w orks w as calculated at $1,395,807.38. The plaintiffs claim for $557,963.74 (w ithout GST) w as calculated as the difference betw een the value of the w orks and the sum of $837,843.64 paid by Vatten (ie $863,236.23 less GST of $25,392.59). 

71\. The plaintiffs evaluation of the w orks w as based on their ow n measurements of the w orks done up to 18 October 2000. Mr Tan Ah San confirmed that he and his foreman, one Ah Chw ee, had done the measurements on w hich the evaluation w as based. After completing the measurements he had passed them to Mr GC Tan to w ork out the claim. It w as asserted that the accuracy of the measurements had not been challenged by Vatten save for w hat they considered to be the lack of qualifications of Mr Tan Ah San and Ah Chw ee. How ever, Mr Francis Teo, the plaintiffs expert, had given evidence that to take measurements of painting, no qualifications are needed it is very simple and anyone can do it. 

72\. The plaintiffs case on this issue faces some difficulties. As stated, the assessment that 98% (or, alternatively, 95%) of the w ork had been completed w as based on the measurements taken by Mr Tan Ah San and Ah Chw ee. Neither of these persons had any technical qualifications (and Mr Tan Ah San had only primary school education) and even Mr GC Tan admitted in the course of cross-examination that all along the progress claims based on the measurements w ere not accurate. 

73\. The evidence adduced by the plaintiffs in support of their measurements has to be balanced against that adduced by the defendants. Mr Kim of Hyundai gave evidence that as of 30 September 2000, the extent of completion of the painting w orks for the architectural items (as opposed to the civil w ork items w hich had already been completed) w as as follow s: 

(a) Inlet w orks 75.42% 

(b) Batteries A&B 78.57% 

(c) Sludge Processing Building 84.26% 

(d) Pow er House 68.66% 

(e) Digesters 32.14% 


(f) Fuel Oil Storage 70.64% 

(g) Transformer House 104.34% 

(h) Additional Painting 90.51% 

The painting w orks for the digesters and chemical store w ere not part of the subcontract. Even taking out those items, the evidence of Mr Kim establishes that the subcontract w orks w ere not 98% complete nor even 95% complete. The level of completion varied. According to a document produced by Mr Kim, overall, as at 30 September 2000, the architectural w orks w ere 87.72% complete. In the course of Mr Kims crossexamination, it became clear that the figure of 87.72% w as an estimate and may not have been completely accurate. What also emerged, how ever, w as that quite a bit of painting w orks had to be done after October 2000 and, as at the date of the hearing, there w ere still some painting w orks being carried on. 

74\. Another w itness, Mr Choo of DNT, estimated that as at 13 October 2000, about 20% of the architectural painting w orks for four buildings (Inlet w orks, Batteries A&B, Sludge Processing Building and Pow er House) had not been completed. Mr Hw ang of Hyundai w as also adamant that the architectural painting w orks had not been completed by October 2000 although he w as not able to give an exact estimate of the amount of w ork outstanding. 

75\. I accept the evidence adduced on behalf of the defendants in preference to that proferred by the plaintiffs. Hyundai had the backup of a large professional staff and they had to take measurements for their ow n progress claims to the employer. There w as no reason for Hyundai to take the part of either the plaintiffs or the defendants or to lie about the substantial completion of the w ork as at October 2000. Whilst the Hyundai certificates may not have been completely accurate in terms of percentages, I accept the w itnesses testimony that the painting w orks remained incomplete w hen the plaintiffs stopped w ork. As at that date it w as not possible to say they w ere finished or done in the ordinary sense. 

76\. The plaintiffs have the burden of proving the assertion that the w ork w as substantially complete as of 18 October 2000 w hen they say they w ere forced to leave the site. They have not discharged this burden. Mr Tan Ah Sans measurements w ere not even regarded as completely reliable by his ow n brother. 

77\. In terms of percentage of w ork completed, I have not been persuaded by the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs. This finding also impacts on the plaintiffs valuation of the w ork that they had done since that valuation w as, like their assessment of percentage of completed w orks, based on the measurements of Mr Tan Ah San and Ah Chw ee. The plaintiffs original valuation w as $1,395,807.38. An alternative valuation put forw ard at the trial w as that of Mr Francis Teo. He valued the w ork as being w orth $1,275,000. In court Mr Te o admitted that his valuation w as based on the measurements taken by the plaintiffs and also on a number of assumptions namely: 

(a) that the information given to him by CHS about the quantity of paint w as correct; 

(b) that the paint in question had been used for the project; and 

(c) that the paint w as not used for reapplication for areas that w ere rejected. 

Mr Teo admitted that he had no personal know ledge w hether any of these assumptions w ere in fact justified. Since he did no measurements of his ow n and could not be sure of the quantities of paint used, it is not safe for me to rely on Mr Teos valuation as an alternative basis for assessing the value of the plaintiffs w orks. 


78\. The position put forw ard by the defendants as to the value of the plaintiffs w orks and the amounts due to them w as as follow s. As at 5 October 2000, Vatten had received payment for w ork done until 31 July 

2000\. This payment w as made by Hyundai on 21 September 2000. Based on the quantities certified by Hyundai and the original rates quoted by CHS, the sum of $39,361.05 plus GST w as due to CHS as at 5 October 2000. As no w ork w as carried out by CHS betw een 5 and 18 October 2000, the same amount w as due to CHS on 18 October. Vatten derived the sum of $39,961.05 from the follow ing calculation: 

 Total value of w orks: $926,805.09 Less: (a) 5% retention $ 46,340.25 (b) Contra-charges $ 9,613.61 $870,851.23 Add: 3% GST $ 26,125.54 Less: (c) Payments prior to August 2000 $780,890.18+ GST ($24,926.71) (d) Payment on 1 August 2000 $ 30,000.00 (incl. GST) (e) Payment on 1 September 2000 $ 20,000.00 (incl. GST) Interim Amount due to Plaintiffs $39,961.05 + GST 

79\. I cannot accept the defendants submission. W hilst in October 2000, CHS may only have been entitled to receive payment for w ork done up to the end of July that year since that w as all that Vatten itself had received from Hyundai, this case w as not commenced then. The action w as started in mid December 2000. By then Vatten should have received payment for w ork up to the end of September 2000 since Hyundai had issued its status report on those w orks on 10 November 2000, and, subject to Vattens rights of set off and counterclaim, CHS w ould have been able to claim the monies due for their w ork up to the same date, less the agreed retention sums. There is no dispute that CHS did w ork on the site in August and September 

2000\. In these circumstances, I do not think that it is correct for me to assess the plaintiffs w ork only up to the end of July 2000 as contended by Vatten. 

80\. Among the documents w hich CHS managed to obtain from Hyundai w ere the latters subcontract interim progress payment status certificates for w ork done up to 31 August 2000 and 31 October 2000. Attached to each certificate w as a summary for all w orks done as of the respective dates. Although I did not see it, there must be a similar certificate and summary for w ork done up to 30 September 2000. Using this information and the rates payable to CHS for the w orks done by them, Vatten should be able to calculate the value of the plaintiffs w orks as of the end of September 2000 if not as of 5 October 2000. I cannot do so. At this stage, therefore, I can only find that as at 5 October 2000 there w as at least $39,961.05 + GST due to CHS on the basis of w ork completed till the end of July and additional amounts due for the internal painting w orks calculated according to the revised rates and for the extra w ork done thereafter w hich must be separately assessed. 

81\. CHS, on the basis that their employment had been w rongfully terminated by Vatten, also put in a claim for damages for the loss of profit that they w ould have earned had they been able to complete the w orks. CHS estimated that the value of the remaining w orks w as $21,894.04 and that on the basis of a profit rate of 15%, they w ould have earned $3,284.11 on these w orks. Since I have found that Vatten w as entitled to terminate the plaintiffs employment because of the latters breach, this claim for damages must fail. 

**Issue 5: Were there defects in CHS works in respect of which Vatten is entitled to a set-off?** 


82\. The defendants claim a set-off in respect of the amount found to be due to CHS for their w ork. They rely on clause 6 of the letter of intent w hich provides that Vatten shall have the right to recover all their costs that arise from non-acceptable w ork performed by CHS and the re-performing of such w ork. I accept that if Vatten w ere able to prove that CHS had not performed the w ork properly and Vatten incurred costs in remedying those defects, they w ould be able to recover such costs. The problem here is that Vattens claim at this stage is inchoate. 

83\. In their submissions, the defendants pointed out that throughout the course of the painting w orks, they had received many complaints from Hyundai in relation to defects in the plaintiffs w ork. They gave a list of complaints that they had received relating to bad w orkmanship and unsatisfactory w orks. Vatten also stated that on 21 October 2000, after CHS left the site, Hyundai w rote to Vatten to complain about defects in the w ork. They made remarks like Final coat, colour no good and final coat no good in respect of various buildings painted by CHS. How ever, they did not give specific details of any of these defective w orks for example, the location and extent of the same, or of the costs that they had incurred or w ould incur to remedy them. 

84\. The plaintiffs response to the allegation of defective w orks w as that there w as no credible evidence to establish the same. It w as submitted that all defects that had been noticed in the course of the w ork had been rectified as and w hen they w ere pointed out. Mr Lim himself had agreed in cross-examination that CHS w as required to make good all defects to a particular coating before the next coating w as permitted to be applied. Further, the contract required inspection and approval of each coating before CHS w as allow ed to apply the next coat. It is also material that in respect of the civil w orks the evidence w as that all defects to them w ould have been rectified before handover to the employer in October 2000. Even Mr Choy, the subcontractor w ho took over after CHS stopped w ork, testified that he could not recall seeing any defective w orks at the site w hen he inspected it in October 2000. 

85\. There w as one specific assertion of damage caused by the plaintiffs w orkers and that w as in relation w hat w ere called the PSB labels on the doors. In Vattens closing submission, it w as stated that this matter w as only discovered after CHS had left the site and it w ould be taken up if interlocutory judgment w as granted to Vatten. No amount has been specified in relation to this claim although there w as a letter from Hyundai indicating that they w ould be holding Vatten responsible for the replacement of the damaged labels and all expenses incurred by Hyundai in this respect w ould be deducted from Vattens price. CHS has responded to this claim by pointing out that the first notification of it came on 21 October 2000, after they left the site, and asserting any damage done w as caused by the w orkers of the replacement contractor. 

86\. On the general issue of defects, Vatten has not made out their case. If indeed there are any defects in the w orks done by CHS in respect of w hich Vatten w ill have to incur costs in rectification, Vatten is free to bring a claim for reimbursement as and w hen such defects materialise and/or the costs are incurred. At present, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate any damage caused to Vatten by reason of any inadequacy in the w orkmanship of CHS. The same reasoning applies to the claim for damage to the PSB labels. As of the date of the filing of the counterclaim, no monies had been deducted from Vatten for this claim. The claim had not crystallised. If monies are subsequently deducted and if Vatten can show that all or part of those monies are attributable to damage caused by the plaintiffs w orkers, they can make a claim against CHS at that stage. 

**Issue 6: Is Vatten entitled to charge CHS for the cost of spark tests carried out by Hyundai?** 

87\. Section 3.3.5.3 of the specifications of the main contract betw een Hyundai and the Government is entitled Amine Cured Coal Tar Epoxy Protective Coating. It contains directions as to the type of coating to be used and how it is to be applied. In sub-section 3.3.5.3.6 it is stated that When completed, and again just before commissioning, coatings w ill be spark tested as directed by the S.O. at a minimum of 2500 volts 


### D.C.. 

88\. Hyundais position w as that by virtue of its subcontract w ith Vatten, Vatten w as obliged to carry out the spark tests. It should be noted that clause 11 of that contract provided that Vatten w ould be responsible for testing of any materials as required under the [main] contract. Vatten incorporated a similar clause in their subcontract w ith CHS and took the stand that CHS as the back-to-back sub-subcontractor had undertaken this obligation. They also relied on Mr GC Tans admission under cross-examination that w hen CHS w as w orking on the project, they w ere required to carry out spark tests to test the thickness of the paint. It w as put to him that CHS had failed to conduct the spark tests as required under the subcontract. Mr Tans answ er w as: The problem is they w ent to do the spark test, they did not tell us. The consultant did the spark tests w ith Hyundais men. If he found defects he w ould mark the areas and w e w ould do the rectification. He then said that CHS w as not supposed to conduct the tests themselves but that the consultant had to be present. In the same answ er, Mr Tan said that the plaintiffs had conducted their ow n tests. It w as put to him that Hyundai had no choice but to deploy their ow n w orkers to do the tests because CHS had failed to do them. Mr Tans response w as that DNT, the paint maker, had conducted the tests. This rather confused testimony left me w ith the understanding that at some basic level Mr Tan accepted that spark tests w ere the plaintiffs responsibility but that he thought they had good excuses for not carrying out that responsibility completely. 

89\. Mr Hw ang Min Ju, a civil engineer employed by Hyundai on the project, gave evidence that as the plaintiffs had failed to conduct the tests, Hyundai had had no choice but to do them themselves as otherw ise the project w ould have been delayed and the penalties for the delay w ere high. He also testified that Hyundai may deduct the sum of $70,000 for these w orks at the end of project. 

90\. As at the date of the hearing, no money had been deducted from Vatten by Hyundai to cover the costs of spark tests carried out by Hyundai. As such, it is my judgment that Vattens claim for reimbursement is premature. I accept that the plaintiffs w ere contractually obliged to carry out the spark tests and that they did not carry out all these tests. How ever, the amount w hich Hyundai is entitled to charge for having to carry out the tests themselves has not been established. The sum of $70,000 appears to be an estimate rather than an exact calculation of the costs that Hyundai incurred. It is also not settled w hether Hyundai w ill in fact make a claim against Vatten for the costs of the spark tests. If it does so in the future, Vatten w ill be entitled to reimbursement from CHS for such sum as w as actually incurred by Hyundai on account of w ork that should have been done by CHS. 

**Issue 7: Was there an agreement for CHS to do the textural painting of the digesters at the rate of $9 per square metre?** 

91\. The background facts relating to this issue are that in January 1999, Vatten asked CHS if they w ould paint the digesters. CHS w as interested and submitted a quotation to do the w ork at the rate of $12.50 per square metre. They also prepared a mock-up. Subsequently, Mr Lim asked Mr GC Tan w hether he w ould reduce the rate to $9 per square metre. Vattens case is that CHS accepted the counter-offer and a contract came into being on that basis. According to Mr Lim, how ever, after Hyundai instructed Vatten to proceed w ith the digester w orks, he asked Mr Tan Ah San w hen the plaintiffs could do these w orks. At that stage Mr Tan stated that the plaintiffs did not w ant to do any additional w ork. Vatten then had to employ another subcontractor for this part of the w orks. CHS denies accepting the counter-offer. Mr Tan said that it w as impossible for him to agree to Mr Lims proposal since the rate suggested w as below his cost. 

92\. The contract, if any, w as an oral one. The issue is w hom to believe. I should point out here that both Mr Lim and Mr GC Tan did not alw ays tell the truth in their testimony. Submissions have been made that I should regard Mr Lim as a habitual liar. Although he w as forced to admit on several occasions that he w as not telling the truth, this does not mean that everything Mr Lim said w as untrue. In the case of the contract 


for the digesters, his assertions w ere supported by Vattens letter of 24 January 2000 to CHS. This letter consisted of several paragraphs under various headings. Item (B) w as entitled Texture Coating and it read: 

 As per our discussion and your verbal confirmation of S$9.00 per m2 inclusive of labors and materials for the texture paint to the 6 nos. of digester of an area of approximate 6000 sq.m., w e like to have your w ork schedule in order for us to arrange w ith Hyundai the necessary staging. The finishes should be similar to the sample done by you. 

It w as submitted that the above paragraph should be accepted as evidence of the verbal agreement since CHS had not at the time refuted the assertion of a contract. 

93\. CHS submitted that the letter could not be relied upon as evidence of an agreement. Counsel pointed out that during cross-examination Mr Lim had admitted that a statement made by him in the first sentence of the third paragraph of the same letter to w it We had in fact reminded you several times that Hyundai w ill only release payment upon giving them the calculation and draw ing of the completed area w as not correct. Counsel asserted that Mr Lim w as capable of w riting untruths in his letter and that it must be regarded as suspect since at that time CHS had made a claim for payment of $400,000 and Mr Lim w ould have been looking for grounds on w hich to resist that claim. 

94\. CHS submitted that a contract to paint the digesters at $9 per square metre could not have come into existence in January 2000 because: 

(1) Vatten could not have agreed on a rate w ith CHS as their ow n rate for the w orks vis--vis Hyundai w as not agreed then and in fact w as not confirmed until 7 March 2000; 

(2) Mr Lim had given evidence that he w ould not have proceeded w ith the w orks if the rate w as not confirmed by Hyundai; 

(3) since Hyundai had not asked Vatten to proceed w ith the w orks in January 2000, it w as completely unnecessary for Mr Lim to require CHS to submit their w ork schedule in order to enable him to arrange the necessary staging w ith Hyundai; 

(4) the evidence of the subcontractor eventually engaged by Vatten for the textural painting w as that Mr Lim did not ask him for a w ork schedule before he commenced w ork nor did Mr Lim or Hyundai give him a time limit for that w ork; and 

(5) in contrast w ith their reaction subsequently w hen CHS stopped w ork, Vatten did not complain in w riting of the plaintiffs alleged refusal to carry out the textural painting of the digesters. 

95\. Having considered the plaintiffs points carefully, I think that in fact there w as an agreement in the terms contended by Vatten. That agreement w as evidenced by the 24 January letter. It w as significant that at the hearing CHS at first objected to the admissibility of that letter. They did this even though the letter had been listed in the list of documents and the plaintiffs solicitors had included it as part of the Agreed Bundle. To counter the plaintiffs assertion that the letter had never been sent to them, the defendants adduced the original fax transmission w hich show ed that the plaintiffs had received the letter. Mr Tan then asserted that he had not seen the letter even though it may have been received in his office. 

96\. The language of the letter is very clear. It states that a verbal confirmation had been given of the rate. If this w as not true, the plaintiffs w ould have w ritten to the defendants to rebut it. Mr Tan made much of the fact that he did not know English and that he had little administrative assistance. This deficiency did not 


stop him from replying tw ice, once in English and once in Chinese, to the defendants subsequent letter protesting against the w ork stoppage. Further, in the years 1999 and 2000, the plaintiffs w ere involved in 12 projects and they employed a quantity surveyor and tw o other staff members. Just a w eek before the letter of 24 January, the plaintiffs had w ritten to the defendants demanding payment of an outstanding amount of $400,000 by 20 January 2000. No doubt that w as a brief letter but they could have w ritten equally briefly to say there w as no agreement at $9 per square metre. 

97\. As regards the argument by CHS that Vatten could not have come to an agreement w ith them in January 2000 because Hyundai had not aw arded the job to the defendants then, Mr Lims evidence w as that Hyundai had already confirmed that Vatten w as to carry out the job. It w as only the rate that had to be confirmed and the defendants w ere confident of obtaining a higher rate from Hyundai. If they had not been able to, they w ould still have had to pay CHS the agreed rate. In any case, if the rate of $9 per square metre w as below cost, Vatten had reasonable grounds for believing that the rate aw arded by Hyundai w ould be at least equal to if not more than that. 

98\. Further, w hen CHS backed out, Vatten employed Toh Hai Cheow to paint the digesters at the rate of $14.50 per square metre. This rate w as higher by $2 than the plaintiffs original quotation. As Vatten submitted, if it w as true that CHS had been prepared to carry out the w orks at $12.50 per square metre, it w ould have made commercial sense for Vatten to engage CHS to do the w ork at that rate instead of employing Mr Toh. 

99\. The evidence adduced by Vatten w as that in respect of the digester w ork they had paid Mr Toh $49,564.82 and paid DNT $32,515.04 for the paint. The total incurred w as $82,079.86 for an area of w ork covering 5,660.68 m. If CHS had done the same w ork at the contracted rate of $9 per square metre, Vatten w ould only have had to pay them $50,946.12. This means that Vatten incurred an extra $31,133.34 by reason of the plaintiffs refusal to carry out their agreement and Vatten is entitled to recover this sum from CHS. 

**Issue 8: Did Vatten seize any plant and material belonging to CHS?** 

100\. CHS contended that Vatten had w rongfully seized their plant and materials having a value of $15,035 w hen they w ere forcibly ejected from the site on 18 October 2000. Although by a solicitors letter dated 20 February 2001, Vatten had informed CHS that they could repossess their property, w hen CHS personnel actually w ent to the site to retrieve the same, they w ere denied access by the security guards. It w as submitted that even if Vatten had not seized the property, as a matter of law , Vatten had come under a duty to take reasonable care of the property on Vattens site after they ejected CHS from it. 

101\. I find great difficulty in this part of the plaintiffs case. The site did not belong to Vatten. Vatten w as not in occupation and possession of the site. The person in occupation w as Hyundai and it w as Hyundai w ho controlled the site and it w as Hyundais guards w ho w ould have ejected trespassers on the site. Even assuming that Mr Ponniah w as removed from the site on 18 October 2000, this removal w as not effected by Vatten but by Hyundai. If any plant and materials w ere left on the site, the same w ould have been w ithin the custody of Hyundai and not w ithin the custody of Vatten. 

102\. Further, the letter from the defendants solicitors w hich CHS referred to stated that CHS should let the defendants solicitors know w hen CHS intended to remove the items so that Vatten could make arrangements w ith Hyundai to give CHS access to the site. The plaintiffs solicitors never responded to this letter and in court, Mr GC Tan conceded that he had not replied to the offer. He said that instead of instructing his law yers to reply to the letter so that Hyundai could be informed, upon receipt of the letter he simply w ent straight to the site to retrieve the items. Thus, CHS have only themselves to blame if they could not get access to the site. 


103\. One of the items claimed w as a lorry. The evidence w as that it w as parked outside the security post in a public area and the keys w ere w ith Mr Tan Ah San. Mr Tan admitted to me that the keys had been w ith him since he had left the site. By November 2001, the lorry w as no longer parked outside the site. Since the keys w ere w ith CHS, they must have removed it. In any case, there w as nothing to stop them retrieving the lorry at any time. 

104\. The plaintiffs claim in respect of the plant and materials and the lorry is unfounded and must be dismissed. 

**Issue 9: Was the call on the performance bond wrongful?** 

105\. In regard to this issue, the submission of CHS w as that having regard to Vattens persistent breaches in underpaying CHS and their w rongful termination of the subcontract, the call on the bond by Vatten on 14 October 2000 and the receipt of the monies paid thereunder w as w rongful. CHS asked for restitution and/or an account of the sum of $60,000 paid to Vatten. My findings that the allegation of persistent underpayment w as not proved and that the termination by Vatten w as law ful have, accordingly, removed the basis of the argument that the call on the bond w as w rongful. As CHS w as in breach of contract by stopping w ork before completion, Vatten w as entitled to call on the bond. They w ill in due course have to account to CHS for the $60,000 received under the bond but this accounting w ill be part of the overall accounting for the project and not something arising out of a breach by CHS. If at the end of the day the calling of the bond means that Vatten has been over-compensated or CHS has been underpaid, the amount of the over-compensation or deficiency w ould have to be refunded by Vatten. 

**Issue 10: Is Vatten entitled to interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed?** 

106\. Vattens position on this issue w as that by stopping w ork CHS had repudiated the contract and this repudiation w as accepted by Vatten vide their solicitors letter of 16 October and 18 October 2000. Vatten then had to find another contractor on an urgent basis as otherw ise they w ould become liable to Hyundai for damages for delay. Vatten obtained three quotations as follow s: 

(1) One Teck General Contractors $298,000 

(2) SKK (S) Pte Ltd $285,000 

(3) Tech 3 International $275,000 

The w orks w ere aw arded to Tech 3 International and it w as agreed that Vatten w ould purchase the materials needed for the w orks and deduct the cost from the contract sum. The contract sum w as high because Tech 3 w as required to provide a w arranty for all the w orks including the major portion done by CHS since Vatten considered that they could not rely on CHS to return to the site to carry out rectification w orks. 

107\. At the time of the hearing Vatten had purchased paint valued at $52,000 for w ork done by Tech 3s w orkers. They had also paid Tech 3 a sum of $84,800 in respect of the labour cost. According to Mr Choy of Tech 3, his company had been chasing Vatten for the balance due of $138,200 but had been asked by Mr Lim to w ait until the final account w as issued by Hyundai w hen Vatten themselves w ould be paid. At the date of the submissions, the final account had not been issued and the defendants therefore asked for interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed to be entered against CHS. They agree that the bond of $60,000 should be taken into account w hen the damages are assessed. 

108\. CHS submitted that, even if Vattens termination of the subcontract w as law ful, they w ere not allow ed 


to claim against CHS for the w arranty procured from Tech 3. There w as no reason to obtain such a w arranty as Vatten still had their contractual right to demand that CHS make good any defects that may arise in the future. 

109\. What w ere the courses of action open to Vatten w hen CHS stopped w ork and Vatten consequently terminated the contract? The first w as to employ another subcontractor simply to complete the uncompleted w orks and to rectify any defects in his ow n w orks. If that course w as chosen and subsequently defects w ere discovered in CHS w ork, Vatten w ould have had to call on CHS to rectify their ow n defects and, in the event of CHS failing to do so, employ yet another subcontractor to do that w ork. The other alternative w as to take the course that Vatten actually chose ie to aw ard a lump sum contract for both the uncompleted w ork and rectification of all w orks. This meant not having to rely on CHS at all but having to pay a larger sum up front to cover defects w ithout any idea of the extent of defective w ork that w ould actually manifest itself. 

110\. Was Vatten reasonable in choosing the second course? They had given a w arranty to Hyundai for the painting w ork and had in turn received a w arranty from CHS. This w arranty considerably extended the period of the subcontractors liability for the w orks. Although I have found that Vatten has not established their claim for defective w orks at this stage, this does not mean that there is no reasonable likelihood of defects in the w ork appearing during the w arranty period w hich w ill require rectification. Vatten did produce evidence of many complaints made by Hyundai on the quality of the w orks. The plaintiffs response w as that any defects seen had been rectified by the time they left the site. They did not assert that no defects at all h a d manifested themselves. Taking into account that there w ere complaints about the plaintiffs w orkmanship and some defects at least manifested themselves w hile the plaintiffs w ere still on the site, there is a likelihood of more defects surfacing during the w arranty period. Further, the circumstances of the termination made it reasonable for Vatten to judge CHS unlikely to honour their w arranty commitments. In my judgment, it w as reasonable for Vatten to employ Tech 3 to provide not only w orkers to complete the w ork but also to undertake the w arranty obligations that should have been undertaken by CHS. 

111\. It appears therefore that the damages sustained by Vatten by the plaintiffs breach of contract w ould be the sum of $275,000 less w hat they w ould have had to pay CHS had CHS completed the w orks. These damages cannot be assessed by me since there is insufficient evidence of exactly how much w ork remained to be done w hen CHS left the site and w hat w ould have been payable for such w ork. These items w ill therefore have to go for assessment. As against the damages recoverable from CHS, there w ill have to be set off w hat w as payable to them for w ork done up to 5 October 2000. As stated therefore, the assessment w ill have to include evidence from Hyundai on w hat w as completed as at end of September 2002 and a calculation of w hat w as due to the plaintiffs based on the subcontract rates, as amended, and after deducting the retention amounts and previous payments made and those contra charges w hich the plaintiffs have accepted. 

**Conclusion** 

112\. My findings on the various issues are set out above. Basically, the plaintiffs have not succeeded on most of their claims, although I have found in their favour on the issue of the rates for the internal painting w orks and have also found that they should be paid for w orks up to October 2000. The defendants have succeeded on their claim for $31,133.34 in respect of the digesters and on the issue of an assessment of damages. They have, how ever, failed on other claims. 

113\. In the result, the plaintiffs are aw arded judgment in respect of the amount due to them for w ork done up to 5 October 2000, such amount to be assessed by the Registrar. The remainder of the plaintiffs claims are dismissed. 


114\. The defendants are aw arded judgment in the sum of $31,133.34 and are also aw arded judgment for damages to be assessed in respect of the plaintiffs breach of contract w hich caused them to employ Tech 3 International at a lump sum of $275,000. These damages shall be assessed at the same assessment as that relating to the w ork completed by the plaintiffs as at 5 October 2000. The remainder of the defendants claims are dismissed. 

115\. I w ill see the parties on costs.
