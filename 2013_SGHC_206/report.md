**Lai Siu Chiu J:** 

**Introduction** 

1       In the present ac tion, Belfield International (Hong Kong) Limited (“the plaintiff”) is c laiming against Sheagar s/o T M Veloo (“the defendant”) for US$358,480.57, interest and c osts under a guarantee that he gave for a loan extended to BlueSea Engineering Pte Ltd (“BlueSea”) by the plaintiff, of whic h the defendant was the managing direc tor and effec tive owner. 

**The background** 

**_The parties_** 

2       The plaintiff is a c ompany inc orporated in Hong Kong and is in the business of providing c ommodities brokerage and struc turing of trade financ e servic es. The two direc tors of the plaintiff are Henri Adriaan Hamelers (“Henri”), who is the managing direc tor, and Gregorio Tolentino Ang Jr. 

3       Blue-Sea was a c ompany inc orporated in Singapore and was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Sea Holdings Pte Ltd (“Great Sea”), in whic h the defendant holds more than 99% of the shares. 

**_The first loan to Blue-Sea_** 

4       During the worldwide financ ial c risis of 2008, banks were reluc tant to give loans and many c ompanies were financ ially tight. The plaintiff was approac hed for loans by some c ompanies through friends and assoc iates. The plaintiff gave loans in very exc eptional c ases, whic h loans were extended to not more than four c ompanies sinc e the plaintiff’s inc orporation on 6 June 2006. 

5       Govender Dayanandan (“Daya”) and Tan Yong Hong (“Eric ”) were the business assoc iates of Henri. The defendant was introduc ed to Daya by his friend C Chandrasegar (“Chandra”), who is an advoc ate and solic itor, and a fellow direc tor of Great Sea with the defendant. 

6       The defendant informed Daya and Eric that BlueSea required a loan of US$348,000 as BlueSea was having c ash flow problems in paying staff’s salaries, Central Provident Fund c ontributions and 


other expenses. This was followed by a meeting between the defendant and Henri sometime in August 

2009\. Henri then disc ussed the matter with Daya and Eric. 

7       Prior to giving any loan to BlueSea, it was dec ided that Daya and Eric would go to BlueSea’s offic e to perform a due diligenc e c hec k and a c redit appraisal of BlueSea and the Great Sea group of c ompanies to asc ertain their c ommerc ial viability and their loan servic eability if a loan were to be granted to BlueSea. The financ ial statements and ac c ounts showed that BlueSea had an impressive sales revenue rec ord for 2006, 2007 and 2008, and it was the main operating c ompany of the Great Sea group of c ompanies. The due diligenc e c hec k was mostly done by Daya and Eric. As both Daya and Eric were retired bankers with experienc e in this field, Henri trusted their judgment. Daya and Eric met up with Henri to go through the financ ial doc uments, and it was agreed that the plaintiff would give a loan of US$348,000 to Blue-Sea (“the first Loan”). 

8       To ensure that any loans c omplied with the legal requirements in Singapore, the plaintiff engaged Ms Bhargavan Sujatha (“Sujatha”) as their lawyer, and Sujatha c onduc ted all the required legal searc hes (suc h as the c ompanies winding-up searc h and the profile searc h) and prepared the legal doc uments for the loan. 

9       On 27 August 2009, the plaintiff passed a direc tors’ resolution to grant BlueSea a loan of US$348,000. The plaintiff’s solic itors then prepared the following doc uments (c ollec tively “the first Loan Doc uments”) for the first loan: 

 (a) the Loan Agreement (“the first Loan Agreement”), whic h stipulated the terms and c onditions of the loan; 

 (b) the Subordination Agreement (“the first Subordination Agreement”), whic h stipulated that the defendant agreed that BlueSea would repay the plaintiff’s loan before repaying the defendant any monies owed to him by Blue-Sea; and 

 (c ) the deed of guarantee and indemnity (“the first Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity”), whic h required a personal guarantee from the defendant for the loan given to Blue-Sea. 

10     On 27 August 2009, Henri signed the first Loan Doc uments, witnessed by Daya, and the defendant signed the same, witnessed by Chandra. On 1 September 2009, the loan of US$348, was transferred by the plaintiff into BlueSea’s bank ac c ount in Singapore. On 1 Oc tober 2009, BlueSea made the first monthly payment of interest and management fee amounting to US$6,033.91. Thereafter, Blue-Sea made regular monthly payments of the interest and management fee. 

**_The second loan to Blue-Sea_** 

11     In early January 2010, about four months after the first Loan was given, the defendant requested Daya to assist him in getting another loan for BlueSea for the amount of US$358,000 (“the sec ond Loan”). The defendant told Daya that the reason for the sec ond Loan was that BlueSea was again unable to meet its expenses. As the financ ial statements of BlueSea and its related c ompanies had just been c hec ked four months earlier, and bec ause Blue-Sea was regular in its monthly payments under the first Loan, Daya rec ommended that the sec ond Loan be given to BlueSea; Henri agreed. Sujatha was similarly engaged by the plaintiff to c onduc t the relevant legal searc hes. She then prepared the legal doc uments, whic h were identic al to the doc uments for the first Loan. (Hereinafter the doc uments will be referred to as the sec ond Loan Agreement, the sec ond Subordination Agreement, and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity.) 


12     On 29 January 2010, BlueSea’s board of direc tors passed a direc tors’ resolution ac c epting the sec ond Loan of US$358,000 from the plaintiff on the terms and c onditions set out in the sec ond Loan Agreement. The direc tors’ resolution was signed by the defendant himself. On the same day, the defendant also signed the sec ond Loan Agreement, the sec ond Subordination Agreement, and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity, witnessed by the defendant’s fellow direc tor, Chandra. On the same day too, Henri signed the same doc uments, witnessed by Daya. The sec ond Loan amount of US$358,000 was then remitted to BlueSea’s bank ac c ount by the plaintiff. From Marc h 2010 onwards, BlueSea regularly paid the monthly interest and management fees for both the first and the sec ond Loans. 

13     Clause 1 of the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity is the main operative c lause and it provides for the defendant’s obligation to pay the plaintiff any sums of monies that remained unpaid by BlueSea, interest at a rate of 7% per annum, and legal c osts inc urred in the enforc ement of the guarantee on an indemnity basis: 

 The Guarantor will pay to the Lender on demand all sums of monies or liabilities whic h are now or shall hereafter from time to time be due or owing or shall remain unpaid to the Lender or be inc urred from or by the Customer anywhere whether as princ ipal or as surety and whether solely or jointly with any other person or persons (in partnership or otherwise) on any ac c ount or ac c ounts or otherwise inc luding the ultimate balanc e whic h at the date of suc h demand shall be due or owing or remain unpaid to the Lender by the Customer under the Fac ility or in respec t of any monies for whic h the Customer may be liable to the Lender as surety whether solely or jointly with any person or persons (in partnership or otherwise) or in any other way whatsoever whether suc h liabilities to the Lender thereon at the date of suc h demand be c ertain or c ontingent and not as yet due and payable TOGETHER WITH in all the c ases aforesaid interest at a rate of 7% per annum c ommission disc ount and other c harges and together with all legal and other c osts (inc luding legal c osts on an indemnity basis) c harges and expenses whic h the Lender may inc ur in enforc ing or seeking to enforc e any sec urity for or obtaining or seeking to obtain payment of all or any part of the monies and liabilities hereby guaranteed on a full indemnity basis. All amounts payable by the Guarantor hereunder (whether on ac c ount of princ ipal interest or otherwise) shall be paid in full free of set-off or c ounterc laim. 

**_Events after the giving of both loans_** 

14     Sometime between 29 July 2010 and 20 Oc tober 2010, the defendant made arrangements to sell BlueSea and remove himself as a direc tor. By 20 Oc tober 2010, BlueSea was owned by Holc roft Financ e Corporation, and two new direc tors had replac ed the defendant as a direc tor of BlueSea. The defendant also plac ed Blue-Sea under provisional liquidation by Oc tober 2010. 

15     On 26 Oc tober 2010, Henri sent two letters of demand to BlueSea, and another two letters of demand to the defendant for repayment of the first Loan and the sec ond Loan. On the same day, the defendant sent two letters of undertaking to the plaintiff, undertaking to fulfil his obligations under the first and sec ond Deeds of Guarantee and Indemnity, as the guarantor of the first Loan (“the first Letter of Undertaking”) by making payment by 15 Dec ember 2010, and of the sec ond Loan (“the sec ond Letter of Undertaking”) by making payment by 1 February 2011. 

16     On 16 Dec ember 2010, the first Loan, inc luding the interest and management fees thereunder, was c ompletely repaid by the defendant as guarantor of the loan. The defendant paid the monthly interest and management fee for the sec ond Loan from Marc h 2010 until 3 February 2011. However, the sec ond Loan remained outstanding and was due on 1 February 2011. 


17     On 9 November 2010, the plaintiff rec eived a letter dated 4 November 2010 from BlueSea’s liquidator, Elango Subramaniam (“Elango”), asking the plaintiff to file a proof of debt by 8 November 

2010\. As the plaintiff did not have suffic ient time to do so, and the plaintiff was looking to the defendant to repay the first and sec ond Loans as the guarantor, the plaintiff did not follow up with Elango. 

18     Pursuant to the sec ond Letter of Undertaking, the defendant was to repay the sec ond Loan as the guarantor by 1 February 2011. However, the defendant failed to do so despite a demand from the plaintiff. On 14 February 2011, the defendant e-mailed Eric to request that he be allowed to pay the sec ond Loan in instalments spread over three months. The plaintiff ac c eded to the request and the defendant agreed to an inc rease in the interest rate to 2% per month, and to pay a restruc turing fee of US$3,580 and legal fees of US$1,000. It was also agreed that the plaintiff would send the defendant a new letter of undertaking (“the third Letter of Undertaking”) for the sec ond Loan, and the defendant would affirm his liabilities and undertake to fulfil his obligation under the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity, and the additional payments in c onsideration of the instalment arrangement. 

19     However, the defendant did not return a signed c opy of the third Letter of Undertaking whic h Eric e-mailed to him on 2 Marc h 2011. 

**_The plaintiff’s claim_** 

20     The plaintiff alleged that BlueSea had breac hed the sec ond Loan Agreement and that events of default had oc c urred, whic h were partic ularised as follows: 

 (a) there were numerous legal proc eedings instituted against BlueSea in the Singapore c ourts of whic h Blue-Sea failed to inform the plaintiff; 

 (b) by Oc tober 2010, the ownership of BlueSea had been transferred from Great Sea to Holc roft Financ e Corporation, but BlueSea failed to notify the plaintiff of the c hange of ownership; 

 (c ) between July 2010 and Oc tober 2010, the defendant removed himself as a direc tor of BlueSea and was replac ed by Roslan Bin Amri and Radhakrishna Sambath Kumar – BlueSea failed to notify the plaintiff of this c hange of direc torship; 

 (d) sometime in Oc tober 2010, BlueSea bec ame insolvent and winding-up proc eedings were c ommenc ed with a liquidator appointed – BlueSea failed to notify the plaintiff of these proc eedings; and 

 (e) Blue-Sea had disposed of all its assets substantially. 

21     Pursuant to the terms of the sec ond Loan Agreement and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity, the default by BlueSea, and the plaintiff’s notic e of demand sent in Oc tober 2010, the sum of US$358,000 and interest at the rate of 7% per annum bec ame due and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff. 

22     Further, the defendant had breac hed the sec ond Letter of Undertaking in whic h the defendant affirmed his liability under the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity and undertook to fulfil his obligation to pay the plaintiff the loan amount of US$358,000 as guarantor by 1 February 2011. 

**The defendant’s case** 


**The defendant’s case** 

23     The defendant argued that the sec ond Loan Agreement and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity were unenforc eable pursuant to: 

 (a) ss 5 and 14(2) of the Moneylenders Ac t 2008 (Ac t 31 of 2008) (“the Moneylenders Ac t 2008”); 

 (b) ss 5 and 21(1)( a ) of the Business Registration Ac t (Cap 32, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the Business Registration Ac t”); and/or 

 (c ) the Hong Kong Money Lenders Ordinanc e (Cap 163) (“the Hong Kong Money Lenders Ordinanc e”). 

24     First, the defendant argued that the plaintiff was in the business of moneylending and was prohibited from suc h a business by s 5 of the Moneylenders Ac t 2008. The plaintiff did not fall within the exc eption of an “exc luded moneylender” as provided by ss 2 and 5(1)( _b_ ) of the Moneylenders Ac t 2008 bec ause the defendant did not lend money solely to c orporations. The c ontention was that the sec ond Loan Agreement was a sham to the extent that it was a personal loan to the defendant disguised as a c orporate loan to BlueSea. Moreover, the “princ ipal debtor c lause” in the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity made the defendant the borrower in the sec ond Loan. Sinc e the defendant was not a c orporate entity but an individual, the plaintiff was not an “exc luded moneylender” under s 2 of the Moneylenders Ac t 2008. 

25     Sec ond, the defendant argued that the plaintiff c onduc ted business in Singapore in the form of the loan transac tions, but failed to register its business as required by s 5(1) of the Business Registration Ac t. Pursuant to s 21(1)( _a_ ) of the Business Registration Ac t, the sec ond Loan Agreement and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity, being c ontrac ts in relation to the business c arried on by the plaintiff, were unenforc eable. 

26     Third, the defendant argued that the Hong Kong Money Lenders Ordinanc e applied to the sec ond Loan Agreement and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity bec ause the loan was disbursed from the plaintiff’s bank ac c ount in Hong Kong, and the loan was to be repaid by BlueSea into the same. Ac c ordingly, the applic ation of the Hong Kong Money Lenders Ordinanc e rendered the sec ond Loan Agreement and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity illegal, and henc e the same were unenforc eable in Singapore as this would be against public polic y. 

27     In addition, the defendant argued that as a matter of public polic y, the sec ond Loan Agreement and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity should not be enforc ed as the plaintiff was trying to c irc umvent the effec ts of the Moneylenders Ac t 2008. 

**The plaintiff’s case** 

28     The plaintiff argued that it was an “exc luded moneylender” under s 2 of the Moneylenders Ac t 2008 bec ause it lent money solely to c orporations, or bec ause it c arried on a business not having for its primary objec t the lending of money. The sec ond Loan was not a sham, as shown by the due diligenc e done on BlueSea, BlueSea’s direc tors’ resolution to ac c ept the loan, and the fac t that the defendant and not someone else stood as the guarantor. Therefore, the prohibition against the business of moneylending under s 5 of the Moneylenders Ac t 2008 did not apply to the plaintiff. 

29     The plaintiff argued that the Hong Kong Money Lenders Ordinanc e did not apply to the plaintiff bec ause the plaintiff was not c arrying on business as a moneylender in Hong Kong. This was shown 


by, _inter alia_ , how the plaintiff had only made isolated loans to four c ompanies, the fac t that all doc umentation for the loan was prepared and exec uted in Singapore, and the fac t that the loans had been disbursed in Singapore. 

**The issues** 

30     The issues before this c ourt are as follows: 

 (a) Was the sec ond Loan Agreement a sham to the extent that it was a personal loan to the defendant disguised as a c orporate loan (“Issue 1”)? 

 (b) Did the “princ ipal debtor c lause” in the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity make the defendant the borrower in the sec ond Loan (“Issue 2”)? 

 (c ) Were the sec ond Loan Agreement and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity unenforc eable pursuant to the Business Registration Ac t (“Issue 3”)? 

 (d) Were the sec ond Loan Agreement and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity unenforc eable pursuant to the Hong Kong Money Lenders Ordinanc e (“Issue 4”)? 

**The decision** 

**_Issue 1: Was the second Loan Agreement a sham to the extent that it was a personal loan to the defendant disguised as a corporate loan?_** 

_The applicable law_ 

31     Sinc e the sec ond Loan Agreement was made on 29 January 2010, the applic able statute was the Moneylenders Ac t 2008, whic h c ame into operation on 1 Marc h 2009. The Moneylenders Ac t 2008 repealed and re-enac ted the Moneylenders Ac t (Cap 188, 1985 Rev Ed), and introduc ed the c onc ept of an “exc luded moneylender”. An “exc luded moneylender” was not c aught by the prohibition in s 5 of the Moneylenders Ac t 2008 against c arrying on the business of moneylending without a lic enc e in Singapore. Sec tion 2 of that Ac t defined “exc luded moneylender” to inc lude any person who lent money solely to c orporations, or who c arried on any business not having for its primary objec t the lending of money in the c ourse of whic h and for the purposes whereof he lent money: 

 Interpretation 

**2.** In this Ac t, unless the c ontext otherwise requires — 

 ... 

 “exc luded moneylender” means — 

 ( a ) any body c orporate, inc orporated or empowered by an Ac t of Parliament to lend money in ac c ordanc e with that Ac t; 

 ( b ) any person lic ensed, approved, registered or otherwise regulated by the Authority under any other written law, to the extent that suc h person is permitted or authorised to lend money or is not prohibited from lending money under that other written law;( c ) any soc iety registered as a c redit soc iety under the Co-operative Soc ieties Ac t (Cap. 62); 


 ( d ) any pawnbroker lic ensed under the Pawnbrokers Ac t (Cap. 222); 

 ( e ) any person who — 

 (i) lends money solely to his employees as a benefit of employment; 

 (ii) lends money solely to ac c redited investors within the meaning of sec tion 4A of the Sec urities and Futures Ac t (Cap. 289); 

 (iii) lends money solely to — 

 (A) c orporations; 

 (B) limited liability partnerships; 

 (C) trustees or trustee-managers, as the c ase may be, of business trusts for the purposes of the business trusts; 

 (D) trustees of real estate investment trusts for the purposes of the real estate investment trusts, 

 or who c arries on any c ombination of suc h ac tivities or servic es; or 

 ( f ) any person c arrying on any business not having for its primary objec t the lending of money in the c ourse of whic h and for the purposes whereof he lends money; 

 ... 

32     This definition of an “exc luded moneylender” remains unc hanged in the latest revised edition of the Moneylenders Ac t (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed). 

33     A doc ument is a sham if all the parties thereto have a c ommon intention that the doc ument was not to c reate the legal rights and obligations whic h it gives the appearanc e of c reating: _Snook v London and West Riding Investments Ltd_ [1967] 2 QB 786 at 802; _Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter and others (Tung Yu-Lien Margaret and others, third parties)_ <span class="citation">[2010] SGHC 163</span> at [112]. In other words, a sham transac tion is one whic h is good in form but false in fac t: _TKM (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Export Credit Insurance Corp of Singapore Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR(R) 858</span> at [41]. 

34     The person alleging that a doc ument is a sham has the burden of proving that the parties intended the doc ument to be a pretenc e, and there is a very strong presumption that the parties intended to be bound by the provisions of the agreements whic h they entered into: _Chng Bee Kheng and another (executrixes and trustees of the estate of Fock Poh Kum, deceased) v Chng Eng Chye_ <span class="citation">[2013] 2 SLR 715</span> at [51]; _National Westminster Bank plc v Jones and others_ [2001] 1 BCLC 98 at [59]. 

_The present facts_ 

35     The doc umentary evidenc e shows that the sec ond Loan was a c orporate loan extended by the plaintiff to BlueSea. The sec ond Loan Agreement expressly stated that the plaintiff was the lender of the sum of US$358,000, while BlueSea was the borrower. The sec ond Loan was ac c epted by BlueSea following a direc tors’ resolution passed on 29 January 2010. The fac t that a due diligenc e c hec k and a c redit appraisal of BlueSea and the Great Sea group of c ompanies were c onduc ted showed 


that the borrower was indeed Blue-Sea, not the defendant. 

36     The defendant argued that the following fac ts showed that the sec ond Loan Agreement was a sham: 

 (a) The plaintiff did not file a proof of debt against Blue-Sea pursuant to the winding-up rules. 

 (b) The plaintiff’s “stric t c redit appraisal” was a sham. 

 (c ) The sec ond Loan Agreement was signed on 29 January 2010 and the money was remitted by 4 February 2010, before the plaintiff rec eived Sujatha’s letter dated 8 February 2010 c onfirming that the due diligenc e searc hes (whic h c omprised the winding-up searc h, the judic ial management searc h and the bankruptc y searc h, and the c omposite litigation searc h) on BlueSea had been done. 

 (d) The “management fee” in the sec ond Loan Agreement was disguised interest. 

(1) Proof of debt 

37     At the outset, it should be noted that the plaintiff barely had suffic ient time to file a proof of debt. Elango sent a letter dated 4 November 2010 to the plaintiff’s address in Hong Kong requesting the plaintiff to file a proof of debt by 8 November 2010 and to attend a c reditor’s meeting on 10 November 2010. However, Henri only rec eived the letter on 9 November 2010. 

38     Although the plaintiff c ould have filed a proof of debt after the deadline, I find that the plaintiff was entitled to pursue the defendant as guarantor of the loan without having to exhaust the option of pursuing BlueSea. I ac c ept the plaintiff’s explanation that it did not want to inc ur legal expenses by proc eeding against BlueSea as the latter was under liquidation. Pursuing the defendant as guarantor would understandably be more expedient and useful as the defendant had already agreed to pay the sec ond Loan amount by 1 February 2011 under the sec ond Letter of Undertaking. 

(2) Credit appraisal 

39     The plaintiff entrusted Daya and Eric with the task of asc ertaining BlueSea’s c ommerc ial viability and loan servic eability. It was revealed that Daya and Eric ’s c redit appraisal of BlueSea for the first Loan was not c onduc ted ac c ording to the stric test standards. The first Loan Agreement was signed on 27 August 2009, but the financ ial statements whic h they looked at were for the years 2006 and 2007. Even though the revenue of BlueSea was S$15m for the year 2008, Daya and Eric seemed to have plac ed too muc h weight on this fac tor in determining BlueSea’s c redit standing as revenue alone c ould not have been determinative of the c ompany’s financ ial status. Nevertheless, I find that Daya was entitled to c onsider the future growth potential of the Great Sea group of c ompanies, even though Blue-Sea was a separate legal entity from the other c ompanies in the Great Sea group. 

40     Even though the plaintiff c onc eded that the c redit c hec ks c ould have been done in a more rigorous manner, this does not detrac t from the fac t that there was a genuine effort to do c redit appraisal. Moreover, Eric was ready to vouc h for BlueSea’s c redit standing for the first Loan. The plaintiff may well have misplac ed its trust in Daya and Eric in asking them to c onduc t a stric t c redit appraisal of BlueSea, but the plaintiff was reasonably entitled to rely on Daya and Eric , given that they were retired bankers with a wealth of financ ial experienc e. Even though there was no c redit appraisal done for the sec ond Loan, it should be noted that a c redit appraisal of BlueSea and the Great Sea group of c ompanies had already been c onduc ted by Eric and Daya four months prior to the 


disbursement of the sec ond Loan amount, and BlueSea had a good trac k rec ord of performing its obligations under the first Loan Agreement. In suc h c irc umstanc es, it would not be unreasonable for the plaintiff to grant the sec ond Loan without another c redit appraisal. The absenc e of a stric t c redit appraisal of BlueSea for the sec ond Loan may also be explained by the fac t that Daya had a personal interest in rec ommending that the loan be given to Blue Sea by the plaintiff. Daya admitted that he was entitled to US$14,520 from BlueSea under a fee agreement dated 29 January 2010 between him and BlueSea for arranging the loan. Although this c onflic t of interest is unfortunate and may have c ompromised the rigour of Daya’s c redit appraisal of Blue-Sea, the plaintiff later c onsented to it. 

(3) Due diligenc e searc hes 

41     Clause 3 of the sec ond Loan Agreement provided that the obligation of the plaintiff to disburse the loan was subjec t to the plaintiff being satisfied that there were no legal or winding-up proc eedings against Blue-Sea and the defendant: 

**3. CONDITION PRECEDENT** 

 The availability of the Fac ility of the Borrower and the obligation of the Lender to advanc e and/or disburse any part of the Fac ility or allow any drawdown shall be subjec t to the following c onditions prec edent:

 ... 

 (iii) the Lender shall be satisfied that:

 (a) there is no legal proc eeding suit or ac tion of any kind whatsoever (whether c riminal or c ivil) instituted or being instituted or threatened against the Borrower or the Guarantor; and 

 (b) there is no winding-up notic e/petition/proc eeding against the Borrower or any bankruptc y notic e/petition/proc eeding against the Guarantor. 

42     Therefore, the fac t that the searc hes done by Sujatha were only c ompleted by 5 February 2010, after the sec ond Loan Agreement was signed, was ac c eptable as the plaintiff c ould still c hoose not to disburse the loan amount if there were any adverse results from the searc hes. 

43     While it does seem odd that the loan amount was disbursed before the searc hes were done, this has to be seen in the larger c ontext of the entire c irc umstanc es. Similar to the c redit appraisal of BlueSea, a due diligenc e c hec k of BlueSea and the Great Sea group of c ompanies had already been c onduc ted by Eric and Daya four months prior to the disbursement of the sec ond Loan amount, asc ertaining BlueSea’s c ommerc ial viability and loan servic eability. Moreover, BlueSea had a good trac k rec ord of performing its obligations under the first Loan Agreement, and the sec ond Loan Agreement c ontained essentially the same terms and c onditions as the first Loan Agreement. In the c irc umstanc es, I find that it was not entirely unreasonable for the plaintiff to have disbursed the sec ond Loan amount before the due diligenc e searc hes were done. Even though this reflec ted a lapse on the part of the plaintiff, I do not find that it is suffic ient to show that the sec ond Loan Agreement was a sham to disguise a personal loan to the defendant. 

44     I find Henri’s ac tions following the loan to be c onsistent with the position that the sec ond Loan made to BlueSea was not a sham. On 15 Oc tober 2010, the defendant told Daya that he was going to put BlueSea under provisional liquidation bec ause his engineers had made wrong projec tion 


c alc ulations and that BlueSea was very muc h in debt. The defendant then asked Daya to request the plaintiff to “transfer” the sec ond Loan from BlueSea to another related c ompany, BlueSea Ventures Pte Ltd, _ie_ , to c hange the borrower from BlueSea to BlueSea Ventures Pte Ltd, even though the loan amount had been disbursed to BlueSea earlier. After Daya had informed the plaintiff of the defendant’s request and despite the defendant’s indic ation that the plaintiff might not be able to rec over its loan to BlueSea, Henri dec lined the request as he c onsidered that it would be “legally unac c eptable to shift loans from one c ompany to another on the basis of doc uments without any real transfer of the underlying loans”. In my view, this supports the plaintiff’s position that the plaintiff intended the sec ond Loan Agreement to c reate the legal rights and obligations whic h it gave the appearanc e of c reating. 

(4) Management fee 

45     The defendant argued that the “management fee” in the sec ond Loan Agreement was disguised interest and henc e an untruth, and that in itself tainted the legality of the sec ond Loan Agreement and rendered the agreement a sham. I disagree. Even if the “management fee” was effec tively disguised interest whic h the plaintiff c harged the defendant, that did not show a c ommon intention that the sec ond Loan Agreement was a sham suc h that the loan was in fac t a personal loan given to the defendant while giving the false appearanc e that it was a c orporate loan to BlueSea. In other words, any alleged disguised interest was not relevant to the issue of whether the loan was made to Blue-Sea or to the defendant. 

46     Therefore, c onsidering the totality of the fac ts, I am not persuaded that the sec ond Loan Agreement was a sham to the extent that it was a personal loan to the defendant disguised as a c orporate loan. In the c irc umstanc es, even if the plaintiff was in the business of moneylending (whic h I find it was not at [55], [72]–[78] below), I am of the view that the plaintiff was an “exc luded moneylender” under s 2 of the Moneylenders Ac t 2008. Ac c ordingly, the sec ond Loan Agreement and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity are not unenforc eable pursuant to the Moneylenders Ac t 2008. Given my findings, it follows that the sec ond Loan is legitimate and the plaintiff was not attempting to c irc umvent the Moneylenders Ac t 2008. 

**_Issue 2: Did the “principal debtor clause” in the second Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity make the defendant the borrower in the second Loan?_** 

47     The defendant argued that the “princ ipal debtor c lause” in the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity made the defendant the borrower in the sec ond Loan. Sinc e the defendant was not a c orporate entity but an individual, the plaintiff was not an “exc luded moneylender” under s 2 of the Moneylenders Ac t 2008. The “princ ipal debtor c lause” is found in c l 9 of the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity: 

9\. As a separate and independent obligation the Guarantor agrees that the Guarantor shall be liable to the Lender at all times as princ ipal debtor and in addition any monies mentioned in paragraph 1 above whic h may not be rec overable on the footing of a guarantee, whether by reason of any legal limitation disability or inc apac ity or lac k of any borrowing powers of or by the     Customer or lac k of authority of any manager offic er direc tor or agent of the Customer or otherwise shall be rec overable from the Guarantor as sole or princ ipal debtor in respec t of it and the Guarantor undertakes to pay all suc h monies to the Lender on demand. 

48     I rejec t the defendant’s argument. It is one thing to say that the defendant was liable to pay the sums owed to the plaintiff as the princ ipal debtor, and quite another to say that the defendant was the borrower and that the sec ond Loan was made to the defendant. In the former, the guarantor 


merely ac c epted the obligation to pay the sums owed to the lender without the guarantor rec eiving the loan amount, while in the latter, it would be the borrower who ac tually rec eived the loan amount. These two sc enarios must be distinguished in analysing the real relationship between the parties. 

49     In the present c ase, the loan amount of US$358,000 was disbursed to BlueSea’s bank ac c ount, not to the defendant’s. While the ac c ount book of BlueSea rec orded the deposit of the loan amount as c oming from the defendant, that was the result of the defendant’s own instruc tions to his ac c ounting staff, and there is no doubt that the monies c ame from the plaintiff’s direc t transfer into BlueSea’s ac c ount. The defendant then admitted to withdrawing the loan amount and applying the loan amount to his other c ompanies. However, I am not persuaded that this was done with the knowledge of the plaintiff. It should be reiterated that BlueSea was expressly stated to be the borrower in the sec ond Loan Agreement, and I did not find that the sec ond Loan Agreement was a sham (see above at [46]). Therefore, the loan was not made to the defendant, and the fac t that the defendant agreed to be the princ ipal debtor did not make the defendant the borrower of the loan. Consequently, even if the plaintiff was in the business of moneylending (whic h I find it was not at [55], [72]–[78] below), the plaintiff was an “exc luded moneylender” under s 2 of the Moneylenders Ac t 2008. Ac c ordingly, the sec ond Loan Agreement and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity are not unenforc eable pursuant to the Moneylenders Ac t 2008. 

**_Issue 3: Were the second Loan Agreement and the second Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity unenforceable pursuant to the Business Registration Act?_** 

50     Sec tion 5(1) of the Business Registration Ac t requires a business to be registered before it is c arried out in Singapore: 

 Application for registration 

**5.** —(1) Subjec t to the provisions of this Ac t, every person shall, before c arrying on business in     Singapore, make an applic ation to the Registrar in the presc ribed manner for registration under this Ac t. 

 (2) Notwithstanding this sec tion, only one applic ation for registration is required to be made where the same person or persons c arry on business under the same business name. 

51     The c onsequenc e of failing to register is found in s 21(1) of the Business Registration Ac t, whic h states that where a person c arries on business without being registered, the defaulter’s rights under a c ontrac t in relation to the business c arried on by the defaulter shall not be enforc eable: 

 Disability of persons in default 

**21.** —(1) Where a person required to be registered under this Ac t — 

 ( a ) c arries on business without being registered under this Ac t to do so; or 

 ( b ) fails to furnish any information required under sec tion 14, 

 then the rights of the defaulter under or arising out of any c ontrac t, in relation to the business c arried on by the defaulter in respec t of whic h there is no valid registration or there is nonc omplianc e with sec tion 14, made or entered into by or on behalf of the defaulter at any time while he is in default shall, subjec t to subsec tion (3), not be enforc eable by ac tion or other legal proc eedings either in the business name or otherwise. 


## ... 

52     The term “business” is defined in s 2 of the Business Registration Ac t: 

 2.—(1) In this Ac t, unless the c ontext otherwise requires — 

 ... 

 “business” inc ludes every form of trade, c ommerc e, c raftsmanship, c alling, profession and any ac tivity c arried on for the purposes of gain but does not inc lude any offic e, employment or oc c upation, or any of the businesses spec ified in the First Sc hedule; 

 ... 

53     In the present c ase, the plaintiff was in the business of providing servic es relating to c ommodities brokerage and the struc turing of trade financ e. Henri explained the plaintiff’s business as suc h during c ross-examination: 

 Court: What does your c ompany do, Mr Hamelers? 

 Witness: The c ompany is in, erm, c ommodities brokerage, er, Your Honour. That is mainly finding, er, business opportunities for outside parties, putting it together with financ ial institutions, et c etera, where after they negotiate on their own and, er, Belfield would then earn a c ommission of any transac tion that’s been done. 

54     Even with Henri’s explanation, it is still not quite c lear how the plaintiff’s business was c onduc ted. But quite apart from the issue of whether the plaintiff did c arry on the business of providing c ommodities brokerage and struc turing of trade financ e servic es in Singapore, the relevant question to be answered is whether the giving of the loans by the plaintiff falls within the definition of “business” in s 2 of the Business Registration Ac t. Spec ific ally, the question to be answered is whether the giving of loans by the plaintiff is an “ac tivity c arried on for the purposes of gain”. It should be noted that an “ac tivity c arried on for the purposes of gain” is very wide and the literal applic ation of this c atc h-all definition of business will potentially lead to a rather absurd situation where every ac t done for the purpose of gain would be c aught. Therefore, I find that the _ejusdem generis_ c anon of c onstruc tion should apply suc h that the meaning of the words “ac tivity c arried on for the purposes of gain” should be limited to those ac tivities in the same c lass as a “trade, c ommerc e, c raftsmanship, c alling, profession”. In _Bennion on Statutory Interpretation_ (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2008) at p 1231, the _ejusdem generis_ princ iple is desc ribed in the following terms: 

 The Latin words ejusdem generis (of the same kind or nature), have been attac hed to a princ iple of c onstruc tion whereby wide words assoc iated in the text with more limited words are taken to be restric ted by implic ation to matters of the same limited c harac ter. The princ iple may apply whatever the form of the assoc iation, but the most usual form is a list or string of genusdesc ribing terms followed by wider residuary or sweeping-up words. 

 ... 

 The ejusdem generis princ iple arises from the linguistic implic ation by whic h words having literally a wide meaning (when taken in isolation) are treated as reduc ed in sc ope by the verbal c ontext. It may be regarded as an instanc e of ellipsis, or relianc e on implic ation. The princ iple is presumed to apply unless there is some c ontrary indic ation. 


55     I note that the prec eding words of “trade, c ommerc e, c raftsmanship, c alling, profession” involve a nec essary degree of system, repetition and c ontinuity, whic h are the features of the c onc ept of a “business” laid down in the c ommon law (see below at [69]); see also _Agus Anwar v Orion Oil Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2010] SGHC 6</span> at [7]–[9]. The genus of the type of ac tivity enc ompassed by the phrase “ac tivity c arried on for the purposes of gain” should therefore be c onfined to an ac tivity whic h is not only c arried on for the purpose of gain, but whic h has a suffic ient degree of system, repetition and c ontinuity. As disc ussed below at [69]–[77], I find that the giving of loans by the plaintiff did not have a suffic ient degree of system, repetition and c ontinuity as would give rise to a business. 

56     Ac c ordingly, sinc e the giving of loans by the plaintiff did not c onstitute a business, and the sec ond Loan Agreement and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity were not related to the plaintiff’s business of c ommodities brokerage and struc turing of trade financ e servic es, I find that the disability provided in s 21 of the Business Registration Ac t does not apply. The right of the plaintiff to c laim from the defendant does not arise from a c ontrac t “in relation to the business c arried on by the [plaintiff ] in respec t of whic h there is no valid registration”. Therefore, the sec ond Loan Agreement and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity are not unenforc eable pursuant to the Business Registration Ac t. 

57     In any c ase, it should be noted that ss 21(2) to 21(4) of the Business Registration Ac t provide that the c ourt may grant the defaulter relief against the disability imposed by s 21(1): 

 (2) A defaulter referred to in subsec tion (1) may apply to the c ourt for relief against the disability imposed by this sec tion. 

 (3) The c ourt, on being satisfied that the default was ac c idental or due to inadvertenc e or some other suffic ient c ause, or that on other grounds it is just and equitable to grant relief, may grant suc h relief either generally, or as respec ts any partic ular c ontrac t, on c ondition that the c osts of the applic ation are paid by the defaulter, unless the c ourt otherwise orders, and on suc h other c onditions (if any) as the c ourt may impose. 

 (4) Relief under subsec tion (3) shall not be granted exc ept on suc h servic e and public ation of notic e of the applic ation as the c ourt may order, nor shall relief be given in respec t of any c ontrac t if any party to the c ontrac t proves to the satisfac tion of the c ourt that, if the provisions of this Ac t had been c omplied with, he would not have entered into the c ontrac t. 

58     I refer to _Federal Lands Commissioner v Benfort Enterprise and another and other actions_ <span class="citation">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 895</span> at [13]–[14], whic h expounded the purpose of the disability under s 17(1) of the Business Registration Ac t (Cap 32, 1985 Rev Ed), whic h was then the equivalent of the c urrent s 21(1) of the Business Registration Ac t: 

 13 The nub of the plaintiffs’ applic ation was what is the misc hief that the Ac t seeks to prevent? It is that those who do business in Singapore disc lose their partic ulars by registering with the Registrar so as not to mislead those whom they do business with as to their real identity. If they do not do so, the c ourt is given the widest possible powers of granting relief to persons in default. It provides that the c ourt on being satisfied that the default was ac c idental, or due to inadvertenc e, or some other suffic ient c ause, or that “on other grounds it is just and equitable to grant relief” may grant suc h relief. As Lush J said in Weller v Denton [1921] 3 KB 103 at 109 in the c ourse of his judgment on a similar provision in the English Registration of Business Names Ac t 1916 (on whic h the Ac t is substantially based): 

 The reason why this wide power of granting relief should be given to the c ourt c an well be 


 understood. Where the defendant has not been misled, and knew the members of the firm or other persons with whom he was dealing, it might be most unjust and inequitable to hold that the plaintiff’s ac tion should not be maintainable merely bec ause he did not know that he ought to have been registered under the Ac t. 

 14 I take the same view. ... 

59     In the present c ase, there is no evidenc e that the defendant or BlueSea did not know who they were dealing with in the plaintiff or that they were misled. There is also no evidenc e that the plaintiff’s omission to register their business with the Registrar of Businesses was deliberate and that the defendant or BlueSea had been misled as a result. Ac c ordingly, I find that it would be just and equitable to grant the plaintiff relief against the disability imposed by s 21(1) of the Business Registration Ac t, if the giving of the sec ond Loan is to be found to be part of a business. 

**_Issue 4: Were the second Loan Agreement and the second Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity unenforceable pursuant to the Hong Kong Money Lenders Ordinance?_** 

_The applicable law_ 

60     It was not disputed that the proper law of the sec ond Loan Agreement and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity is Singapore law, as expressly agreed by the relevant parties in the sec ond Loan Agreement and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity. 

61     It should be noted that the c ontravention of a foreign law, Hong Kong law in this c ase, is only relevant if referenc e is made to suc h a foreign law by a c hoic e of law rule, a forum mandatory rule, or the fundamental public polic y of the forum (Singapore in this c ase): _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2013 Reissue) at para 75.359. 

62     The defendant has so identified a fundamental public polic y of Singapore, whic h is the princ iple of public polic y formulated in the c ase of _Foster v Driscoll_ [1929] 1 KB 470 (“the princ iple in _Foster v Driscoll_ ”). In _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2013 Reissue), Prof Yeo Tiong Min suc c inc tly summarised the princ iple in _Foster v Driscoll_ at para 75.365: 

 If the c ontrac ting parties in entering into the c ontrac t had at the outset a c ommon intention to use the c ontrac t [to] c ommit an ac t in a friendly foreign c ountry whic h is illegal by the law of that c ountry, then the c ontrac t will not be enforc eable as being c ontrary to the fundamental public polic y of the forum. 

63     The princ iple in _Foster v Driscoll_ has been explained by the Court of Appeal in _Peh Teck Quee v Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale_ <span class="citation">[1999] 3 SLR(R) 842</span> at [45]–[47]: 

 45 The appellant also raised a related argument based on a princ iple of public polic y formulated in the c ase of Foster v Driscoll [[1929] 1 KB 470]. This princ iple states that the c ourts will treat a c ontrac t governed by its own law as void where the parties’ intention and objec t c ontemplated thereby jeopardises relations between its government and another friendly government. The c ase c onc erned a c ontrac t, governed by English law, for the supply and sale of whisky that was to be smuggled into the United States of Americ a in c ontravention of the prohibition laws in forc e at the time. The ac tions were brought in relation to various disputes arising out of the c ontrac t. The Court of Appeal c ategoric ally stated that the c ourts would not enforc e suc h a c ontrac t “made between the parties to further an adventure or break the laws of a foreign state”. Sankey LJ added: 


 ... an English c ontrac t should and will be held invalid on ac c ount of illegality if the real objec t and intention of the parties nec essitates them joining in an endeavour to perform in a foreign and friendly c ountry some ac t whic h is illegal by the law of suc h c ountry notwithstanding the fac t that there may be, in c ertain events, alternative modes or plac es of performing whic h permit the c ontrac t to be performed legally. 

 In other words, an agreement whose objec t to be attained is a breac h of international c omity will be regarded by the c ourts as being against public polic y and void. 

 46 This princ iple was elaborated on in the c ase of Regazzoni v K C Sethia (1944) Ltd [[1958] AC 301] whic h c onc erned a c ontrac t for the sale and delivery of jute bags. The parties to the c ontrac t c ontemplated that these bags should be shipped from India to Genoa for resale to South Afric a. One party eventually repudiated the c ontrac t and the other party brought an ac tion for damages for breac h of c ontrac t. The proper law of the c ontrac t was English law. At the time, there was in forc e a prohibition on the export of goods to South Afric a by the Indian Government. The Law Lords agreed with and applied Foster v Driscoll. Lord Keith said ... at 327: 

 ... to rec ognise the c ontrac t between the appellant and the respondent as an enforc eable c ontrac t would give a just c ause for c omplaint by the Government of India and should be regarded as c ontrary to c onc eptions of international c omity. On grounds of public polic y, therefore, this is a c ontrac t whic h our c ourts ought not to rec ognize. 

 47 In the same c ase, Lord Reid added at 323 that: 

 The real question is one of public polic y in English law: but in c onsidering this question we must have in mind the bac kground of international law and international relationships often referred to as the c omity of nations. This is not a c ase of a c ontrac t being made in good faith but one party thereafter finding that he c annot perform his part of the c ontrac t without c ommitting a breac h of foreign law in the territory of the foreign c ountry. If this c ontrac t is held to be unenforc eable, it should, in my opinion, be bec ause from the beginning the c ontrac t was tainted so that the c ourts of this c ountry will not assist either party to enforc e it. 

 Based on this and the finding that the parties had intended to violate the laws of India, the House of Lords held that the c ontrac t was unenforc eable sinc e an English c ourt would not enforc e a c ontrac t or award damages for its breac h, if its performanc e would involve doing an ac t in a foreign and friendly state whic h would violate the law of that state. This was based on the princ iple of public polic y and the c onsequent desire for international c omity. 

64     Therefore, an analysis of whether the sec ond Loan Agreement and the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity are unenforc eable under the Hong Kong Money Lenders Ordinanc e is nec essary. 

_Application of Hong Kong law_ 

65     The short answer to the defendant’s argument is that the parties did not have a c ommon intention to use the sec ond Loan Agreement to c ommit an ac t in Hong Kong whic h was illegal under the laws there, bec ause the sec ond loan transac tion was not c aught by the Hong Kong Money Lenders Ordinanc e. I elaborate on this below. 

66     It was ac c epted that two c onditions must be satisfied for a partic ular loan transac tion, 


expressly governed by a foreign law, to be c aught by the Hong Kong Money Lenders Ordinanc e, as stated in _Hong Kong Shanghai (Shipping) Ltd v The owners of the ships or vessels “Cavalry” (Panamanian Flag) and others_ [1987] HKLR 287 (“ _Cavalry_ ”) at 296 (approved and applied in _China Merchants Bank v Minvest International Limited and Hu Xiang Dong James_ [2001] HKCU 982): 

 (a) the lender was c arrying on the business as a moneylender in Hong Kong or advertising, announc ing or holding itself out as so c onduc ting itself; and 

 (b) the proper law of the c ontrac t, objec tively assessed, was Hong Kong law. 

67     The issue to be addressed now is whether the plaintiff was c arrying on the business of moneylending in Hong Kong. Sec tion 2(1) of the Hong Kong Money Lenders Ordinanc e defines a “money lender” as: 

 ... every person whose business (whether or not he c arries on any other business) is that of making loans or who advertises or announc es himself or holds himself out in any way as c arrying on that business, but does not inc lude– 

 (a) a person spec ified in Part 1 of Sc hedule 1; or 

 (b) as respec ts a loan spec ified in Part 2 of Sc hedule 1, any person who makes suc h loan ... 

68     The test for determining whether a person was c arrying on the business of moneylending was whether, at the time of the loan, the business of the person was that of making loans, whic h is a question of fac t to be dec ided by referenc e to the fac ts of eac h c ase: _Chow Wun Sing Winston v Yiu Chun Luk_ , unrep, CACV 295/2006, 6 Marc h 2008 (“ _Chow_ ”) at [15]. 

69     The expression “business” c onnotes some degree of system, repetition and c ontinuity: _Edgelow v MacElwee_ [1918] 1 KB 205 (“ _Edgelow_ ”); _R v Cheng Chun-hung_ [1987] HKDCLR 17. As elaborated in _Edgelow_ at 206, a person will generally be found to be c arrying on a moneylending business if he makes loans with the nec essary degree of system, repetition and c ontinuity, and the fac t that a person made oc c asional loans is not enough: 

 ... A man does not bec ome a money-lender by reason of oc c asional loans to relations, friends, or ac quaintanc es, whether interest be c harged or not. Charity and kindliness are not the bases of usury. Nor does a man bec ome a money-lender merely bec ause he may upon one or several isolated oc c asions lend money to a stranger. There must be more than oc c asional and disc onnec ted loans. There must be a business of money-lending, and the word “business” imports the notion of system, repetition, and c ontinuity ... 

70     Generally, a man who c arries on a moneylending business is one who is ready and willing to lend to all and sundry: _Litchfield v Dreyfus_ [1906] 1 KB 584 at 589. 

71     In _Newman v Pyke_ (1908) 25 TLR 127 at 128, the c ourt held that the plaintiff in that c ase was not in the business of moneylending after taking into ac c ount that: (a) there were very few lending transac tions before the loan in question; (b) the loans were mostly to friends and relatives; and (c ) there was no holding out or advertising by the plaintiff. 

72     In the present c ase, I find that the plaintiff was not c arrying on the business of moneylending. The plaintiff was in the business of providing c ommodities brokerage and struc turing of trade financ e servic es. Even though there was proper doc umentation of the loans and guarantees, a c redit

appraisal c hec k done by Daya and Eric , and due diligenc e searc hes done by Sujatha, these should be seen as nec essary and prudent measures, given the large loan amounts of US$348,000 for the first Loan and US$358,000 for the sec ond Loan. Daya and Eric were retired bankers, and they were not on the payroll of the plaintiff but assisted on an informal basis in reviewing BlueSea’s business operations. I ac c ept Daya’s explanation during c ross-examination of the relationship between himself and the plaintiff: 

 So how would you desc ribe your relationship with Belfield International? 

 I was basic ally a financ ial c onsultant. And a financ ial c onsultant, you---you’re c alling it an “agent”. I’m c alling myself a financ ial c on---c onsultant. I mean at the end of the day, there was a relationship between me and Belfield. That was--

 And what is the relationship? 

 Well, whenever we had some sort of, er, business opportunity we felt that was viable, we put it to Belfield. And it was just on a---on a---on a---erm, you know, on a---er, on a informal basis. It wasn’t a---a formal that Harry, er, or Belfield told us “Go and bring me business”, I mean, you know, “Go and get loans for me” of “Get c ommodities for me.” Nothing---there was nothing, absolutely nothing. Erm, so it was on a [ sic ] informal basis that we brought--we thought it was a good opportunity bec ause of the yields being low in US dollars, it was a good opportunity for Belfield to---to take, er, you know, the-the small and medium enterprise lending market was---was a bit basic ally squashed after 2008. So it was an opportunity bec ause the yields were better and, er, muc h better than leaving the money in the bank. And this is why we put this proposal to him. I mean at the end of the day, he had to measure the risk, er, and make---er, make a judgment on it but it c ame with our rec ommendation. 

Ac c ordingly, I do not find that there was a suffic ient degree of system for the loans given by the plaintiff to c onstitute a business in moneylending. 

73     The plaintiff only advanc ed loans to four c ompanies between 2009 and 2010, namely, BlueSea, Nordlinger Automation Pte Ltd, PT Indoasia Cemerlang, and IRA International Pte Ltd. Although I ac c ept that there may have been more than one loan for eac h of the four c ompanies, and there were in fac t two loans given to BlueSea, the defendant has not disc harged its burden of showing that more than one loan was indeed given to eac h of the four c ompanies suc h that the total number of loans exc eeded five. It should be noted that the first Loan given to BlueSea in 2009 was the first of suc h loans to the four c ompanies. Ac c ordingly, I find that there was no suffic ient degree of repetition for the loans given by the plaintiff to c onstitute a business in moneylending. 

74     Moreover, the plaintiff did not seek out the borrowers, and the plaintiff neither advertised nor announc ed nor held itself out in any way as c arrying on a moneylending business. This goes to show that there was no suffic ient degree of c ontinuity for the loans given by the plaintiff to c onstitute a business in moneylending. The plaintiff only made loans to four c ompanies bec ause of requests that were made to the plaintiff for loans by c ash-strapped c ompanies through friends. The requests for loans were prompted by the financ ial c risis of 2008 when c ompanies were finding themselves in a tight liquidity situation as banking fac ilities were withdrawn from them. It was not the c ase of the plaintiff dec iding to give loans to all and sundry when there was no desperate request from c ompanies. It is also evident from the plaintiff’s financ ial statements that the plaintiff did not provide loans to c ompanies from its inc orporation on 6 June 2006 until the financ ial c risis of 2008.

75     The defendant sought to c harac terise the plaintiff as seeking to take advantage of the financ ial c risis of 2008 and the tight liquidity situation to enter the business of moneylending. I do not find that this assertion has been borne out by the fac ts. I ac c ept Henri’s explanation in c ross-examination that the plaintiff did not dec ide to venture into the business of moneylending to take advantage of the tight liquidity situation: 

 So, simply put, if a party who is the borrower, is desperate, then he’ll be more inc lined to ac c ept high interest rates. That’s what you’re saying? 

 Exac tly. The same as in the banking world. 

 Yes. And the---and the opportunity of imposing a high interest rates [ sic ] bec ame espec ially right, given the fac t there’s a global meltdown, and a lot of c ompanies were desperate for liquidity. Correc t? 

 Well, yes. It---it was applic able at that stage, yes. 

 Yes. And this is something that you took into c onsideration after you had spent 4½ years in the trading and c ommodity business before the c ompany dec ided to go into the moneylending business. Correc t? 

 No, the c ompany did not dec ide it wanted a moneylending business after the brokerage business. The c ompany was approac hed for loans, whic h the c ompany did not want to do, but under the c irc umstanc es had no option to do. These were friendly request by people who were really desperate---who were really, er, whic h we understand was short of any sourc e of funds from the banks. They were probably, er, reac hed the limits from the banks they had, so they had no other option but to go into the---the private market. Right. 

76     Further, the fac t that loans were only made to four c ompanies whose owners or direc tors were friends or assoc iates militate against finding suc h allegedly opportunistic behaviour on the part of the plaintiff. In the c ase of the two loans to BlueSea, the defendant was a friend of Henri and Chandra. Chandra was a direc tor in BlueSea and friend of Daya. Daya and the defendant were ac quaintanc es who met at parties and Chandra’s house, and Daya had gone to the defendant’s house for meals and played football with the defendant’s c hildren. It was Chandra who referred the defendant to Daya and requested for assistanc e in the form of a loan to BlueSea or the Great Sea group of c ompanies. Chandra also referred PT Indoasia Cemerlang to the plaintiff. Eric had known the defendant through Chandra sinc e 2005 when Eric was working in a bank. 

77     The plaintiff sought to argue that Henri’s statement in his affidavit that the giving of loans was “not its c ore business” and that the plaintiff was never in the “primary business” of lending money implied that the giving of loans was the plaintiff’s sec ondary business. I find that the plaintiff’s fixation on the words “c ore” and “primary” was misplac ed. I ac c ept Henri’s explanation in c ross-examination that there was no intention to give out loans on a regular basis to give rise to a finding of a moneylending business: 

 No, all I’m saying is that given the fac t that you said it is rather unfortunate that the words “primary” and “c ore” appears in your own affidavit at paragraph 4--

 Right. 

 ---I’m giving you an opportunity to explain why you say it is rather unfortunate that these 


## A: 

 two words appear in the c ontext of c onduc ting a business. 

 Right. These---Your Honour, these words, er, give the impression---well, while one reads that it---it---it definitely says that we did, er, we did do loans and over and above the---so on. But it also implies that that is the kind of business that, erm, the c ompany would c arry on doing as a matter of standard. Erm, I better c ome bac k to the fac t that the loans that were made were not made from our own side. We did not marketeted [ sic ] them. We did not go out to find borrowers, the borrowers c ame to us. So had there been no more borrowers c oming to us, we would have not made any further loans. And all these loans, Your Honour, I must stress again, this c ompany would have never ever c onsidered a private, personal loan. Now, that’s just putting the c herry on the top, We are not really in the---that understanding that kind of a market of doing loans. Erm, er, princ ipal business was brokerage business. Brokerage. Arbitrage. 

78     Although it is entirely possible for the plaintiff to be in the business of providing c ommodities brokerage and struc turing of trade financ e servic es _and_ also be in the business of moneylending, the small proportion of its profits and revenue derived from the giving of loans to the four c ompanies, although not c onc lusive, is c onsistent with the finding that the plaintiff was not c arrying on the business of moneylending. For the financ ial year 2009 as at 30 September 2009 (whic h was after the first Loan was given), the total inc ome from “loan interest” and “loan management fee” was just $49,009.72, whic h was 4.5% of the total revenue and 14.7% of the profit before taxation in 2009. As was asserted by the defendant and ac c epted by Henri, the “management fee” was essentially “disguised interest” and not for any ac tual management of the loan. At the very least, the small proportion of the inc ome from the loans to the plaintiff’s revenue and profit shows that the plaintiff’s business of the provision of c ommodities brokerage and struc turing of trade financ e servic es was hardly a sham and faç ade for a hidden business in moneylending. 

79     For c ompleteness, I should state that had I found that the plaintiff c arried on the business of moneylending, the plac e of the plaintiff’s moneylending business would have been Hong Kong. In _Cavalry_ at 297, the c ourt held that the c onduc t of the business of moneylending in Hong Kong postulated both the lending of money and the repayment of money in Hong Kong. In the present c ase, the monies were disbursed from the plaintiff’s bank ac c ount in Hong Kong, the monies for the first Loan were repaid into the same bank ac c ount, and the monies for the sec ond Loan were to be repaid into the same. This is notwithstanding that the negotiations, the signing of the doc uments, and the preparation of the invoic es were all done outside of Hong Kong. Given the foregoing, there is no issue of the extraterritorial applic ation of the Hong Kong Money Lenders Ordinanc e bec ause the transac tion would be c harac terised as taking plac e in Hong Kong and henc e c aught by the territorial applic ation of the Ordinanc e. 

**Conclusion** 

80     For all the reasons set out earlier, I award judgment to the plaintiff for its c laim in the sum of US$358,000, with c ontrac tual interest at 7% per annum on US$358,000 from 8 April 2011 until the date of payment. 

81     It follows from [80] that the defendant’s c ounterc laim is dismissed. 

82     Pursuant to c l 1 of the sec ond Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity (see above at [13]), the plaintiff shall have its c osts (one set) for the c laim and the c ounterc laim taxed on an indemnity basis unless otherwise agreed.
