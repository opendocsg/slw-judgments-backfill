1       The plaintiff and the defendant are both c ompanies inc orporated in Singapore and they are related to eac h other in that the plaintiff is a majority shareholder of the defendant in that it holds 60% of the issued share c apital of the defendant. The other shareholder in the defendant is another Singapore c ompany, HD Holdings Pte Ltd (“HD Holdings”). 

2       The plaintiff started this ac tion to rec over the total sum of $263,000 whic h it had advanc ed to the defendant in varying amounts between January 2004 and Dec ember 2005. In due c ourse, the plaintiff applied for summary judgment. On 21 May 2008, the Assistant Registrar made the following orders: 

 (a) that judgment be entered against the defendant in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $190,000 together with interest; 

 (b) that the defendant be given c onditional leave to defend in respec t of the sum of $73,000; 

 (c ) that the defendant pay $30,000 into c ourt in order to defend the said c laim; and 

 (d) that the defendant pay the plaintiff c osts of $5,000 plus reasonable disbursements. 

3       The defendant appealed against the Assistant Registrar’s dec ision. I heard the appeal on 30 June 2008 and dismissed it with c osts. The defendant has appealed. 

**The plaintiff’s case** 

4       The defendant has three direc tors: Mr Chan Wai Chuen, Mr Chan Siang Khing and Mr Liu ChunLin. The first two direc tors are the plaintiff’s representatives on the board of the defendant and they are also direc tors of the plaintiff itself. The third direc tor, Mr Liu, is HD Holdings’ representative on the board. In the O14 proc eedings, Mr Chan Wai Chuen affirmed the affidavits in support of the plaintiff’s c ase whilst Mr Liu was the main deponent on behalf of the defendant. 

5       The plaintiff’s c ase was that from January 2004 to Dec ember 2005, it made advanc es totalling the sum of $190,000 to the defendant as follows:

In support of this assertion, the plaintiff produc ed a c opy of the defendant’s G/L Transac tions Listing for Ac c ount No. 2010 for the year 2005, the plaintiff’s United Overseas Bank Limited (“OUB”) Statements of Ac c ount for one of its ac c ounts and the UOB c heque deposit slips whic h evidenc ed the advanc es. The advanc es were also reflec ted in the defendant’s Annual Financ ial Statements for the year ended 31 Dec ember 2005 as unsec ured, interest free advanc es that were repayable on demand to the plaintiff. 

6       Between January 2006 and Oc tober 2006, the plaintiff made further advanc es totalling $73, to the defendant as set out below:

In support of this assertion, the plaintiff produc ed a c opy of the defendant’s G/L Transac tions Listing for Ac c ount No. 2010 for the year 2006, the defendant’s UOB Statements of Ac c ount, UOB Cash Deposit slips and the plaintiff’s c heques to the defendant evidenc ing the advanc es. 

7       By way of letters dated 1 November 2007 and 23 November 2007 from its solic itors, the plaintiff demanded repayment of the sum of $263,000 being the total amount advanc ed to the defendant. The defendant did not repay that amount or any part of the same. 

8       The defendant did not deny that the advanc es had been made on the dates and in the amounts spec ified by the plaintiff. Its position was that for various reasons these advanc es were not repayable on demand as asserted by the plaintiff. 

**The defendant’s arguments and my decision** 

**_Advances totalling $190,_** 

9       In respec t of the sums advanc ed between 2004 and 2005 totalling $190,000, the defendant agreed that this sum formed part of a larger sum of $1.2m that was reported in the defendant’s 2005 financ ial statements as being advanc es made by the plaintiff to the defendant as at 31 Dec ember 

2005\. Although the advanc es were reported as being unsec ured, interest free and repayable on demand, this statement had to be c onsidered in the light of the undertaking of the plaintiff to provide financ ial support to the defendant. 

10     The defendant pointed out that in the Auditor’s Report attac hed to its financ ial statements, the auditors stated: 

 Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 2.2 of the financ ial statements. The Group and the Company inc urred a net loss of $2,237,580 and $2,160,951 respec tively for the financ ial year ended 31 Dec ember 2005 and as of that date, the Group and the Company’s total liabilities exc eeded its total assets by S$159,607 and S$34,300 respec tively. The financ ial statements have been prepared on a going c onc ern c onc ept as the holding c ompany have (sic ) c onfirmed that it will provide the nec essary c ontinuing financ ial support to the Company. 

11     In the same financ ial statements, the “Statement by Direc tors”, whic h was signed by both the direc tors appointed by the plaintiff, ac knowledged that the plaintiff as the holding c ompany had given an undertaking “to provide the nec essary c ontinuing support to the [defendant]” and that therefore “there [were] reasonable grounds to believe that [the defendant would] be able to pay its debts as and when they fell due”. The defendant submitted that in this assertion, the word “debts” must have inc luded the advanc es totalling $190,000. Further, in the Notes to the Financ ial Statements, it was reported that these statements had “been prepared on a going c onc ern basis as the Group has obtained a c ommitment for c ontinuing financ ial support from the holding c ompany”. 

12     The defendant asserted that without this undertaking from the plaintiff to provide c ontinuing financ ial support, the defendant would c learly have been insolvent and would not have been able to c ontinue its business without the direc tors breaking the law. The auditors were induc ed to prepare 


the audited ac c ounts of the defendant as a going c onc ern bec ause of this undertaking. Further, HD Holdings, the other shareholder, was induc ed into ac c epted the audited ac c ounts. Consequently, the plaintiff was estopped from suing on those advanc es. 

13     I was unable to ac c ept that there was any issue of estoppel with regards to the total amount of $190,000. The plaintiff denied that it had given an undertaking to provide c ontinuing financ ial support to the defendant. As it submitted, however, even if it had given suc h an undertaking, it was not prec luded from demanding repayment of the advanc es made to the defendant. The undertaking was c ontained in the defendant’s 2005 Audited Ac c ounts. These doc uments also stated c learly that the advanc es were repayable on demand. It was c lear therefore that although the plaintiff may have agreed to give financ ial support to the defendant, it had not agreed that this financ ial support would go on forever. There was nothing in the financ ial statements for 2005 that prec luded the plaintiff from demanding repayment of its money some two years later. By stating in the Audited Ac c ounts that the advanc es were “repayable on demand”, the direc tors of the defendant had rec ognised the nature of the advanc es and that the plaintiff was not obliged to keep the funds in the defendant c ompany indefinitely. Under ss 199(1) and 201(15) of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50 2006 Rev Ed), the financ ial statements of a c ompany are the responsibility of its direc tors. (See also _JSI Shipping (S) Pte Ltd v Teofoongwonglcloong (a firm)_ [2007] 4 SLR 460). 

14     The defendant also argued that if there had been no undertaking to provide c ontinuing financ ial support, the defendant would have been insolvent and would not have been able to c ontinue its business without the direc tors breaking the law. Bec ause of the undertaking, the auditors were induc ed to prepare the Audited Ac c ounts of the defendant on the basis that the defendant was a going c onc ern and HD Holdings, the other shareholder, was induc ed into ac c epting the Audited Ac c ounts. As a result, the plaintiff was estopped from suing on the advanc es. 

15     I did not see any basis for an estoppel argument. Any relianc e by HD Holdings and the auditors on the alleged undertaking would not c hange the nature of the advanc es as being repayable on demand. An estoppel would, perhaps, have been c onstituted had there been a c hange in position by the defendant itself in relianc e on the undertaking. There was no evidenc e of suc h c hange in position after the public ation of the 2005 Audited Ac c ounts. 

**_Claim for $73,_** 

16     The defendant argued that these advanc es in 2006 were made without any board resolution or shareholders’ resolution and that Mr Liu was not aware of them until the ac tion started. In law, it argued, a c reditor c annot be his own debtor and therefore Mr Chan Wai Chuen and Mr Chan Siang Khing c ould not lend money to themselves. The Chans had breac hed their fiduc iary duty as direc tors by ac c epting advanc es that were repayable on demand when they knew or ought to have known that the defendant would not be in a position to repay the same unless they had formed the view or intended that the advanc es should not be repayable on demand. 

17     I did not understand that argument. As a direc tor of the defendant, Mr Liu had ac c ess to the books of the c ompany and it was always open to him to find out how the defendant was financ ing its business. If it was indeed a breac h of duty on the part of the Chans, as direc tors of the defendant, to proc ure loans from the plaintiff, then the defendant would have to sue the Chans for breac h of duty. Suc h an assertion would not justify a refusal to repay money borrowed from the plaintiff. Perhaps what the defendant was arguing was that the advanc es in 2006 c onstituted a gift from the plaintiff as they were made without the request of the defendant as evidenc ed by the passing of a board resolution. This seemed a tenuous argument to me as advanc es of money by one c ommerc ial c orporation to another to assist it in c arrying on its business are c ommerc ial payments and not 


generally in the nature of gifts espec ially where the paying party is a shareholder of the rec ipient and there is a history of advanc es being made to help the rec ipient operate. 

**_Agreement to treat advances as investment_** 

18     The defendant asserted that it was not in dispute that the advanc es were made to meet the working c apital needs of the defendant. It c ontended that the plaintiff was obliged to c onvert the alleged advanc es into shares and give 40% of those shares to HD Holdings. This obligation arose pursuant to an agreement between the plaintiff and HD Holdings some time in February 2005. The plaintiff had invited HD Holdings to join it in the healthc are business whic h the plaintiff had intended to develop and pursue in China through the defendant as its investment vehic le. It was agreed that HD Holdings would provide its strong and wide business network in China whilst the plaintiff would provide working c apital and operational expertise. The plaintiff would also bear all the expenses inc urred by HD Holdings. The defendant asserted that this agreement was supported by the fac t that the plaintiff did c onvert advanc es of $1,030,000 to the defendant into 4,120,000 shares and then transferred 1,648,000 ordinary shares (whic h represent 40%) to HD Holdings in February 2005. 

19     The plaintiff did not admit that the advanc es were made as working c apital for the defendant. Even if they had been, however, it did not follow that they were not repayable by the defendant on demand. The fac t that the advanc es were intended for working c apital would not be inc onsistent with the defendant’s obligation to repay the same when the plaintiff required repayment. Consequently, this argument did not raise a triable issue. 

20     The assertion that the advanc es should be c onverted into shares and 40% of the same issued in the name of HD Holdings did not provide a defenc e either. Even if there had been an agreement to suc h effec t, a matter I do not have to determine, that agreement would have been one made between HD Holdings and the plaintiff. There was no agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant that the plaintiff would ask for its loans to be c onverted into share c apital and that suc h shares would be alloc ated in part to HD Holdings. The defendant was not party to any c ontrac t between the plaintiff and HD Holdings and therefore the terms of suc h c ontrac t c ould not affec t the defendant’s obligations to repay the advanc es to the plaintiff. 

**_The defendant’s counterclaim_** 

21     The defendant c ontended in the alternative that it had a valid set off and c ounterc laim whic h exc eeded the plaintiff’s c laim. This arose from serious mismanagement by the plaintiff’s Chan Siang Khing and/or Chan Wai Chuen of the defendant’s investment in China. 

22     The defendant said that all the advanc es made by the plaintiff to the defendant had been expended on the defendant’s business in China. This business c onsisted of investments in two subsidiary c ompanies in China. The plaintiff who c ontrolled the management of the defendant through Chan Siang Khing and Chan Wai Chuen, also managed the businesses of the subsidiaries through them and the two had mismanaged the affairs of the subsidiaries to suc h an extent that the investment appeared to have been totally lost. The defendant also asserted that there were strong grounds to pursue rec overy ac tion against Chan Siang Khing. Yet, Chan Wai Chuen as the c hairman of both the defendant and the subsidiary c ompany had refused to do anything. As a result of the wrongful ac tions of the two men, the defendant had a c laim of $2.79m against the plaintiff. 

23     I agreed with the plaintiff that it was not nec essary to go into the substantial merits of the defendant’s c ounterc laim. There was no c onnec tion between the plaintiff’s c laim and the defendant’s c ounterc laim as the latter arose out of transac tions that were entirely separate and distinc t from the 


advanc es made by the plaintiff to the defendant. There c ould not be, therefore, a set off whic h would entitle the defendant to resist summary judgment. In any c ase, the defendant’s c ounterc laim c ould not serve as a defenc e to the plaintiff’s c laim bec ause it was an allegation that the two direc tors in managing the affairs of the defendant had c aused it to suffer loss in various subsidiary c ompanies. Suc h c laims would have to be brought against the direc tors themselves and not against the plaintiff whic h c ould not be regarded as the alter ego of the two men. 

**Conclusion** 

24     In the result, I saw no reason to interfere with the orders made by the Assistant Registrar. If anything, the Assistant Registrar was generous in giving the defendant leave to defend in respec t of the 2006 advanc es. As the plaintiff had not appealed against that order, however, I did not alter it.
