29 January 2010 Judgment reserved. 

**Lai Siu Chiu J:** 

1       This was a c laim by William Cheng (“the plaintiff”) in his c apac ity as the sole remaining administrator (as well as a benefic iary) of the estate of Louise Cheng (“the estate”) his late mother, against DBS Bank Ltd (“the defendant”). The plaintiff c laimed c ompensation arising from allegedly unauthorised transfers of moneys out of the estate’s bank ac c ount maintained with the defendant. The plaintiff had a c o-administrator in his brother Robert Cheng (“Robert”) until 11 May 2006, when Robert was adjudged a bankrupt. Robert met an untimely death on or about 4 April 2009 after he was involved in a road ac c ident in Malaysia. 

**The facts** 

2       Louise Cheng (“the dec eased”) passed away on 1 September 1984. On or about 10 May 1986, in their c apac ities as joint administrators of the estate, the plaintiff and Robert opened an ac c ount with the defendant for the estate under ac c ount number 001XXXXXXX (“the ac c ount”). Both administrators were signatories to the ac c ount and the mandate to the defendant was that both signatures were required to operate the ac c ount. However, bec ause the plaintiff was then working in Taiwan, it was agreed between the siblings that Robert would be responsible for managing the estate and monitoring the ac c ount. 

3       Ac c ording to the instruc tions rec eived by the defendant when the ac c ount was opened, the bank statements for the ac c ount were to be sent to No 17 Jalan Senandong (“the property”) whic h was then Robert’s residenc e. The property was also the main asset of the estate. 

4       Although the dec eased died intestate, the two administrators as well as their four sisters were aware of her wishes, whic h she had written out in Mandarin in a doc ument dated 28 August 1984. Essentially, it was the intention of the dec eased that the estate was to be divided into three shares with one share eac h going to the plaintiff and Robert while the remaining share was to be used for the funeral expenses of the dec eased and the c ost and upkeep of her gravesite. 

5       In or about Oc tober 2001, the property was sold for $4.3m and the net sale proc eeds less 


expenses amounting to $3,874,681.77 (“the sale proc eeds”) were deposited into the ac c ount. After the sale was c ompleted, Robert moved to Bloc k 12,Toh Yi Drive #02-389, Singapore 590012 (“Robert’s house”). On or about 9 Oc tober 2001, Robert instruc ted the defendant to c hange the mailing address of the ac c ount from the property to Robert’s house. The defendant c omplied with his instruc tions. 

6       On 22 Oc tober 2001, DBS c heque no. 243341 for $1m was drawn in favour of the plaintiff as part of the plaintiff’s one-third entitlement (equivalent to $1.3m) to the sale proc eeds of the property. On 23 Oc tober 2001, DBS c heque no. 243343 dated 22 Oc tober 2001 for $1m was drawn in favour of Madam Long Lee Choo (“Robert’s wife”) representing part of Robert’s one-third share of the sale proc eeds. Robert made a gift of the sum to his wife. 

7       In Dec ember 2001, Robert and the plaintiff disc ussed the balanc e $1.3m of the sale proc eeds. It far exc eeded what was required to maintain their parents’ temporary gravesite in Taipei. Robert dec ided to and did c onsult a lawyer. He was verbally advised by a solic itor (OSH) that neither he nor the plaintiff were legally bound to hold the sum of $1.3m to maintain their parents’ temporary gravesite. OSH subsequently rendered a written opinion to both brothers on 12 Marc h 2002 (at 1AB561-564) to c onfirm his views. Robert duly c onveyed OSH’s oral advic e to the plaintiff and after disc ussion, the plaintiff and Robert agreed that $1m from the balanc e one-third share would be shared equally between them leaving $300,000 for maintenanc e of their parents’ gravesite. 

8       On 6 January 2002, the plaintiff and his wife visited Robert’s house. Robert suggested to the plaintiff that $1m from the one-third share for the gravesite maintenanc e be plac ed in a fixed deposit ac c ount in Malaysia as the sum was lying idle in the ac c ount. Moreover, the interest earned on Malaysian Ringgit (“MR”) deposits would be higher than the interest rates offered by Singapore banks for fixed deposits. The plaintiff agreed to Robert’s suggestion. The plaintiff signed DBS c heque no. 243346 for $1m (“the first c heque”) in favour of the estate. A separate DBS c heque no. 243347 for $50,000 (“the sec ond c heque”) was issued in favour of the plaintiff who c laimed (ac c ording to Robert’s affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief [“AEIC”]), to have inc urred expenses for the maintenanc e of their parents’ temporary gravesite in Taiwan. 

9       Robert had previously been informed by a Malaysian bank offic er that there c ould be c ertain issues with regard to using a c heque to transfer a large sum of money from a Singapore bank ac c ount to an ac c ount in Malaysia. After disc ussing these issues, the plaintiff signed DBS c heque no. 243348 (“the third c heque”) in blank as a c ontingenc y method of payment to effec t the transfer of monies from the ac c ount to a MR ac c ount in Malaysia should Robert enc ounter problems in the transfer. The date, payee, amount and Robert’s signature were missing from the third c heque. The plaintiff returned to Taiwan on the following day. 

10     The c onversion of $1m into MR was to be arranged by Robert’s daughter (Vivienne) who worked as a financ e direc tor for a Malaysian public listed c ompany. 

11     On 8 January 2002, Robert forwarded to the plaintiff a fax that Robert had rec eived from Vivienne on the then prevailing exc hange rate between the MR and the Singapore dollar applic able to $1m. Subsequently, Robert forwarded to the plaintiff another fax he had rec eived from Vivienne on 14 January 2002 wherein Vivienne advised that a person c alled Robert Yong (“Yong”) wanted US$542,000 (equivalent to S$995,112) in exc hange for MR2,059,600. Yong wanted a draft in the sum o f US$542,000 to be handed to his Singapore private banker Jessie Heng in exc hange for MR2,059,600. Robert deposed in his AEIC that he had disc ussed Yong’s offer with the plaintiff who agreed to ac c ept the same and that Robert should c arry out the transac tion. 

12     Ac c ordingly, Robert visited the Bukit Timah Plaza branc h of the defendant (“the branc h”) on the 


morning of 21 January 2002 to purc hase a draft for US$542,000. Robert was handed a demand draft applic ation form (“the applic ation form”) whic h he c ompleted, signed and presented to the branc h’s staff for proc essing. He was told the applic ation form was not ac c eptable as the same only had one signature whereas the mandate also required the plaintiff’s signature. In response, Robert showed to the staff the third c heque and said he would be using the same to pay for the draft. He filled in the blanks in the third c heque, signed it and handed the same to the staff. Shortly thereafter, Robert rec eived the draft for US$542,000 (“the first draft”). 

13     Robert proc eeded to Jessie Heng’s offic e and handed her the first draft. However, Jessie Heng informed him that the first draft was not in order as the benefic iary should be Yong and not herself. Robert informed her he would rec tify the mistake. 

14     Robert rushed bac k to the branc h. He explained to a staff of the branc h that the benefic iary should be Yong and not Jessie Heng. A member of the staff then c rossed out Jessie Heng’s name in t h e applic ation form and inserted Yong’s name. Robert was then asked to initial and verify the amendment whic h he did. Robert then rec eived a new draft no. 00160D2004017 (“the sec ond draft”) in Yong’s name for US$542,000. He returned to Jessie Heng’s offic e and handed the sec ond draft to her. 

15     On the same day, the estate rec eived RM2,059,600 into its Malaysian ac c ount maintained with Hong Leong Bank Berhad (“the HL ac c ount”) whic h sum was plac ed in fixed deposit (“the fixed deposit”). It subsequently transpired that the third c heque was not used to purc hase the first or sec ond drafts. Instead, the defendant debited the ac c ount with the sum of $995,112 together with administrative c harges of $100 and $10. 

16     In his AEIC, Robert said he subsequently rec eived the balanc e of $300,000 of his $1.3m share of the sale proc eeds by a DBS c heque no. 300052 dated 15 April 2002 (“the fourth c heque”). Robert deposed the fourth c heque was jointly signed by him and the plaintiff and issued in favour of Robert’s wife. Although the plaintiff also sued the defendant in relation to the fourth c heque, the plaintiff did not refer to the fourth c heque at all either in his AEIC or in his supplemental AEIC. The first mention by the plaintiff of the fourth c heque (admitted by him in c ourt) was in his statement of c laim ( _infra_ [30]). I will return to this observation when I look at the evidenc e adduc ed from the plaintiff in c ross-examination (at N/E 106-107). 

17     On 6 May 2002, the plaintiff sent a fax to Robert c ontaining the following message: 

 The amount from the Estate that was paid in Ringgit deposit was for 3 months only. Please give me an update and have the amount returned to the Estate ac c ount right away. 

In his AEIC (at para 21), the plaintiff explained that he sc ribbled the above note out of extreme anger with Robert bec ause Robert had sent him a fax about title to their parents’ gravesite, amongst other things. 

18     After his return to Singapore for good in June 2002, the plaintiff started familiarising himself with the estate’s matters as well with the estate of his sister Daisy. The plaintiff alleged that Robert was not c ooperative in this respec t as whic h result he wrote to the defendant on 3 Marc h 2003 with a request that monthly statements of the ac c ount be sent to his address (No. 25 Kew Drive). 

19     On 13 May 2003, the plaintiff rec eived the Marc h 2003 statements from the defendant. He wrote to the defendant on 15 May 2003 to request for future statements of the ac c ount to be sent to him. 


 (a) 

 (b) 

 (c ) 

20     On 22 May 2003, the plaintiff rec eived the defendant’s letter informing him that his request for a c hange of mailing address in [18] c ould not be proc essed bec ause Robert’s signature was required. 

21     The plaintiff replied to the defendant on 27 May 2003 to inquire when the c hange of address from the property to Robert’s house was effec ted and whether his signature was obtained as required by the defendant. The defendant replied on 9 June 2003 to say the plaintiff’s inquiry would be forwarded to the defendant’s department in c harge of address updating. The plaintiff c laimed that in a subsequent telephone c onversation with one Julie Chow of the defendant on 24 Marc h 2004, he was told the c hange of address from the property to Robert’s house had been an “oversight”. 

22     The plaintiff heard nothing further from the defendant regarding his inquiry in [21] until his rec eipt of the defendant’s solic itors’ letter dated 22 April 2008 enc losing a c opy of the defendant’s request form for c hange of address signed by Robert only. 

23     In Marc h 2004, the plaintiff finally rec eived from the defendant statements of the ac c ount for the period July 2001 to February 2004. He perused the statements and was puzzled by the debit entry of $995,112 on 21 January 2002 in the statement for January 2002. 

24     On 16 Marc h 2005, the plaintiff wrote to the defendant requesting a c opy of the outward draft advic e in respec t of the debit entry of $995,112 on 21 January 2002. The plaintiff rec eived a c opy of the advic e on 26 May 2005. After making further inquiries of and rec eiving additional doc uments from the defendant, the plaintiff unc overed the following fac ts: 

 a sum of $995,112 was remitted out of the ac c ount on 21 January 2002 based on the third c heque dated 14 January 2002 purportedly signed by Robert and himself; 

 the applic ation form for the first draft had been signed by Robert only; and 

 the request for c hange of mailing address from the property to Robert’s house was also signed by Robert only but was ac c epted by the defendant. 

25     Consequently, on 12 September 2006, the plaintiff wrote to the defendant enc losing c opies of, the third c heque, the applic ation form (original and amended c opies) and sought _inter alia_ c larific ation on whether and when the third c heque was presented to the defendant and why the mandate of two signatures had been waived by the defendant in relation to the applic ation form. The defendant responded to the plaintiff’s queries on 26 Oc tober 2006 pointing out that: 

 (a) It was not disputed the plaintiff had signed the third c heque and he had admitted at a meeting he had with the defendant in July 2005 that he had signed the third c heque for the purpose of buying US dollars whic h transac tion Robert had indeed c arried out. 

 (b) The plaintiff had raised his queries in relation to the applic ation form in May 2005, whic h was more than a year after the relevant statements of ac c ount were furnished by the defendant in April 2004, in breac h of c l 7 of the Terms and Conditions (see [79] below) governing the ac c ount. 

 (c ) the plaintiff’s c onduc t was c onsistent with the fac t that the defendant had c arried out the 


 transac tion properly and reasonably. 

26     The plaintiff denied he had signed the third c heque in blank. He maintained he had signed only one c heque _viz_ the first c heque. He also disc laimed knowledge of the fixed deposit and the HL ac c ount. He had assumed that no fixed deposit was plac ed bec ause he had not been asked to sign any doc uments for the opening of a Malaysian bank ac c ount for the estate. Notwithstanding his rec eipt of Vivienne’s fax dated 14 January 2002 from Robert at [11], it was the plaintiff’s c ase that he was unaware of the plac ement of the fixed deposit bec ause he had heard nothing further from Robert after 16 January 2002. 

27     In fac t, the plaintiff c laimed he c ame to know of the fixed deposit and the HL ac c ount only when he sued Robert in Suit No 386 of 2005 (“the 2005 suit”) to rec over the sum of $995,112. Robert had there filed an affidavit in an (unsuc c essful) attempt to set aside the judgment in default of pleadings that the plaintiff had obtained against him under O 19 of the Rules of Court. When Robert c ould not/did not pay the judgment sum in the 2005 suit, the plaintiff made him a bankrupt on 11 May 2006 in Bankruptc y No 956 of 2006. It was in the c ourse of proc eedings in the 2005 suit that the plaintiff disc overed that the HL ac c ount had been opened by Robert as far bac k as 10 July 1995. The plaintiff believed his signature on the HL ac c ount opening form was forged. 

28     The plaintiff c laimed he met the defendant’s representative one Bertilla Chea at its Parkway Parade branc h on 12 Dec ember 2006 who then showed him the original of the third c heque. The plaintiff noted therefrom that his signature was signed in blue ink whereas the remaining handwritten portions whic h appeared to be written by Robert were in blac k ink. The plaintiff’s signature on the first c heque on the other hand was in blac k ink. The plaintiff reiterated that he only signed the first c heque and no others on 6 January 2002; he believed Robert had forged his signature on the third c heque. 

**The pleadings** 

29     On 18 January 2008, the plaintiff c ommenc ed this ac tion. In his statement of c laim the plaintiff repeated his c ontention that he was unaware of and did not sign the third c heque. He alleged that the defendant used the third c heque to pay or issue the sec ond draft in favour of Yong and thereby debited the ac c ount in the sum of $995,112 (being the amount of the third c heque) as well as two additional sums of $100 and $10.00. The plaintiff c ontended he did not authorise the drawing of the third c heque and he did not apply or sign the applic ation form or the amendments thereto in respec t of the first and sec ond drafts respec tively. Consequently he c ontended, the defendant had no authority to debit the ac c ount with the aforesaid three sums on 21 January 2002 or at all. 

30     The plaintiff further alleged that unbeknownst to him until Marc h/April 2004, the defendant had, in breac h of its mandate, c hanged the mailing address of the ac c ount from the property to Robert’s house. 

31     As a result of the defendant’s breac hes, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant was negligent and in breac h of c ontrac t in relation to the ac c ount. The plaintiff also alleged that the defendant’s negligenc e c aused him to sign the fourth c heque whic h sum was debited to the ac c ount on 18 April 2002. 

32     In its defenc e and c ounterc laim (amendment No.1), the defendant denied it had been negligent and averred that the plaintiff and Robert had both signed the third c heque as authorised signatories to the ac c ount whic h third c heque the defendant utilised in payment of the two drafts. The defendant asserted that the applic ation for and amendments to the first and sec ond draft 


respec tively had been validly authorised by the plaintiff and Robert. If indeed the drawing of the third c heque was unauthorised (whic h was not admitted), the defendant c ontended that the plaintiff had fac ilitated suc h unauthorised withdrawal and the applic ation for and amendments to the two drafts by signing the third c heque without taking proper safeguards suc h as indic ating on the third c heque the purpose for whic h it was signed, and by making the third c heque available for the use of Robert who was a signatory of the ac c ount. The defendant relied on c l 16 of the Terms and Conditions governing the operation of the ac c ount to say it was not liable to the plaintiff in suc h an event. 

33     The defendant averred that the plaintiff knew of the fixed deposit in the HL ac c ount, relying _inter alia_ on the fax (in [17]) sent by the plaintiff to Robert on 6 May 2002. 

34     The defendant added that the plaintiff c ould not in any c ase c hallenge the validity of the applic ation for and/or the amendments to the first and sec ond drafts respec tively and/or payment of the third c heque to the defendant and payment of the fourth c heque, by reason of c l 7(b)(iii)(bb) of the Terms and Conditions governing the ac c ount. 

35     The defendant pointed out that the applic ation for and amendments to the first and sec ond drafts respec tively and/or payment of the third and fourth c heques were reflec ted as entries in the statements that were periodic ally issued by the defendant. Further, pursuant to the plaintiff’s request, the defendant had on or around 3 April 2004 provided the plaintiff with statements of the ac c ount for the period September 2000 to February 2004. The statements expressly informed the holder of the ac c ount that: 

 It is your duty to c hec k all entries in this statement and unless errors are reported to the bank within fourteen (14) days after rec eipt, the entries will be c onsidered c orrec t and you will be bound by them. 

36     The defendant averred that it was only by way of a letter dated 16 June 2005 whic h was more than 14 days after the plaintiff’s rec eipt of the statements that the plaintiff sought to raise to the defendant objec tions to the applic ation for and/or amendments to the first and sec ond drafts and/or payment of the fourth c heque. In fac t, until the defendant was served the statement of c laim on 20 May 2008, the plaintiff had not raised any objec tions to the debit from the ac c ount of the sum of $300,000 in the fourth c heque. 

37     In the event the defendant was found to be liable to the plaintiff, the defendant c ounterc laimed for a dec laration that it was entitled to a c ontribution or indemnity from the plaintiff in his c apac ity as an administrator of the estate and/or c o-signatory of the ac c ount, pursuant to s 15 of the Civil Law Ac t (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)(“the Civil Law Ac t”). 

38     In his reply and defenc e to the c ounterc laim, the plaintiff pleaded for the first time that he and Robert had agreed that a sum of $1m from the ac c ount would be plac ed in an ac c ount to be opened in Malaysia in the name of the estate, for a period of three months only and whic h would be operated jointly by both of them. The plaintiff c ontended that the third c heque was never reflec ted in any of the defendant’s statements forwarded to the plaintiff or shown to have been c leared through the ac c ount maintained with the defendant. 

39     The plaintiff averred that the doc umentation pertaining to the two drafts was only shown to him on or about 11 July 2005 after the plaintiff had queried the transac tion while the original of the third c heque was only shown to him on or about 12 Dec ember 2006. 

40     The plaintiff denied he had authorised Robert to amend the applic ation form on his behalf. The 


plaintiff alleged that the defendant failed to c ontac t him when there were persistent amendments made by Robert to the applic ation form, in breac h of the mandate granted to the defendant. The plaintiff denied he had c ontributed to or assisted in the applic ation form and/or in the subsequent amendments to the applic ation form for the drafts. 

41     The plaintiff c ontended that by reason of the defendant’s wrongful and/or unauthorised c hange of the mailing address to whic h monthly statements were sent, the plaintiff was unaware of the unauthorised and/or un-mandated withdrawals. Had the plaintiff known of the disc repanc ies in the ac c ount, the plaintiff averred he would have stopped any further issuanc e of c heques in relation thereto. He c ontended that by its c onduc t the defendant was estopped from relying on any of the exc lusion c lauses in relation to the operation of the ac c ount. 

42     On the first day of trial, the plaintiff applied by Summons No 3424 of 2009 (“the plaintiff’s applic ation”) to amend the reliefs in the statement of c laim to inc lude: (i) a dec laration that the defendant was not entitled to debit the ac c ount with the amounts of $995,112, $100 and $10 and (ii) a c laim for restitution to the plaintiff of all sums wrongfully debited against the ac c ount. The defendant opposed, and I dismissed the plaintiff’s applic ation for the reason that, a c laim for restitution is a nec essary c orollary to a c laim for unjust enric hment but suc h a c laim was not pleaded by the plaintiff. 

43     The defendant also had an applic ation on the first day of trial, by way of Summons No 3111 of 2009 (“the defendant’s applic ation”) for Robert’s AEIC to be rec eived in evidenc e at the trial despite the fac t that his demise meant Robert c ould not be c ross-examined. I overruled the objec tions of c ounsel for the plaintiff and granted an order in terms of the defendant’s applic ation, with the c aveat that the probative value of Robert’s written testimony must fac tor in the lac k of opportunity by c ounsel for the plaintiff to c ross-examine Robert and (with the agreement of c ounsel for the defendant) that the princ iple in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 57 would apply. 

**_The evidence_** 

44     The plaintiff was the only fac tual witness for his c ase. The defendant also had only one fac tual witness in its employee Ho Siew Fong (“Ho”) in the light of Robert’s demise. Ho at the material time was a c ustomer servic e offic er (“CSO”) at its Bukit Timah branc h. Both sides also had an expert witness. In the plaintiff’s c ase, his expert was William Pang Chan Kok (‘Pang”) who is a private handwriting and forensic doc ument examiner while the defendant’s expert Yap Bei Sing (“Yap”) is a senior forensic sc ientist from the Health Sc ienc e Authority’s Doc ument Examination unit. Eac h side roundly c ritic ised the opposing party’s expert’s testimony as well as his expertise. There was even a suggestion in the plaintiff’s c losing submissions that Yap was a biased witness bec ause he had had sight of Pang’s report when Yap prepared his report. 

_(i) The plaintiff’s case_ 

45     The plaintiff’s testimony has been outlined in the fac ts set out above (save where the same c ame from Robert’s AEIC). I therefore turn to the plaintiff’s c ross-examination for the additional evidenc e that was adduc ed from him by c ounsel for the defendant. 

46     Contrary to the assertions made in his AEIC, the plaintiff c hanged his stanc e in c rossexamination and made the following signific ant admissions: 

 (a) he knew from the two faxes in [11] that he rec eived from Robert that $1m from the ac c ount would be withdrawn, c onverted into MR and transferred to an ac c ount in Malaysia; 


 (b) his fax to Robert at [17] showed he was aware of the fixed deposit of RM2,059.600; 

 (c ) the fourth c heque in [16] was meant for Robert’s balanc e share of the estate. The plaintiff disavowed his signing of the fourth c heque bec ause he felt that Robert had taken more than his share of the estate; 

 (d) the plaintiff was aware that the property had been sold in Oc tober 2001 and that statements for the ac c ount c ould no longer be sent there. The plaintiff did not take any steps to effec t the c hange of mailing address nor did he ask Robert if the mailing address had been c hanged; 

 (e) prior to Marc h 2003, the plaintiff did not request the defendant for past statements for the ac c ount for the period 2001-2002; 

 (f ) after the plaintiff signed the first c heque (for $1m) he had disc ussed with Robert the latter’s proposal to c onvert $1m of the estate’s money into MR as well as Vivienne’s proposal of a better deal for the estate by doing an exc hange of Singapore dollars for MR with a private individual (initially with the sister of one Vinc ent Tan and eventually with Yong); 

 (g) he left it to Robert to c arry out the transac tion of c onverting $1m into MR although Robert was required to keep him informed of the proc ess; 

 (h) he signed four c heques on 6 January 2002 whic h inc luded DBS c heque no. 243345 for $20,000 (at 2AB20). Just like the third c heque, the plaintiff signed this c heque in blue ink whereas the rest of the handwriting was in blac k ink. 

47     I turn next to portions of the plaintiff’s testimony whic h c ontradic ted his c ase and/or his AEIC. Although the plaintiff had pleaded in his Further & Better Partic ulars of the statement of c laim (filed on 24 July 2008) that he did not sign the third c heque to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, he was more c ertain in his AEIC as there (in para 31) he said: 

 I wish to say that I did not sign the c heque no. 243348 dated 14 January 2002 for $995,112. I signed only one c heque [the first c heque], for $1 million on 6 January 2002. By 14 January 2002, I had returned to Taiwan and was not in Singapore. I also did not sign the c heque in blank. 

48     The plaintiff’s reasoning that he c ould not have signed the third c heque in blank was based purely on its date of 14 January 2002. However, his reasoning was flawed – the sec ond c heque for $50,000 issued to him (at 1AB61) was also not dated 6 January 2002. Confronted with the sec ond c heque, the plaintiff (at N/E 76/77) sought to explain the date by stating he left Singapore for Hong Kong on 7 January 2002, he returned to Taiwan therefrom on 11 January 2002 and he posted the sec ond c heque bac k to his Singapore bank (Keppel Tat Lee Bank) on 12 January 2002 for c rediting to his ac c ount. He then exc used himself with the remark “so long ago” when he was asked to c onfirm that the sec ond c heque was dated 12 January 2002 even though he signed it in Singapore on 6 January 2002. I find it strange that a person in the plaintiff’s position (a Permanent Sec retary of two ministries and c hairman of the Central Provident Fund Board before his retirement and posting to Taiwan in 1979 to set up Singapore’s trade offic e) would venture to say that the dates in c heques nec essarily evidenc ed when they were ac tually signed. 

49     The defendant’s submissions c ritic ised the plaintiff’s ac tion of bringing the sec ond c heque bac k with him to Taiwan and then posting it bac k to Singapore as illogic al and unlikely. It was the defendant’s submission that it was more likely than not (with whic h I agree) that the plaintiff and 


Robert signed four c heques in blank on 6 January 2002; the sec ond c heque was one of them. Robert was entrusted with the four c heques and it was Robert who filled in the partic ulars in all the c heques inc luding those on the sec ond c heque and its date of 12 January 2002 and c redited it to the plaintiff’s Singapore bank ac c ount for him. Consequently the dates of the four c heques have no signific anc e and even less c onsequenc e. The plaintiff’s testimony ignored the c ommon prac tic e of bac kdating or postdating c heques. 

50     The defendant’s submissions also gave a reason why the plaintiff’s c ase that he did not sign the third c heque has no merit. As stated earlier in [21], the plaintiff had previously sued and obtained judgment against Robert in the 2005 suit. In an affidavit filed on 3 August 2005 in the 2005 suit, the plaintiff had (in para 10) said he signed the third c heque whic h he disavowed in these proc eedings. 

51     However, subsequently, in a later affidavit (at para 14) that he filed (on 27 September 2005) in the 2005 suit, the plaintiff did a _volte face_ and c laimed that he did not sign the third c heque. The plaintiff explained his c hange of heart on the basis that he had mistaken the third c heque for the first c heque he signed on 6 January 2002 and he only realised his mistake when he obtained a c opy of the third c heque from the defendant. The plaintiff’s explanation was unc onvinc ing ac c ording to the defendant. The defendant pointed out that by 3 August 2005 (when the plaintiff filed his first affidavit ac knowledging he signed the third c heque) the plaintiff had already seen the third c heque as a c opy thereof was exhibited in Robert’s affidavit filed on 29 July 2005 in the 2005 suit. 

52     The defendant submitted that it was unbelievable that the plaintiff c ould have c onfused the third c heque with the first. Granted the amounts stated in both c heques were the same _ie_ $1m. However, the payee in the first c heque was the estate whereas the third c heque had no payee until Robert filled in the defendant’s name (the c heque itself was dated 14 January 2002). The defendant added that it was also logic al for the third c heque to be signed in blank sinc e the payee and amount details were not known until 22 January 2002. It was only on that day that Robert c ould write the prec ise Singapore dollar amount for US$542,000 in the c heque. 

53     I note that in the statement of c laim, the plaintiff pleaded that the third c heque was used to purc hase a draft in favour of Yong. This was in ac c ordanc e with the disc ussions reac hed between the plaintiff and Robert on 6 January 2002 and reflec ted in the fax of 14 January 2002. The plaintiff did not deny rec eiving this fax nor Robert’s earlier fax of 8 January 2002. The plaintiff had even made a handwritten notation of _16/01/02_ on the fax of 14 January 2002 to indic ate Thursday 16 January 2002 was the likely date the transac tion with Yong would be c onc luded. If indeed he disagreed with Robert’s proposed transac tion with Yong, why did the plaintiff not objec t? Instead, there was a fax from him to Robert (set out at [17]), implic itly ac knowledging the fixed deposit in MR. 

54     It is puzzling why the plaintiff would send suc h a fax to Robert out of extreme anger. As c ounsel for the defendant as well as the c ourt pointed out to the plaintiff (at N/E 24 and N/E 146 respec tively) whic h the plaintiff c onc eded, the text of the fax did not reflec t any anger the plaintiff may have felt towards Robert. On a plain reading of the fax dated 6 May 2002, the plaintiff wanted to have an update from Robert. It was no c oinc idenc e (ac c ording to the defendant) that the fax to Robert was sent on 6 May 2002 as that was exac tly three months from the date (6 January 2002) the two brothers had disc ussed the plac ement of the fixed deposit in MR. 

55     In re-examination, the plaintiff sought to explain (at N/E 153) that Robert had provoked him by asking for $300,000 urgently to buy a piec e of land at Desaru, Johor. The plaintiff said he ac c eded to Robert’s request by signing a c heque and sending it to Robert by c ourier servic e only to rec eive in return c ertain c omplaints from Robert. I disallowed this line of re-examination further as this turn of events was unrelated to the plaintiff’s fax of 6 May 2002 (at AB72). 


 (a) 

56     The plaintiff had also c laimed that his signature on the signature c ard of the HL ac c ount (N/E 28) was a forgery. However, apart from a bare assertion, the plaintiff c onc eded that he had no other evidenc e to support his belief as his own expert Pang did not verify the plaintiff’s signatures on HL’s signature c ard. 

57     It would appear from the plaintiff’s pleadings and his AEIC that his premise for saying the third c heque was not used in the purc hase of the bank draft was based on the fac t that the bank statement of the ac c ount for January 2002 (at AB183) showed the c heque was not c leared through the banking system but the ac c ount was instead debited. I shall return to this observation later. 

_(ii) The defendant’s case_ 

58     I turn next to the evidenc e of Ho Siew Fong (“Ho”), the CSO who attended to Robert when he visited the branc h (twic e) on 21 January 2002 to proc ure the two drafts. Ho was then the most senior staff available at the branc h that morning as neither the servic e nor branc h managers were in. Robert had initially been attended to by one Sandy Neo and thereafter by Norita Bte Johar. The two persons were unsure whether the applic ation form c ould be proc essed as the doc ument c ontained only Robert’s signature whereas two signatures were required to operate the ac c ount. 

59     When the matter was referred to her, Ho informed Robert that two signatures were required to proc ess the applic ation form. Robert suggested that a c heque be made out to the defendant for the s um required in the draft and handed the third c heque to her. Ho examined the third c heque and verified the two signatures on the c heque with the sample signatures in the defendant’s c omputer system. She noted the payee of the third c heque was the defendant and the foreign exc hange c ontrac t number CF 02004856-01 (“the forex c ontrac t”) was also inserted. Ho ac c epted the third c heque and approved the applic ation form on that basis. 

60     Ho deposed that the words “ok By TRSVNJJ that appeared on the third c heque (see 2AB38) were the initials of Miss Ng Jean Jane (“Ng”) who used to be a treasury manager at the branc h. Ng no longer worked for the defendant and Ho did not know her whereabouts. 

61     In c ross-examination Ho indic ated it was unlikely that a foreign exc hange (‘forex”) c ontrac t in exc ess of US$500,000 would have been c onc luded at the c ounter when Robert c alled at the branc h. It was more likely that Robert c ontrac ted with one of the defendant’s foreign exc hange dealers _ie_ Ng as reflec ted in the forex c ontrac t (at AB661). Ho testified there was a bit of c ommotion when Robert was at the branc h. While Ho was doing some bac k room transac tions, she heard Robert talking loudly before she c ame out to attend to him. Robert insisted on the branc h proc essing the applic ation form as there was a forex c ontrac t and he had the third c heque with whic h to make payment. Ho telephoned the defendant’s treasury department to obtain its approval to use the third c heque for the forex c ontrac t before she herself approved the applic ation form. 

62     Robert’s AEIC (admitted into evidenc e on the first day of trial) c ame in for intense c ritic ism in the plaintiff’s c losing submissions. The plaintiff not surprisingly argued that Robert was an unreliable witness lac king in c redibility, based on past inc onsistent affidavits that he had filed (whic h doc uments referred to in her submissions by c ounsel for the plaintiff were not in any of the bundles used in this trial). The plaintiff pointed out that in Robert’s affidavit filed on 30 August 2005 to set aside the default judgment in the 2005 suit, Robert had deposed to the following fac ts: 

 on 6 January 2002, he and the plaintiff had agreed to plac e $1m in a Malaysian ac c ount to earn better interest, for whic h purpose the third c heque was signed; 


 (b) 

 (c ) 

 (d) 

 he was subsequently told that the third c heque would take time to c lear and the exc hange rate would not be favourable; 

 shortly thereafter, Robert struc k a deal with Yong to purc hase RM2,059,600 in exc hange for US$542,000; and 

 Robert informed the plaintiff of the intended transfer of funds and the third c heque was signed, suggesting that the third c heque was signed after 6 January 2002. 

63     The plaintiff then submitted that in Suit No 28 of 2007 (“the 2007 suit”) where Robert’s trustee for his bankrupt estate sued Robert’s wife, Robert had alleged in an affidavit (filed on 14 May 2007) that the plaintiff was the c ause of his earlier bankruptc y. When the plaintiff took issue with this allegation, Robert withdrew it c laiming it was a mistake. This statement was erroneous – I note from the affidavit filed by Robert’s wife in the 2007 suit that this allegation was not made by Robert but by Robert’s wife in her affidavit). Ac c ording to the plaintiff, before 2006, Robert and Robert’s wife had been adjudged bankrupts in Bankruptc y Nos 4800 of 1986 and 3228 of 1986 respec tively by the same judgment c reditors. These bankruptc ies were however disc harged in 1995/1996. 

64     It was submitted by the plaintiff (without elaboration) that Robert had also refused to c ooperate with the plaintiff in the administration of their sister Daisy’s estate. Although this fac t was c ompletely irrelevant to this suit, the plaintiff’s submission also volunteered the information that Daisy’s bequest to Robert in her Will was dec lared void bec ause Robert’s wife had witnessed Daisy’s Will. 

65     Having read the affidavits for the 2007 suit (to whic h the defendant understandably objec ted in its c ounsel’s letter to the c ourt subsequent to the trial at [106] _infra_ ), I disagree with and rejec t the plaintiff’s submission that Robert lac ked c redibility and his AEIC should be rejec ted. On the c ontrary, there were no inc onsistenc ies in Robert’s testimony vis-a-vis his several affidavits filed in the 2005 suit and this suit, unlike the inc onsistenc ies between the plaintiff’s pleaded c ase and his evidenc e as highlighted earlier. 

**_The expert testimony_** 

66     As stated earlier (at [44]), eac h side had an expert witness of whom the other side was highly c ritic al. I start my review by looking at the testimony of the plaintiff’s expert. 

67     Pang (PW2) who is the sole-proprietor of his own firm (Handwriting and Doc ument Examiner) was instruc ted by c ounsel for the plaintiff to c onduc t a c omparative examination of the plaintiff’s signature in the third c heque with those in the first and fourth c heques and in DBS c heque no. 243345 for $20,000 with those in six other c heques issued by the defendant and in 28 c heques issued by Keppel Tat Lee Bank (hereinafter referred to c ollec tively as “the spec imen signatures”). Pang’s task was to determine whether the plaintiff signed the third c heque. 

68     Pang c arried out a mic rosc opic and mac rosc opic examination to assess the struc ture, features and writing quality of all the signatures followed by a c omparative examination of the similarities and differenc es between the signature in the third c heque and the spec imen signatures. 


69     While the plaintiff’s signature in the third c heque was pic torially similar to the spec imen signatures, Pang opined that there were seven differenc es between them as whic h result he c onc luded that the plaintiff did not write the signature in the third c heque. 

70     Both Pang’s c redentials and his report c ame in for heavy c ritic ism from the defendant in its c losing submissions. The defendant pointed out that unlike Yap who had 20 years’ experienc e in the field of forensic doc umentation, who had handled more than 3,900 c ases and testified in c ourt on more than 70 oc c asions as an expert witness, Pang only started two years of formal apprentic eship under one Chris Anderson in 2004 and rec eived c ertific ation as a forensic examiner in 2006. Therefore Pang had no more than three years’ experienc e as a c ertified forensic doc ument examiner. By his own admission during c ross-examination, the bulk of Pang’s experienc e was in graphology. Further, Pang c ontinued to be mentored by Chris Anderson in all aspec ts of doc ument examination and in his c asework. (Chris Anderson was originally sc heduled to be the plaintiff’s expert together with Pang by Order of Court dated 21 November 2008). 

71     The defendant c ritic ised as flawed Pang’s finding that the plaintiff’s signature on the third c heque was likely to be a forgery. Essentially, Pang’s methodology was to c ompare the spec imen signatures with that in the third c heque. The defendant c ontended that his seven differenc es between the spec imen signatures and that in the third c heque were in fac t within the range of natural variations of the plaintiff’s signatures and ac tually supported the defendant’s view that the plaintiff did sign the third c heque. Pang’s opinion was said to be not impartial. The c ourt was urged to disregard his report as the evidenc e to suggest forgery of the plaintiff’s signature in the third c heque was not c ogent enough. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to meet the requisite standard of proof to make out his c ase that his signature on the third c heque was forged. 

72     The plaintiff not surprisingly similarly c ritic ised the defendant’s expert Yap who had opined (in his first report) that it was highly probable that the writer of the 15 sample signatures he was given was the signatory in the third c heque. The plaintiff not only c omplained of Yap’s lac kadaisic al approac h to preparation and presentation in his reports (whic h c ontained no explanation of his methodology), but also attac ked his lac k of integrity for failing to disc lose that c ounsel for the defendant had given him a c opy of Pang’s first report to answer when Yap prepared his sec ond report. 

73     Yap was c ross-examined in great detail and the plaintiff’s c losing submissions dealt _in extenso_ on his non-disc losure. Counsel for the plaintiff alleged (at N/E 466) that Yap’s sec ond report was targeted at Pang’s report. Yap was further c ritic ised for his sc anty first report and for ac c epting at fac e value the 15 sample signatures of the plaintiff that were given to him by the defendant (five of whic h were extrac ted from letters while six were hardly c ontemporaneous) unlike Pang who gathered the spec imen signatures (all from c heques) himself in a professional manner. 

74     It was pointed out in the plaintiff’s submissions that during c ross-examination (at N/E 465), Yap had admitted that he brought up ten points in his sec ond report to disc redit Pang’s seven points and that was his “trump c ard”. The plaintiff therefore submitted that the omissions in Yap’s report were not “ac c idents” and his evidenc e should be viewed with suspic ion bec ause he was not an independent witness and lac ked impartiality. 

75     I should point out that in his sec ond report, Yap was given for c omparison with the signature in the third c heque, the spec imen signatures that Pang had extrac ted from 28 Keppel Tat Lee c heques o f the plaintiff. Conversely, in Pang’s sec ond report, he was given six of the 15 sample signatures relied on in Yap’s first report and whic h were identified by Yap as S1, S11 to S15. S1 was the defendant’s signature c ard signed by the plaintiff and Robert when the ac c ount was opened on 


10 May 1986 while the other sample signatures of the plaintiff c ame from five letters he had written to the defendant between 23 August 2005 and 9 February 2007. Both experts’ views remained unc hanged in their respec tive sec ond reports. 

76     Having gone to the trouble of c alling Pang as an expert witness, it was surprising to find (in para 178) the following passage in the plaintiff’s c losing submissions: 

 The plaintiff’s position remains that on the totality of the evidenc e, whether or not [the plaintiff’s] signature was forged on the [third] c heque is not relevant bec ause the [third] c heque was never presented and never used. The debiting of the Ac c ount was direc t – it was not based on the c heque. 

**The Issues** 

77     Based on the fac ts and the plaintiff’s pleaded c ase, the following issues arose for determination in this suit: 

 (a) Did the defendant breac h the mandate for the operation of the ac c ount (whic h required two signatories’ authority) when it ac c epted Robert’s instruc tions to c hange the mailing address from the property to Robert’s house? 

 (b) Did the defendant similarly breac h the mandate when it ac c epted the applic ation form signed by Robert for the purc hase of the bank draft and entered into the forex c ontrac t? 

 (c ) What was the basis of the forex c ontrac t? 

 (d) Was the plaintiff’s signature on the third c heque a forgery? 

 (e) If the defendant is liable to the estate for breac h of mandate, is it entitled to a c ontribution or indemnity from the plaintiff due to his negligenc e? 

**_The submissions_** 

78     Before I set out my findings, it would be useful to first look at the c losing submissions tendered by the parties. 

79     The defendant had relied on two c lauses of the Terms and Conditions governing the ac c ount in denying liability. The first was c l 7(b)(iii)(bb) whic h reads as follows: 

 Customer’s Duty 

 The c ustomer is under a duty: 

 to examine all debit and c redit entries in the Statement of Ac c ount and updated passbooks, statements, transac tion advic es, deposit advic es and rec ords (Transac tion Rec ords”) and to report any omission from or debits/c redits wrongly made or made without authority to or inac c urate entries in suc h Statement of Ac c ounts and/or Transac tion Rec ords. Unless the debit or c redit entries or omissions or any other inac c urac ies therein are objec ted to within 14 days after the c ustomer’s rec eipt of his Statement of Ac c ount or his Transac tion Rec ords, suc h entries made in the Statement of Ac c ount or Transac tion Rec ords shall be deemed c orrec t and shall be c onc lusive without further proof as against the c ustomer that suc h Statement of Ac c ount or Transac tion Rec ords c ontain all c redits that should be c ontained therein and no debits that 


 should not be c ontained therein and further the c ustomer shall be bound by the Statement of Ac c ount and the Transac tion Rec ords and the Bank shall be free from all c laims in respec t of any and every debit or c redit item shown in the Statement of Ac c ount and the Transac tion Rec ords. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bank reserves the right upon notic e to the c ustomer to add and/or alter the entries in the Statement of Ac c ount and Transac tion Rec ords in the event of inc orrec t or missing entries or amounts stated therein. 

80     The sec ond c lause relied upon by the defendant was c l 16; it reads: 

 No liability for loss 

 (a) the Bank shall not be liable for any loss, damage or expense suffered or inc urred by the c ustomer (whether as a result of c omputer breakdown, forgery of signatory’s signature, material alteration of withdrawal requests or other reasons of any kind whatsoever) through no fault of the Bank. 

 ... 

 (c ) If in any event desc ribed in paragraph (a) or (b) above the Bank has debited the c ustomer’s ac c ount in relianc e on a withdrawal or payment request on whic h the signature of the c ustomer or his authorised signature was forged, the Bank shall not be liable to reverse the debit or pay or c ompensate the c ustomer in respec t of the amount so debited. 

81     It was the plaintiff’s c ase that the defendant was not entitled to rely on c l 16 to exc lude its liabilit y bec ause it had breac hed the mandate for the ac c ount. The defendant however maintained that even if there was suc h a breac h (whic h it did not admit), the defendant was not liable, relying o n _London Intercontinental Trust Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd_ [1980] 1 Lloyds LR 241 (“ _London Intercontinental_ ”). 

82     In _London Intercontinental_ , the plaintiff c ustomer of the defendant bank c omplained that the latter ac ted in breac h of its mandate when it paid out on two c heques (totalling £195,000) that c ontained only the signature of one instead of two authorised signatories as required. Slynn J held the defendant was not liable as he found that Mr Ross the sole signatory of the two c heques had ac tual authority to direc t the transfer of the moneys. As suc h the defendant was entitled to ac t on the c heques drawn on his sole signature and those c heques were not invalidated by the fac t that the defendant had a mandate requiring two signatures. 

83     The defendantc ontended that Robert had ac tual authority from the plaintiff to transfer the sun of US$542,000 from the ac c ount to Yong; there was therefore no breac h of mandate. 

84     Moreover the defendant argued, the law required a high standard of proof for an allegation of forgery, fraud and/or c riminal c onduc t, c iting the Court of Appeal’s dec ision in _Yogambikai Nagarajah v Indian Overseas Bank_ [1997] 1 SLR(R) 258 (“ _Yogambikai_ ”) and this was reiterated in _Chua Kwee Chen, Lim Chah In v Koh Choon Chin_ [2006] 3 SLR(R) 469. 

85     In _Yogambikai_ , the appellant appealed against the trial judge’s dec ision in: (i) dismissing her c laim that her mandate signature was forged and that a letter to the respondent bank purportedly c ontaining her instruc tions to transfer moneys from her fixed deposit to one Valli’s ac c ount was not signed by her and that (ii) moneys held in her ac c ount with the respondent bank were held on trust for the benefit of Valli and Valli’s infant daughter. 


86     The appellant failed in her appeal. In affirming the judgment of the trial judge, the appellate c ourt opined that the more serious the allegation made by one party, the higher was the standard of proof it had to satisfy, following the UK Court of Appeal’s dec ision in _Hornal v Neuberger Products_ [1957] 1 QB 247. 

87     The defendant pointed out that the plaintiff had failed to disc harge the requisite high standard of proof set out in _Yogambikai_ for his allegation that his signature on the third c heque had been forged. 

88     The defendant c ontended (in para 269 of its c losing submissions) that the c hange of mailing address did not c ause the plaintiff to sign the fourth c heque or to suffer any loss. 

89     Not surprisingly, the plaintiff disagreed with the defendant. His c ounsel sought to distinguish _London Intercontinental_ from this c ase on the basis that there, even though the c heques bore only one signature (that of Mr Ross) when the mandate required two, there were letters sent to the defendant bank c onfirming the transac tions. That was why the c ourt found that Mr Ross had ac tual authority to transfer the sums of money. It was pointed out that Slynn J had opined (at p 249) that as a result of its failure to observe the disc repanc y, the defendant took a risk in honouring the c heque that Mr Ross was not in fac t authorised although ultimately the c ourt held he was. 

90     Here, in allowing the first draft to be issued, knowing full well that the mandate was not fulfilled, the defendant had indeed taken the risk upon itself that Robert was not authorised. After all, Ho had c onfirmed she was not aware of the purpose for whic h the first draft was required. 

91     Counsel for the plaintiff added that the defendant should not be allowed to rely on c l 7 of the Terms and Conditions set out at [84] above. She pointed out that the defendant’s submission meant that the c lause would apply even though the monthly statements were furnished to the plaintiff some two years after the transac tions. That ran c ounter to the plain meaning of the c lause that it would only apply to c urrent statements issued by the defendant and not to statements rec eived some years later as in this c ase. No objec tions were raised by the defendant to the plaintiff’s late c omplaints on the monthly statements nor did it plac e relianc e on c l 7 until three years later in the defendant’s letter dated 26 Oc tober 2006 (referred to at [25] above). In any event, the plaintiff’s rec ollec tion was that he had signed a c heque in the sum of $1m whilst the third c heque was for $995,112. Consequently, the plaintiff c ould not be c ritic ised for being c onfused or for not immediately reporting a fraud. 

92     The plaintiff’s c ounsel also argued that _Yogambikai_ did not apply as the c ourse of ac tion the defendant took was not justifiable. 

93     The plaintiff c ritic ised the defendant’s witness pointing out that Ho’s evidenc e was not helpful. The defendant failed to c all Ng, a more relevant witness, to testify. Neither did the defendant c all anyone to explain why the ac c ount’s mailing address was c hanged upon Robert’s sole signature in the request form. Bertilla Chea (see [28] was also not c alled to testify. The c ourt was asked to draw an adverse inferenc e against the defendant for its failure to c all witnesses other than Ho. 

94     I noted that the plaintiff’s submissions dealt exc lusively (apart from the expert testimony) on the defendant’s breac h of mandate as set out in [77](a), (b) without addressing the issue of the c onsequenc es that resulted from the defendant’s breac h (if it was found to be so liable). I shall return to this observation later. 

**The findings** 


_(i) Was there a breach of mandate in the change of mailing address without the plaintiff’s authority/consent?_ 

95     It is trite law that a bank must c omply stric tly with the terms of the mandate from its c ustomer. It was not disputed by the defendant that the ac c ount required the joint signatures of the plaint iff and Robert for its operation. Consequently, the defendant was in breac h of that joint mandate when it ac ted only on Robert’s sole signature in the request form dated 9 Oc tober 2001 to c hange the mailing address of the ac c ount from the property to Robert’s house. 

96     However, it bears remembering in this regard that the plaintiff did not return to Singapore until June 2002 whereas the property was sold in Oc tober 2001. Had Robert not c hanged the mailing address of the ac c ount to Robert’s house after the c ompletion of the sale of the property, the statements and c orrespondenc e relating to the ac c ount would have been returned to the defendant by the purc haser of the property or thrown away, unless Robert had requested (and the purc haser had agreed) that mail be forwarded to Robert’s house (whic h would mean the statements still ended up at Robert’s house). It was more likely than not that had he been asked by Robert, the plaintiff would have c onsented to the c hange of mailing address from the property to Robert’s house as they then had a good relationship. In any c ase, the plaintiff did not offer any alternative to Robert’s house as the new mailing address of the ac c ount after Oc tober 2001. 

97     The unauthorised c hange of mailing address was tied to the plaintiff’s c omplaint that had he rec eived the statements for the ac c ount, he would not have signed the fourth c heque. However, the fourth c heque for $300,000 was for the balanc e of Robert’s share of $1.3m of the sale proc eeds of the property. I fail to see the c onnec tion between the plaintiff’s non-rec eipt of the statements for the ac c ount due to the c hange of mailing address and his signing of the fourth c heque to settle Robert’s entitlement to a one-third share. Even before Oc tober 2001, the plaintiff was not rec eiving the monthly statements of the ac c ount as they were rec eived by Robert at the property. 

_(ii) Was the plaintiff’s signature on the third cheque forged?_ 

98     It is an established princ iple of law that the standard of proof required for forgery is very high (see _Yogambikai_ and restated in _Chua Kwee Chen, Lim Kah Nee and Lim Chah In v Koh Choon Chin supra_ [84]). I find that the plaintiff failed to disc harge the burden of proof in this regard. 

99     If indeed the plaintiff’s signature on the third c heque had been forged, s 24 of the Bills of Exc hange Ac t (Cap 23, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the BE Ac t”) bec omes relevant. The sec tion reads:

 Forged or unauthorised signature 

24\. —(1) Subjec t to the provisions of this Ac t, where a signature on a bill is forged or plac ed thereon without the authority of the person whose signature it purports to be, the forged or unauthorised signature is wholly inoperative, and no right to retain the bill or to give a disc harge t herefor or to enforc e payment thereof against any party thereto c an be ac quired through or under that signature, unless the party against whom it is sought to retain or enforc e payment of the bill is prec luded from setting up the forgery or want of authority. 

 (2) Nothing in this sec tion shall affec t the ratific ation of an unauthorised signature not amounting to a forgery. 

100    A forgery of the plaintiff’s signatures on any of the four c heques meant the defendant would have had no defenc e to the plaintiff’s c laim under the above sec tion of the BE Ac t. 


101    However, I disbelieve the plaintiff’s c laim (and rejec t Pang’s testimony in that regard) that he only signed one c heque _viz_ the first c heque and not the third or other two c heques on 6 January 

2002\. I find that the third c heque was signed by the plaintiff at Robert’s house that day together with the sec ond and fourth c heques. Seen in tandem with his fax to Robert dated 6 May 2002 set out at [17], the plaintiff had not only signed the third c heque but had expressly authorised Robert to enter into the forex transac tion with Yong. There c an be no other logic al c onc lusion this c ourt c an arrive at, based _not_ on the AEIC of Robert (whic h I was well aware was not tested by c ross-examination) but on the plaintiff’s own inc onsistent testimony observed earlier at [45] to [53]. 

102    Earlier (at [16]), I had c ommented on the plaintiff’s total silenc e in his AEIC on the signing of the fourth c heque. His only referenc e to the same was in para 9 of his statement of c laim where he pleaded that the defendant’s negligenc e c aused him to sign the fourth c heque. Not surprisingly, the defendant requested Further and Better Partic ulars of suc h a c ryptic pleading. However, the Partic ulars rendered by the plaintiff were singularly unhelpful. The plaintiff merely repeated his allegation that the mandate for the ac c ount required two signatures but the defendant ac ted only on Robert’s signature in c hanging the mailing address from the property to Robert’s house. No answer was provided on how the defendant’s breac h in this respec t c aused the plaintiff to sign the fourth c heque. 

_(iii) Was there a breach of mandate in the defendant’s acceptance of the application form without the plaintiff’s signature?_ 

103    A finding on this sec ond breac h nec essitates a rec apitulation of what transpired on 21 January 2009 as set out earlier a t [12] to [15]. Despite the defendant’s defenc e and submissions to the c ontrary, the applic ation form (ac c ording to Ho’s own testimony) required the signature of the plaintiff besides that of Robert. What is also c lear is the fac t that Robert had in his hand the third c heque signed in blank by the plaintiff. Robert wanted to use the third c heque to pay the defendant when he was informed by Ho that the applic ation form lac ked the plaintiff’s signature and c ould not therefore be proc essed for purposes of debiting the ac c ount for the c ost of purc hase of the first draft. Consequently, the third c heque should have been ac c epted in payment by the defendant and should have been reflec ted in the defendant’s January 2002 statement for the ac c ount. 

104    It is not disputed that the third c heque was not c leared by the defendant. Henc e, the plaintiff’s c omplaint that the defendant, despite rejec ting the applic ation form, nonetheless ac ted on the same and deduc ted the forex amount from the ac c ount, and thereby breac hed the mandate. The plaintiff’s submissions made muc h of the defendant’s omission in this regard and argued that its waiver of the requirement of the plaintiff’s signature amounted to a breac h of the mandate for the ac c ount and henc e, a breac h of c ontrac t. The plaintiff’s c omplaint was borne out by the ac c ount’s January 2002 statement. However, for the reasons that follow, the defendant’s breac h in this regard does not advanc e the plaintiff’s c ase. 

105    Inc identally, the plaintiff’s submissions had raised as an issue (at para 20[b]) whether the defendant had breac hed its mandate in entering into the forex c ontrac t. This issue however was not pleaded in the plaintiff’s statement of c laim or reply and will ac c ordingly be ignored. 

106    At this junc ture I need to digress. Counsel for the plaintiff had raised strenuous objec tions to the Reply submissions of the defendant on the Counterc laim c omplaining (in her letter dated 20 August 2009) that the same exc eeded the parameters of this c ourt’s direc tions on submissions. In partic ular, c ounsel asked that paragraphs 1-61 of the Reply submissions be disallowed arguing that the paragraphs amounted to a reply to the plaintiff’s submissions on his c laim for whic h the defendant had no right of reply. The plaintiff c ontended that the defendant c ould/should have addressed in its 


submissions filed on 20 July 2009, the issue of the forex c ontrac t as well as the plaintiff’s referenc e to doc uments not referred to at the trial. 

107    In response to the plaintiff’s solic itors’ c omplaint, c ounsel for the defendant pointed out that t he plaintiff did not deny that its c laim that the forex c ontrac t was unauthorised was not pleaded. The defendant ac c used the plaintiff of blatantly attempting to inc lude in its submissions a new and unpleaded c ause of ac tion in relation to the forex c ontrac t, not to mention that the plaintiff referred to affidavits that were never raised in examination-in-c hief, c ross-examination or re-examination nor related to this suit. It was obvious that the plaintiff’s tac tic in objec ting to paras 1-61 of the defendant’s reply submissions was to mask the lac una in his pleaded c ase. Consequently, his c ounsel’s objec tions are without merit and are hereby dismissed. 

_(iv) What was the basis of the forex contract?_ 

108    The plaintiff’s allegation of the forex c ontrac t being unauthorised even if pleaded, would not have suc c eeded bec ause it was c lear on the evidenc e (based on the two faxes he rec eived from Robert at [11] and his own fax to Robert at [17]) that the plaintiff knew of and had authorised the forex c ontrac t even though he did not sign the applic ation form. Consequently, the transac tion itself being authorised (as in _London Intercontinental_ ) it mattered not that the proc ess by whic h the transac tion was effec ted _viz_ by the applic ation form, was not signed by the plaintiff in ac c ordanc e with the mandate for the ac c ount. Nor did it matter that the defendant omitted to c lear the third c heque and instead (wrongly ac c ording to the plaintiff ) debited the sum of $995,112 to the ac c ount based on the applic ation form. It should be noted that the estate suffered no loss for whic h the defendant c an be liable – the forex c ontrac t for $995,112 was transac ted with the plaintiff’s knowledge and approval and the estate did rec eive in exc hange the equivalent sum of RM2,059,600. 

109    As I found earlier in [101] that the third c heque was indeed signed by the plaintiff, it would not be nec essary to address the expert testimony of the parties. 

110    However, in the event my findings on the plaintiff’s testimony are wrong, I would ac c ept the evidenc e of Yap in preferenc e to that of Pang, _viz_ that the third c heque was likely to have been signed by the plaintiff. Granted, the plaintiff’s c ritic ism of Yap’s c avalier and/or lac kadaisic al attitude was not without justific ation. Even so, notwithstanding whatever shortc omings in his first report and in his approac h to being a c ourt expert, Yap’s analysis of the plaintiff’s handwriting is to be preferred, despite Pang’s diligenc e and more professional approac h in gathering the spec imen signatures. The c ourt c annot overlook the fac t that Yap’s expertise and experienc e in forensic doc umentation far exc eeded that of Pang. 

111    I disagree with Pang’s opinion that the seven differenc es between the plaintiff’s signature in the third c heque and the spec imen signatures meant that the plaintiff did not sign the third c heque. I prefer Yap’s opinion that those differenc es were within the range of natural variations. 

112    In the light of my findings, it would not be nec essary to address the issue of whether the defendant would not have been liable to the plaintiff in any event based on c ll 7(b)(iii)(bb) and 16 of the Terms and Conditions governing the ac c ount. 

113    I have two observations to make before I c onc lude this judgment. First, although he repeatedly asserted his signatures in the third and fourth c heques were forged, the plaintiff was c areful not to identify the person who allegedly forged his signature. On the evidenc e, the alleged forger c ould only have been Robert if the allegation had been true whic h I find it was not. 


114    Sec ondly, the plaintiff never mentioned the fate of the HL ac c ount. Ac c ording to the defendant’s reply submissions (at para 121), Robert had unilaterally withdrawn moneys from the HL ac c ount after 21 January 2002. That would explain the plaintiff’s unhappiness with Robert and his disc laimer of knowledge of the HL ac c ount (whic h I disbelieve). The plaintiff’s allegation that his signature on the signature c ard for the HL ac c ount was forged was not established in any c ase as it was not c orroborated by Pang (see [56]). 

**Conclusion** 

115    Consequently, I dismiss the plaintiff’s c laim with c osts to the defendant to be taxed (on a st andard basis) unless otherwise agreed. In the light of my dismissal of the plaintiff’s c laim, the defendant’s c ounterc laim for a c ontribution from the plaintiff under s 15 of the Civil Law Ac t based on his negligenc e does not arise for c onsideration. The c ounterc laim is similarly dismissed with c osts whic h are fixed at $2,000, as no evidenc e was led on the c ounterc laim at all, the issue of c ontribution being a question of law.
