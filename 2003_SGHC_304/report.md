1       This was an appeal against the sentenc es imposed on the respondents, Poh Kim Video Pte Ltd (‘Poh Kim Video’), in respec t of five offenc es under s 136(2) of the Copyright Ac t (Cap 63, 1999 Rev Ed). At the end of the hearing before me, I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons. 

**Background facts** 

2       Poh Kim Video engage in the sale of video c assettes, c ompac t disc s, laser disc s, Video Compac t Disc s (‘VCDs’) and Digital Video Disc s at 33 outlets in Singapore. 

3       On 27 Dec ember 2001, private investigators were instruc ted by TS Laser Pte Ltd (‘TS Laser’) to c onduc t trap purc hases of a Korean drama series known as ‘Bad Friends’ (‘the drama series’) from Poh Kim Video. One box set of the drama series, c omprising 18 VCDs, was purc hased in eac h of the Poh Kim Video outlets at Junc tion 8 Shopping Centre, Northpoint Shopping Centre, Century Square, Suntec City Mall and Centrepoint. 

4       TS Laser then c ommenc ed a private prosec ution against Poh Kim Video for breac hes under s 136(2)(a) of the Copyright Ac t. 

**Charges** 

5       Five c harges were preferred against Poh Kim Video. The first c harge read as follows: 

 You, POH KIM VIDEO PTE LTD, ROC No. 198401906E of 53 Kim Keat Road #03-03 Mun Hean Building Singapore 328823, are c harged that you, on 27 Dec ember 2001 at 9 Bishan Plac e #04Junc tion 8 Shopping Centre Singapore 579837, at a time when c opyright subsists in the “BAD FRIENDS” series, did sell 18 VCDs of “BAD FRIENDS” VCDs whic h you knew or ought reasonably to know to be infringing c opies of the “BAD FRIENDS” series and you have thereby c ommitted an offenc e punishable under Sec tion 136(2)(a) of the Copyright Ac t, Cap 63 (1999 Revised Edition). 

6       Exc ept for the addresses of the outlets at whic h the trap purc hases were c onduc ted, the 


other four c harges were similarly framed. 

**The prosecution’s case** 

7       The prosec ution’s c ase at the trial below was that the c opyright in the drama series was owned by MBC Produc tion Co Pte Ltd (‘MBC’), the broadc asting station in South Korea whic h produc ed the drama series. MBC had granted Hwa Yae Multimedia International Trading Company (‘Hwa Yae’), a c opyright agent based in Asia, the sole and exc lusive rights in the series for the territory of Singapore for a period of three years c ommenc ing on 1 Dec ember 2001. 

8       In turn, Hwa Yae sub-lic ensed these rights to TS Laser with effec t from 1 Dec ember 2001. Thus, TS Laser owned the rights to distribute the drama series in Singapore as of 1 Dec ember 2001. The prosec ution submitted that the five box sets sold by Poh Kim Video on 27 Dec ember 2001 were infringing c opies of the drama series. 

**The defence** 

9       The c rux of Poh Kim Video’s defenc e was that the box sets of the drama series sold at their outlets with effec t from 13 Dec ember 2001 were legitimate parallel imports from Hong Kong. The defenc e took the position that Poh Kim Corporation Pte Ltd (‘Poh Kim Corporation’), a related c ompany of Poh Kim Video, had ac quired rights for the Hong Kong region from YSY Digital Entertainment Company Limited (‘YSY Digital’) as of 19 November 2001. Poh Kim Corporation had replic ated the drama series and had then sold the manufac tured box sets to Crest Oc ean (Hong Kong) Limited (‘Crest Oc ean’), a related c ompany of Poh Kim Video. Poh Kim Video had then ordered 1,000 box sets from Crest Oc ean and these box sets were imported into Singapore. 

**The decision of the magistrate** 

10     The magistrate who heard the c ase rejec ted Poh Kim Video’s defenc e of parallel import and held that this defenc e was ‘a sham and an exc use’. While the magistrate found that MBC had granted a lic enc e to Phoenix Satellite Television Co Limited (‘Phoenix Satellite’) for the Hong Kong region and Phoenix Satellite had in turn granted a distributorship lic enc e to YSY Digital, the lic enc e period ran from 1 January 2002 to 31 Dec ember 2004. Thus, in the month of Dec ember 2001, when the trap purc hases were made, YSY Digital did not have authority to grant Poh Kim Corporation distribution rights for Hong Kong. 

11     The magistrate found that the prosec ution had proven that c opyright for the drama series subsisted in favour of MBC and TS Laser. The five box sets were held to be infringing c opies of the drama series as Poh Kim Video did not have rights in the drama series as of 27 Dec ember 2001 when the trap purc hases were c onduc ted. The magistrate further held that Poh Kim Video knew that the box sets were infringing c opies. 

12     In sentenc ing Poh Kim Video, the magistrate made the following observations: 

 ...although there were 18 disc s in eac h set, the evidenc e showed that the series was sold on a box set basis at a fixed pric e of $39.90 per box. I therefore dec lined to follow the prosec ution’s invitation to c onsider the number of films or episodes in eac h box when sentenc ing, bec ause no evidenc e was led to show that the episodes were sold separately. For the purposes of sentenc ing under s 136(2) of the Copyright Ac t, I c onsidered eac h box an artic le rather than eac h episode an artic le. 


The magistrate took into ac c ount a number of mitigating fac tors and imposed a fine of $2,000 per c harge, for a total fine of $10,000. 

**The appeal** 

13     TS Laser appealed against the sentenc e imposed by the magistrate on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate and advanc ed two main c ontentions on appeal. 

14     First, TS Laser submitted that the magistrate had failed to take into ac c ount two aggravating fac tors whic h nec essitated that a higher fine be imposed. The first aggravating fac tor was Poh Kim Video’s abuse of the defenc e of parallel import at the trial below. This defenc e was said to be a mere sham as Poh Kim Video were aware that they had had no right to distribute the drama series in Singapore in Dec ember 2001. The sec ond aggravating fac tor was the fac t that Poh Kim Video’s infringement of c opyright was on a large sc ale. 

15     Sec ond, TS Laser c ontended that the magistrate erred in regarding eac h box set as an ‘artic le’ for the purposes of sentenc ing under s 136(2) of the Copyright Ac t. TS Laser was of the view that the c orrec t approac h would have been to regard eac h VCD as an ‘artic le’ and that Poh Kim Video should have been sentenc ed on the basis of 90 artic les, instead of five artic les. 

16     I shall now deal with these arguments in turn. 

**Whether the magistrate erred in failing to take into account Poh Kim’s abuse of the defence of parallel import** 

17     I was of the view that Poh Kim Video’s advanc ement of the defenc e of parallel import at the trial below c ould not be regarded as an aggravating fac tor. It would be wrong to penalise Poh Kim Video for raising this defenc e bec ause they had every right to do so. As I have previously held in c ases suc h as _Zeng Guoyuan v PP_ <span class="citation">[1997] 3 SLR 321</span>, while the sc andalous or reprehensible c onduc t of one’s defenc e may c onstitute an aggravating fac tor in c ertain c ases, an ac c used is entitled to raise any type of defenc e nec essary to his c ase, even if this defenc e is sc andalous or vexatious in nature. In _Zeng Guoyuan_ , I quoted with approval the following passage from Mohamed Azmi J’s judgment in _Ahmad Shah bin Hashim v PP_ [1980] 1 MLJ 77 at 86: 

 It is my c onsidered opinion that in a c riminal trial an ac c used person is entitled to put up any type of defenc e that he thinks nec essary and justified in order to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosec ution c ase, and the fact that such defence has not succeeded should not be taken against him in assessing sentence. [Emphasis added] 

18     I was of the view that the c onduc t of Poh Kim Video’s defenc e c ould not be said to be sc andalous. There was a marked disparity between the c onduc t of Poh Kim Video’s defenc e and the fac ts of _Zeng Guoyuan_. In _Zeng Guoyuan_ , the appellant displayed a wholly exc eptional c ontempt for the c ourt proc eedings by badgering witnesses, insinuating that the judge was biased and refusing to answer direc t questions from the c ourt on the relevanc y of his c ross-examination tac tic s. In the present appeal, no suc h c ontempt was shown. Indeed, there were doc uments to show that Poh Kim Video had the rights to distribute the drama series for the Hong Kong region at least with effec t from 1 January 2002. There was also evidenc e that Poh Kim Video had erroneously assumed that the lic enc e period in fac t c ommenc ed on 19 November 2001. 

19     Further, Poh Kim Video were entirely justified in raising the issue of parallel import as the burden lies on the prosec ution, in making out an offenc e under s 136(2) of the Copyright Ac t, to 


prove that an imported artic le whic h is alleged to be an infringing artic le is not a legitimate parallel import: _Highway Video Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[2002] 1 SLR 129</span> at 143. 

**Whether the magistrate failed to take into account the fact that Poh Kim’s infringement was on a large scale** 

20     TS Laser submitted that the fac t that Poh Kim Video owned a large number of retail outlets and sold infringing artic les in these outlets was an aggravating fac tor for the purposes of sentenc ing. TS Laser were of the view that the magistrate had assumed that Poh Kim Video were ‘honest businessmen’ simply bec ause they owned a large group of retail outlets. 

21     I was unc onvinc ed by TS Laser’s arguments in this regard. It appeared to me that they had in fac t misinterpreted the magistrate’s observations on this point. Having perused the magistrate’s grounds of dec ision c losely, I saw no merit to TS Laser’s c ontention that the magistrate regarded Poh Kim Video as honest purely on the basis that they owned a large retail c hain. It was evident from the magistrate’s grounds of dec ision that he simply drew a distinc tion between syndic ated pirates engaged in large sc ale c opyright infringement operations, on the one hand, and Poh Kim Video, whic h did in fac t own the c opyright for the series in Hong Kong with effec t from 1 January 2002, on the other. The magistrate also rightly took into ac c ount the fac t that the infringing period was brief and that with effec t from 1 January 2002, Poh Kim Video c ould have legitimately imported the series from Hong Kong by parallel import. 

22     In my view, the magistrate was c orrec t in holding that the c ulpability of Poh Kim Video was lower than that of c opyright pirates involved in syndic ated operations. There was simply no basis on the present fac ts for holding that the size of Poh Kim Video’s retail c hain should be regarded as an aggravating fac tor and I dec lined to do so. 

**Whether the magistrate erred in regarding each box set as an ‘article’ for the purposes of sentencing under s 136(2) of the Copyright Act** 

23     The c rux of TS Laser’s appeal was that the magistrate had erred in regarding eac h box set as an ‘artic le’ for the purposes of sentenc ing under s 136(2) of the Copyright Ac t. TS Laser submitted that the magistrate was bound to regard eac h VCD in the box set as an ‘artic le’, sinc e offenders have c onsistently been sentenc ed in relation to the number of infringing VCDs and not the number of box sets. TS Laser c ited _Lim Tai Wah v Highway Video Pte Ltd_ , MC, PSS 162/2001, an unreported dec ision dated 28 August 2001, to support this submission. 

24     TS Laser further argued that, using this approac h, the magistrate should have sentenc ed Poh Kim Video in respec t of 18 artic les for eac h of the five c harges, whic h worked out to a total of 90 artic les for the five c harges. It was submitted that, on this basis, Poh Kim Video were only sentenc ed to a fine of approximately $111 per artic le whic h was manifestly inadequate in light of sentenc ing benc hmarks whic h provide for a fine of between $400 and $600 per artic le. 

25     As TS Laser’s c ontentions c entred on the magistrate’s interpretation of s 136(2) of the Copyright Ac t, the relevant provision is set out below for c onvenient referenc e. 

 Sec tion 136(2) Copyright Ac t 

 A person who at a time when c opyright subsists in a work has in his possession or imports into Singapore any artic le whic h he knows, or ought reasonably to know, to be an infringing c opy of the work for the purpose of — 


 (a) selling, letting for hire, or by way of trade offering or exposing for sale or hire, the artic le; 

 (b) distributing the artic le for the purpose of trade, or for any other purpose to an extent that will affec t prejudic ially the owner of the c opyright in the work; or 

 (c ) by way of trade exhibiting the artic le in public , 

 shall be guilty of an offenc e and shall be liable on c onvic tion to a fine not exc eeding $10,000 for the artic le or for eac h artic le in respec t of whic h the offenc e was c ommitted or $100,000, whic hever is the lower, or to imprisonment for a term not exc eeding 5 years or to both. 

26     While no definition of ‘artic le’ is provided in the Copyright Ac t, it was evident from a plain reading of s 136(2) that an ‘artic le’ is any ‘infringing c opy of the work’. Taking this into ac c ount, I was of the view that there is nothing in the Copyright Ac t that prevents the c ourt from regarding a box set of a single drama series as an ‘artic le’ for the purposes of sentenc ing. I disagreed with TS Laser’s c ontention that the c ourt was bound to regard eac h VCD in the box set as an ‘artic le’. In light of the legislature’s dec ision not to provide a definition of ‘artic le’ in the Copyright Ac t, eac h c ase must be c onsidered on its own fac ts. This is a sensible approac h in light of present tec hnology, and TS Laser’s view that the c ourt is obliged to regard eac h VCD as an ‘artic le’ in all c ases was wholly untenable. 

27     The fallac y of TS Laser’s c ontention was evident when I c onsidered that a single drama series c ould be released in different versions. One version of the drama series might c onsist of 18 VCDs while another version might split up the same drama series into only five VCDs. If eac h VCD were viewed as an ‘artic le’, then different fines would be imposed for the same offenc e of c opyright infringement, depending wholly on the number of VCDs in the box set in question. For example, an offender would be sentenc ed in respec t of 18 artic les if the drama series happened to be split into 18 VCDs but only in respec t of five artic les if the drama series was reproduc ed on five VCDs. This has grave sentenc ing implic ations if the drama series was reproduc ed on 18 VCDs, an offender would fac e a maximum fine of $100,000 pursuant to s 136(2), whereas the same drama series reproduc ed on five VCDs would only attrac t a maximum fine of $50,000. I was of the view that suc h a result would be inc ongruous and unsatisfac tory. 

28     Further, TS Laser’s interpretation was problematic as it required the c ourt to sentenc e offenders based on the number of infringing VCDs in all c ases, regardless of the partic ular c irc umstanc es of eac h c ase. I was of the view that suc h an approac h would be entirely inappropriate in c opyright offenc es where two or more infringing works are c aptured on a single VCD. In suc h c ases, the c ourt would be bound to sentenc e the offender based on one artic le only and the maximum fine whic h c ould be imposed is $10,000. The c ourt’s hands should not be tied in suc h a manner, partic ularly sinc e developments in digital tec hnology have now made it possible for a single hard disk to c ontain hundreds of infringed works. 

29     On the fac ts of the present appeal, I was of the view that the magistrate did not err in c onsidering eac h box set as an ‘artic le’ when sentenc ing Poh Kim Video. The magistrate rightly took into ac c ount the fac t that the drama series was sold as a box set at a fixed pric e of $39.90 per box set and that the individual VCDs were not sold separately. I rejec ted TS Laser’s submission that 18 artic les were set out in eac h of the five c harges preferred against Poh Kim Video. I was of the view that there was nothing in the c harges whic h would prec lude the c ourt from regarding eac h box set as an ‘artic le’ on the present fac ts. 

**Whether the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate** 


30     Poh Kim Video were fined $2,000 per artic le. I noted that the c ourts have generally imposed sentenc es ranging from $400 to $600 per artic le in offenc es under s 136(2) of the Copyright Ac t: _Cherng Chiu Yung v Rahman bin Haji Omar_ , MA16/97/01, an unreported judgment dated 25 February 1997, and _PP v Chew Alleng_ , MA 248/1993/02, an unreported judgment dated 23 July 1997. In light of this, the fine imposed on Poh Kim Video c ould not be said to be manifestly inadequate. 

31     I therefore dismissed the appeal and upheld the total fine of $10,000 imposed by the magistrate. 

_Appeal dismissed._
