**Belinda Ang Saw Ean J:** 

1       The Plaintiff wife (“the Wife”) filed for divorc e on 16 July 2009 after 15 years of marriage to the Defendant husband (“the Husband”) on the grounds that he had behaved in suc h a way that she c ould not reasonably be expec ted to live with him. The Interim Judgment of Divorc e was granted on 6 Oc tober 2009, and the anc illary matters fell to be determined over five separate days of hearing. Orders relating to c ustody, c are, c ontrol of and ac c ess to the three c hildren of the marriage were made on 6 August 2010. Notably, at the hearing on 6 August 2010, the parties agreed to joint c ustody of the c hildren, with c are and c ontrol to the Wife, and an order in terms was duly granted. The Husband was given ac c ess to the c hildren within the framework of a defined set of liberal and flexible arrangements, to wit: 

 Dinner with the c hildren onc e a week during the weekdays; 

 Alternate weekends overnight from Friday 6 pm to Sunday 6 pm; 

 Half of the c hildren’s sc hool holidays with liberty to bring the c hildren overseas. In the event that an overseas holiday is intended, the [Husband] is to notify the [Wife] at least 14 days before the date of departure. In the event that the [Wife] intends to bring the c hildren overseas, the [Wife] is to notify the [Husband] at least 14 days before the date of departure. 

 Alternate public holidays, and 


 e. Any other ac c ess to be agreed between the [Wife] and the [Husband]. 

2       Orders on maintenanc e for the Wife and c hildren, and the division of the matrimonial assets were made on 22 Marc h 2011, and they inc luded the following matters: 

 (1) The Wife shall transfer all her rights, interest, and title in the property known as and situated at [address redac ted] (“the DDD property”) to the Husband. The Husband shall pay for the outstanding monthly mortgage repayments towards the disc harge of the mortgage loans sec ured on the DDD property. The Husband shall bear the c osts and expenses relating to the aforesaid transfer. 

 (2) The Husband shall transfer all his rights, title, and interest in the property known as [address redac ted] (“the MMM property”) to the Wife. The Wife shall pay for the outstanding monthly mortgage repayments towards the disc harge of the mortgage loan sec ured on the MMM property. The Wife shall bear the c osts and expenses relating to the aforesaid transfer. The moneys withdrawn from the Husband’s CPF Ac c ount are not refundable to the Husband or to the Husband’s CPF Ac c ount upon transfer of the Husband’s share of the MMM property to the Wife. 

 (3) The Wife shall transfer all her rights, interest, and title in the property known as [address redac ted], Malaysia (“the [Malaysian] property”) to the Husband. The Husband shall bear the c osts and expenses relating to the aforesaid transfer. 

 (4) Both parties are to c lose the following joint investment/bank ac c ounts and there shall be no distribution of moneys, if any, left in the following ac c ounts:

 (5) Eac h party is to retain all other assets in his or her respec tive sole names. 

 (6) The [Husband] shall pay maintenanc e to the [Wife] in the sum of $8,400.00 a month whic h sum is to be deposited into the Wife’s DBS ac c ount no [xxxxxxxxx]. The first payment is to be made on 1 April 2011. A breakdown of the said sum of $8,400.00 is as follows: 

 (i) the sum of $2,500.00 for the Wife’s personal expenses; 

 (ii) the sum of $900.00 for the personal expenses of the c hildren; 

 (iii) the sum of $5,000.00 for the household expenses, whic h inc lude the purc hase of groc eries, expenses for the maid and the c ar. 


 (7) In addition, the [Husband] shall pay to the [Wife] (and not on a reimbursement basis) the c hildren’s expenses in relation to their educ ation, insuranc e polic ies and weekly poc ket money. 

3       The Husband has appealed against the Orders made on 22 Marc h 2011. I now publish the reasons for my dec isions on maintenanc e and division of the matrimonial assets. 

**Background facts** 

4       The parties were married on 19 January 1994 and were divorc ed 15 years later. They are both presently 45 years of age. Their son [E] is 16 years old, and their two daughters, [F] and [G] are respec tively 13 and 8 years old (“the Children”). 

5       The Wife has a diploma in Building and Quantity Surveying from Singapore Polytec hnic. For the first five years of the marriage, she worked full-time as a quantity surveyor and projec t manager. From 1999 until the marriage ended in 2009, the Wife was a full-time homemaker, and she was financ ially dependent on the Husband. The Husband is a shareholder and the Managing Direc tor of his family c ompany known as [OO] Pte Ltd (“OO”). He c laimed to be drawing a net monthly salary of $9,100, and that he was able to meet his monthly expenses with personal loans from his mother, and OO. The Husband also rec eived additional inc ome from his investments. He c laimed that OO dec lared a one-time dividend payment and that was in November 2008. 

6       During the marriage, the Husband gave the Wife supplementary c redit c ards issued by various financ ial institutions suc h as Americ an Express, OCBC, POSB, ABN AMRO, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank and the Royal Bank of Sc otland. Ac c ording to the Wife, she would be told by the Husband whic h supplementary c ard to use to pay the bills and expenses of the household and family. The Husband did not dispute the Wife’s evidenc e in general save that he c onfirmed that she usually made used of three supplementary c redit c ards and that all the c redit c ards were c anc elled in July 2009. During the marriage, at different periods of time, the Wife rec eived monthly payments from three sourc es: (a) a business known as [PP], the sum of $4,000; (b) a business known as [QQ], the sum of $3,000 and (c ) rental of $3,200 from the MMM property. I will elaborate on these rec eipts in [30] below. 

**The matrimonial assets** 

7       The parties have three real properties that they hold as joint tenants, and these form the bulk of the matrimonial assets. Firstly there is the DDD property, a semi-detac hed house that was purc hased in 1994 for $1.74m and it had apprec iated in value to about $2.85m at the time of the hearing. This was the matrimonial home. Sec ondly, there is the MMM property, a ground floor apartment, whic h was purc hased in 1995 for $943,000 and valued at $1.85m at the time of the hearing. Lastly, the parties have the Malaysian property in Port Dic kson with an agreed value of 

$32,866.46. [note: 1] Besides the above, the parties also have in their joint names several bank and investment ac c ounts, but these have a total negative value of -$14,939.70. 

8       The Husband’s disc losed assets were as follows: a 20% share in a property known as [address redac ted] (hereafter referred to as “One Jervois”) that he c o-owned with his brother, shares, various insuranc e polic ies, his CPF moneys and several other bank ac c ounts. As mentioned earlier, the Husband is a shareholder of OO, a private family c ompany started by the Husband’s parents in 1984. I agreed with the Husband’s c ounsel, Ms Bernic e Loo (“Ms Loo”), that the OO shares were not a “matrimonial asset” within the meaning of s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed). The OO shares were ac quired before marriage and were not improved upon by the Wife. They were therefore rightly exc luded from the pool of matrimonial assets. The total value of the Husband’s 


disc losed assets was $729,545.74. [note: 2] However, the Husband has an outstanding tax liability of $69,188.85 arising from his share of the taxable profits derived from the sale of the Queen Astrid Park property in 2006. Therefore, the total net value of assets in the Husband’s name was $660,356.89. 

9       It is a c onvenient junc ture to mention that the personal bank ac c ount balanc es disc losed by the Husband did not appear to be supported by his version of the evidenc e. The Husband c laimed that he had $13,565.88 in his Standard Chartered c urrent ac c ount and $23.61 in his Citibank Ready 

Credit ac c ount as at July 2009. [note: 3] There were negligible or negative values in all the bank ac c ounts that he held jointly with the Plaintiff, and the balanc es gave the appearanc e that the Husband had extremely low c ash reserves at his disposal. The Husband said that his monthly expenses amounted to $23,517, and to defray these he rec eived loans from his mother and later advanc es from OO. By way of explanation, the Husband c laimed that he rec eived payments of $12,000 twic e a month from OO; the total of $24,000 c omprising firstly his salary of $9,100 and a sec ondly a loan of $14,900. This alleged loan had been provided by his mother through OO sinc e 

2005\. In c onnec tion with the loan from his mother, in his 1st Affidavit, the Husband stated that the monthly loan was $14,000 and exhibited one bank statement in support of his c ontention. In doing so, he suggested that he was still rec eiving the monthly loan from his mother in 2009. I noted that the 

Husband had exhibited _only one_ bank statement in support of these bimonthly payments [note: 4] , whic h showed one payment of $12,000 at the end of June 2009, and another payment of $12,000 at the beginning of July 2009; rather than two payments of $12,000 within the same month. In short, the doc umentary evidenc e did not support the Husband’s story. The logic al inferenc e is that he must have other undisc losed ac c ounts elsewhere, and the disc repanc y suggested that the Husband’s net worth was arguably more than the total amount disc losed in his affidavits. Quite unexpec tedly, the 

Husband in his 3rd Affidavit modified his earlier affidavit evidenc e to c laim that the loan was $14, and not $14,000 and that sinc e the year 2007/2008, he had stopped borrowing from his mother, and 

instead borrowed the same sum of $14,900 from OO direc tly. [note: 5] I will elaborate further on the loans in [42] below. 

10     The Wife’s disc losed assets were as follows: shares, a motor c ar, her CPF moneys, several bank and investment ac c ounts and some insuranc e polic ies. She also holds two fixed deposit ac c ounts jointly with her mother. Unlike the Husband, the Wife has no outstanding liabilities, and the total value of assets in her name was $822,422.03 in 2009. 

**The parties’ positions on division** 

11     The Husband’s position on division of the matrimonial assets was c onsistent throughout the hearings. He wanted the MMM property sold and to apply the sale proc eeds in the following manner: 

 (a) To repay the outstanding housing loan; 

 (b) To refund the moneys withdrawn from both the Wife and the Husband’s CPF Ac c ounts plus ac c rued interest; 

 (c ) To pay the c osts of and inc idental to the sale of the MMM Property, and 

 (d) The available balanc e of the sale proc eeds is to be divided in the proportion of 30% to the Wife and 70% to the Husband. 

12     As for the other assets in joint names and the assets in the respec tive names of the Husband and the Wife, the Husband’s position was that a division in the ratio of 80:20 in favour of the Husband 


was fair and equitable. Finally, he wanted the Wife’s name removed as a named benefic iary from his AXA insuranc e polic y no [xxxxxxxxx]. 

13     Unlike the Husband, the Wife’s position on division of the matrimonial assets went through several rounds of c hange, starting with the position outlined in the Fac t and Position Sheet and repeated in the Skeletal Submissions tendered by the Wife’s c ounsel, Mr Koh Tien Hua (“Mr Koh”), on 6 August 2010. Initially, the Wife asked for a just and equitable division of the matrimonial home based on her indirec t c ontributions to the marriage and family inc luding looking after the home. As for the MMM property, there was no dispute that the Wife withdrew a princ ipal amount of $110,326. from her CPF Ac c ount towards the ac quisition of the MMM property. However, the Husband disputed her allegations that she had in the c ourse of the marriage maintained and paid for the repairs to the property inc luding the efforts she allegedly made to rent out the property. In relation to the MMM property and the other matrimonial assets in the names of the Husband, the Wife wanted a share based on a just and equitable division. The Husband was willing to transfer his share in the Malaysian property to the Wife as part of the division of matrimonial assets without selling it. 

14     At the adjourned hearing on 16 September 2010, Mr Koh brought up the Wife’s proposal: that eac h party should be given one property. In other words, the Wife would keep the MMM property and the DDD property would go to the Husband. Mr Koh explained that the Wife’s proposal for a “swap” was just and equitable in the c irc umstanc es bearing in mind her direc t financ ial and non-financ ial c ontributions to the ac quisition and maintenanc e of the MMM property, her indirec t c ontributions as a homemaker to the marriage, family and c are of the home as well as her c ontributions to the businesses of PP and QQ. The tenanc y on the MMM property would expire in 2012, and the Wife’s idea was to utilise the rental to pay for rented ac c ommodation for her and the Children until the expiry of tenanc y in 2012. At the adjourned hearing on 16 September 2010, the Wife’s stand as advanc ed by Mr Koh was that the Husband had not ac c ounted for $600,000 of the profits derived from the sale of the property at Queen Astrid Park and that sum should, therefore, be inc luded in the pool of assets for division. The Wife rec koned that she should be awarded 30% of the sale proc eeds of $600,000. T he Wife wanted the Malaysian property sold and be given 50% of the sale proc eeds. As for the property known as One Jervois, Mr Koh pointed out that in the absenc e of doc umentary evidenc e to support the Husband’s c laim that his share in the property was only 20%, and working from the basis of his ownership of 100%, the Wife should be granted 30% of the value of One Jervois after deduc tion of the outstanding loan. Finally, eac h party was to retain the assets held in their respec tive names. Assets held on behalf of the Children were to be exc luded from the pool of assets. 

15     At the adjourned hearing on 30 November 2010, Ms Loo c onfirmed that One Jervois had been sold and the Husband’s share of the sale proc eeds was only $404,273.29 based on his 20% c o

ownership of the property. [note: 6] At the same hearing, Mr Koh informed the c ourt of the Wife’s revised position: that in exc hange for the MMM property, (a) the Wife would take over the outstanding mortgage loan and the Husband would have to refund the moneys withdrawn from his CPF Ac c ount together with interest from his own resourc es; and (b) she would give up her c laim to the DDD property inc luding her c laims in respec t of the $600,000 profits derived from the sale of the property at Queen Astrid Park and the $404,273.29 derived from the sale of One Jervois. However, the Wife still wanted 30% of the moneys in the Husband’s bank ac c ounts. Mr Koh also advised that the Wife would not c laim against the insuranc e polic ies in the Husband’s name. As for assets in the Wife’s name, Mr Koh advised that the Wife wanted to retain them. 

16     At the adjourned hearing on 22 February 2011, Mr Koh c onfirmed the Wife’s final position on the division of matrimonial assets. For the MMM Property, the Wife would pay the outstanding mortgage without a refund of the moneys withdrawn from the Husband’s CPF Ac c ount or the c orresponding ac c rued interest. In return, she would also forgo her c laims for a share of (a) the DDD property; (b) 


the profits of about $600,000 derived from the sale of the Queen Astrid property (c ) the sum of $404,273.29 the Husband obtained from the sale proc eeds of One Jervois; (d) the bank and investment ac c ounts listed under “(B) Defendant’s Assets” item 4 of Tab 1 to the Defendant’s written submissions filed on 6 August 2010; and (e) the sum of $174,000 provided by the Husband’s father for t he purc hase of the DDD property. Eac h party would keep the polic ies in their respec tive names as well as moneys in their CPF Ac c ounts as at August 2009. Mr Koh c larified that if the Husband dec ided to refund to his CPF Ac c ount the moneys whic h he withdrew to ac quire the MMM property and the c orresponding ac c rued interest, the Husband would have to refund these sums from his own financ ial resourc es. 

**Section 112 of the Women’s Charter** 

17     Sec tion 112 of the Women’s Charter provides for the c ourt to divide matrimonial assets upon divorc e in a just and equitable manner. The legislation c onfers a wide disc retion on the c ourt dealing with the division of matrimonial assets. The c ourt will c onsider the fac tors listed in s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter, and “a multi-fac torial approac h” to division based broadly on the fac tors relevant to the c ase is usually undertaken (per Andrew Phang JA in _Pang Rosaline v Chan Kong Chin_ <span class="citation">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 935</span> (“ _Pang Rosaline_ ”) at [23]. 

18     It is c onvenient to now set out the relevant provisions of s 112(2): 

**112. (2) ..**. 

 2) It shall be the duty of the c ourt in dec iding whether to exerc ise its powers under subsec tion (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, inc luding the following matters: 

 (a) the extent of the c ontributions made by eac h party in money, property or work towards ac quiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets; 

 ... 

 (d) the extent of the c ontributions made by eac h party to the welfare of the family, inc luding looking after the home or c aring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party; 

19     The c ourt will dec ide on the weight to be given to any one fac tor. Nowadays, it is c ommon that both parties work, and the financ ial responsibilities are shared together with c aring for the Children a n d home. Eac h c ase is fac t-spec ific espec ially as to the degree of the shared responsibilities between the spouses. However, where the husband earned the money and the wife looked after the home and the Children, there should be no bias in favour of the working spouse against the homemaker. This is c lear from Phang JA’s observations in _Pang Rosaline_ at [23] where he emphasised that a party’s direc t financ ial c ontribution to any partic ular matrimonial asset is not _prima facie_ determinative of how the asset is to be divided, and that indirec t c ontributions, whic h c annot be asc ribed a monetary value, c an be ac c orded as muc h or even more weight than financ ial c ontributions if so warranted on the fac ts in evidenc e. Sec tion 112(2)(d) is partic ularly important for the homemaker whose c ontributions are likely to be to the welfare of the family, inc luding looking after the home or c aring for the family. To illustrate, I refer to _Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy_ <span class="citation">[2011] 2 SLR 1157</span> (“ _Yeo Chong Lin_ ”). In that c ase, the direc t financ ial c ontributions were made by the husband while the indirec t non-financ ial c ontributions were made by the wife. The husband also paid for the expenses of the family and the Children’s educ ation overseas. The appellate c ourt did not 


disturb Judith Prakash J’s finding that the wife c ontributed to the family and the marriage to the best of her ability by taking on the roles of homemaker and mother. Prakash J viewed the matrimonial assets on a global basis and divided the assets to the wife and the husband in proportions of 35: respec tively. The Court of Appeal c ommented that “35% of a large pool of matrimonial assets would be [just] to a spouse whose c ontributions were all in the domestic sphere” (at [82] of the judgment). Again in _Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah_ <span class="citation">[2007] SGCA 21</span>, the homemaker wife did not make direc t c ontributions to the assets ac quired by the husband. The wife’s c laim was based on her c ontributions to the welfare of the family. The c ourt rec ognised the importanc e of non-financ ial c ontributions to the welfare of the family and noted that s 112(2)(d) of the Women’s Charter obliges the c ourt to take into ac c ount the extent of the c ontributions made by eac h party to the welfare of the family, inc luding looking after the home or c aring for the family. 

**Considerations** 

20     In the present c ase, the Wife was a homemaker although she worked before F was born. Typic ally as was the c ase here, the working spouse would have c ontributed to the bulk of the assets. As the working spouse, the Husband provided financ ially for the family. One salient feature of the marriage was the inc lusion of the Wife’s name in the titles to the properties to whic h she had made no direc t financ ial c ontributions. Apart from the MMM property where she c ontributed financ ially to the ac quisition of the property, the Husband permitted the Wife’s name to be inc luded as a joint tenant to the DDD property. He had also permitted her name to be inc luded as a joint tenant to the Malaysian property when she was his fianc ée. There were bank ac c ounts and investment ac c ounts that were held jointly by the parties. It was not disputed that the Wife did not c ontribute financ ially to these 

ac c ounts. I noted that the Husband explained in his 3rd Affidavit at paragraph 246 that he had “inc luded her name bec ause [he] loved her, she was [his] wife and [he had] wanted her to feel ‘inc luded’”. In the c ontext of the fac tual matrix in the present proc eedings, the Husband’s c onduc t as exemplified by his c ommitment to joint ownership was c lear evidenc e of his position that the properties were matrimonial property for the benefit of the union and the family. 

21     At the hearings of the anc illary matters, the Husband’s stand on what would be a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets suffered from an over-emphasis of his financ ial c ontributions, and he attempted to downplay the Wife’s indirec t c ontributions to the marriage and family. Muc h of the debate was on the parties’ level of indirec t c ontributions to welfare of the Children. I will examine the evidenc e and arguments later under the heading of “Indirec t Contributions”. Suffic e it to say, the Wife’s final proposal merited sc rutiny to see if it c ould measure up to a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets. I should explain at the outset that the detailed narrative of the Wife’s different proposals above was not intended to suggest a weakening of her position after eac h adjournment. Rather, the Wife’s final proposal was foc used on the one property where she saw the evidenc e to be most advantageous to her c ase. There was nothing wrong with this stratagem as it was sensible. Needless to say, had the final proposal c rystallised sooner, it would have reduc ed the number of hearings, spared the parties some emotional distress and saved them some time and c osts. 

**_Financial contributions towards the acquisition of the real properties_** 

22     The DDD property was purc hased after the parties were married in 1994 for $1.74m and its 

value has sinc e apprec iated to about $2.85m. [note: 7] The Husband’s father had c ontributed 

$174,000 or 10% of the purc hase pric e in 1994 as down payment for the house. [note: 8] Although the Husband c laimed that this was a loan, it was not his c ase that his father had demanded repayment. However, if the property was to be sold, the Husband wanted the father’s loan to be repaid. Initially, 


the Wife argued that the $174,000 was a gift to the married c ouple, and through this gift, she c laimed her financ ial c ontribution to the purc hase of the property. However, she later dropped this c laim in the light of her proposal for the properties to be swapped. Moving on to the enc umbranc es, there are two substantial outstanding mortgages amounting to $1,603,217.15 taken out on the property, bringing its net value to $1,246,782.85. One of the mortgages was for a sum of $700,000 to c over the Husband’s Forex losses in 2008. The DDD property was thus used as c ollateral for $700, 

of the Husband’s investment losses. The monthly mortgage of $9,261.36 [note: 9] was paid from an ac c ount in the parties’ joint names, but it was not disputed that the Wife did not make any c ontributions to this joint ac c ount. The Wife had made no financ ial c ontribution to the ac quisition of the DDD property. 

23     The Husband made two broad arguments: The first was that sinc e the Wife would ordinarily benefit from the investment gains, she should likewise be responsible for the investment losses. Ac c ordingly, as the argument developed, the Wife should bear part of the Husband’s Forex losses or the outstanding liabilities under the sec ond mortgage. I did not c onsider the Husband’s argument as valid and meritorious. The Wife was a homemaker sinc e 1999 and was financ ially dependent on the Husband. As the Husband was the sole breadwinner, it fell on the Husband to take on the financ ial responsibility of taking c are of the needs of the family and household as well as to financ e the purc hases that now represent the bulk of the assets. I did not think that upon termination of the marriage, the family arrangement that had prevailed over the last 15 years should suddenly c hange in suc h a way as to make the Wife pay for her share of the investment losses sustained during the marriage. The sec ond argument related to the Wife’s indirec t c ontributions to the marriage and family. To the Husband, the Wife’s indirec t c ontributions were not signific ant bec ause she always had a maid to help with the c are of the Children and the home, and that in rec ent years the Wife neglec ted the family and home after she befriended a medium, Anna. Therefore, her share of the DDD property should not be more than 20% whic h to the Husband was a generous division. I will deal with this sec ond argument in the subsequent sec tion headed “Indirec t c ontributions” (see [32] below). 

24     The MMM property was purc hased in 1995 for a sum of $943,000. At the time of the hearing, the market value of the property had more than doubled and was worth $1.85 million. There was an out st anding mortgage of $108,676.02, whic h meant that the net value of the property was 

$1,741,323.98. The down payment of $94,300 was from the Husband’s father. [note: 10] Like in the earlier loan, it was not the Husband’s c ase that his father had demanded repayment of the money. However, he wanted the property sold. In the event, the father’s loan had to be repaid from the sale proc eeds. Initially, the Wife again argued that the $94,300 was a gift to the married c ouple. However, she later dropped this c laim in the light of her property swap proposal. Now, in respec t of this property, both parties had c ontributed financ ially to its ac quisition. The princ ipal amount withdrawn from the Wife’s CPF Ac c ount was $110,326.35. In Husband’s c ase, the princ ipal amount withdrawn from his CPF Ac c ount was $328,136.67. The Husband made c apital repayments totalling $370, [note: 11] by utilising part of the profits derived from the sale of the Queen Astrid Park property whic h 

Ms Loo ac c epted was a matrimonial asset. 

25     In relation to the MMM property, the Husband said that the Wife’s share of the net sale proc eeds should be 30% given her financ ial and non-financ ial c ontributions. 

26     The Malaysian property was purc hased in 1993, and the Husband paid 100% of the purc hase pric e for this property. At the time of the hearing, it was worth $32,866.46. The Wife’s proposal to swap the properties did not spec ific ally c over the Malaysian property. In short, the last time it was raised was at the adjourned hearing of 16 September 2010 where Mr Koh submitted that the Wife wanted the Malaysian property sold and that she should be given 50% of the sale proc eeds. 


Presumably, her position remained the same throughout the proc eedings. 

27     The Husband rec eived a windfall when his 2006 investment with two friends in a new property at Queen Astrid Park returned a handsome profit of $931,713 for the Husband. With his profit of $931,713, he made a c apital repayment of $370,000 to reduc e the mortgage of the MMM property. He then used $310,000 as down payment for One Jervois. I pause here to c omment on the Wife’s c ontention that the Husband’s interest in One Jervois was not 20% as there was no doc umentary proof of his shareholding. In my view, there was no evidential basis for the Wife’s c ontention. The Husband exhibited a letter from his c onveyanc ing lawyer dated 28 Oc tober 2008 c onfirming his 20% 

interest as tenants in c ommon with his brother who held the remaining 80%. [note: 12] I should also mention Ms Loo’s c onfirmation that One Jervois had been sold and that the Husband’s share of the sale proc eeds was $404,273.29 (see [15] above). Another c ontention was over the Husband’s c laim that he utilised $50,000 of the profits to buy the Wife’s c ar. In any c ase, the rest of the money ( _ie_ , $201,713) was apparently invested through the DBS Vic kers investment ac c ounts and Saxo Bank investment ac c ounts. In the property swap proposal, Mr Koh c onfirmed that the Wife would drop her c laim for division of this One Jervois sale proc eeds, and the sum of $201,713 that the Husband had invested through the DBS Vic kers investment ac c ounts and Saxo Bank investment ac c ounts. Likewise, I would imagine that the remaining $50,000, whether it was spent on the c ar or not, would also not be an issue. 

**_Indirect contributions_** 

28     The Wife had left her c areer as quantity surveyor and building projec t manager in 1999 to take on the roles of a full time homemaker, a parent and c aregiver to the Children. During the marriage, the Wife would do the marketing and shop for groc eries, c ook for the family, and drive the Children to and from their sc hool and ac tivities. Although there was a full-time maid, the Wife said she supervised the 

maid to ensure that the household ran smoothly. [note: 13] 

29     In the c ourse of the marriage, the Wife assisted the Husband in two business ventures. In one venture, she was registered as the sole proprietor of PP, and the Husband was the registered proprietor of QQ. Both businesses were joint enterprises between the Husband and Wife: he brought in the business and she satisfied the administrative needs of the business. The parties argued on who between the two of them provided the start up c ost of $10,000. Be that as it may, in my view, PP and QQ were businesses generated by the joint efforts of the parties for the benefit of the marriage and family. The Wife admitted that the monthly drawings of $4,000 from PP were used for “their 

expenses”. The monthly drawings of $3,000 from QQ were put aside as “their savings”. [note: 14] The Wife appeared to have c orrec ted her evidenc e in a later affidavit to state that the money she 

rec eived from PP and QQ were used only for household expenses. [note: 15] 

30     Ac c ording to the Husband, the Wife’s evidenc e on the monthly drawings was misleading. He argued that the Wife never at one time rec eived monthly allowanc es from both businesses. The monthly allowanc e from PP was paid between 2004 and 2006. In the first year, the monthly allowanc e was about $3,000 but it subsequently inc reased to $4,000 monthly. The Husband said that PP c eased to c arry on business in 2006. As for QQ, the business was set up in 2006. Between 2006 and 2007, the Wife was paid a monthly figure of $3,000 by QQ until it stopped trading in 2007. In response, the Wife disputed the Husband’s c laim that PP c eased business in 2006. She was able to produc e invoic es 

to prove that PP was still c arrying business as late as August 2008. [note: 16] Furthermore, she only stopped rec eiving monthly allowanc e from QQ in January 2008, and not in 2007 as alleged by the Husband. The evidenc e supported the Wife’s c laim in that she was able to show from invoic es that 


QQ was still doing business in May 2008. [note: 17] I did not think that the c onflic ting evidenc e was material. 

31     In my view, the material evidenc e the Husband gave was the sourc e of the $50,000 invested in the Queen Astrid Park property. Out of this $50,000, a sum of $42,000 c ame from the ac c ount of PP. [note: 18] This fac t was signific ant as the Husband utilised part of the huge profit he made from the 

Queen Astrid Park property to make c apital repayments totalling $370,000 in two tranc hes ( _ie_ , 

$200,000 in 2006 and $170,000 in 2008 [note: 19] ) towards reduc ing the loan the parties had taken to ac quire the MMM property. In this regard, the $42,000 represented funds from the joint enterprise, _viz_ PP that was invested by the Husband, and the windfall derived from the investment enabled the c apital repayments to be made. In this regard, the c apital repayments were trac eable to the $42, that c ame from the Wife’s indirec t c ontribution to the joint enterprise and was thus relevant and should not be ignored. 

32     To the Husband, the Wife’s indirec t c ontributions were not substantial bec ause she always had a full-time maid to help with the c are of the Children and the home, and that in rec ent years the Wife neglec ted the family and home after her assoc iation with a medium, Anna. This allegation of neglec t was denied by the Wife who maintained that Anna was not a medium but was the c hairperson of Wat 

Samnak Poh Pu Lersi Na Lai, a c haritable organisation. [note: 20] I make three points. 

33     Firstly, I rejec ted as unsustainable the argument that the Wife was assisted by a full-time maid as a reason to diminish the Wife’s indirec t c ontributions to the marriage, c are of the household and well being of the family. The evidenc e before me did not bear out the Husband’s c laim. This was a 15 year marriage with three Children. The Husband’s argument ignored the Wife’s parental responsibilities towards the Children. In the words of Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) in _Lee Chung Meng Joseph v Krygsman_ <span class="citation">[2000] 3 SLR(R) 965</span> at [41] (and approved by the Court of Appeal in _Pang Rosaline_ at [18]), “[h]aving a maid in the household, or a number of maids for that matter, does not mean abdic ation of parental responsibility towards the c hild”. Furthermore, by the husband’s own 

evidenc e, he admitted to the Wife’s supervision of the Children before their sc hool examinations. [note: 21] He ac c epted that the Wife did the marketing and shopped for groc eries but she was ac c ompanied 

by the Husband and these ac tivities stopped two years ago ( _ie_ , these ac tivities stopped in 2008 sinc e 

the Husband’s affidavit was filed in 2010). [note: 22] The Wife disputed the Husband’s c laim. 

34     Sec ondly, I noted that the Wife’s alleged neglec t of family and home was _after_ she befriended Anna. In other words, the Husband’s argument c arried the implic ation that the Wife had c ontributed to the domestic sphere in her roles as mother, wife and housekeeper until she befriended Anna. Thirdly, the allegation of neglec t c ould not have been as bad as the Husband had wanted this c ourt t o bel _ie_ ve. A c ompelling fac tor militating against the allegation of the Wife’s neglec t of the Children 

was the Husband’s willingness to give c are and c ontrol of the Children to the Wife. In his 2nd Affidavit 

of 10 Marc h 2010, the Husband unreservedly ac c epted the Wife’s proposal made in her 1 st Affidavit of 29 Dec ember 2009 that joint c ustody of the Children should be granted to both parents, with c are and c ontrol to the Wife and reasonable ac c ess to the Husband. At the hearing on 6 August 2010, Ms Loo c onfirmed the Husband’s agreement to joint c ustody with c are and c ontrol to the Wife, and I so ordered. As for ac c ess, the Husband’s proposal was set out in Ms Loo’s submissions. The Wife agreed to most of the Husband’s demands exc ept for dinners thric e a week with the Children. The Order on ac c ess is set out at [1] above. 

35     In relation to the Husband’s indirec t c ontributions, the Husband c laimed to have been a c ommitted parent and that even though he had to travel several times a year on business and that 


he worked full-time, he still made the effort to fetc h the Children to their ac tivities on the weekends, and to spend as muc h time as possible with them. The Wife did not agree that the Husband was as involved in the lives of the Children as he would have this c ourt believe. She c laimed that the Husband was too busy with his business and spent little time with the Children preferring to spend the evenings in front of the television. That said, elsewhere in her affidavit, the Wife admitted (a) that the Husband would bring the Children out and fetc h them home, presumably from sc hool or ac tivities, [note: 23] and (b) to the Husband’s generosity and that he had provided well for the family. She also 

admitted to the Husband’s weekly outings with the family to the c inema and the family would often dine at well-known restaurants. From the overall evidenc e, my impression was that both parties were involved parents. The parents’ relationships with the Children, and the Children’s relatively good ac ademic results and busy extra-c urric ular ac tivities bear testimony to a c aring and c onduc ive familial support system. 

36     The Wife c laimed that she worked as “the builder” for both the DDD and MMM properties when 

t he properties were renovated. [note: 24] The Husband c laimed that he had made the final dec isions on c hoic e of the c ontrac tors and materials for the properties, and that the Wife had made minimal c ontribution to the renovations. Given the Wife’s qualific ations and experienc e in the c onstruc tion and building industry, I believe that the Wife would have c ontributed her skill and experienc e to the renovations, but whether these were rec eived and ac c epted by the Husband was another matter. The Wife revealed that the Husband was domineering and would insist on his way. In the end, the fac t remained that when the marriage was ongoing and the relationship between the parties was good, the parties seemed c ommitted to improving the family’s assets together. 

**Division of the matrimonial assets** 

37     Having c onsidered the matters set out above, I found the proposal that eac h party to take one of the properties in Singapore workable, and above all it was c ommensurate with a fair and equitable division. Upon the transfer of the MMM property from the Husband to the Wife, there would be no refund of the Husband’s CPF moneys that were used for the purc hase of this property. The MMM property is tenanted until 2012 at a c urrent monthly rental of $3,650. However, the Husband would 

transfer $3,200 of the monthly rental to the Wife. [note: 25] The Wife c onfirmed that she was left to 

p a y the maintenanc e c harges of $340 per month. [note: 26] After the resolution of the anc illary matters, the Wife would have to move out of the DDD property and find suitable ac c ommodation for herself and the Children. The Wife had indic ated that, in the meantime, she would use the rental from the MMM property to pay for the rented ac c ommodation for herself and the Children. I thought it fair and equitable that the parties should be allowed to retain the assets in their own names. The value of the assets retained by the Wife would help her pay for the MMM property mortgage, and start her new home for the Children. Allowing the Wife to retain her c ar meant that she would be able to provide transport and run errands for the Children. 

38     I have already c ommented on the DDD property above at [22]-[23]. Compared to the Wife, the Husband was better plac ed financ ially. By referenc e to his earning c apac ity in the family business and, if nec essary, the financ ial support of his parents, he would have the financ ial resourc es to shoulder the mortgage liabilities sec ured against the DDD property. As for the third piec e of real property, the Malaysian property, the Husband was allowed to keep it. 

**Maintenance** 

39     The Wife sought from the Husband a monthly payment of $10,300 as maintenanc e for herself and the Children. In essenc e, as Mr Koh explained, the Wife wanted the same amount of money that 


she had rec eived during the marriage, and this figure c ame from the same three sourc es mentioned in [6] above. Ac c ording to the Wife, she rec eived (a) the sum of $3,000 monthly from QQ until January 2008; (b) the sum of $4,000 monthly from PP until June 2009; and (c ) the sum of $3,200 monthly 

being the rental proc eeds from the MMM property. [note: 27] The Wife’s c laim for $10,300 was based on items (a), (b), and the 2007 monthly rental of $3,300 for the MMM property. 

40     Sec tion 114 of the Women’s Charter stipulates the matters that the c ourt would c onsider in determining the quantum of maintenanc e to be the Wife and Children. The Wife is, therefore, required to justify her c laim for the sum of $10,300 as monthly maintenanc e. 

41     Looking bac k to the time before the breakdown of the marriage, the family had enjoyed a relatively high standard of living. They lived in the DDD semi-detac hed landed property, the Wife held many supplementary c redit c ards given to her by the Husband, and he gave her expensive gifts of watc hes and jewellery. The Children had a wide variety of extrac urric ular ac tivities inc luding language lessons, swimming and taekwondo c lasses, and either of the parties would drive them there in the family c ar. The Husband was the only working spouse but the Wife rec eived allowanc es from the enterprises set up by the parties. She also rec eived the monthly rental inc ome from the MMM property. The allowanc es and rental inc ome were applied towards their expenses. It was not disputed that the Wife also used the supplementary c redit c ards to pay the household and family expenses. [note: 28] 

42     The Husband’s monthly expenses amounted to $23,517, of whic h roughly half went towards paying off the mortgage and property tax for the MMM and DDD properties. The Husband also c laimed that he drew a net monthly inc ome of $9,100. At first glanc e, this seems to be an egregious c ase of spending beyond one’s means. The Husband, however, explained that the gulf between his inc ome and his expenses was bridged by the solid support of his mother, who lent him a sum of $10,000 a month sinc e early 2005, whic h was subsequently revised to $14,900 a month in June 2005 when the 

Husband requested for more assistanc e. [note: 29] As explained at [9] above, the Husband c laimed that OO paid him $12,000 twic e a month, the total amount of $24,000 being the sum of $9,100 and $14,900. It was also noted above that the Husband produc ed only one bank statement in 2009 (see [9]) despite c laiming to have had rec eived these payments sinc e 2005. The Husband went on to c laim that the loans would probably c ease after the anc illary proc eedings were c ompleted, bec ause the matrimonial assets would in all likelihood be sold off and he would no longer be liable for the hefty mortgage payments due in respec t of the properties in the pool of matrimonial assets. 

43     The mec hanism by whic h the mother’s loan was granted operated in the following manner. Apparently OO was indebted to the Husband’s mother for a large sum, and it was dec ided that instead o f repaying the loan to the Husband’s mother direc tly, OO would simply pay the sum owed to the Husband. In that way, the Husband’s mother would transmit loans amounting to $14,900 a month to the Husband through OO. These supposed loans from the Husband’s mother had been paid by OO 

sinc e June 2005. [note: 30] However, the Husband later c laimed that in 2007/2008 he stopped 

borrowing from his mother and borrowed the sum of $14,900 every month from OO instead. In his 3 rd Affidavit, the Husband for the first time introduc ed a loan from OO. At para 12, the Husband stated: 

 OO has repaid my mother for the loan whic h she had extended to OO. However, as I needed money to meet my expenses, in or around 2007/2008, I c ontinued drawing extra money from OO every month, as a loan from OO to me. 

44     Apart from the Husband’s c onfirmation to the auditor that he owed OO the sum of $170,000 as 

at 31 Dec ember 2008, [note: 31] and OO’s c onfirmation to the auditor that it owed [J] (the Husband’s 


mother) the sum of $142,781.19 as at 31 Dec ember 2006, the doc umentary evidenc e suc h as OO’s financ ial statements and the one bank statement exhibited by the Husband did not establish satisfac torily the Husband’s c laim that the mother’s loan was disbursed through OO. Be that as it may, throughout the marriage there was available to the Husband enough money to fund his personal expenses, mortgages repayments and the expenses of the household and family. 

45     The amount of household expenses c laimed by the Wife totalled $10,413.91. This inc luded expenses related to the purc hase of groc eries, utilities and maintenanc e of the household, the upkeep of the c ar and the employment of the maid. I found the sums c laimed by the Wife, in partic ular those sums relating to the marketing and groc ery bills, tonic s, vitamins, utilities, repairs of elec tronic goods, and maintenanc e of the c ar to be exc essive. I thought it fair that the Husband should pay the Wife a monthly sum of $5,000 for the household expenses. 

46     Separately, the Wife c laimed that the monthly expenses for all three Children totalled $6,867.68, and these inc luded expenses related to educ ation, insuranc e premiums, grooming, entertainment and leisure, holidays/travel and birthday parties. I believe that some of the expenses c laimed by her were on the high side, in partic ular those relating to items like holidays/travel, gifts, and c lothes, shoes, bags, storybooks. For the last item, the Wife c laimed a sum of $1,500 a month. Her c laim for “holidays/ travel” also amounted to $1,500 a month whic h I believe is exc essive for sc hool going Children. Simply bec ause the Husband spent $500 per month for his personal travel was 

no justific ation for insisting on the same amount for the Children and herself. [note: 32] If travel expenses were for sc hool trips suc h as for sports, exc hange programmes, and learning programmes, they would be borne separately by the Husband under the Order of 22 Marc h 2011. For the above reasons I thought it fair that the Husband should bear the Children’s monthly expenses (not on a reimbursement basis) relating to their educ ation, insuranc e polic ies and weekly poc ket money, and he shall pay the Wife an additional separate sum of $900 a month for the Children’s personal expenses. 

47     Mr Koh submitted that the Wife’s personal expenses totalled $4,646.82 and these inc luded expenses related to handphone c harges, c lothes, shoes and bags, c osmetic s, grooming, insuranc e, food, holidays/travel, allowanc e for her parents and festive expenses suc h as Christmas presents and Vesak Day c haritable c ontributions. Some items of expenses suc h as c lothes, shoes and bags, handphone c harges, holidays/travel, festive expenses and donations were exc essive. In the c irc umstanc es I thought it fair that the Husband shall pay the Wife a sum of $2,500 a month for her personal expenses. 

48     In sum, the Husband is to pay the Wife a sum of $8,400 a month as maintenanc e for herself and the Children. The breakdown of this sum is $2,500 for the Wife’s personal expenses, $900 for the Children’s personal expenses and $5,000 for the household expenses. In addition, the Husband shall pay the Wife, and not on a reimbursement basis, the Children’s expenses relating to their educ ation, insuranc e polic ies and weekly poc ket money.
