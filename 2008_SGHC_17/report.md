Tay Yong Kwang J: 

**The application** 

1       The plaintiff ac ts in person in these proc eedings. She is a legally trained person. In RA No. 61 of 2007, she appealed against the dec ision of Assistant Registrar Kenneth Yap who had ordered her amended Statement of Claim in this ac tion to be expunged from the c ourt rec ords bec ause the ac tion was deemed disc ontinued under O 21 r 2(6) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5). The assistant registrar also direc ted her to file an applic ation to reinstate the ac tion, failing whic h no further doc ument was to be ac c epted by the registry of the Supreme Court (“the registry”) for filing. 

2       I heard the plaintiff’s appeal and dismissed it on 25 April 2007. Several months later, on 13 September 2007, the plaintiff took out Originating Summons No. 1369 of 2007 before the Court of Appeal to seek leave to file an appeal out of time against my dec ision. On 26 Oc tober 2007, she was granted leave to file an appeal within two weeks of the Court of Appeal’s order. The Court of Appeal made no order as to c osts for the hearing before it. On 6 November 2007, she filed her notic e of appeal (in CA No. 134 of 2007). 

3       State Counsel for the defendant very helpfully prepared a c hronology of the main events in this ac tion and its related matters. The following sets out the relevant events: 

 17 Dec ember 2004 the plaintiff c ommenc ed this ac tion for alleged wrongful termination of her employment c ontrac t and other relief in administrative law. 

 10 January 2005 the defendant applied to strike out parts of the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court. 

 14 February 2005 the defendant’s applic ation was heard before an assistant registrar (“AR”) who reserved judgment. 


23 February 2005 the said AR ordered c ertain portions of the Statement of Claim struc k out and gave leave to the plaintiff to amend other portions of the Statement of Claim within three weeks. He also ordered the defendant to file and serve the Defenc e within 14 days from the date of servic e of the amended Statement of Claim. The plaintiff was ordered to pay c osts of $400 to the defendant. 

9       Marc h 2005 the plaintiff appealed against the AR’s dec ision. 

17     Marc h 2005 the plaintiff wrote to inform the defendant about the above appeal and asked for a two-week grac e period to engage solic itors. The defendant ac c eded to her request. 

5 April 2005 Tan Lee Meng J (“Tan J”) heard and dismissed the appeal but allowed three sentenc es to be reinstated in the Statement of Claim. No c osts order was made as none was sought. 

6 April 2005 the plaintiff wrote to inform the defendant of her intention to appeal against Tan J’s dec ision and requested that payment of taxed c osts ordered against her in earlier proc eedings be held in abeyanc e. 

11 April 2005 the defendant served a statutory demand on the plaintiff for payment of c osts ordered against her by the Court of Appeal in the earlier proc eedings (see <span class="citation">[2001] SGCA 10</span>). 

29 April 2005 the plaintiff applied in OSB No. 38 of 2005 to set aside or to stay the statutory demand (“the bankruptc y proc eedings”). 

1 June 2005 an AR dismissed the plaintiff’s applic ation in the bankruptc y proc eedings. No order on c osts was sought by the defendant. 

14 June 2005 the plaintiff appealed against the dismissal of her applic ation in the bankruptc y proc eedings. 

25 July 2005 Tan J dismissed her appeal (see <span class="citation">[2005] SGHC 182</span>). 

24 August 2005 the plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal (in CA No. 87 of 2005) against Tan J’s dec isions made on 5 April 2005 in the present ac tion and on 25 July 2005 in the bankruptc y proc eedings. The defendant objec ted and applied to set aside the notic e of appeal in respec t of the present ac tion. 

24     Oc tober 2005 the Court of Appeal heard the defendant’s applic ation and ordered that the appeal in respec t of the present ac tion in CA No. 87 of 2005 be set aside. The plaintiff was ordered to pay c osts of $1000. 


 10 November 2005 the registry informed the parties that CA No. 87 of 2005 (in respec t of the bankruptc y proc eedings) was sc heduled for hearing before the Court of Appeal in the week beginning on 27 Marc h 2006. 

 27 January 2006 the registry informed the parties that CA No. 87 of 2005 was deemed withdrawn pursuant to O 57 r 9(4) of the Rules of Court as the rec ord of appeal and other required doc uments had not been filed and that the hearing date was therefore vac ated. 

 13 February 2006 the plaintiff filed an affidavit in support of her applic ation to extend time for filing her appeal papers in CA No. 87 of 2005. This affidavit was not served on the defendant until one year later. 

 8 February 2007 the plaintiff filed her amended Statement of Claim in the present ac tion. 

 16 February 2007 the registry c alled the parties to attend a pre-trial c onferenc e in respec t of the present ac tion. 

 1 Marc h 2007 AR Kenneth Yap ruled that the present ac tion was deemed disc ontinued as no step was taken between August 2005 and August 2006. He ordered the amended Statement of Claim to be expunged from the c ourt rec ords and direc ted the plaintiff to file an applic ation to reinstate the ac tion, failing whic h no further doc ument was to be ac c epted by the registry for filing. 

4       As mentioned earlier, the plaintiff’s appeal before me related to the order made on 1 Marc h 2007 by AR Kenneth Yap. O 21 r 2(6), (6A) and (6B) of the Rules of Court provide: 

 (6) Subjec t to paragraph (6A), if no party to an ac tion or a c ause or matter has, for more than one year (or suc h extended period as the Court may allow under paragraph (6B)), taken any step or proc eeding in the ac tion, c ause or matter that appears from rec ords maintained by the Court, the ac tion, c ause or matter is deemed to have been disc ontinued. 

 (6A) Paragraph (6) shall not apply where the ac tion, c ause or matter has been stayed pursuant to an order of c ourt. 

 (6B) The Court may, on an applic ation by any party made before the one year referred to in paragraph (6) has elapsed, extend the time to suc h extent as it may think fit. 

5       Where an ac tion has been automatic ally disc ontinued, an applic ation may be made to reinstate the ac tion under O 21 r 2(8) whic h provides: 

 (8) Where an ac tion, a c ause or a matter has been disc ontinued under paragraph (5) or (6), the Court may, on applic ation, reinstate the ac tion, c ause or matter, and allow it to proc eed on suc h terms as it thinks just. 

6       In _Moguntia-Est Epices SA v Sea-Hawk Freight Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2003] 4 SLR 429</span>, Judith Prakash J said 


(at [20]): 

 In our c ase, the trigger date is the date of the last step in the ac tion as it appears in the c ourt rec ords (and this may be a step taken by the plaintiff or by the defendant) and the guillotine date is the day before the anniversary of the trigger date. 

I n _Attorney-General v Tan Wee Beng_ <span class="citation">[2002] SGHC 261</span>, an AR observed (at [25]) that the words “step or proc eeding ... that appears from the rec ords maintained by the Court” in O 21 r 2(6) c onnote an ac tion vested with the formality of the c ourt adjudic ation proc ess and that suc h a step or proc eeding must therefore involve doc uments whic h are filed in c ourt and therefore exc ludes c orrespondenc e with the c ourt and c orrespondenc e between the parties. I agree with this observation but would opine that a letter to a judge requesting further arguments in c ases where suc h a proc ess is required by law would also fall within the ambit of “step or proc eeding”. This is logic al bec ause suc h a letter is a nec essary step prec eding an appeal and is part of the litigation proc ess to drive the c ase to its c onc lusion. 

7       The plaintiff submitted that the issue before me was whether any step was taken by her between 8 February 2006 and 8 February 2007 (when the amended Statement of Claim was filed). She said that after the Court of Appeal allowed the defendant’s applic ation on 24 Oc tober 2005, she wrote a letter dated 31 Oc tober 2005 to request further arguments as the substantive issues had not been argued and that she would be enlisting an expert in administrative law from the Fac ulty of Law of the National University of Singapore to assist her with the arguments. She was informed by the registry on 7 November 2005 that the Court of Appeal did not wish to hear further arguments. She then took steps to file the appeal papers in respec t of her appeal in the bankruptc y proc eedings. 

8       In my view, the last step or proc eeding (or the “trigger date” as stated by Judith Prakash J in [6] above) in the present ac tion was when the Court of Appeal heard and allowed the defendant’s applic ation to strike out the notic e of appeal in so far as it relates to the present ac tion. That was on 24 Oc tober 2005. There is no proc edure for further arguments before the Court of Appeal mandated by law and the plaintiff’s letter of 31 Oc tober 2005 would not therefore be c onsidered a “step or proc eeding” within the meaning of O 21 r 2(6). Even if one were to c onsider the said letter and the registry’s reply of 7 November 2005 as suc h step or proc eeding, no other step or proc eeding took plac e between 7 November 2005 and 8 February 2007 when the amended Statement of Claim was filed, a period of more than one year. All the matters during that stretc h of time mentioned by the plaintiff related to the appeal in respec t of the bankruptc y proc eedings and not the present ac tion, inc luding her affidavit of 13 February 2006. Clearly, the bankruptc y proc eedings had nothing to do with the present ac tion. They arose out of earlier proc eedings in c ourt taken out by the plaintiff. Bankruptc y proc eedings are a separate matter in any event even if they arose out of the present ac tion. The step or proc eeding that is material is not one taken in any related matters. It must relate to the ac tion in issue. 

9       For the reasons stated in [6] above, the plaintiff’s letter dated 24 Marc h 2006 to the registry to ask for a c opy of Tan J’s grounds of dec ision and notes of evidenc e with respec t to the striking out appeal in the present ac tion would also not be a step or proc eeding for automatic disc ontinuanc e purposes. It appeared from her arguments before me that she believed that her appeal against Tan J’s dec ision in the striking out appeal was still alive when that appeal had c learly been set aside by the Court of Appeal. 

10     In my opinion, the AR was c orrec t in finding that the present ac tion was deemed disc ontinued before the amended Statement of Claim was filed although I differed from him on when the disc ontinuanc e took effec t. In my view, the ac tion was deemed disc ontinued one year after 


24     Oc tober 2005. As the amended Statement of Claim was filed on 8 February 2007, it was well after automatic disc ontinuanc e had taken plac e. I would add that the AR who allowed her leave to amend on 23 February 2005 inc luded an order that unless the amended Statement of Claim was filed and served within three weeks from the date of his order, the paragraphs in question would be struc k out too. 

11     The matter before me c onc erned only the issue whether the present ac tion was deemed disc ontinued. It was not about whether the ac tion should be reinstated under O 21 r 2(8) although the plaintiff had added in her further submissions that if I were of the opinion that the ac tion was deemed disc ontinued, she would ask that it be reinstated and allowed to proc eed “in view of the exc eptional c irc umstanc es and irregularities of my c ase, in the interest of justic e and fair play”. The defendant gave notic e that if an applic ation for reinstatement was made, he would seek to argue that the c ause of ac tion was already barred by limitation as the alleged breac h was on 21 Dec ember 1998, more than six years before the deemed disc ontinuanc e. The plaintiff should take out suc h an applic ation as direc ted by the AR if she wishes to pursue this matter further. 

12     For the above reasons, I dismissed the plaintiff’s appeal. As the defendant did not wish to have c osts for the appeal, I made no order as to c osts.
