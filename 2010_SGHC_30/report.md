**Andrew Ang J:** 

**Introduction** 

1       This is a c laim by Max Media FZ LLC (“the plaintiff”) for the return of money paid out under a bank guarantee (“the 1st BG”) to Nimbus Media Pte Ltd (“the defendant”). The defendant resisted the c laim on the ground that it was entitled to keep the money drawn under the 1st BG pursuant to the part ies’ agreement and c ounterc laimed against the plaintiff for damages arising from the plaintiff’s breac h of c ontrac t. 

**Background** 

**_The parties_** 

2       The plaintiff is a sales and management agenc y operating in the Middle East inc orporated in the United Arab Emirates. It deals in television advertising and broadc ast sponsorship and is part of the Emirates Neon Group LLC of c ompanies. The defendant is a Singapore inc orporated c ompany in the business of television programme produc tion. Through an arrangement with Neo Sports Broadc ast Pvt Ltd (“Neo Sports”), an Indian c ompany that broadc asts all c ric ket matc hes played under the aegis of the Board of Control for Cric ket in India (“the BCCI”), the defendant ac quired the rights to exhibit advertising material during the transmission of c ric ket matc hes in Neo Sport’s Middle Eastern television networks (“the advertising inventory”). 

3       The following are the key persons involved in the present dispute: 

 (a) The plaintiff’s representatives – managing direc tor, Muhammad Rehan Merc hant (“Mr Merc hant”); head of Strategic Business Planning from the Emirates Neon Group LLC, Akella Lakshminarayana (“Mr Akella”); and financ e manager, George Thomas (“Mr Thomas”). 

 (b) The defendant’s representatives – c hief financ ial offic er, Shah Umeet Bharat (“Mr Shah”);

 (c ) 

 the previous c hief financ ial offic er, Arvind Agrawal (“Mr Agrawal”); senior vic e-president of International Sales & Syndic ation, Mr Vikram Das (“Mr Das”); and legal c ounsel, Mr Benedic t Ball Laurenc e (“Mr Ball”). 

**_The Agreement_** 

4       Sometime in April 2007, the defendant issued an Invitation To Tender (“the ITT”) for the exc lusive right to sell the advertising inventory it obtained pursuant to its arrangement with Neo Sports. The ITT c overed both international and domestic c ric ket events. A sc hedule of spec ific international c ric ket events, the BCCI International Cric ket Series, c omprising 19 Test matc hes and 47 One Day International games that would be broadc ast by Neo Sports up to 2010 was inc luded. A “Minimum Guarantee” sum was attributable for eac h of these international events, although a pro rata addition or subtrac tion was applic able if any spec ific matc hes were added or taken off the sc hedule. Unlike the international events, no spec ific sc hedule was provided for the BCCI Domestic Cric ket Series, although there was an “indic ative listing of matc hes”. For the domestic events, a “Minimum Guarantee” sum was attributable to eac h financ ial year from 2007 to 2010. The ITT also stated that Neo Sports would be ac quiring more properties for distribution and provided an “Additional Matc hes Matrix” for the c alc ulation of the “Minimum Guarantee” applic able to new events ac quired by Neo Sports whic h were not in the original list. 

5       The plaintiff won the bid and c ommenc ed negotiations over the terms of the c ontrac t. Subsequently, the parties entered into an Advertising Sales Agenc y agreement dated 18 April 2007 (“t he Agreement”) under whic h the plaintiff was appointed the exc lusive sales agent for advertising inventory with respec t to c ric ket matc hes broadc ast by Neo Sports Pte Ltd in the Middle East region for a period of three years. In c onsideration, the defendant was promised the Minimum Guaranteed amount of US$6,675,000 (c l 6.1.1) and any “inc remental Minimum Guarantee if applic able”. The ITT was inc luded as Annexure 3 of the Agreement. The spec ific event listing, the “Minimum Guarantee” amounts and the “Additional Matc hes Matrix” were also separately inc luded as Annexure 4 to the Agreement. Separate timelines were stipulated for payment of international and domestic events (see c l 6.1.1 below). The Agreement also provided for pro rata inc reases or reduc tions in the Minimum Guaranteed amount should events be c anc elled or added (see c l 6.2). The Agreement was governed by English law although it provided for Singapore as the forum. Other salient terms of the Agreement were as follows: 

 ... 

 In respec t of payments for international Events (Tests and ODIs) payment shall be due within seventy five (75) days of issuing the invoic es to c lients. Invoic es to the c lients will be issued within 3 days from the date of rec eiving the Telec ast Certific ates from [the defendant]; 

 In respec t of domestic matc hes and other programming, payment shall be due in twelve (12) Equal Monthly Instalments over the c ourse of that c ontrac t year as per the payment sc hedule set out in Annexure 4; 

 In respec t of all remaining payments, inc luding for new or additional events, and inc luding additional payments after deduc tion of Commission, as set out in Annexure 4, payment shall be due in ac c ordanc e with [the defendant]’s standard invoic e terms and c onditions, as per 6.1.1(a);

 [The plaintiff] shall deliver to [the defendant], Bank Guarantee for the aggregate attributable values for BCCI International c ric ket series and other programming on the c hannel as set out in Annexure 4 for the 1st c ontrac t year for USD2,475,000 (United States Dollars Two Million Four Hundred and Seventy Five Thousand) on or before 23rd April 2007. This bank guarantee will be valid for 1 year with the c laim period thereafter of 3 months. 

 [The plaintiff] shall deliver to [the defendant], Bank Guarantee for the aggregate attributable values for BCCI International c ric ket series and other programming on the c hannel as set out in Annexure 4 for the 2nd c ontrac t year for USD2,050,000 (United States Dollars Two Million fifty thousand only) on or before 15th Marc h 2008. This bank guarantee will be valid for the period 1st April 2008 to 31st marc h [sic ] 2009 with the c laim period thereafter of 3 months. 

... 

 Time is of the essence in relation to [the plaintiff’s] payment obligations as hereunder. The bank guarantee in forc e from time to time (as mentioned in bank guarantee with payment sc hedule attac hed to Annexure 4) may be drawn upon by [the defendant] in ac c ordanc e with its terms to make up the full amount of eac h and every instalment of the Minimum Guaranteed amount due from [the plaintiff] to [the defendant] whic h is not paid by the due date for payment, in respec t of that instalment. [The defendant] shall be entitled to draw upon and retain the full amount of the bank guarantee in force from time to time in the event that [the plaintiff] misses three (3) payment dates over the entire contract period. In such event, [the defendant] may also terminate this Agreement forthwith upon written notice.

 [emphasis added] 

6       I should add two things. First, the term “Telec ast Certific ates” was not defined within the Agreement nor was its format spec ified. This is signific ant bec ause there was c ontention as to whether “stamped” Telec ast Certific ates, _ie_ , Telec ast Certific ates c ontaining the defendant’s letterhead and stamp, were required (see below at [8]). Sec ondly, the draft version of c l 6.1. originally c irc ulated to the plaintiff by the defendant did not c ontain the words “and retain”; they were inc luded during the c ourse of the negotiations over the terms by Mr Ball, the defendant’s legal c ounsel. 

**_The events leading to the present dispute_** 

7       Pursuant to c l 6.1.2.1 of the Agreement, the plaintiff’s parent c ompany, Emirates Neon Group LLC, provided the defendant with bank guarantee PEB/GTY/0751888/B, _ie_ , the 1st BG dated 25 April 2007 for the sum of US$2.5m to sec ure the plaintiff’s payment obligations in respec t of the first c ontrac t year. However, during the c ourse of the first c ontrac t year, the plaintiff was either late or had not made payment at all for the following invoic es: 

8       Invoic e No 74 was issued by the defendant on 13 Dec ember 2007 for the India _v_ Pakistan event whic h was broadc ast sometime in late 2007. As the defendant alleged was its prac tic e, unstamped Telec ast Certific ates ( _ie_ , without the defendant’s c hop and stamp) for this event were issued to the Plaintiff soon after. The plaintiff enc ountered diffic ulty in c ollec ting payment for this event and Mr Thomas explained to the defendant in an e-mail dated 5 January 2008 that the plaintiff did not have “c omplete Telec ast Certific ates” whic h he c laimed would “affec t the rec overy [of payments]”. Stamped Telec ast Certific ates were then provided to the plaintiff on 7 January 2008 and, 

by agreement, the plaintiff was given until 31 Marc h 2008 to make payment for this event. [note: 1] 

9       Notwithstanding this, no payment was made for Invoic e No 74 on or before 31 Marc h 2008. 


Instead, partial payments were made throughout April and May 2008: US$136,072.94 on 13 April 2008; US$200,000 on 24 April 2008; and US$350,000 on 20 May 2008 (there was referenc e on the invoic e itself to a c redit note for US$280,000 issued on 12 April 2008 but this was with respec t to the reduc tion of the originally invoic ed sum of US$1.4m to US$1.12m). 

10     Not all the events whic h were broadc ast by Neo Sports were invoic ed. In partic ular, the parties were in negotiations as to whether to waive the plaintiff’s obligation to pay for the BCB Bangladesh _v_ South Afric a event, whic h Neo Sports broadc ast beginning from 22 February 2008. Mr Das had informed the plaintiff of the addition of the event on 6 February 2008 but the plaintiff alleged that no advertising inventory c ould be sold for it bec ause of the short notic e. Mr Merc hant, in an e-mail dated 12 February 2008, stated that: 

 Yes c ontrac tually we are there to pic k up series we get from NEO but not if suc h is the timeline to sell ... 

 Then we don’t have to as this was not defined in the agreement – henc e if we don’t talk over it to sensibly agree on something – then we don’t take it ... 

On 3 Marc h 2008, the parties held a meeting. Mr Agrawal and Mr Das represented the defendant; the plaintiff was represented by, _inter alia_ , Mr Merc hant, Mr Akella and Mr Thomas. The minutes of that meeting rec orded, in relation to the BCB Bangladesh _v_ South Afric a event, that: 

 [The plaintiff ] to send a note/letter to Mr Arvind for MG waiver for the c urrent series as well as revaluation of all Bangladesh future series. [The Plaintiff ] to provide realistic projec tions for the Bangladesh Calendar. And Arvind will present to Neo Board for approval. 

 Review of all Matrix apart from “A” team c ric ket boards that are not realistic /saleable. [The plaintiff ] to write separate letter to NEO for revision/delete same from the original c ontrac t. Neo to present this to its Board and if approved by Board the rebate will be passed to [the plaintiff]. 

 [emphasis in original] 

However, the plaintiff did not send the requisite letter and the issue remained unresolved. 

11     Separately, the plaintiff enc ountered problems in proc uring the sec ond bank guarantee (“the 2nd BG”) by 15 Marc h 2008, as it was obliged to do under c l 6.1.2.2 of the Agreement. Its bank, HSBC Bank Middle East Ltd (“HSBC”), was unwilling to issue the 2nd BG while the 1st BG was still extant. As a result, the plaintiff failed to provide the 2nd BG to the defendant on 15 Marc h 2008. Negotiations were c ommenc ed to resolve the issue. Mr Agrawal suggested that the plaintiff request 

its bank to “inc rease the validity of the c urrent Bank Guarantee and make it valid till 30 th June 2009”. Mr Thomas replied that the 2nd BG was being issued and that there would be a c lause that the 2nd BG would be valid from the expiry date of the 1st BG. Mr Das, in an e-mail dated 27 Marc h 2008, stated that (3AB.828): 

 [w]e want you to reproduc e the c lause as per your mail on bank letter head and the c lause should be irrevoc able, this is to ensure that the understanding is same between all the parties involved and we are on the same page. 

A few days later on 2 April 2008, HSBC issued a letter to the defendant (“HSBC’s 2 April 2008 letter”) that stated (3AB.837): 


 This is with referenc e to the issuanc e of new Bank Guarantee in your favor [ sic ] for USD2,050,000/as per Clause 6.1.2.2 of Advertising Sales Agenc y Agreement dated 18.04.2007, for the sale of Advertising Inventory on the Neo Sports Broadc ast Pvt Ltd. 

 As per the terms of agreement, the guarantee is to be valid from 1 st April 2008. However, please note that sinc e there is already a Bank Guarantee for USD2.5 Million in plac e for the above mentioned c ontrac t and whic h is expiring on 31 st May, 2008, we will be able to provide the new Bank Guarantee for USD2.05 Million only after expiry of the earlier Guarantee having referenc e No. PEB/GTY/0751888/B. 

 As suc h, [p]lease note our c onfirmation that the Bank Guarantee for USD 2.05m will be issued from 01st June 2008 valid till 31st May 2009. 

However, on 10 April 2008, the defendant rejec ted HSBC’s 2 April 2008 letter, stating that it was “not ac c eptable” bec ause it “does not protec ts [ _sic_ ] [the Defendant] in any manner”. 

12     On 18 April 2008, the defendant, through Mr Shah, sent an e-mail to the plaintiff informing it that it was in default of its c ontrac tual obligations: 

 (a) to pay the sum of US$984,000 outstanding for the India v Pakistan Series ( ie , Invoic e No 74); and 

 (b) to provide the 2nd BG on or before 15 Marc h 2008. 

The defendant reserved its rights with regard to the breac hes, although it stated that it “[did] not wish to take any drastic measures at this moment in time”. It requested the plaintiff to rec tify the breac hes by 24 April 2008. 

13     Mr Akella, on behalf of the plaintiff, replied to the defendant on 21 April 2008 and promised to pay the defendant the outstanding sum for Invoic e No 74 in three tranc hes: US$200,000 by 22 April 2008; US$350,000 by 12 May 2008; and US$434,000 by 31 May 2008. He assured the defendant that the 2nd BG would be issued by the first week of June 2008. 

14     The c orrespondenc e c ontinued on 25 April 2008, when Mr Shah ac knowledged rec eipt of the first tranc h of US$200,000 but rejec ted Mr Akella’s proposed timelines for the other two tranc hes of payment and the provision of the 2nd BG. Instead, he c ounter-proposed that the plaintiff pay US$400,000 on or before 1 May 2008, and subsequently US$384,000 on or before 8 May 2008. He also suggested that the 2nd BG be issued and exc hanged for the 1st BG in the presenc e of the plaintiff’s bankers, although he qualified that this proposal was made on a without prejudic e basis and subjec t to the ratific ation of the defendant’s board of direc tors. In response, Mr Merc hant asked Mr Shah on 28 April 2008 if the board of direc tors had ratified the proposal, although he did not c omment on Mr Shah’s proposed timelines for payment of Invoic e No 74. 

15     No payment was made on 1 May 2008. On 6 May 2008, Mr Merc hant sent another e-mail to Mr Shah stating that the plaintiff would be “transferring a payment very soon”. Mr Merc hant reiterated that the defendant should not insist on the issuanc e of a 2nd BG that would overlap with the 1st BG. He also ac knowledged that the defendant had not agreed to the proposal as set out in HSBC’s 2 April 2008 letter. 

16     On 14 May 2008, Mr Merc hant sent Mr Das a text message stating that he was “signing off 


c heques today and [S]aturday of all payments”. On 20 May 2008, the defendant initiated the proc ess of drawing down the 1st BG. On 26 May 2008, Mr Merc hant again sent Mr Das a text message promising to transfer the moneys “by tomorrow dayafter [ _sic_ ] ...”. This was not done and, on 30 May 2008, the defendant sent another default notic e to the plaintiff, stating that the plaintiff was in breac h of c ll 9.1.1, 9.1.6 and 9.1.7 of the Agreement. It warned the plaintiff that failure to remedy the breac hes within five days of the letter would entitle the defendant to terminate the Agreement. On 2 June 2008, Mr Merc hant asked the defendant to withdraw its c laim on the 1st BG and c onfirmed the plaintiff’s intention to honour the Agreement. 

17     On 4 June 2008, the defendant rec eived US$2.5m from HSBC pursuant to its drawing on the 1st BG. On 5 June 2008, the defendant sent a notic e informing the plaintiff that it was terminating the Agreement on the following grounds: 

 (a) under c l 9.1.6 for the plaintiff’s failure to provide the 2nd BG by 15 Marc h 2008; 

 (b) under c l 9.1.1 for the plaintiff’s persistent breac h due to there being at least three late payments beyond 15 days from the due date in the c ontrac t period; and 

 (c ) under c l 6.1.3 for the plaintiff having missed at least three payments over the entire c ontrac t period. 

The plaintiff was told to stop selling advertising inventory for the BCB Kitply Triseries event (otherwise known as the “Kitply Cup”) whic h was broadc ast from 8 June 2008 onwards. After terminating the Agreement, the defendant entered into another advertising c ontrac t with Integrated Advertising Servic es FZ LLC on 2 Oc tober 2008. 

**_The issues_** 

18     It is not disputed that the plaintiff owes at least US$700,378 to the defendant. The defendant, on its part, c onc eded that the plaintiff was entitled to the marketing expenses it had inc urred in the c ourse of selling the advertising inventory. The amount in dispute is c onfined to the plaintiff’s liability for post-termination damages and payment for three items (“the 3 Uninvoic ed Events”) amounting to US$459,167 that were delivered but not invoic ed by the defendant: 

 (a) the BCB Bangladesh v South Afric a event, amounting to US$105,000; 

 (b) the Kitply Cup, amounting to US$325,000; and 

 (c ) the BCCI Minimum Guarantee sc heduled payment of US$29,167 for June 2008. 

19     Sinc e the c onsequenc e of the defendant’s termination of the Agreement is that both parties are released from performing obligations whic h had not fallen due at the time of the termination, the plaintiff is still bound to make payments whic h had fallen due by 5 June 2008, but not for payments whic h would have fallen due after that date had the Agreement not been terminated. The defendant is, however, entitled to rec over these future instalments as damages if the plaintiff’s breac h was repudiatory (see below at [29]). This distinc tion may be signific ant should I find that the defendant is _not_ entitled to post-termination damages bec ause it is unc lear _when_ payment fell due for the 3 Uninvoic ed Events (if at all). In at least one c ase, the Kitply Cup, it is obvious that payment c ould not have fallen due by 5 June 2008 bec ause the event was only broadc ast after the termination of the Agreement. 


20     For this reason, it is easier to examine the issues in this order: First, whether c l 6.1.3 is a penalty c lause. Sec ond, whether the defendant is entitled to post-termination damages. Third, whether the plaintiff is liable to pay for the 3 Uninvoic ed Events. 

21     I should point out that despite the Agreement providing that the governing law was to be English law, neither party submitted on this point and no evidenc e was led as to any differenc e between English law and Singapore law relevant to this c ase. Ac c ordingly, I will proc eed on the basis that there is none. 

**Whether cl 6.1.3 is a penalty clause** 

**_The parties’ arguments_** 

22     Mr Philip Fong (“Mr Fong”), c ounsel for the plaintiff, argued that the defendant in c alling on and retaining the US$2.5m drawn under the 1st BG had unjustly enric hed itself by the sum of US$1,799,622 in exc ess of the plaintiff’s ac tual debt of US$700,378 owed to the defendant bec ause c l 6.1.3 was a penalty c lause and should be struc k down. He submitted that: 

 (a) a proper c onstruc tion of the sec ond limb of c l 6.1.3 showed it was penal in nature as it sought to deter non-performanc e by the plaintiff; 

 (b) the defendant’s pleadings and evidenc e revealed its utilisation of c l 6.1.3 in a “penal fashion”; and 

 (c ) the fac tual matrix showed that the objec tive c onstruc tion of the sec ond limb of c l 6.1. was oppressive. 

23     Not surprisingly, Mr Chandra Mohan (“Mr Mohan”), c ounsel for the defendant, argued that c l 6.1.3 was not a penalty c lause but should be interpreted to mean that the defendant was entitled to retain the 1st BG to c ompensate it in respec t of: 

 (a) the plaintiff’s missed payments; and 

 (b) the losses suffered by the defendant as a result of the plaintiff’s breac h of the Agreement. [note: 2] 

T he predominant c ontrac tual func tion of c l 6.1.3 was “protec tive” rather than _in terrorem_. At the time the Agreement was entered into, the greatest c onc eivable loss for the first c ontrac t year flowing from a possible breac h of the Agreement was US$2.8m. In c omparison, the sum of US$2.5m provided for under the 1st BG was neither “extravagant and unc onsc ionable” nor “greater than the sum whic h ought to have been paid”, and there was no oppression given that both parties were legally advised and had negotiated at arm’s length. 

**_The applicable principles of law_** 

24     As rightly pointed out by the defendant, ordinarily restitutionary princ iples are supplemental to the law of c ontrac t where the parties are in a c ontrac tual relationship: see _Lancore Services Ltd v Barclays Bank Plc_ [2008] EWHC 1264 at [110] and also _Firstlink Energy Pte Ltd v Creanovate Pte Ltd and another action_ [2007] 1 SLR(R) 1050 at [46]–[48]. The rationale behind this general rule is that the law of restitution should not redistribute the risks whic h the parties have, by c ontrac t, already alloc ated. In this c ase, the defendant drew and kept the full amount of the bank guarantee pursuant 


to c l 6.1.3 of the Agreement. Nonetheless, one rec ognised exc eption where restitution may apply to a c ontrac t is where the c onsideration for the c ontrac t has failed. The relevant princ iple applic able here is this: where money has been paid out under a c ontrac t that is or bec omes ineffec tive, the payer may rec over the money if the c onsideration for the payment has totally failed; but this right of rec overy only arises where there is _no_ express or implied term in the c ontrac t making the payment irrec overable: _Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd_ [1943] AC 32 (“ _Fibrosa_ ”) at 67 _per_ Lord Wright; Goff and Jones _, The Law of Restitution_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 2007, 7th Ed) at pp 56–58. This failure of c onsideration is judged from the payer’s point of view and refers ( _ibid_ , at 48): 

 ... not [to] the promise whic h is referred to as the c onsideration, but the performanc e of the promise. The money was paid to sec ure performanc e and, if performanc e fails the induc ement whic h brought about the payment is not fulfilled. 

The failure must be total bec ause c onsideration is normally viewed as “whole and indivisible” and the c ourt will not divide or apportion unless it is c lear that the parties intended it to be so: _Biggerstaff v Rowatt’s Wharf Ltd_ [1896] 2 Ch 93 at 100. Thus, _partial_ failure of c onsideration would normally bar an unjust enric hment c laim, unless the c ontrac t is divisible ( _Fibrosa_ at 77). 

25     The law on penalty c lauses was laid out in the seminal c ase of _Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage & Motor Co Ltd_ [1915] AC 79 (“ _Dunlop_ ”), whic h was in turn endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _Beihai Zingong Property Development Co and another v Ng Choon Meng_ [1999] 1 SLR(R) 527. Whether a c lause is penal depends on the c onstruc tion of the c ontrac t: a penalty c lause is a payment _in terrorem_ of the offending party, in c ontrast to a liquidated damages c lause whic h is a genuine pre-estimate of the damages that may flow from a breac h of c ontrac t. Lord Dunedin further elaborated on the princ iples to be applied when c onstruing suc h a c lause as follows ( _Dunlop_ at 87–88): 

 (a) It will be held to be penalty if the sum stipulated for is extravagant and unc onsc ionable in amount in c omparison with the greatest loss that c ould c onc eivably be proved to have followed from the breac h. ... 

 (b) It will be held to be a penalty if the breac h c onsists only in not paying a sum of money, and the sum stipulated is a sum greater than the sum whic h ought to have been paid ... 

 (c ) There is a presumption (but no more) that it is a penalty when a single lump sum is made payable by way of c ompensation, on the oc c urrenc e of one or more or all of several events, some of whic h may oc c asion serious and others but trifling damage ... 

 (d) It is no obstac le to the sum stipulated being a genuine pre-estimate of damage that the c onsequenc es of the breac h are suc h as to make prec ise pre-estimation almost an impossibility. On the c ontrary, that is just the situation when it is probable that the pre-estimated damage was the true bargain between the parties ... 

**_The construction of cl 6.1._** 

26     I am unable to agree with the plaintiff’s c ase that c l 6.1.3 is a penal c lause. First, the plaintiff took inc onsistent positions. On the one hand, the plaintiff argued that, on an objec tive or proper c onstruc tion of the sec ond limb of c l 6.1.3, it was penal in nature; but on the other hand it argued that it understood c l 6.1.3 to mean that: 


 ... in the event the Plaintiff missed 3 payment dates and there were sums outstanding, the Defendant c ould draw down and retain the full amount of the BG until the ac tual sum outstanding was rec onc iled between parties, and the exc ess would be returned to the Plaintiff forthwith ... 

 [plaintiff’s c losing submissions at para 189] 

This latter interpretation was substantially the same as the position adopted by the defendant, whic h w a s _not_ seeking to retain any money over and above the payments whic h had fallen due and the post-termination damages whic h it had suffered as a result of the plaintiff’s breac h. Put another way, while an interpretation of c l 6.1.3 to the effec t that the defendant was allowed to draw down and retain the _full amount_ of US$2.5m without reduc tion for payments made by the plaintiff may or may not be penal in nature, this was not an interpretation adopted by the defendant and therefore not an interpretation I have to c onsider. Parenthetic ally, given the plaintiff’s denial of liability for posttermination damages, its interpretation of c l 6.1.3 did not c ontemplate the money drawn under the 1st BG being applied to post-termination damages. However, if I were to dec ide that post-termination damages are payable, I do not think the plaintiff would have reason to objec t to the defendant being allowed to set off the balanc e of suc h moneys against post-termination damages. Henc e, while it is true that the defendant’s position on this issue was not entirely c lear from its pleadings or at the start of the trial, the fac t of the matter is that there is no longer any substantial divergenc e between the parties’ understanding of c l 6.1.3. 

27     Sec ondly, in any event, the sum of the bank guarantees for the three c ontrac t years represented the total amount of payments due to the defendant as _per_ the sc hedule of events c ontained in Annex 4 of the Agreement. The maximum loss the defendant is potentially exposed to is not, as the plaintiff asserts, the sum of three missed payments; the defendant may be fac ed with the loss of more than three instalments over the entire c ontrac t period, and possibly also posttermination damages. Eac h bank guarantee in forc e under c l 6.1.3 would thus represent a genuine pre-estimate of the total loss that may befall the defendant. 

28     Finally, I agree with the defendant that there is no suggestion of oppression here. I would add that I do not think there is muc h signific anc e to the fac t that Mr Ball had added the words “and retain” to c l 6.1.3. The plaintiff was legally advised when it entered into the Agreement and had the opportunity to review the doc ument before binding itself to it. Thus, c l 6.1.3 is _not_ a penalty c lause, and the plaintiff c annot seek restitutionary relief sinc e the Agreement had expressly provided for the retention by the defendant of the US$2.5m drawn under the 1st BG. The defendant is entitled to retain the payments due to it whic h had not been made, as well as damages (if any). 

**Whether the defendant is entitled to post-termination damages** 

29     Although there is no issue that the defendant had validly terminated the Agreement, the question now arises as to whether there was, under c ommon law, a repudiatory breac h by the plaintiff allowing the defendant to c laim post-termination damages. 

**_The parties’ arguments_** 

30     The gist of the defendant’s c ounterc laim was this: The plaintiff’s failure to pay amounts due to the defendant and/or to provide the 2nd BG either on time or at all were breac hes that entitled the defendant to terminate the Agreement under c ommon law. Therefore, the plaintiff was liable to the defendant for post-termination damages. This assertion was supported by the following fac tors. To begin with, the plaintiff had never disputed the defendant’s termination of the Agreement nor had it pleaded that it was not in repudiatory breac h of the Agreement. In any c ase, the c onstruc tion of 


the Agreement as a whole rendered both terms c onditions of the Agreement, the breac h of whic h would entitle the defendant to repudiate the Agreement under c ommon law. From the language of the Agreement itself, time was expressly made of the essenc e in relation to both the plaintiff’s payment obligation and the provision of the bank guarantee, and both terms gave rise to a right of termination under the Agreement. Additionally, the provision of the bank guarantees was fundamental to the Agreement bec ause they sec ured the “very essenc e” of the Agreement and protec ted the defendant from being financ ially exposed to non-payment by the plaintiff. For this reason, the plaintiff’s suggestion to provide the 2nd BG after the 1st BG had expired was c ontrary to the parties’ express understanding that the bank guarantees were designed to overlap. With regard to the plaintiff’s payment obligation, Mr Mohan submitted that the enc ashment of the 1st BG did not equate to “rec tific ation of the breac h” as the Agreement did not c ontemplate payment by way of a bank guarantee to be the same as payment by the plaintiff for the Minimum Guaranteed amount. 

31     Mr Mohan argued that based on the English Court of Appeal dec ision in _Lombard North Central Plc v Butterworth_ [1987] QB 527 (“ _Lombard_ ”), the defendant was entitled to post-termination damages. He sought to distinguish an earlier English Court of Appeal dec ision in _Financings Ltd v Baldock_ [1963] 2 QB 104 (“ _Financings_ ”) on the basis that the latter did not involve a repudiatory breac h. 

32     Although Mr Fong did not dispute that the Agreement was validly terminated, he submitted that the defendant was to blame for the plaintiff’s non-payment bec ause it had failed to provide proper Telec ast Certific ates. He argued that the mere phrase “time is of the essenc e”, without more, was insuffic ient to transform an ordinary term into a c ondition. On that basis, he argued that the dec ision of _Lombard_ should be distinguished from the present c ase. Further, the enc ashment of the 1st BG had rec tified the plaintiff’s non-payment within the stipulated time given in the defendant’s sec ond default notic e of 20 May 2008. Mr Fong argued that those fac tors supported the plaintiff’s position that it had never intended to repudiate the Agreement and there was in any c ase no substantial deprivation by the delayed payment. With regard to the provision of the 2nd BG, Mr Fong asserted that the plaintiff had made best efforts to proc ure the 2nd BG and these efforts should have been ac c epted by the defendant. There was also, he submitted, no substantial deprivation of the whole of the benefit of the Agreement as a result of the failure to provide the 2nd BG. 

**_The law on damages for loss of bargain_** 

33     It is by now well-established that a breac h of c ontrac t will entitle the innoc ent party to terminate the c ontrac t where it falls within one of the four situations laid out in _RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd and another appeal_ [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 (“ _RDC Concrete_ ”). Briefly, the situations inc lude: 

 (a) where the c ontrac tual term c learly and unambiguously states that the innoc ent party is entitled to terminate upon the oc c urrenc e of an event (Situation 1); 

 (b) where the party in breac h by its words or c onduc t renounc es the c ontrac t (Situation 2); 

 (c ) where the term breac hed is a c ondition of the c ontrac t under the “c ondition-warranty approac h” (Situation 3(a)); and 

 (d) where the breac h of a term deprives the innoc ent party of substantially the whole benefit intended under the c ontrac t (Situation 3(b) or “the Hongkong Fir approac h”). 

34     The foc us in Situation 3(a) is on the nature of the term breac hed whereas the foc us in 


Situation 3(b) is on the nature and c onsequenc es of the breac h. The Court of Appeal c onc luded in _RDC Concrete_ at [106] that the approac h in Situation 3(a) takes prec edenc e over the approac h in Situation 3(b) bec ause the foremost c onsideration must be to give effec t to the c ontrac ting parties’ intention (see also Lord Wilberforc e’s speec h in _Bunge Corporation, New York v Tradax Export SA, Panama_ [1981] 1 WLR 711 at 726 (“ _Bunge v Tradax_ ”)). In _Sports Connection Pte Ltd v Deuter Sports GmbH_ [2009] 3 SLR(R) 883 (“ _Sports Connection_ ”), the Court of Appeal went further to explain that Situations 1 and 3(a) were substantially the same, only that Situation 1 was a more explic it way of c harac terising a situation that would otherwise fall within Situation 3(a). 

35     This observation raises an interesting issue. Currently, where a c ontrac t is terminated pursuant to an express provision alone, _ie_ , under Situation 1, damages for loss of bargain may be rec overable only if there is a c onc urrent repudiatory breac h under c ommon law: see Lord Nic holls’ speec h in _Lombard_ ([31] _supra_ ) at 546 whic h was reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal in _Sports Connection_ at [55] (see also _Tan Wee Fong v Denieru Tatsu F&B Holdings (S) Pte Ltd_ [2009] SGHC 290 (unreported) at [31]–[35]). On the other hand, without a repudiatory breac h under c ommon law, the innoc ent party may not c laim for damages arising after the c ontrac t’s termination (see generally _Financings_ ), although it will still be entitled to rec over damages in respec t of the loss it suffered at or before the date of termination. But if Situation 1 is substantially the same as Situation 3(a), then this bifurc ated princ iple would make no sense. It is artific ial to ask what is the nature of a term under c ommon law where there is within the c ontrac t an express provision stating that the breac h of that term would give the innoc ent party the right to terminate. This quandary was also rec ognised in Brian R Opeskin’s artic le, “Damages for Breac h of Contrac t Terminated under Express Terms” [1990] LQR 106 (Apr) 293. 

36     The diffic ulty stems from the dec ision in _Lombard_ ([31] _supra_ ), whic h c aused some unease bec ause it seemed to undermine the earlier dec ision in _Financings_ ([31] _supra_ ), where Lord Denning expressed his hesitanc e at awarding damages for the loss of bargain when the c onsequenc es of the breac h were ac tually very minor. The fac ts of the two c ases best illustrate the artific iality of the bifurc ated princ iple. In _Financings_ , the defendant entered into a hire purc hase c ontrac t for a truc k, under whic h he was obliged to make a down-payment and several instalment payments. The c ontrac t provided that any failure to pay within ten days of the due date entitled the owner to terminate the hiring and c all for a minimum payment equivalent to the remainder of the instalments. The defendant failed to meet two instalment payments and the c ontrac t was terminated. However, damages for the loss of bargain were held to be irrec overable bec ause the defendant’s failure to pay only two inst alment s was not a wrongful repudiation or a breac h of a c ondition. This was regarded as an eminently fair result bec ause the defendant’s non-payment was regarded as a very minor breac h whic h c ould not possibly have entitled the plaintiff to c laim for _all_ the future instalments payable. The fac ts of _Lombard_ were essentially the same with one key differenc e. The defendant entered into a hire-purc hase c ontrac t for a c omputer, but time was stipulated to be “of the essenc e” in relation to the defendant’s payment obligations. The defendant defaulted, and Lord Nic holls found, “with c onsiderable dissatisfac tion”, that the drafting of the c ontrac t in _Lombard_ meant the c ourt had to regard the lateness of the payment as going to the root of the c ontrac t, thereby obliging the c ourt to awarding damages for the loss of bargain even though there was no prac tic al differenc e with the c ontrac t in _Financings_. The plaintiff had suc c eeded in terminating and c laiming damages for the loss of the whole bargain for what was, in the c ourt’s opinion at least, an inc onsequential breac h. 

37     Professor G H Trietel suggests, in his c ase c omment on _Lombard_ , “Damages on Resc ission for Breac h of Contrac t” [1987] 2 LMCLQ 143 at pp 144–145, that a distinc tion should be drawn between terms whic h are c lassified by law as c onditions bec ause of the likelihood that the breac h will c ause serious prejudic e to the injured party; and terms expressly c lassified by the parties to be c onditions whic h may not have suc h a tendenc y. The c onc ern raised by Lord Nic holls in _Lombard_ c ould be avoided by awarding damages for loss of bargain only for breac hes falling under the first limb. 


However, Prof Trietel’s suggestion has yet to be adopted by the English c ourts. 

38     As it stands, therefore, the law permits the rec overy of post-termination damages simply on the basis that the parties have c lassified the term in question as a c ondition, regardless of the nature or c onsequenc es of the breac h. Here, the issue really is whether the term breac hed fell within either Situation 3(a) the c ondition-warranty approac h, or Situation 3(b), _ie_ , the _Hongkong Fir_ approac h. Under the c ondition-warranty approac h, the c ourt’s func tion is to determine the nature of the term. As was emphasised by the Court of Appeal in _Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd (formerly known as E D & F Man International (S) Pte Ltd) v Wong Bark Chuan David_ [2008] 1 SLR(R) 663 (“ _Man Financial_ ”), there is no magic formula enabling a c ourt to determine if a c ontrac tual term is a c ondition. The foc us must be on (see [161]): 

 ... ascertaining the intention of the contracting parties themselves by construing the actual contract itself (including the contractual term concerned) in the light of the surrounding circumstances as a whole ... [emphasis in original] 

Fac tors whic h c ould assist the c ourt inc lude: (a) statutory provisions; (b) the express c lassific ation by the parties; (c ) prior prec edents; (d) the nature of the transac tion. 

39     Interestingly, the Court of Appeal in _Man Financial_ read _L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd_ [1974] AC 235 (“ _Schuler_ ”) – a c ase normally c ited for the proposition that the express language of a c ontrac tual term may not be determinative of its nature – as being c onsistent with the _Hongkong Fir_ approac h/Situation 3(b) of _RDC Concrete_ ([33] _supra_ ). Following _RDC Concrete_ , the Court of Appeal took the view that the intention of the parties (pursuant to the c ondition-warranty approac h) ought to take prec edenc e, a view whic h it c onsidered was shared by the dec isions of the House of Lords after _Schuler_ , suc h as _Bunge v Tradax_ ([34] _supra_ ). Thus, if it is c lear from the express language of a partic ular c ontrac tual provision that it is meant to be a c ondition, then the c ourt must give effec t to the c ontrac ting parties’ intention in so c lassifying that partic ular term. 

**_Whether there was a repudiatory breach under common law_** 

40     The relevant c lauses are c l 6.1.1, governing the instalment payments, and c l 6.1.2.2, governing the provision of the 2nd BG. Both these provisions are governed by the stipulation that “time is of the essenc e” in c ll 6.1.3 and 6.3.4. As disc ussed in the prec eding paragraph, the c ourts must give effec t to the parties’ intention, and if the parties agree that a partic ular c ontrac tual term is a c ondition, then that is the interpretation that must be given to that provision. Viewed in isolation, punc tual payment will ordinarily not be regarded as a c ondition of the c ontrac t: see for example, _Financings_ ([31] _supra_ ) and more rec ently, _Alliance Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd v Comfort Resources Pte Ltd_ [2009] 4 SLR(R) 602. However, the c ourts have c onsistently interpreted stipulations that “time is of the essenc e” to mean that parties have agreed that a failure by one party to perform within the stipulated time would entitle the other party to terminate the c ontrac t: _Lombard_ ([31] _supra_ ); _Steedman v Drinkle_ [1916] 1 AC 275. It is not an unfamiliar term to lawyers. The applic ability of this prec edent is not entirely without diffic ulty and there may be an element of surprise where it is applied to obligations to pay in c onsumer c ontrac ts: see Edwin Peel, _Treitel, The Law of Contract_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2007) at paras 18-069 and 18-090 where the author disc usses _Lombard_ in some detail. However, where both parties are c ommerc ial entities, having had the benefit of legal advic e and the opportunity to negotiate before entering into a c ontrac t, then c learly the c ompelling interpretation is that the _nature_ of both c ll 6.1.1 and 6.1.2.2 are c onditions, pursuant to the c ondition-warranty approac h. 

41     Even looking at the _consequences_ of the breac h, _ie_ , t he _Hongkong Fir_ approac h, the plaintiff 


was also in repudiatory breac h. Despite multiple extensions of time granted by the defendant for the 31 Marc h 2008 deadline (whic h took into ac c ount the fac t that new Telec ast Certific ates were issued, see above at [8]), the plaintiff failed to make payment for Invoic e No 74 and had previously been late in making payment for several other invoic es (see above at [7]). Further, the plaintiff did not c hallenge the defendant’s drawing upon the 1st BG, whic h was an admission that it had missed three payment dates over the entire c ontrac t period. 

42     The enc ashment of the 1st BG does not amount to a rec tific ation of the breac h. First, this is c ontrary to c l 6.1.3 – any rec tific ation must have been for the purpose of avoiding the termination of the Agreement. Sinc e the drawing of a bank guarantee was in itself a ground for termination, it c ould not at the same time operate as a means of rec tifying the plaintiff’s misc onduc t. Sec ondly, even if it absolved the plaintiff from liability for instalments it had yet to pay, the enc ashment did nothing towards c uring the failure to provide the 2nd BG. Lastly, the enc ashment was not a means of rec tific ation in the c ontemplation of the parties. When the sec ond default notic e was sent on 30 May 2008, the plaintiff was aware that the defendant had initiated the proc ess of enc ashing the 1st BG and that payment by HSBC to the defendant was imminent. The sec ond default notic e should be interpreted in this c ontext. Rec tific ation c ould not have been by way of the defendant’s rec eipt of money pursuant to the 1st BG sinc e both parties knew the enc ashment proc ess was already under way. There would have been no need to send the sec ond default notic e asking for rec tific ation if indeed enc ashment was the remedy sought by the defendant. 

43     Independently, the requirement for the provision of the 2nd BG also appears to me to be in the nature of a c ondition. The purpose of the bank guarantee is to provide the defendant sec urity against financ ial exposure. It is fair to say that the Agreement may not have been entered into if there had not been adequate protec tion for the defendant against suc h risk. The Agreement expressly and unambiguously provided for the terms and duration of eac h bank guarantee. The plaintiff’s argument that it was taken by surprise by HSBC’s unwillingness to provide overlapping bank guarantees is patently unsupportable. Likewise, I find diffic ulty in understanding the plaintiff’s suggestion that the overlap in bank guarantees was not foreseeable or that suc h a fac t should have been highlighted to it. Both parties were legally advised and the plaintiff had ample time to review the terms of the Agreement. Whatever the c ommerc ial c onsiderations behind the parties’ eventual dec ision to struc ture the provision relating to the bank guarantees as suc h, I do not think that the plaintiff c ould turn and say that it was surprised when the nature of its obligations were fully c ontained within the c ontrac tual provisions. It goes without saying that it is inc umbent on the plaintiff to meet its obligations and any hurdles whic h it c annot surmount in the proc ess would be no exc use to its nonperformanc e (unless, of c ourse, the c irc umstanc es allow it to plead one of the legally rec ognised exc eptions, suc h as frustration). 

44     As shown by the c orrespondenc e on rec ord, the parties had nearly, but not quite, reac hed an agreement to allow the plaintiff to provide the 2nd BG on 1 June 2008, immediately after the expiry of the 1st BG on 31 May 2008. Unfortunately for the plaintiff, the proposal from HSBC c ontained in its letter of 2 April 2008 (see above at [11]) was ultimately rejec ted by the defendant on 10 April 2008. The plaintiff asserted that it had, in substanc e if not in form, c omplied with the defendant’s offer to restruc ture the provision of the bank guarantees. However, Mr Shah himself had ac knowledged that no agreement was reac hed for the provision of the 2nd BG and that he was attempting to reac h a c ompromise on the issue right up till the eventual termination of the Agreement. 

45     I should add for good measure that it does not matter if the plaintiff always had an intention to make payments or to provide the 2nd BG. The Agreement c alled for performanc e and the plaintiff’s c ontinued failure to do so leads me to the c onc lusion that it had c ommitted a repudiatory breac h of the Agreement under c ommon law, whether looking at the nature of the term or the severity of the 


breac h, entitling the defendant to damages for the loss of bargain. 

**Whether the plaintiff was obliged to pay for the 3 Uninvoiced Events** 

46     Sinc e I have determined that the plaintiff’s breac h was repudiatory and that the defendant is entitled to post-termination damages, it is not stric tly nec essary to c onsider whether the plaintiff was obliged to pay for the 3 Uninvoic ed Events. Nevertheless, in view of the lengthy arguments advanc ed by both parties, I shall deal with this issue. Before addressing the bulk of the parties’ arguments, it should be noted that while Mr Fong in his submissions suggested that payment c ould not be due unless an invoic e was issued, Mr Merc hant had already admitted, during c ross-examination, that there was no requirement for the defendant to issue an invoic e to the plaintiff to “ac tivate the payments”. 

**_The parties’ arguments_** 

47     Mr Fong made the following arguments in support of his c ontention that the defendant was not entitled to payment for the 3 Uninvoic ed Events. With respec t to the BCB Bangladesh _v_ South Afric a event, no advertising inventory was sold by the plaintiff and no Telec ast Certific ates were issued to the plaintiff; there was no c onsideration provided and therefore the plaintiff’s payment obligation did not arise. The parties: 

 ... had for all purposes agreed to waive the entire [Minimum Guaranteed] amount for this event, as evinc ed in the meetings of the 3 Marc h 2008 meeting. 

 [plaintiff’s c losing submissions at para 273] 

It was further admitted that: 

 ... the Defendant’s representatives at the meeting did not have suffic ient power to bind the Defendant without obtaining formal board approval ... 

 [plaintiff’s c losing submissions at para 274] 

although Mr Fong c ontended that this requirement c ould not be established without Mr Das’s evidenc e. With respec t to the BCB Kitply Triseries event, Mr Fong submitted that the c ric ket matc hes took plac e _after_ termination, Telec ast Certific ates were not provided, and the plaintiff was not allowed to sell advertising inventory after the defendant terminated the Agreement. Mr Fong went further to assert that many pre-termination bookings by the plaintiff’s c lients were c anc elled as news 

of the defendant’s termination was leaked. [note: 3] This was based on Mr Merc hant’s testimony during c ross-examination that bookings for advertising inventory would normally be made all the way through to the last few days of an event and that the news was out in the market that the defendant was terminating the Agreement. However, this explanation appeared to be an after-thought made only during c ross-examination and was not inc luded in any of Mr Merc hant’s affidavits. Finally, with respec t to the BCCI Minimum Guaranteed sum for June 2008, Mr Fong argued that no c onsideration was given to the plaintiff for this payment. 

48     Mr Mohan maintained that the plaintiff was liable for payment for the 3 Uninvoic ed Events. Generally, he argued that there was no failure of c onsideration for any of the 3 Uninvoic ed Events sinc e: 

 (a) there was no dispute that the plaintiff’s payment obligations arose irrespec tive of whether the defendant had issued an invoic e to the plaintiff; 


 (b) the events were broadc ast; and 

 (c ) the advertising inventory was aired. 

With respec t to the BCB Bangladesh _v_ South Afric a event, Mr Mohan submitted that there was no minimum notic e period to sell advertising inventory for eac h event and Mr Merc hant had admitted to the fac t that the plaintiff had requested a waiver of payment for this event pre-supposed that it was under an obligation to pay. In any c ase, the meeting of 3 Marc h 2008 did not amount to a waiver, the minutes of the meeting explic itly stated that suc h waiver would only be c onsidered by the defendant upon rec eipt of the plaintiff’s written request and the plaintiff had c onc eded that suc h a written request was never made. Further, it was illogic al for the plaintiff to insist on a blank Telec ast Certific ate sinc e it did not sell any advertising inventory for this event and would not be c ollec ting any money from its c lients. With respec t to the BCB Kitply Triseries event, Mr Mohan submitted that the plaintiff had failed to plead that it was not given the full benefit of the event and that it was entirely unc onsc ionable for the defendant to seek payment of the full Minimum Guaranteed amount. The plaintiff had also failed to adduc e evidenc e that its existing bookings were affec ted by the termination of the Agreement or that it had diffic ulty in c ollec ting payment due to the lac k of proper Telec ast Certific ates. In fac t, it c ontinued to send c ue sheets to the defendant via e-mail from 7 to 10 June 2008, although the Agreement was terminated on 5 June 2008. 

**_BCB Kitply Triseries / The Kitply Cup (US$325,000)_** 

49     The Kitply Cup took plac e from 8 to 14 June 2008, _after_ the plaintiff had sent its Letter of Termination on 5 June 2008. The Letter of Termination spec ified that the plaintiff was not allowed to sell advertising inventory for the Kitply Cup post-termination and only bookings made before termination would be honoured by Nimbus. Sinc e the plaintiff had, in fac t, an opportunity to sell some of the advertising inventory for this event, it would not be open to it to c laim there was a total failure of c onsideration. As pointed out by the defendant, the plaintiff had not adduc ed evidenc e aside from Mr Merc hant’s testimony given at the very late stage of c ross-examination that its c lients had resc inded their purc hases of advertising inventory upon learning that the defendant intended to terminate the Agreement. No doc uments were provided for this assertion. While the defendant had forbidden the plaintiff from c ontinuing to sell advertising inventory for the Kitply Cup, it is not c lear at all from the evidenc e that the plaintiff had ac tually c eased selling advertising inventory. In any event, at the very most there may have been a partial failure of c onsideration. 

50     Another argument raised by Mr Fong was the defendant’s alleged failure to provide proper Telec ast Certific ates (only unstamped Telec ast Certific ates were provided by the defendant). As with the India _v_ Pakistan series, the plaintiff requested for Telec ast Certific ates “in the proper form”, _ie_ , stamped Telec ast Certific ates. During c ross-examination, Mr Ball c onfirmed that the defendant had, to date, not responded to suc h a request. I do not think this was fatal to the defendant’s c laim. At trial, Mr Thomas testified that the industry prac tic e within the Middle East was to provide stamped Telec ast Certific ates and Neo Sports was aware of this prac tic e. However, aside from Mr Thomas’s testimony, no evidenc e of suc h industry prac tic e was provided. The only oc c asion on whic h stamped Telec ast Certific ates were evidently provided was the India _v_ Pakistan series ( _ie_ , Invoic e No 74), and that was upon Mr Thomas’s request. That request c ould be seen as a c omplaint that the defendant had ac ted c ontrary to the established prac tic e between the part ies, _ie_ , by providing Telec ast Certific ates in “improper” form, or it might simply reflec t an _ad hoc_ arrangement for the partic ular event. There is no evidenc e either way and it would be a stretc h to find that the defendant had ac ted c ontrary to the established prac tic e based on the language of Mr Thomas’s request alone. What is c lear is that the Agreement itself did not provide for a fixed format and, aside from Invoic e No 74, there was no prior rec ord of a request for a stamped Telec ast Certific ate. 


51     Henc e, it is not c lear to me that the plaintiff’s obligation to make payment only arose upon the defendant’s provision of a stamped Telec ast Certific ate. Nothing in the express language of the Agreement or the c irc umstanc es surrounding how the Agreement was ac tually c arried out pointed to this c onc lusion. Previous invoic es had been met without the plaintiff insisting on stamping the Telec ast Certific ates. Notably, even after the plaintiff’s diffic ulty in c ollec ting payment for Invoic e No 74, there was no variation to the Agreement to make c lear what form the Telec ast Certific ate should take. The plaintiff c annot now rely on the absenc e of stamping of the Telec ast Certific ates to evade its payment obligations. 

52     Both parties have adopted an “all or nothing” approac h. The defendant c onc entrated on the fac t that the plaintiff had ac tually sold advertising inventory for the event, even adduc ing c ue sheets submitted after 5 June 2008, without regard to the fac t that it had forbidden the plaintiff to make further sales after termination of the Agreement. The plaintiff, on the other hand, insisted it was not liable to make _any_ payment for the Kitply Cup at all; it did not admit that it had the opportunity to and did in fac t sell some advertising inventory for this event. It also did not seek to c hallenge the applic ability of the 1st BG with respec t to the payment for the Kitply Cup. The plaintiff has not shown that there was a total failure of c onsideration. It had been given the opportunity to sell the advertising inventory and the advertisements were in fac t aired; there is no room for the plaintiff to assert that it had been denied the bargain it had entered into; at best there was a partial failure of c onsideration. The partial failure of c onsideration would not have entitled the plaintiff to deny the defendant payment for the partic ular event. On the other hand, it would be unjust for the defendant to insist upon stric t performanc e of the Agreement after having forbidden the plaintiff from selling advertising inventory after termination. A fair solution whic h I might have been tempted to attempt was an apportionment. Fortunately, on the view that I have taken, namely, that the plaintiff is liable for post-termination damages, it is not nec essary for me to embark on this exerc ise. As alluded to earlier at [19] and [26] above, even if stric tly speaking the defendant may not bring a c laim for the Kitply Cup as suc h, the money rec eived under the 1st BG c ould be applied towards post-termination damages (inc luding what would have been rec eived under the Kitply Cup). In the c irc umstanc es, I find on balanc e that the better view is that the defendant is entitled to the payment for the Kitply Cup. 

**_BCB Bangladesh v South Africa (US$105,000)_** 

53     The Agreement c learly c ontemplates the inc lusion of additional c ric ket events to the existing sc hedule provided in Annexure 2. Although c l 6.2 provided that a pro rata adjustment of the Minimum Guaranteed amount payable would be made upon the addition or reduc tion of c ric ket matc hes broadc ast by Neo Sports, there was no provision stipulating a minimum notic e period prior to the additional event in order for the plaintiff to sell advertising inventory, nor was the plaintiff given the option to rejec t the opportunity to sell the extra advertising inventory from additions to the sc hedule. Here, a distinc tion may be made with c l 4.1 whic h stipulated that the plaintiff had to give BCCI sponsors an exc lusive two-week negotiating period for the purc hase of exc lusive c ommerc ial airtime pac kages and/or broadc ast sponsorship, provided the defendant gave notic e prior to the event in question (although the ac tual time-frame for notific ation was ambiguous). As drafted, the Agreement would arguably allow Neo Sports to add a new event to the original sc hedule at the very last minute and still c ollec t payment from the plaintiff pursuant to c l 6.2. This situation may not have been within the c ontemplation of parties when they entered into the Agreement, sinc e the plaintiff c ould rec eive no tangible benefit if it was not given an opportunity to sell advertising inventory. From his e-mail on 12 February 2008, Mr Merc hant also seemed to be of two minds as to whether the plaintiff was obliged to pay. 

54     However, there was in any c ase c onsideration provided for this partic ular event. The plaintiff was given some time, from the notific ation by Mr Das on 6 February 2008 till the ac tual broadc ast 


beginning on 22 February 2008, to sell the advertising inventory to its c lients. The plaintiff had not shown that it had been c ompletely denied the opportunity to sell _any_ advertising inventory to its c lients but was billed under c l 6.2 nevertheless. (In that c ase there might c onc eivably be at least a partial failure of c onsideration.) Beyond Mr Fong’s assertion that in this c ase there was no possibility o f selling the advertising inventory, there is no evidenc e as to how long a period of time was suffic ient or reasonable for suc h sales to be c onduc ted. It may well be that the two weeks provided by Mr Das would ordinarily be suffic ient for the sale of advertising inventory to be c onc luded, but that for some other reason it c ould not be done in this instanc e. 

55     Contrary to Mr Fong’s submissions, I do not think there was any serious dispute that Mr Das lac ked the authority to bind the defendant to the alleged waiver. The minutes c learly rec orded that the defendant was not bound until formal board approval was given for a waiver, and I do not think the plaintiff c an seriously argue that the minutes were falsified or that the defendant had been bound by the representations of Mr Das. Ac c ordingly, there was no agreement between the parties to waive the payment for the Bangladesh _v_ South Afric a event and the plaintiff must be held to its c ontrac tual obligations under c l 6.2. 

**_BCCI – Minimum Guarantee for June 2008 (US$29,167)_** 

56     The BCCI Minimum Guaranteed amount for June 2008 was part of the sc heduled payments, spread over the entire c ontrac t year, for the domestic c ric ket matc hes broadc ast by Neo Sports. The plaintiff submitted that bec ause no advertising inventory was sold by the plaintiff for June 2008, there was no c onsideration for this payment. In my view, this was not tenable. Consideration for the payments c annot be separated ac c ording to eac h monthly instalment bec ause this was not how the Agreement was struc tured. Unlike the international events where a c ertain Minimum Guaranteed sum was attributed to eac h individual event and payment was dependent on the broadc ast of the event in question; there was no breakdown of the c ost of eac h domestic series: domestic c ric ket matc hes were not evenly spread over the c ontrac t year. Payment for the domestic series, however, was to be made in equal monthly instalments over the c ontrac t year (as c an be seen from Annexure 4 of the Agreement ). Therefore eac h monthly instalment payment did not nec essarily c orrespond to a partic ular domestic series. Even if the plaintiff was deprived of the opportunity to sell advertising inventory for the domestic series broadc ast after the defendant’s termination of the Agreement, it was diffic ult to imagine there being a total failure of c onsideration given that the payment due in June 2008 c ould not be said to have arisen from any one partic ular domestic series. The June 2008 payment was only part of a series of payments promised in exc hange for the right to sell advertising inventory for _all_ the domestic c ric ket events for that c ontrac t year. The plaintiff is not absolved of its responsibility to make payment. 

57     Neither party addressed the question when in June 2008 the payment was to be made. If it was after termination on 5 June 2008, the plaintiff would not have been required to make suc h payment sinc e termination of the Agreement released both parties from further performanc e of the Agreement (but without prejudic e to rights arising by reason of the repudiatory breac h). However, this is not an argument I have to c onsider bec ause of the view that I have taken that post-termination damages are payable. 

**Conclusion** 

58     In the result, the plaintiff’s c laim is dismissed and the defendant’s c ounterc laim is allowed in eac h c ase with c osts. The plaintiff failed to establish that c l 6.1.3 should be struc k down as a penalty. There is therefore no room for it to c laim unjust enric hment. Its breac h of the Agreement was repudiatory whether under the express stipulations or under c ommon law and, as a result, the 


defendant is entitled to c laim post-termination damages. The damages are to be assessed by the registrar. The amount drawn under the 1st BG is to be applied not only to default payments but to the damages assessed. 

[note: 1] (^) Mr Das wrote an email on 18 April 2008 to Mr Shah explaining that “due to late TVR c ertific ate delivery to them”, the payment obligation only arose on 22 Marc h 2008, although this was amended to 31 Marc h 2008 by agreement: see 3AB.882. [note: 2] (^) It argued that Mr Merc hant had in fac t adopted that position during his c ross-examination: see 4NOE pp 40–41.
