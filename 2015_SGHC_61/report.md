**Introduction** 

1       This is my judgment in respec t of the anc illary matters in Divorc e Transfer No 708 of 2012. The hearing of the anc illary matters was transferred to the High Court on 29 January 2014 bec ause the defendant-wife (“the Defendant”) dec lared that the value of the matrimonial assets exc eeded $1.5m. I first pause to observe that the parties disagree on the total size of the pool of matrimonial assets. The Defendant asserts that a sum of $958,517.50, ac c rued from various property investments, ought to be added to the pool, taking the size of the matrimonial pool to a sum about $1.5m. The plaintiffhusband (“the Plaintiff”) denies that suc h a sum exists and c onsequently asserts that the matrimonial pool is c orrespondingly smaller (and below $1.5m). By way of a c onsent order dated 7 Dec ember 

2012, [note: 1] the parties agreed on joint c ustody of the two c hildren with c are and c ontrol awarded to the Defendant and liberal ac c ess granted to the Plaintiff, subjec t to the availability of the c hildren and their wishes. The c onsent order also provided for interim maintenanc e to be paid for the c hildren’s upkeep. From the date of the order, the Plaintiff has been paying monthly maintenanc e amounting to $1,000 for the two c hildren. The issues that fall to be dec ided in this applic ation are (a) the division of the matrimonial assets; and (b) the final quantum of maintenanc e to be paid in respec t of the Defendant and the c hildren. 

2       After hearing the parties, my dec ision is that the Plaintiff’s share in the matrimonial home, a c ondominium unit loc ated in the west of Singapore (“the matrimonial home”), is to be transferred to the Defendant. The Defendant is to bear the c osts of this transfer but she will otherwise not be required to provide any c onsideration to the Plaintiff nor will she be required to make any refund to the Plaintiff’s Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) ac c ount. The remaining assets owned by the parties shall remain in their respec tive names. As for the issue of maintenanc e, I order that the Plaintiff pay the Defendant a nominal sum of $1 per month. The maintenanc e for the two c hildren shall be inc reased from the interim sum of $1,000 per month to a sum of $1,400 per month with effec t from the date of this judgment. I now set out the reasons for my dec ision. 

**Background facts** 

**_The parties_** 


**_The parties_** 

3       The parties married on 30 September 1995, when the Plaintiff and the Defendant were 20 years old and 19 years old, respec tively. The parties have two sons, aged 8 and 15 respec tively. After 17 years of marriage, the Plaintiff filed for divorc e. Interim judgment was granted on 26 November 2012. [note: 2] 

4       The Plaintiff is 39 years old and has a polytec hnic diploma. [note: 3] He is presently self

employed and runs a general import and export c ompany (“the Company”). [note: 4] The Plaintiff 

asserts that he has no inc ome and the Company is not making any profit as it is new. [note: 5] I highlight at the outset that I have my doubts as to the verac ity of the Plaintiff’s assertion that he has no inc ome. This is highly unlikely given that the Company has been operating sinc e 2012. Further, 

in his previous job as a sales manager, the Plaintiff was earning a monthly salary of $11,000. [note: 6] 

5       The Defendant is 38 years old and is a graduate with a degree in Business Financ e. She is a 

real estate agent and earns a monthly inc ome of $5,468.08. [note: 7] I note that in the Defendant’s written submissions of 23 August 2013, it is stated that she is a senior assoc iate direc tor in another real estate c ompany. 

6       In 2010, the Plaintiff moved out of the matrimonial home to reside in another c ondominium unit, also loc ated in the west of Singapore (“the sec ond c ondominium unit”) whic h he had purc hased. Subsequently, sometime in 2012 or 2013, the Plaintiff moved to the Philippines and has been residing there sinc e. Whilst the evidenc e as to when the Plaintiff moved to the Philippines is c onfusing, there is no doubt that he was residing there at the time of the hearing (and had, in all likelihood, been residing there for some time). The Plaintiff makes oc c asional trips to Singapore to visit the c hildren. [note: 8] The Defendant and the two c hildren presently reside in the matrimonial home. As at 2 April 

2013, the Plaintiff’s parents also resided in the matrimonial home together with the Defendant and the c hildren. 

**Overview of the Proceedings** 

7       Divorc e proc eedings were c ommenc ed in the Subordinate Courts (now the State Courts) and an interim judgment was delivered on 26 November 2012. On 7 Dec ember 2012, a c onsent order dealing with c ustody, c are and c ontrol and ac c ess over the c hildren and their interim maintenanc e was made (see [1] above). 

8       In July 2013, both parties filed their respec tive Dec larations of the Value of Matrimonial Assets. It will be rec alled that the Plaintiff estimated that the net value of the matrimonial assets was below $1.5m whereas the Defendant’s estimate was that the sum exc eeded $1.5m (see [1] above). Thereafter, the parties filed their respec tive Anc illary Matters Fac t and Position Sheets as well as their respec tive affidavits. I pause here to note that, in his Anc illary Matters Fac t and Position Sheet of 21 August 2013, the Plaintiff dec lared, _inter alia_ , that he had lost his employment as a sales manager in Marc h 2012 and that the business that he started had yet to make money as it was new. 

9       Initially, the parties filed two affidavits eac h. Subsequently, the Defendant filed a Request for Interrogatories on 30 April 2013 in whic h she sought information on transac tions and dealings in respec t of a number of properties whic h were said to be part of the pool of matrimonial assets. The Plaintiff’s brief responses were set out in his Answers to Interrogatories dated 17 May 2013. 

Immediately prec eding that, on 15 May 2013, the Plaintiff filed a 3rd affidavit in whic h he stated, _inter_ alia, that the estimated value of the Company was $30,000 but that it was still not turning a profit. 


The Defendant responded by way of a 3rd affidavit dated 1 July 2013 whic h was, in turn, followed by 

the Plaintiff’s 4th affidavit dated 12 November 2013. 

10     The anc illary proc eedings were transferred to the High Court on 29 January 2014. The matter c ame before me on 21 April 2014. The hearing was adjourned to allow the parties to file a further affidavit in respec t of the c ontributions they eac h c laimed to have made to the two properties: _viz_ , the matrimonial home and the sec ond c ondominium unit. In his further affidavit of 4 June 2014, the Plaintiff explained that he was able to purc hase the sec ond c ondominium unit bec ause of the savings he had ac c umulated during his time as a sales manager. The Defendant’s further affidavit was filed on 24 July 2014. The adjourned hearing took plac e before me on 12 January 2015. 

**Division of matrimonial assets** 

11     I shall first address the issue of the division of matrimonial assets. The law in this area is c lear. Pursuant to s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”), the c ourt has a wide disc retion to order a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets. Sec tion 112(2) of the WC sets out a non-exhaustive list of fac tors that the c ourt is to take into ac c ount. I will adopt the global assessment methodology in this c ase as I do not see any need for the separate apportionment of different c lasses of matrimonial assets. 

12     In _ATT v ATS_ <span class="citation">[2012] 2 SLR 859</span> at [15], the Court of Appeal endorsed a “broad-brush” approac h and helpfully summarised the steps that a c ourt take when ordering a division of matrimonial assets: 

 (a) first, delineate what exac tly c onstitutes the pool of matrimonial assets; 

 (b) sec ond, assess the value of the pool so that the c ourt’s deliberation c an be made with referenc e to a working quantum; 

 (c ) third, c onsider all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, inc luding but not limited to the fac tors listed in s 112(2) of the WC, partic ularly the direc t financ ial c ontributions as well as the indirec t financ ial c ontributions of eac h party, and thereby determine what is the just and equitable proportion; 

 (d) finally, asc ertain the most expedient means of exec uting the division in that proportion. 

**_Matrimonial assets_** 

13     The parties are unable to agree on the total value of the matrimonial assets. There are two areas of dispute. First, they disagree on whether the sec ond c ondominium unit, whic h was registered in the sole name of the Plaintiff, is a matrimonial asset. Sec ond, they disagree on whether substantial profits – possibly amounting to $958,517.50 – had been made as a result of investments in property over the years and, if so, whether these profits should be inc luded in the list of matrimonial assets. 

_The second condominium unit_ 

14     The first issue is easily resolved. Although the sec ond c ondominium unit is registered in the Plaintiff’s sole name, it is c learly a matrimonial asset bec ause it was ac quired during the parties’ marriage and thus falls squarely within the definition of a “matrimonial asset” found in s 112(10) of the WC. 

_Profits earned from property investments_ 


15     On the sec ond issue, the Defendant avers that she had relied on her expertise as a property agent in identifying luc rative property investment opportunities during the subsistenc e of the marriage. She further avers that the parties had dec ided to make joint investments pursuant to her rec ommendations so she is now entitled to a share in the profits made from these investments even though most of the properties were registered in the Plaintiff’s sole name or in the names of other parties (suc h as the Plaintiff’s parents), and not in her name. 

16     Regardless of whether the Defendant had ac tively c ontributed to the investments, any profits that were made are matrimonial assets given that they were ac quired during the marriage. The Defendant’s role in the investments will only be relevant at a subsequent stage when I c onsider her direc t or indirec t financ ial c ontributions. At this stage, the question to be determined is how muc h is to be added to the pool of matrimonial assets. 

17     Ac c ording to the Defendant, the following investments were made from 2007 to 2012: [note: 9] 

 ( a ) Another unit in the west of Singapore: purc hased in the Plaintiff’s name in September 2007 for $430,000 and sold in January 2008 at a profit of $123,230.34. 

 ( b ) A unit in “The Dew”: the option to purc hase was “flipped” in April 2008 at a profit of $28,000. 

 ( c ) A unit loc ated at Bloc k 9 Selegie Road: purc hased in the Plaintiff’s parents’ names in Dec ember 2008 at $285,000 and sold in June 2010 at a profit of $50,000. 

 ( d ) A unit loc ated in “Parc Oasis”: option to purc hase was “flipped” in Dec ember 2008 at a profit of $22,000. 

 ( e ) A unit loc ated at Bloc k 756 Upper Serangoon Road (“Upper Serangoon property”): purc hased in the Plaintiff’s name in May 2009 at $419,750 and sold in Marc h 2012 at a profit of $632,000. 

 (f ) A unit loc ated at Bloc k 29A Jalan Mas Puteh: purc hased in the Defendant’s name in a joint venture with one Dexter Lee (“Dexter”) in Oc tober 2009 for $555,000 and sold in Marc h 2010 at a profit of $125,000, whic h was shared with Dexter. 

18     The Defendant avers that a large proportion of the profits rec eived were kept by the Plaintiff. [note: 10] The parties originally had a joint ac c ount with the Development Bank of Singapore (“DBS”) 

where the proc eeds were deposited but this joint ac c ount was c losed in Marc h 2009. The Defendant avers that, thereafter, the Plaintiff deposited the profits in bank ac c ounts registered in his sole name. 

19     Although the Defendant is not able to furnish extensive doc umentary evidenc e surrounding the transac tions and the profits that were made, I am satisfied that the parties were ac tive in the purc hase and sale of properties as well as the “flipping” of options to purc hase. I am also satisfied that the parties made substantial profits from the transac tions. 

_Adverse inference against the Plaintiff_ 

20     At this junc ture, I think it apposite to say a few words about the Plaintiff’s c onduc t. I am of the view that the Plaintiff has not been forthc oming in disc losing his inc ome and assets. When questioned on the property transac tions, the Plaintiff either denied having any knowledge of the transac tions or stated that the Defendant is not entitled to any share in them as they were his personal investments. 


Despite the requests for interrogatories and disc overy from the Defendant, [note: 11] the Plaintiff has only provided bare denials or assertions and has ac c ounted neither for the amount of profits that were made nor the ways in whic h they have been spent. Further, I note that the Defendant also 

made a Request for Disc overy on 27 June 2013 [note: 12] whereby she sought disc overy of doc uments relating to the sec ond c ondominium unit as well as doc uments relating to the Plaintiff’s business and inc ome from his work in the Philippines. However, it does not appear that the Plaintiff replied to this request. 

21     The Plaintiff asserts that he does not have any other assets apart from the matrimonial home and the sec ond c ondominium unit, save for a Post Offic e Savings Bank (“POSB”) ac c ount c ontaining a 

mere sum of $2,176.75 as of 21 August 2013 and the money in his CPF ac c ount. [note: 13] He also avers that he has no inc ome at all. He explains that this is bec ause the Company, despite having been in operation for more than two years, makes no profits. He also deposes that he is no longer renting out the sec ond c ondominium unit and is henc e not rec eiving any rental inc ome. 

22     I do not believe the Plaintiff’s assertions regarding his financ ial status. I find it diffic ult to believe that he would be able to survive in a foreign c ountry and pay for his monthly expenses if he truly had no inc ome. Having c onsidered that the Plaintiff has a polytec hnic diploma and used to earn a sum of $11,000 every month before he was retrenc hed, I find that his assertion that he has no inc ome is not to be believed. The lac k of information as to his inc ome and savings also stands out for c omment. The Plaintiff did not furnish any doc umentary evidenc e to support his c laim of poor financ ial health. I also note in passing that the Plaintiff in his Affidavit of Assets and Means stated that he has 

arthritis, fatty liver, and hypertension with proteinuria. [note: 14] While a medic al report dated 20 September 2012 was provided, I note that there is no evidenc e that his health problems have impeded his ability to work. 

23     I am unimpressed by the Plaintiff’s failure to make full and frank disc losure of his assets and earnings and will be drawing an adverse inferenc e against him. The importanc e of the duty owed by eac h party to make full and frank disc losure of all relevant information in anc illary proc eedings c annot be overstated. If the c ourt is to ac hieve a just and equitable distribution of the matrimonial assets, it is vital that parties prepare the affidavits with the relevant supporting evidenc e: see _Sim Kim Heng Andrew v Wee Siew Gee_ <span class="citation">[2014] 1 SLR 1276</span> at [116]. After all, ss 112(2) and 114(1) of the WC require the c ourt to have regard to a myriad of fac tors inc luding the inc ome of the parties, their earning c apac ity, and other financ ial resourc es. These fac tors are important both to the question of the appropriate quantum of maintenanc e to be awarded as well as to the question of the appropriate division of matrimonial assets. 

24     With that being said, it does not follow that an adverse inferenc e must always be drawn when the evidenc e of financ ial c ontributions and assets appears to be inc omplete. Muc h will depend on the fac ts. In a long marriage where numerous financ ial transac tions and c ontributions were made many years ago, inc omplete doc umentation is to be expec ted. In the present c ase, the unsatisfac tory responses made by the Plaintiff to the request for information c oupled with the pauc ity of information as to his present financ ial assets, means and inc ome, lead me to the c onc lusion that it is proper to draw an adverse inferenc e against him. It is evident that the Plaintiff’s business interests are in the Philippines, whic h is where he appears to spend most of his time. Very little, if any, information has been provided as to the Company’s business, profits, losses and the Plaintiff’s earnings aside from the bare statement that the business is new and makes no profits. 

25     In _Koo Shirley v Mok Kong Chua Kenneth_ <span class="citation">[1989] 1 SLR(R) 244</span> (“ _Shirley Koo_ ”), the husband had left Singapore and was working in Japan. He dec lared a net monthly salary equivalent to $6,164 but 


 S/n Matrimonial Asset Value 

did not provide any information about his living allowanc es. Further, he did not provide any information about his net monthly inc ome (as distinguished from his salary). LP Thean J (as he then was) highlighted the husband’s failure to make full disc losure despite having been direc ted to do so by the c ourt, and held that he did not believe that the husband only earned a sum of $6,164 a month. One fac tor that led to this c onc lusion was the fac t that the husband (prior to his move to Japan) earned approximately $6,435 per month while he was employed in Singapore. The learned judge was of the view that the husband’s net monthly inc ome (as opposed to salary) from his employment in Japan must be more than what had been disc losed. Similarly, in _Chan Siew Fong v Chan Fook Kee_ <span class="citation">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 93</span> (“ _Chan Siew Fong_ ”), the Court of Appeal noted at [20] that the husband had settled in South Afric a and c ommented that he “was quite sec retive in his business ac tivities there.” The c ourt refused to ac c ept that he did not have any other assets apart from those he dec lared. 

26     Eac h c ase must, of c ourse, turn on its own fac ts. In the present c ase, I am satisfied that an adverse inferenc e should be drawn as the Plaintiff has not been forthc oming in making full and frank disc losure, partic ularly as regard the earnings from his business interests, both the Company he established in 2012 as well as his interests in the Philippines. 

27     In _NK v NL_ <span class="citation">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 743</span> (“ _NK v NL_ ”), the Court of Appeal held there are at least two c onsequenc es whic h may follow the drawing of an adverse inferenc e following non-disc losure. The first is that the c ourt may go on to determine the value of the undec lared assets, thereby adding to the pool of matrimonial assets available for division. The sec ond is that the c ourt may order a higher proportion of the known assets to be given to the other party. At [61] of _NK v NL_ , the Court of Appeal c autioned against “unnec essary spec ulation” in the determination of the value of the undisc losed assets and observed that, in some c irc umstanc es, it “might be more just and equitable (not to mention, prac tic al) to order a higher proportion of the known assets to be given to the wife” ( _NK v NL_ at [62]). 

28     In _Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy_ <span class="citation">[2011] 2 SLR 1157</span> (“ _Nancy Tay_ ”), the Court of Appeal endorsed its previous holding in _NK v NL_. At [66], the c ourt stated: 

 ... In the nature of things, whic hever approac h the c ourt adopts in suc h a situation, it is undoubtedly to a large extent spec ulative; whether it dec ides to give a value to what it c onsiders to be "undisc losed assets" or to give a higher perc entage of the disc losed assets to the other party. Either approac h would translate to giving something more to the other spouse by way of a spec ific sum. The very fac t that the c ourt is c onfronted with the problem of “undisc losed assets” means that the position is unc lear and far from c ertain. In the final analysis, it is for the c ourt to dec ide, in the light of the fac t-situation of eac h c ase, whic h approac h would in its view best ac hieve an equitable and just result. What must be c learly rec ognised is that when the c ourt makes suc h a determination it is not undertaking an exerc ise based on arithmetic but a judgmental exerc ise based, in part at least, on feel. 

29     In the light of the diffic ulty assoc iated with quantifying the amount of profits earned as well as the Plaintiff’s undisc losed assets and inc ome, the sec ond approac h is more appropriate in this c ase. I will therefore inc rease the overall proportion of the matrimonial assets awarded to the Defendant. 

_List of matrimonial assets and their values_ 

30     The undisputed matrimonial assets and their gross values are set out in the following table: 


 1 Matrimonial Home (joint names) $1,300,000 [note: 15] 

 (per the Plaintiff’s valuation, whic h is the higher of the two) 

 2 The sec ond c ondominium unit (the Plaintiff’s sole name) $1,000,000 [note: 16] 

 3 The Plaintiff’s POSB Savings Ac c ount $2,176.75 [note: 17] 

 (as at 21 August 2013) 

 4 The Plaintiff’s CPF ac c ounts: Ordinary Ac c ount (“OA”): $ Medisave Ac c ount (“MA”): $37,043. Spec ial Ac c ount (“SA”): $33,079. 

 $70,122.40 [note: 18] (as at 29 August 2012) 

 5 The Plaintiff’s two insuranc e polic ies Undisc losed surrender values 

 6 Nissan Latio (on hire purc hase) 

 $ 16,257.00 [note: 19] 

 7 The Defendant’s POSB Savings Ac c ount $2,194.29 [note: 20] 

 (as at 18 Dec ember 2012) 

 8 The Defendant’s United Overseas Bank Uniplus Ac c ount $9,540.10 [note: 21] 

 (as at 1 July 2013) 

 9 The Defendant’s DBS Plus Ac c ount $1,850.00 [note: 22] 

 (as at 18 Dec ember 2012) 

 10 The Defendant’s CPF ac c ounts OA: $928. MA: $21,638. SA: $532. 

 $23,099.81 [note: 23] (as at 17 Dec ember 2012) 

 11 The Defendant’s five insuranc e polic ies 1) NTUC Inc ome Enhanc ed Inc omeshield Insuranc e Polic y; 2) Aviva Ltd My Shield Polic y; 3) Great Eastern Life Whole Life with Esc alating Reversionary Bonus Polic y; 4) NTUC Inc ome Mortgage Protec tor Insuranc e; and 5) Manulife Financ ial Life Protec tor Plus Polic y. 

 Undisc losed surrender values for four of the polic ies. The fifth polic y has a surrender value of $120,000. [note: 24] 

 Gross value of matrimonial assets $2,545,240. 

31     The parties have not provided suffic ient evidenc e on the surrender values of their respec tive 


 S/n Liabilities Amount 

 1 Outstanding loan for the matrimonial home Approximately $405,309. (as at 12 January 2015; $445,085.75 as at 6 February 2013) [note: 25] 

 2 Outstanding loan for the sec ond c ondominium unit Approximately $565,153. (as at 12 January 2015; $610,219.28 as at 6 February 2013) [note: 26] 

 3 Outstanding loan for the Nissan Latio $33,792.00 [note: 27] 

 (as at 18 Dec ember 2012) 

 Total liabilities $1,004,254. 

insuranc e polic ies. In his Affidavit of Assets and Means, the Plaintiff listed two insuranc e polic ies but did not disc lose their surrender values. As for the Defendant, she disc losed the surrender value of only one out of five of her insuranc e polic ies. I have added the surrender value of $120,000 of this polic y in the c alc ulation of the gross value of the matrimonial assets. The lac k of evidenc e on the surrender values of the remaining six polic ies inevitably c ompromises on the ac c urac y of the valuation of the matrimonial assets. Suc h an unsatisfac tory position c ould have been avoided if parties had properly and c onsc ientiously disc losed the surrender values of the insuranc e polic ies. 

32     Next, the outstanding liabilities in relation to the matrimonial assets are as follows: 

33     In the Defendant’s Dec laration of the Value of Matrimonial Assets, she listed a sum of $8,255. as an outstanding liability that should be deduc ted from the value of matrimonial assets. These were said to debts owed by her pursuant to personal loans that she had taken up from various banks. It is unc lear when the loans were taken, though the evidenc e in her Affidavit of Assets and Means suggests that they must have been taken before 18 Dec ember 2012. The Defendant did not provide any reasons to explain why the loans were taken and whether they were taken in relation to the matrimonial assets. She has also not furnished any doc umentary evidenc e of the loans. In the c irc umstanc es, I did not regard the sum of $8,225.01 as an outstanding liability. 

34     The total net value of the undisputed matrimonial assets is henc e $1,540,985.44. To reiterate, this sum does not inc lude the profits that were made in the investments in properties over the years as well as other undisc losed assets that the Plaintiff may have. 

35     I will now move on to c onsider the c irc umstanc es in this c ase, partic ularly the direc t and indirec t c ontributions of the parties, in order to dec ide on a just and equitable division of the assets. 

**_Direct financial contributions to the matrimonial assets_** 

36     In this sec tion, I will foc us on the parties’ financ ial c ontributions to the matrimonial house and the sec ond c ondominium unit. 

_The operative date to consider contributions by parties_ 


37     I deal first with a preliminary point. The parties disagree on whether payments of the monthly loans and maintenanc e sums of the matrimonial home made by the Defendant sinc e Oc tober 2012 are to be taken into ac c ount. The Plaintiff stopped paying the monthly loan repayment sum of $1,850 as well as the quarterly maintenanc e sum of $660 for the matrimonial home in Oc tober 2012. For the past 27 months (up to the hearing on 12 January 2015), the Defendant has been paying the repayment sums as well as the quarterly maintenanc e fees. The total sum in c ontention amounts to about $55,890 ((monthly repayment sum of $1,850 x 27 months) + (quarterly maintenanc e sum of 

$660 x 9 quarters)). [note: 28] 

38     The Plaintiff submits that the repayments made by the Defendant c annot be taken into ac c ount as they were made after the grant of interim judgment. In support of his submission, c ounsel for the Plaintiff c ited the c ase of _Nancy Tay_. He submitted that _Nancy Tay_ stands for the proposition that the date of the grant of interim judgment is the c ut-off date for the c alc ulation of c ontributions made by parties. 

39     I do not ac c ept this argument. The issue in _Nancy Tay_ was very different. The question in _Nancy Tay_ was whic h date the c ourt should adopt to determine whether an asset owned by a spouse was a matrimonial asset. The c ourt did not disc uss the question of the c ut-off date for the _calculation of contributions_. In _Nancy Tay_ , the c ourt dec ided that there should not only be one operative date to determine whether an asset was a matrimonial property. The c ourt held at [36]: 

 It seems to us that prac tic ality would suggest that there should be an operative date. However, the problem is in determining what that operative date should be, bearing in mind the possible diverse assets, and the different c irc umstanc es under whic h they were ac quired. Indeed, it does not follow that there can only be one operative date. Multiple dates are distinc tly possible, depending on the nature of the assets and the c irc umstanc es surrounding their ac quisition. Ultimately, perhaps the adoption of an operative date or dates may not really be that critical as compared to arriving at a just and equitable division. [Emphasis added in italic s]. 

40     A similar approac h was taken in _Anthony Patrick Nathan v Chan Siew Chin_ <span class="citation">[2011] 4 SLR 1121</span> (“ _Anthony Patrick_ ”). The issue in _Anthony Patrick_ was the operative date on whic h the c ourt should determine the _value_ of the pool of matrimonial assets. It was suggested in _Anthony Patrick_ that it may be appropriate for jointly owned assets to be valued at the date of the judgment on anc illary matters, whereas separately owned matrimonial assets should generally be valued at the date on whic h the matrimonial assets were determined. In response, the c ourt foc used on the imperative of reac hing a just and equitable division and observed (at [29]): 

 ... Ultimately, the date on whic h matrimonial assets should be valued is up to the c ourt’s disc retion, just as it is when it c omes to the operative date on whic h the pool of matrimonial assets should be determined. What is critical is to arrive at a “just and equitable division” (see Nancy Tay at [36]) in all the circumstances in each particular case). [Emphasis added in italic s]. 

41     I am of the view that a similar approac h should be taken towards an assessment of the c ontributions of the parties. In order to arrive at a just and equitable division in the present c ase, it is appropriate to take into ac c ount the Defendant’s direc t financ ial c ontribution of $55,890 (as c alc ulated in [37]) made up to the point of the hearing. This approac h is also c onsistent with the wording of s 112(2) of the WC. Pursuant to s 112(2)( _a_ ) of the WC, “the extent of the c ontributions made by eac h party in money, property or work towards ac quiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets” is one of the fac tors that ought to be c onsidered in dec iding what a just and equitable division of the assets ought to be. Nothing in s 112 of the WC dic tates that only c ontributions up to the date of the grant of interim judgment c an be taken into ac c ount. The sum of

_Direct financial contributions to the second condominium unit_ 

42     As for the sec ond c ondominium unit, the Plaintiff avers that it was solely financ ed by him. On the other hand, the Defendant avers that the initial investment in the sec ond c ondominium unit was financ ed by a re-mortgage of the Upper Serangoon property. Her argument is princ ipally that the 

initial funding of approximately $294,310.26 [note: 29] should be attributed to both parties as funding c ame from the parties’ joint investment in the Upper Serangoon property. In support of her submission, the Defendant exhibited a historic al information searc h of the Upper Serangoon property, 

whic h shows that the Upper Serangoon property was re-mortgaged in Dec ember 2010. [note: 30] The Defendant points out that this c oinc ides with the payment of the purc hase pric e of the Lakeshore and submits that it is evidenc e that the purc hase of the sec ond c ondominium unit was funded out of the 

mortgage of the Upper Serangoon property. [note: 31] I ac c ept the submission of the Defendant and hold that the initial funding of the Lakeshore c ame from joint monies held by the parties. Henc e, the direc t purc hase c ontribution of $294,310.26 should be c redited to both parties. 

_Direct financial contributions_ 

43     Having dec ided on the two main points of disagreement, I now set out the parties’ direc t c ontributions in the following table: 


 Loan repayments in c ash for the matrimonial home 

## $0 $49, 

 (payment of loan from Oc tober 2012 to Dec ember 2014 at $1850 per month) 

 Total contribution $489,328.49 $283,595. 

 Percentage 63.3% 36.7% 

**_Indirect contributions of the parties_** 

44     Ac c ording to the Plaintiff, the Defendant has not made signific ant indirec t c ontributions to the marriage. He avers that she did not do any household c hores and barely took c are of the c hildren. Instead, he states that his mother is the main c aregiver of the c hildren. He avers that his mother did the household c hores by herself until Oc tober 2012 when the Defendant employed a domestic helper. [note: 38] He also alleges that the Defendant refused to c ontribute towards the household expenses 

and their c hildren’s expenses, save only for the fac t that she paid for the younger son’s milk powder and toiletries. 

45     I do not believe the Plaintiff. Apart from the Plaintiff’s bare allegations, there is no evidenc e that the Defendant is not a good mother to her two c hildren. The two c hildren, now aged 8 and 15 

years old, [note: 39] appear to be doing well in sc hool and their extra-c urric ular ac tivities. [note: 40] In fac t, I note that the Plaintiff is the one who spends less time with the c hildren and is rarely in Singapore. The Defendant submits that the Plaintiff started making about two overseas trips every month sinc e 2002. In 2010, about two weeks before the Lunar New Year, the Plaintiff left the matrimonial home and began residing in the sec ond c ondominium unit. That was also the year that the parties’ elder son took his Primary Sc hool Leaving Examinations. Subsequently, the Plaintiff left for the Philippines, where he presently resides. 

46     Having c onsidered the evidenc e before me, I am not prepared to ac c ept the Plaintiff’s submission that the Defendant has not made any indirec t c ontribution to the marriage. Instead, I find that the Defendant, despite being a working mum, had made signific ant indirec t c ontributions to the marriage and the family. The Defendant avers that she took up the job as a real estate agent in 2002 for the flexible hours it affords, allowing her to both c are for the c hildren and c ontribute to the household inc ome. I ac c ept the Defendant’s evidenc e. 

47     Further, I am also of the view that the Defendant’s expertise and ac umen in the property market was the major fac tor behind the property investments that the parties’ profited from. I ac c ept the Defendant’s submission that the investments were mostly made in the name of the Plaintiff bec ause the Defendant was a real estate agent and wanted to avoid any potential c onflic ts of interest. I therefore rejec t the Plaintiff’s assertion that these were his personal investments in whic h the Defendant had no part to play. I also note that, when the parties bought their first matrimonial home in 1998, the Plaintiff was still serving National Servic e whic h he only c ompleted in 2000. Henc e, I also ac c ept the Defendant’s submission that she was the main sourc e of financ ial support for the family during that time. 

48     All in all, I am of the view that the Defendant had made substantial indirec t c ontributions to the marriage. 

**_Just and equitable division_** 


49     As rec ognised, a broad-brush approac h ought to be adopted in dec iding on a division of the matrimonial assets. All the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, inc luding the fac tors in s 112(2) of the WC are to be c onsidered. The c ourts have c onsistently emphasised that the division of matrimonial assets is not a mathematic al exerc ise. One fac tor that bears mention is the needs of the c hildren, whic h s 112(2) of the WC requires the c ourt to c onsider when dec iding on an appropriate division of assets. In this c onnec tion, I note that the Defendant is the primary c aregiver of the c hildren (both of whom are still of sc hool-going age) as she has been awarded c are and c ontrol. 

50     In the result, I have dec ided that it would be just and equitable to award the Defendant 60% of the assets in the matrimonial pool. In c oming to my dec ision on the appropriate division, I have c onsidered the c onsiderable length of the marriage, the parties’ direc t c ontributions (63.3% by the Plaintiff and 36.7% by the Defendant), the signific ant indirec t c ontributions made by the Defendant, as well as the needs of the c hildren. The final proportion also inc orporates the inc rease I think is due to the Defendant in the light of the adverse inferenc e that I have drawn against the Plaintiff for his lac k of disc losure in relation to his inc ome, assets, and the profits he earned from the property investments. 

**_Most expedient means of distribution_** 

51     The only remaining step is the asc ertainment of the most expedient means for exec uting the division. The parties have two main assets – the matrimonial home and the sec ond c ondominium unit. Based on the c alc ulations referred to earlier, the net value of the matrimonial home represents about 58.1% of the total assets. The Defendant, the c hildren and possibly the Plaintiff’s parents have also been staying at the matrimonial home sinc e 2008. In the c irc umstanc es, I am of the view that it is expedient, as well as just and equitable, to order the Plaintiff to transfer his share of the matrimonial home to the Defendant, without requiring the Defendant to make any refunds into the Plaintiff’s CPF ac c ount. I am in partic ular persuaded by the fac t that this manner of distribution will c ause minimal disruption to the two sc hool-going c hildren who reside in the matrimonial home. The other assets owned by parties, inc luding the sec ond c ondominium unit, are to remain in their own names. 

**Maintenance of the Defendant** 

52     In c onsidering the appropriate sum of maintenanc e to order, I have taken into ac c ount the Defendant’s relatively young age (38 years old), her inc ome, professional c ompetenc e and her experienc e in the property market, as well as the Plaintiff’s health issues. Further, I have also c onsidered that the Defendant will be given sole ownership of the matrimonial home. In the c irc umstanc es, I think it appropriate that only nominal maintenanc e of $1 be given to the Defendant and I so order. 

**Maintenance of the children** 

53     In the Defendant’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 1 July 2013, she estimated the monthly expenses of the c hildren as being $1,005 and $1,154, respec tively. I note that more than a year has lapsed sinc e that assessment and the two c hildren are presently in Primary 3 and Sec ondary 4 respec tively. It follows that their expenses will inc rease, partic ularly the expenses of the elder son. Henc e, I order that maintenanc e for the c hildren be inc reased from the interim sum of $500 eac h to $800 for the older son and $600 for the younger son. Therefore, with effec t from the date of this judgment, the Plaintiff is to pay the Defendant a total of $1,400 every month for the maintenanc e of the c hildren. 

**Conclusion** 


**Conclusion** 

54     In summary, my orders are as follows: 

 (a) The Plaintiff’s share in the matrimonial home is to be transferred to the Defendant without any refund into the Plaintiff’s CPF ac c ount. The Defendant is to bear the c osts of this transfer. 

 (b) The Registrar of the Family Justic e Courts shall be empowered to sign all doc uments nec essary to effec t suc h a transfer in the event that the Plaintiff refuses to do so. 

 (c ) Eac h party is to retain their respec tive assets in their sole names. 

 (d) Nominal maintenanc e of $1 per month is to be paid to the Defendant. 

 (e) Maintenanc e of $1,400 per month for the two c hildren is to be paid to the Defendant.
