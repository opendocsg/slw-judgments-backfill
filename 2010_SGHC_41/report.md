**Philip Pillai JC:** 

1       This was an appeal against the Assistant Registrar’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s applic ation to set aside the defendant’s statutory demand of USD 10,309,708.87 and grant of leave to the defendant to file a bankruptc y applic ation against the plaintiff after the day of that order. 

2       The appeal was based on rr 98(2)(b) and (e) of the Bankruptc y Rules (Cap 20, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ _Bankruptcy Rules_ ”) _viz_ that the statutory demand is disputed on grounds whic h appear to the c ourt to be substantial or that the c ourt is satisfied on other grounds that the demand ought to be set aside, respec tively. 

3       It was c ommon ground that the test to be applied by the c ourt in this determination is the same as the test to be applied for the grant of summary judgment pursuant to Order 14 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, Rev Ed), _ie_ whether or not there are triable issues to go to trial. 

**_Is there a triable issue that the guarantee has been discharged by reason of impairment caused by the defendant?_** 

4       The plaintiff argued that he was disc harged from the joint and several c ontinuing guarantee or that at least there was a genuine triable issue on whether or not he had been disc harged. 

5       The threshold for this c ourt is helpfully set out by the Court of Appeal in _Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Lim Chor Pee CA_ [2006] 2 SLR(R) at [19] that there is “some real doubt about the question, thus a triable issue, upon whic h further evidenc e or arguments [are] required.” In _Manjit Kaur Monica v Standard Chartered Bank_ <span class="citation">[2000] SGHC 205</span>, Woo Bih Li JC (as he then was) adopted the formulation in _Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd_ (1994) 12 ACSR 785 at 787-788 by Mc Lelland CJ in the following terms: 

 It is, however, nec essary to c onsider the meaning of the expression “genuine dispute” where it oc c urs in [s 459H of the Corporations Law]. In my opinion that expression c onnotes a plausible c ontention requiring investigations, and raises muc h the same sort of c onsideration as the “serious question to be tried” c riterion whic h arises on an applic ation for an interloc utory 


 injunc tion or for the extension or removal of a c aveat. This does not mean that the c ourt must ac c ept unc ritic ally as giving rise to a genuine dispute, every statement in an affidavits “however equivoc al, lac king in prec ision, inc onsistent with undisputed c ontemporary doc uments or other statements by the same deponent, or inherently improbable in itself, it may be “suffic ient prima facie plaudibility to merit further investigation as to [its] truth” (c f Eng Mee Yong v Letchumann [1980] AC 331 at 341), or “a patently feeble legal argument or an assertion of ac ts unsupported by evidenc e”: c f South Australia v Wall (1980) 24 SASR 189 at 194. 

6       With respec t to valid c ounterc laims, set-off or c ross demands, _Goh Chin Soon v OverseasChinese Banking Corporation Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2001] SGHC 17</span>, per Lee Seiu Kin JC (as he then was) is also germane: 

 Rule 98(2)(a) provides that the c ourt shall set aside the [Statutory Demand (the “SD”)] if the debtor appears to have a valid c ounterc laim, set-off or c ross demand whic h exc eeds the amount of the debts in the SD. The word “valid” is plac ed there for good reason. It requires the c ourt to examine the alleged c ounterc laim, set-off or c ross demand to see if the debtor has a bona fide c laim against the c reditor that, if suc c essful, would enable him to pay the debt the subjec t of the statutory demand. If all that rule 98(2)(a) requires were the mere existenc e of suc h a c laim, no matter how spurious, then it will be only too easy for a debtor to make suc h a c laim in order to stave off bankruptc y proc eedings. ... [emphasis in original] 

7       The plaintiff c ited _Bank of Montreal v Wilder_ [1986] 2 S.C.R. 551 for the proposition that a guarantee is disc harged where the c reditor impairs the sec urity, inc reases risk or c auses default. The plaintiff referred to the following sequenc e of events in support of his position that the guarantee had been disc harged by impairment c aused by the defendant. 

8       The defendant granted c redit fac ilities to EP Carriers Pte Ltd on 11 Marc h 2008. In Dec ember 2008 following restruc turing disc ussions it was agreed that the c redit fac ilities would be novated to Linford Pte Ltd whilst the sec urity given to support c redit fac ilities, inc luding a mortgage on the vessel “Eagle Prestige” would remain. However, new doc uments would be signed together with a c ontinuing guarantee (“Guarantee”) provided by the plaintiff to the defendant. On 2 Dec ember 2008 prior to the c ompletion of the novation and sec urity doc uments, the vessel “Eagle Prestige” was arrested by TS Lines Ltd and sold by way of judic ial sale. The writ of arrest esc aped the notic e of the defendant whic h proc eeded to c omplete the novation and sec urity doc uments. 

9       It was the plaintiff’s c ase that the sale of the vessel c aused him loss and that the defendant ought to have c onduc ted proper searc hes in c onnec tion with perfec ting its sec urity, following whic h t hey would have disc overed the arrest writ. The plaintiff’s argument was that had the defendant disc overed the arrest writ, they would not have proc eeded with the novation bec ause it would not have met the bank’s prec onditions to the novated fac ilities and sec urity. It was argued that had the defendant not proc eeded with the novated fac ilities and sec urity, EP Carriers Pte Ltd would have remained as borrower and TS Lines Ltd would have stood lower in ranking against the vessel _vis-à-vis_ the defendant’s mortgage over the vessel. As the new mortgage under novation was effec ted after t he _in rem_ writ, but before arrest, it was argued that by this omission, the Guarantee had been impaired. In other words, the plaintiff argued that had the defendant been vigilant in its searc hes, it would not have proc eeded with the novation and sec urity and the defendant c ould have resisted the arrest and sale or c laimed against the sale proc eeds. This was bec ause the defendant, under the original sec urity had mortgagor’s priority for the indebtedness far in exc ess of TS Lines Ltd whic h arrested the vessel. Ac c ordingly, it was argued that the statutory demand whic h was founded on the Guarantee had by law been disc harged and the statutory demand on whic h it was founded was substantially disputed. 


10     The defendant replied that the plaintiff’s c ase was based on the defendant breac hing a purport ed obligation, where the defendant owed no suc h obligation. Even if the novation had not been c arried out, the same guarantors would have been liable for the debt under the previous guarantees. Even if the sec urity was impaired, the impairment was only of the magnitude of USD 1.16m and not for the defendant’s full statutory demand of USD 10,309,708.87. To the plaintiff’s relianc e on set offs and c ounterc laims to the Guarantee, the defendant referred to Clauses 1, 4 and 9 of the Guarantee whic h expressly exc luded the right to raise them on a c all on the guarantee: see _Bauer v The Bank of Montreal_ [1980] 2 SCR 102 at 108. It was further argued that even if the defendant had taken full priority and proc eeded against the vessel, the plaintiff would still have no defenc e against the c laim of USD 10,309,708.87 as there would have remained owing and payable the sum of USD 8m. In any event, TS Line Ltd’s c laims had not c rystallized and the sale proc eeds remained with the sheriff as their c laims have been disputed. 

11     It was further the defendant’s position that it was only obliged to set off value of any sec urity whic h only the guarantors have given. In this c ase, the relevant sec urity was sec urity provided by third parties. At the time the defendant issued its statutory demand, USD 10,309,708.87 was outstanding and not paid. The defendant had and has sinc e rec eived nothing by way of other sec urity. 

12     In any event, the defendant’s failure to make a searc h or disc over the admiralty writ was not a breac h on the part of the defendant. The obligation was plac ed on the borrower and mortgagor with partic ular referenc e to c lause 3 of the representations and warranties in the mortgage, that there were no writs pending against the vessel as of 22 Dec ember 2008 where in fac t the admiralty writ had been issued on 2 Dec ember 2008. Onc e the vessel had been arrested, c lauses 6.2 and 10 of the mortgage obliged the borrower to have the vessel released. The defendant submitted that it was disingenuous for the plaintiff, who was a direc tor and c ontroller of the c orporate borrowers, not having c omplied with these obligations, to now argue that the sec urity had been impaired by the defendant’s failure to make a searc h or disc over the admiralty writ whic h it was not obliged to do. The defendant submitted that ac c ordingly, it had not breac hed any obligations whic h would lead to the disc harge of the guarantee under the authority of _Bank of Montreal v Wilder_ , above, at [7]. 

13     Finally, on the question of whether an exc essive demand in the statutory demand c ompels the c onc lusion that the statutory demand is defec tive, it was submitted by the defendant that if the evidenc e was that the plaintiff c ould not pay the undisputed sum, nothing c ould be served by setting aside the statutory demand. This was bec ause the next step is to issue a fresh statutory demand. The pivotal c onsideration of the c ourt was whether the plaintiff had a defenc e of the whole amount and not just the USD 1.61m or USD 1.97m c laimed by the plaintiff to have been lost in the arrest of the vessel. 

14     The plaintiff c onc eded that there had been no breac h by the defendant of an express obligation under the novation agreement and sec urity doc uments. It was c onc eded that he bore the heavy burden to establish that the obligation was a term of the guarantee by implied term or a c ollateral c ontrac t or by misrepresentation. 

15     Having c arefully c onsidered the written and oral submissions and authorities c ited I found that no triable issues have been made out whic h would be suffic ient to justify the setting aside of the defendant’s statutory demand. The issues that have been run by the plaintiff were naturally raised in order to avoid the antic ipated c onsequenc es of an unsatisfied statutory demand, _viz_ , bankruptc y. It did not mean, however, that any defenc es asserted would nec essarily result in the setting aside of the statutory demand. The first threshold was whether these defenc es raised triable issues. The gist of the argument made before me was that the defendant had c aused an impairment of the sec urity 


by reason of its not having c onduc ted the relevant register searc hes, whic h in the first plac e, it was never c ontrac tually expressly obliged to do. 

**_Would such impairment have matched or exceeded the statutory demand?_** 

16     Even if I were to have found that a triable issue relating to the impairment of the guarantee exists, the question remains whether the effec t of suc h c ounterc laim would be to fully meet the statutory demand amount of USD 10,309,708.87. 

17     The plaintiff submitted that the prejudic e suffered by him was the whole c laim made by defendant, _viz_ , USD 10,309,708.87 plus the USD 1.61m, whic h were the sums he was supposed to pay. In the alternative, he submitted that the extent of prejudic e was the differenc e in the value of the vessel for the purpose of novating and the net sale proc eeds. The plaintiff then relied on the valuation of the vessel at USD 8.2m in c onnec tion with the fac ility and submitted that the prejudic e was the differenc e between USD 8.2m and S$1,974,492.79 (the net sale proc eeds). 

18     I found no merit in those submissions. The plaintiff’s c laim would not in my view, in any event, have equalled or exc eeded the amount stated in the statutory demand and ac c ordingly this applic ation and appeal was flawed at the outset. There was therefore no justific ation for this c ourt to exerc ise its powers under Rule 98(2)(a) of the _Bankruptcy Rules_ (see also _Goh Chin Soon and anor v Vickers Capital Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2000] 3 SLR(R) 977</span>). I would also add, for the purposes of this applic ation, that there was also no justific ation for this c ourt to exerc ise its power under Rule 98(2)(e) of the Bankruptc y Rules. 

**_Ought a fresh statutory demand be required to be issued in these circumstances?_** 

19     As I have found that even if triable issues were to exist, they would not have extinguished the whole of the statutory demand, the next question was whether the statutory demand was liable to be set aside and the defendant obligated to issue a fresh one. In the c irc umstanc es before me, I saw no purpose in requiring the defendant to issue a fresh statutory demand. 

20     Ac c ordingly, the appeal was dismissed and the plaintiff was ordered to pay the c osts of the appeal to defendant, whic h was to be agreed or taxed.
