**Tan Lee Meng J:** 

1       The plaintiff, Mdm Gurnam Kaur d/o Sardara Singh (“GK”), a widow aged 65 years, and her son, the defendant, Mr Harbhajan Singh s/o Jagraj Singh (“HS”), are joint tenants of Bloc k 57 Geylang Bahru, #07-3517, Singapore 330057 (the “Geylang Bahru property”). In these proc eedings, GK sought an order that the joint tenanc y be severed, that the property be sold and that the net proc eeds of sale be divided between her and HS. 

**Background** 

2 February 1974, GK and her late husband purc hased the Geylang Bahru property. They held the property as joint tenants. By 1980, the housing loan for the property was fully paid up. In 1989, GK’s husband passed away and she bec ame the sole owner of the property. 

3       Four of GK’s five c hildren got married and bought their own properties. Only HS c ontinued to reside at the Geylang Bahru property with GK. In July 1998, GK allowed HS to bec ome a joint tenant of the said property without requiring him to pay any money. She explained that she invited HS to bec ome a joint owner of the said property to make it easier for him to marry his girlfriend, who was a foreigner, and to enc ourage him to bec ome a more responsible person. 

4       After HS got married, his relationship with his mother deteriorated to suc h an extent that she left her home. Ac c ording to GK, HS then c hanged the loc ks of the Geylang Bahru property and prevented her from entering the property. In due c ourse, GK instituted the present proc eedings to protec t her rights. 

5       After hearing arguments by c ounsel for both parties, I ordered that the joint tenanc y be severed and that the Geylang Bahru property be sold in the open market, with GK having c onduc t of the sale. If HS refuses to c o-operate by signing the requisite doc uments to fac ilitate the sale within two weeks after being asked to do so, the Registrar of the Supreme Court shall sign the said doc uments on his behalf. 


**Division of the net proceeds of sale** 

6       The division of the net proc eeds of sale will next be c onsidered. It is trite law that where two or more joint tenants have c ontributed towards the purc hase pric e of a property, there is a presumption in equity that eac h party’s interest in the property is in proportion to his or her financ ial c ontribution. Thus in _Sitiawah Bee bte Kader v Rosiyah bte Abdullah_ <span class="citation">[2000] 1 SLR 612</span>, where a mother and her daughter were joint tenants of a Housing and Development Board, S Rajendran J held that there was an equitable tenanc y in c ommon, with the mother having a 23% share of the flat and her daughter having the remaining 77% bec ause the former paid around 23% of the purc hase pric e of the flat whereas the latter paid the balanc e of the purc hase pric e. 

7       In the present c ase, HS c laimed to be entitled to 50% of the net proc eeds of sale of the Geylang Bahru property. Why he made suc h a c laim when he did not pay a single c ent for the said property c annot be fathomed. HS pointed out that he c ontributed $150 per month for food for the family and that he paid the elec tric ity and water bills for the said property. He added that he gave his mother $40 per month for her expenses. These payments, if made, had nothing to do with the purc hase pric e of the Geylang Bahru property. As for his c laim that he rec ently paid $13,000 for renovating the property, it is, without more, not appropriate to take suc h a payment into ac c ount when asc ertaining the extent of a party’s interest in a property after the severanc e of a joint tenanc y: see _Sitiawah Bee bte Kader v Rosiyah bte Abdullah_ ( _supra_ ). This is espec ially so where, as in the present c ase, the purc hase pric e of the property was paid long before the renovation work was undertaken. 

8       Although HS had not c ontributed any money for the purc hase of the Geylang Bahru property, GK only c laimed 70% of the net proc eeds of sale. Considering the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, HS should be c ontented with having 30% of the net proc eeds of sale. I thus ordered that GK be paid 70% of the net proc eeds of sale and that the balanc e be paid to HS.
