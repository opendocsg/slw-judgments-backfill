**Introduction** 

1       Originating Summons 246 of 2016 (“the Applic ation”) was the appellant’s appeal against the dec ision of the Strata Titles Board (“the Board”) in STB No 40 of 2015 (“the STB Applic ation”) on points of law, pursuant to sec tion 98(1) of the Building Maintenanc e and Strata Management Ac t (Cap 30C, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”). The Applic ation raises several interesting questions, the princ ipal of whic h is the c orrec t interpretation of c ommon property in s 2(1) of the Ac t. 

2       The appellant is the subsidiary proprietor of unit #29-01, a penthouse unit oc c upying the 29th and 30th floors of Tower 15 of the c ondominium at 13 Ardmore Park (“the Unit”). The respondent is the management c orporation of the development. 

3       The STB Applic ation c onc erned the appellant’s installation of three works in different areas of the development. The respondent, upon disc overing these works, demanded that the appellant remove the works and/or obtain the requisite approval. It took the position that the works had been installed on c ommon property in breac h of various by-laws. Substantial c orrespondenc e passed between the parties c ulminating in the appellant c ommenc ing the STB Applic ation to obtain, _inter alia_ , a dec laration that he had not breac hed the by-laws by installing the works and in the alternative, an order that the respondent c onsent to the works. The Board dismissed the STB Applic ation. 

4       I dismissed the Applic ation and gave detailed oral grounds. The appellant has appealed my dec ision, and I set out the full grounds of my dec ision. 

**Background to the dispute** 


**Background to the dispute** 

5       Sometime around November 2011, the appellant submitted an applic ation through his appointed representative, Glory Sky Tec hnology Ltd (“Glory”), for the following works to be c arried out at the Unit: 

1\. Demolition of non struc tural walls. 

2\. Removal of unwanted existing trunking, c able trays, wires, AC duc tings. 

3\. Laying of new elec tric al, data, water, ACMV, telephony servic es. 

4\. Erec tion of new walls & partitions. 

5\. Replac ement of doors & window panels. 

6\. Laying of new wall & floor finishes. 

7\. Install new c eiling, painting works & install new c abinetry. 

6       The appellant had also indic ated “Yes” in response to a question on the applic ation form asking whether there would be any “Additions/alterations to elec tric al system inc luding air-c onditioning system”, but did not elaborate. 

7       It was _not_ stated in the applic ation that the works were to be c arried out in areas _not_ within the Unit. The works were to c ommenc e on 14 November 2011 and be c ompleted by 13 Marc h 2012. The applic ation was approved but the works were not c ompleted by the c ompletion date and the appellant made numerous applic ations for extensions of time. 

8       In August 2013, in the c ourse of inspec tions, the respondent disc overed that the fixed glass panels bordering two areas of the Unit had been replac ed with sliding panels, and the appellant had installed timber dec king on two wide ledges beyond those panels outside the Unit on the 29th floor (“Work 1”). Figures 1 and 2 depic t Work 1: 


9       The two wide ledges eac h ran along a segment of the Unit’s external faç ade and were enc losed by a low parapet merely 0.75m in height whic h it would appear had been c onstruc ted by the developer. Though the ledges resembled balc onies, it was c ommon ground that they were not. The parapet did not meet the required safety standards for balc onies, not being of suffic ient height. Fixed glass panels originally separated the wide ledges from the Unit suc h that they c ould not be physic ally ac c essed by the oc c upants of the Unit. It is c lear that the wide ledges were not meant to be ac c essed by them. It was also c ommon ground that the ledges were demarc ated in the strata title plan as c ommon property, as shown in Figure 3 (the respondent’s annotations in red): 


10     The respondent sent an e-mail to Glory on 26 August 2013, stating that Work 1 was unauthorised and requesting that the appellant restore the fixed glass panels. The parties c orresponded and on 28 August 2013, the respondent advised the appellant to submit a formal applic ation to install timber dec king on the ledges. The appellant submitted an applic ation to the respondent by way of a letter dated 3 September 2013 from Glory to the respondent. However, the management c ounc il took the view that Work 1 was tantamount to exc lusive use of c ommon property, whic h it had no jurisdic tion to authorise. The appellant was thus advised to sponsor a 90% resolution at the upc oming Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) in April 2014 to ac quire exc lusive use of the ledges pursuant to s 33(1)( _c_ ) of the Ac t. He did not do so. 

11     Shortly after the AGM, around 5 May 2014, the respondent disc overed that the appellant had installed timber dec king on the flat roof on the 30th floor outside the Unit (“Work 2”), as seen in Figures 4 and 5 (respondent’s annotations in red): 


12     The timber dec king c overed the flat roof entirely, _including the floor trap and drainage system_ , thus making it diffic ult for the respondent to properly upkeep the area. The flat roof was ac c essible to the appellant via the bac k door of the kitc hen of the Unit, and also ac c essible to all subsidiary proprietors in the c ondominium via a c ommon stairc ase. It was c ommon ground that the flat roof was in an area demarc ated as c ommon property in the strata title plan, as shown in Figure 7. 

13     Around 12 May 2014, the respondent disc overed that the appellant had installed an airc onditioning ventilation unit on the outside wall of Tower 15, the external wall enc losing the Unit, in the same vic inity as Work 2 (“Work 3”). Work 3 is shown in the following photograph: 

14     Work 3 would have required the appellant to hac k through the c ommon property wall to c onnec t the air-c onditioning unit vent to the interior of the Unit. It was c ommon ground that the flat roof was in an area demarc ated as c ommon property in the strata title plan, as shown below (the respondent’s annotations in red): 


15     A c loser view of the loc ation of the air-c onditioning ventilation unit c an be seen in Figure 8 (the respondent’s annotations in red): 

16     On 12 May 2014, the respondent wrote to Glory requesting the immediate removal of Works 1, 2 and 3 (c ollec tively “the Works”). No reply was rec eived. On 28 May 2014, the respondent again wrote to Glory, giving 14 days’ notic e to remove the Works failing whic h the respondent would remove or demolish “all unauthorised works”. Glory replied on 30 May 2014, c ommunic ating the appellant’s intention to “table the appropriate proposal under Sec tion 34 of [the Ac t] for the c onversion of the c ommon area to private usage”. The respondent advised the appellant to obtain the approval of the general body at a general meeting but he did not do so. 

17     On 29 August 2014, the appellant was again given 14 days’ notic e to remove the Works. More c orrespondenc e passed between the parties (and, subsequently, their appointed solic itors) but the Works remained unremoved. The appellant was again advised to table any nec essary resolution at the AGM in April 2015. 

18     At the AGM on 25 April 2015, the appellant tabled three motions seeking exc lusive use and enjoyment and/or spec ial privileges in respec t of the c ommon property where the Works had been c arried out: (a) for more than three years (to be passed by a 90% resolution); (b) for three years (to be passed by a spec ial resolution, _ie_ , 75% vote); or (c ) for one year (to be passed by an ordinary resolution, _ie_ , a bare majority). He was unable to suc c eed on any of his three motions, with the vote c ount as set out below: 


 No Resolution Vote c ount 

 1 Seeking exc lusive use and enjoyment and/or spec ial privileges of the relevant areas for more than three years 

 26% for; 74% against 

 2 Seeking exc lusive use and enjoyment and/or spec ial privileges of the relevant areas for three years 

 26% for; 74% against 

 3 Seeking exc lusive use and enjoyment and/or spec ial privileges of the relevant areas for one year 

 30% for; 70% against 

19     On 30 June 2015, the appellant c ommenc ed the STB Applic ation seeking the following orders: 

 (a) a dec laration that he had not breac hed any by-laws by virtue of the Works; 

 in the alternative, 

 (b) a dec laration that the Works did not amount to exc lusive use and enjoyment of or the c onferment of spec ial privileges in respec t of c ommon property within the meaning of s 33 of the Ac t; 

 (c ) an order pursuant to s 111( a ) of the Ac t that the respondent c onsent to the Works; 

 (d) a dec laration pursuant to s 101(1)( c ) read with s 101(4) of the Ac t that the respondent failed to exerc ise its powers under s 37(4) of the Ac t; and 

 (e) an order pursuant to s 111( b ) of the Ac t that the respondent authorise the Works under s 37(4) of the Ac t, on suc h terms as the appellant or the Board proposed. 

20     On 11 February 2016, the Board dismissed the STB Applic ation with c osts to the respondent. The Board expressed doubts regarding its c ompetenc e to make dec larations as sought by the appellant, but this did not arise for dec ision as the Board dismissed the applic ation on its merits. The appellant filed the Applic ation on 10 Marc h 2016. 

**The Board’s decision** 

**_The Works were situated on common property_** 

21     The first issue the Board had to determine was whether the Works were situated on c ommon property. This assumed greatest signific anc e in relation to Work 1 as it was not a matter of serious disagreement that Works 2 and 3 were indeed situated on c ommon property. 

22     The Board c onstrued the definition of “c ommon property” in s 2(1) of the Ac t to mean any area whic h was _both_ (i) not c omprised in any lot or proposed lot in a strata title plan _and_ (ii) used or c apable of being used or enjoyed by the oc c upiers of two or more lots. In other words, the Board read the twin limbs of s 2(1) as c onjunc tive requirements. As it was not disputed that none of the areas housing the Works was c omprised in any lot in the strata title plan, the Board’s analysis nec essarily foc used and ultimately turned on the c onstruc tion of limb (ii). Ac c ordingly, the Board had to form a view as to what was meant by the area in question being used or c apable of being used by the oc c upiers of two or more lots. 


23     The Board ac knowledged that the use or purpose of the wide ledges on whic h Work 1 was installed was “subjec t to spec ulation”. Nevertheless, the Board took the view that the ledges were “part and parc el of the fabric of the building” and “c ontribute[d] to the c harac ter and appearanc e” of the building, and that all subsidiary proprietors were entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of it. Moreover, the Board noted that the ledges served “as a shelter or sunshade to the unit/units below” and were demarc ated as c ommon property in the strata title plan. The Board was therefore of the view that the ledges were used or c apable of being used by the oc c upiers of two or more lots in the development. 

24     Works 2 and 3 were installed at the flat roof outside the appellant’s lot. This area was bordered by the outside wall of Tower 15 and was ac c essible to all subsidiary proprietors of the estate via a c ommon stairc ase. The Board found that it was c ommon property on that basis. 

**_Breaches under the by-laws_** 

25     The Board further found that by c arrying out the Works, the appellant had breac hed by-laws 8.1.1 and 8.2.5 of the by-laws made by the respondent under s 32(3) of the Ac t (“Additional ByLaws”). He had also breac hed by-law 5 of the by-laws presc ribed in the Sec ond Sc hedule to the Building Maintenanc e (Strata Management) Regulations 2005 (GN No S 192/2005) (“Presc ribed ByLaws”) as he had not applied for the requisite approval before c ommenc ing Works 2 and 3. The Board held (at [38]) that Works 2 and 3 did not fall within the works exempted from the requirement for approval in by-law 5(3) of the Presc ribed ByLaws bec ause they were not “loc king or safety devic es for the protec tion of the [a]ppellant’s lot against intruders”, “devic es that c ould improve safety within the [a]ppellant’s lot” or “safety devic es installed to _prevent harm_ to the c hildren” (emphasis in original). 

26     The Board found that by installing Work 3, the appellant had arrogated to himself exc lusive use and enjoyment of that sec tion of the wall whic h the ventilation unit oc c upied, and whic h was c ommon property, within the meaning of s 33(1) of the Ac t. This required authorisation by spec ial resolution or 90% resolution as Work 3 was intended to last for more than a year. The respondent had therefore reasonably taken the view that it lac ked jurisdic tion to authorise the Works in the absenc e of suc h a resolution, as the Works were “restric ted matter[s]” pursuant to s 58(1) read with s 58(4) of the Ac t. Moreover, s 111( _a_ ) of the Ac t c ontemplated the prospec tive grant of c onsent in respec t of works that had been proposed but not yet c arried out, whereas the Works had already been installed. Given these c onsiderations, the Board dec lined to order the respondent to authorise the Works under s 111( _a_ ) of the Ac t. 

27     Nor c ould the respondent authorise the Works under s 37(4) of the Ac t as these were not improvements “in or upon [the appellant’s] lot”, suc h works needing to be _in_ the lot as opposed to _in respect of_ a lot. As the Works were all on c ommon property, they did not, in the Board’s view, satisfy the sec tion. The Board therefore c ould not order the respondent to c onsent to the Works under s 111( _b_ ) or s 101(1)( _c_ ) read with s 101(4) of the Ac t. 

**The parties’ cases** 

**_The appellant’s case_** 

28     First, the appellant took the position that the Works had not been installed on c ommon property, bec ause the areas where they were c arried out were “not visible or ac c essible to anyone”. Partic ularly, the wide ledges on whic h Work 1 had been installed c ould not be physic ally ac c essed or enjoyed by any subsidiary proprietor. The appellant thus submitted that they did not satisfy limb (ii) 


of the definition of “c ommon property” in s 2(1) of the Ac t ( _ie_ , used or c apable of being used or enjoyed by the oc c upiers of two or more lots). As regards Works 2 and 3, the appellant asserted that the respondent had been unable to furnish evidenc e as to the c ommon purpose or c ommon usage of the areas in question. Sinc e c entral or c ommon usage was an essential ingredient in c ommon property, the areas where Works 2 and 3 were installed did not c onstitute c ommon property. 

29     Sec ond, the appellant asserted that the Board was wrong to find him in breac h of the Additional ByLaws. He c laimed that he had c omplied with by-laws 8.1.1 and 8.2.5 by obtaining the nec essary approval for the Works. The appellant also asserted that the Additional ByLaws were inc onsistent with the Ac t and henc e inapplic able. 

30     Third, the appellant submitted that the Board had erred by c onflating by-laws 5(3)( _a_ ) and 5(3) ( _c_ ) of the Presc ribed ByLaws. He asserted that Works 2 and 3 had been installed for his c hildren’s welfare, health and/or safety and therefore did not require the respondent’s approval under by-law 5. 

31     Fourth, the appellant submitted that the Board had erred in finding that Work 3 amounted to exc lusive use and enjoyment of c ommon property within the meaning of s 33 of the Ac t. Even if c orrec t, this did not prec lude the respondent from authorising Work 3 for a period not exc eeding one year as it was not a “restric ted matter” under s 58(4) of the Ac t. The Board had therefore erred in finding it reasonable for the respondent to withhold its c onsent to Work 3. The appellant also submitted that, in any event, the Board ought to have made a “dec laration” that Works 1 and 2 did not amount to exc lusive use within the meaning of s 33 of the Ac t, given its finding that this was so. 

32     Fifth, the appellant argued that s 111( _a_ ) of the Ac t allowed the Board to order the respondent to retrospec tively c onsent to works that had already been c arried out without c onsent. The Board had erred by supposing that the fac t the works had already been installed prec luded relianc e on s 111( _a_ ). 

33     Sixth, the appellant submitted that the Board had erred in its interpretation of “improvement in or upon the lot” in s 37 of the Ac t. The appellant submitted that s 37 inc luded improvements whic h, although not tec hnic ally within a lot, were nevertheless “in respec t of” the lot. The Works were therefore not exc luded from s 37 purely by virtue of the fac t that they were not installed within the Unit. 

**_The respondent’s case_** 

34     The respondent emphasised that s 98 of the Ac t did not permit the appellant to raise issues of fac t. He had to show rather that there was an error of law _ex facie_ or that the Board had made a determination that “no person ac ting judic ially and properly instruc ted as to the relevant law c ould have c ome to” ( _Liu Chee Ming and others v Loo-Lim Shirley_ <span class="citation">[2008] 2 SLR(R) 764</span> at [16], _Dynamic Investments Pte Ltd v Lee Chee Kian Silas and others_ <span class="citation">[2008] 1 SLR(R) 719</span> at [15]). In this regard, the Board’s findings that the relevant areas c onstituted c ommon property; that the Works breac hed by-laws 8.1.1 and 8.2.5 of the Additional ByLaws; and that the Works were not devic es to “prevent harm” to the appellant’s c hildren within the meaning of by-law 5(3)( _c_ ) of the Presc ribed By-Laws were all findings of fac t not open to c hallenge. Moreover, these findings were substantiated by the evidenc e. 

35     First, the strata title plan demarc ated the relevant areas as c ommon property. In respec t of Work 2, the respondent added that “roofs” had been defined as c ommon property under the Land Titles (Strata) Ac t (“LTSA”) (Cap 158, 1999 Rev Ed) before the Ac t c ame into forc e, and that this should still be the c ase as Parliament had not intended the Ac t to c hange the definition of c ommon 


property (see _Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 367 v Lee Siew Yuen and another_ <span class="citation">[2014] 4 SLR 445</span> (“ _Lee Siew Yuen_ ”) at [22]–[23]). 

36     Sec ond, the Board was c orrec t to find that the appellant had not submitted any applic ation for the installation of the Works prior to c ommenc ing them. The respondent also maintained that the Additional ByLaws were not inc onsistent with the Ac t but fell within the sc ope of s 32. In this regard, it highlighted Parliament’s intention for the Ac t to provide flexibility and promote selfregulation amongst management c orporations. 

37     Third, the appellant’s c ontention that Works 2 and 3 had been installed for his c hildren’s health and safety (thus falling within by-law 5(3)( _c_ ) of the Presc ribed ByLaws) surfac ed belatedly for the first time in the STB Applic ation and was unsubstantiated by evidenc e. There was no reason for his c hildren to frequent the flat roof at level 30 when it was not part of the appellant’s lot and was intended to be ac c essed for maintenanc e purposes only. 

38     Fourth, the Board’s finding that Work 3 amounted to exc lusive use or enjoyment of c ommon property within the meaning of s 33 of the Ac t was supported by the authorities of _Mark Wheeler v The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 751 and another_ [2003] SGSTB 5 (“ _Mark Wheeler_ ”), _Anne Lee Heng T/A Tian Hup Chan Warehousing v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1360_ [2011] SGSTB 1 (“ _Anne Lee_ ”) and _Yap Sing Lee v MCST Plan No 1267_ [2013] SGSTB 10 (“ _Yap Sing Lee_ ”). Given that the appellant’s proposed resolutions to ac quire exc lusive use of the relevant areas had been roundly rejec ted at the 2015 AGM, it was “hardly appropriate” for him to attempt to undermine the dec ision of the other subsidiary proprietors by means of an appeal to the High Court. 

39     Fifth, s 111( _a_ ) of the Ac t c ould have no retrospec tive effec t. The wording of s 111( _a_ ) c ontemplated a subsidiary proprietor’s proposal “ _to effect_ ” alterations or additions to c ommon property, and henc e c ould not apply where the alterations or additions had already been effec ted. 

40     Sixth, the Board was right to find that the Works had not been erec ted “in or upon” the appellant’s lot, and henc e c ould not have been authorised by the respondent under s 37(4) of the Ac t, whic h was limited to works installed _within_ the subsidiary proprietor’s lot. The respondent moreover c ontended that s 111( _b_ ) of the Ac t was, like s 111( _a_ ), prospec tive in effec t, and thus did not permit the Board to order that the respondent c onsent to works already installed. 

**The issues** 

41     Various issues were framed by the Applic ation and raised in argument. The key questions of law raised by the appellant c an be summarised as follows: 

 (a) what was the c orrec t interpretation and applic ation of “c ommon property”; 

 (b) whether the appellant had breac hed by-laws 8.1.1 and 8.2.5 of the Additional By-Laws; 

 (c ) whether the Works fell within by-law 5(3)( c ) of the Presc ribed By-Laws; 

 (d) what was the c orrec t interpretation and applic ation of ss 33 and 58 of the Ac t; 

 (e) whether s 111( a ) of the Ac t c ould apply retrospec tively; and 

 (f ) whether improvements outside a lot c ould c onstitute improvements “in or upon” a lot within 


 the meaning of s 37 of the Ac t. 

**Issue 1: the meaning of common property** 

42     This issue, on whic h both parties spilt muc h ink and spent muc h energy, was of c entral importanc e in partic ular as to Work 1. The princ ipal disc ord between the parties was whether the twin limbs in the definition of “c ommon property” in s 2(1) of the Ac t ought to be read c onjunc tively, as use of the word “and” in the sec tion naturally suggests, or disjunc tively. The appellant argued the former and the respondent the latter. Sec tion 2(1) of the Ac t defines “c ommon property” as: 

 ( a ) in relation to any land and building c omprised or to be c omprised in a strata title plan, suc h part of the land and building — 

 (i) not c omprised in any lot or proposed lot in that strata title plan; and 

 (ii) used or c apable of being used or enjoyed by oc c upiers of 2 or more lots or proposed lots; or 

 ( b ) in relation to any other land and building, suc h part of the land and building — 

 (i) not c omprised in any non-strata lot; and 

 (ii) used or c apable of being used or enjoyed by oc c upiers of 2 or more non-strata lots within that land or building; 

43     For present purposes, only sub-sub-s ( _a_ ) is relevant. An interesting question whic h arose in the c ourse of the proc eedings, partic ularly in relation to Work 1, was whether “c ommon property” inc luded areas evidently not intended for the enjoyment of _any_ oc c upier (as opposed to areas intended for the enjoyment of the oc c upiers of two or more lots). Suc h an area would _prima facie_ by definition be inc apable of “being used or enjoyed by oc c upiers of 2 or more lots”, thereby failing limb (ii) of the definition of “c ommon property”. In the final analysis, this question proved to be the turning point as regards Work 1. 

44     The wide ledges, while demarc ated as c ommon property in the strata title plan, were not ac c essible to any subsidiary proprietors, the appellant inc luded. While adjoined to the Unit, they were c learly not intended for the appellant’s personal use as they were originally sealed off from the Unit by fixed glass panels. It was the appellant who had taken matters into his hands and replac ed those panels with sliding panels as part of Work 1. It is perhaps unsurprising that ac c ess had been bloc ked, as the ledges do not appear to have been safe for use. As noted earlier, the ledges were not meant to serve as balc onies for the Unit – the height of the parapet and the fac t that they were not reflec ted as part of the Unit in the strata title plan were dead giveaways in this regard. Indeed, the appellant did not argue that the ledges were meant for use by the oc c upants of the Unit. The respondent stated that the ledges were intended to be ac c essed from the external faç ade of the building by the respondent’s staff for maintenanc e purposes. This was not c hallenged by the appellant. 

45     As noted earlier, the appellant asserted that the wide ledges did not c onstitute c ommon property bec ause they failed the sec ond limb of s 2(1), whic h he argued must be interpreted c onjunc tively. The respondent argued instead for a disjunc tive interpretation, suc h that any area c onstituted c ommon property so long as it fulfilled either of the two limbs in s 2(1) ( _ie_ , _either_ was not c omprised in any lot in the strata title plan _or_ was used or c apable of being used by the oc c upiers of 


two or more lots). 

46     Having c arefully c onsidered the arguments and the ric h vein of authorities that the parties most helpfully plac ed before me, I agreed with the appellant that the two limbs should be read as c onjunc tive requirements. This approac h is borne out by c ase law and literature: see, _eg_ , _Lee Siew Yuen_ at [27]; _Lee Lay Ting Jane v MCST Plan No 3414_ [2015] SGSTB 5 (“ _Lee Lay Ting Jane_ ”) at [31]; Teo Keang Sood, _Strata Title in Singapore and Malaysia_ (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2015) at para 6.04; _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 14 (LexisNexis, 2014) para 170.0206 n 4. As will bec ome apparent, I believe it is also supported by the lineage of the definition in s 2(1). 

47     Both parties took the position that Parliament did not intend to substantively vary the premeaning of “c ommon property” in the Ac t. They were c orrec t. However, they adopted diametric ally opposing interpretations of the pre-2004 meaning of “c ommon property”. The respondent argued that the pre-2004 meaning of “c ommon property” was simply all property not c omprised in any lot; the appellant argued that the property must additionally exist for c ommon use by two or more subsidiary proprietors in order to be c onsidered c ommon property. In order to determine this dispute it would be helpful to delve into the legislative history of the definition. This originally borrowed heavily from New South Wales (“NSW”) legislation, whic h I will first sketc h briefly before moving to the definition of c ommon property in Singapore. 

**_Legislative history of the definition of “common property”_** 

48     NSW’s Conveyanc ing (Strata Titles) Ac t 1961 was enac ted to address defic ienc ies in the methods of subdividing property in NSW at the time, whic h c ould not provide the individual oc c upant of a unit with the sec urity of separate title and ownership. This was espec ially pressing in the surge of demand for multi-storey residential buildings and residential flats following the end of the Sec ond World War: Alex Ilkin, _Strata Title Management and the Law_ (The Law Book Company Limited, 1989) at pp 4–5. The Conveyanc ing (Strata Titles) Ac t 1961 enabled property to be subdivided into c ommon areas and lots, with separate title and ownership of the lots, and provided the following definition of “c ommon property” at s 2: 

 “Common property” means so muc h of the land for the time being c omprised in a strata plan as is not c omprised in any lot shown in suc h plan. 

49     Sinc e then, the meaning of “c ommon property” in NSW has not c hanged substantively despite minor amendments to the definition: _cf_ s 5(1) of the Strata Titles Ac t 1973 (subsequently renamed the Strata Sc hemes (Freehold Development) Ac t 1973), s 4(1) of the Strata Sc hemes (Leasehold Development) Ac t 1986 and Part 1 of the Dic tionary to the Strata Sc hemes Management Ac t 1996. 

50     Presently, s 4(1) of the NSW Strata Sc hemes Development Ac t 2015 states: 

 common property , in relation to a strata sc heme or a proposed strata sc heme, means any part of a parc el that is not c omprised in a lot (inc luding any c ommon infrastruc ture that is not part of a lot). 

51     In turn, “c ommon infrastruc ture” is defined in s 4(1) as: 

 (a) the c ubic spac e oc c upied by a vertic al struc tural member of a building, other than a wall, or 

 (b) the pipes, wires, c ables or duc ts that are not for the exc lusive benefit of one lot and are: 


 (i) in a building in relation to whic h a plan for registration as a strata plan was lodged with the Registrar-General before 1 Marc h 1986, or 

 (ii) otherwise—in a building or in a part of a parc el that is not a building, or 

 (c ) the c ubic spac e enc losed by a struc ture enc losing pipes, wires, c ables or duc ts referred to in paragraph (b). 

52     The definition of “c ommon property” in NSW has thus always been, and remains, all the land within the strata sc heme not c omprised in any lot. This simplic ity of approac h has muc h to c ommend it. It provided the basis for the definition of “c ommon property” that was introduc ed in Singapore. 

53     In Singapore, prior to 2004, “c ommon property” was defined in two statutes: the LTSA and the Buildings and Common Property (Maintenanc e and Management) Ac t (“BCPA”) (repealed). The first edition of the LTSA (“1967 LTSA”), whic h was the earlier statute, was modelled on NSW’s Conveyanc ing (Strata Titles) Ac t 1961 ( _Strata Title in Singapore and Malaysia_ at para 1.01). The need for the LTSA arose from the lac k of a designated authority responsible for the upkeep of c ommon areas in flats, and was desc ribed by then Minister for Law and National Development Mr E W Barker in the following terms ( _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (27 February 1967) vol 25 at c ols 1113–1114): 

 Under existing prac tic e, what the purc haser of a flat usually obtains is a 999-year lease in a building. The freehold title in the land above whic h the flat is built is either retained by the vendor who imposes on eac h of his lessees a servic e c harge for the maintenanc e of c ommon parts and property or is c onveyed in proportionate shares to the purc hasers of all flats built on the land as tenants in c ommon. Experienc e has shown that it is diffic ult for tenants to get together and problems arise when lifts break down or pipes burst. This rather unsatisfac tory state of affairs has impeded the development and sale of flats in the Republic and the Bill now before the House, whic h is based on Australian legislation, takes ac c ount of the c omments of the former Bar Committee and seeks to remove these diffic ulties. 

54     To c ombat these diffic ulties, the 1967 LTSA adopted the Australian strata title system. To address the issue of responsibility for c ommon areas, the 1967 LTSA c reated the “management c orporation”, a body c omprising all the flat owners whic h would be responsible for the maintenanc e of c ommon property. When the LTSA was first enac ted in 1967, s 3 c ontained the following definition: 

 “c ommon property” means, in relation to a subdivided building, so muc h of the land for the time being c omprised in a strata title plan as is not c omprised in any lot shown therein; 

55     It would be apparent that this definition adopted the simplic ity of approac h taken in the NSW’s Conveyanc ing (Strata Titles) Ac t 1961. In essenc e, all areas of the strata development whic h were not c omprised in any individual lot were by definition c ommon property. This definition was reproduc ed without amendment in the 1970 Revised Edition of the LTSA and persisted until 1976. 

56     Unfortunately, the objec tives of the LTSA were met with limited suc c ess. Six years after the LTSA was enac ted, the BCPA was introduc ed to address the persisting neglec t of c ommon property. Mr E W Barker introduc ed the Buildings and Common Property (Maintenanc e and Management) Bill with the following words ( _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (20 Marc h 1973) vol 32 at c ol 1095): 

 Large numbers of high-rise flats and other buildings have been c onstruc ted in Singapore in rec ent 


 years, and many of them are not properly managed and maintained. In many c ases, the owners, management c orporations or persons responsible for their maintenanc e and management have not been disc harging their func tions properly and have allowed the buildings to fall into disrepair. Steps have to be taken to ensure that this unsatisfac tory position is rec tified before it further deteriorates. With the encouragement of condominium development, the need to ensure that the buildings and the amenities and facilities shared in common are properly managed and maintained has now become even more urgent. It is therefore proposed to set up a public authority with appropriate powers to deal with this problem. It is to this end that this Bill is now before the House. 

 [emphasis added] 

57     The BCPA was a short Ac t initially numbering only 11 sec tions (although by the date of its repeal it had expanded to 23 sec tions), and appears to have been largely supplementary to the LTSA. It was desc ribed as an “Ac t to provide for the proper maintenanc e and management of buildings and c ommon property in Singapore” and its c hief purpose appears to have been to establish the offic e of Commissioner of Buildings, who was c harged with the administration of the BCPA and Part IV of the LTSA. The Commissioner’s primary func tion under the BCPA was to require owners of buildings to c arry out repairs and maintenanc e to the buildings and c ommon property. Curiously, for reasons unexplained, instead of adopting the LTSA’s definition of “c ommon property”, s 2 of the 1973 edition of the BCPA (“1973 BCPA”) offered its own definition as follows: 

 “c ommon property” inc ludes fixture and fittings (inc luding lifts), refuse c hutes, refuse bin c ompounds, drains, sewers, pipes, wires, c ables and duc ts, the exterior of all common parts of the building, playing fields, driveways, c ar parks, open spac es, landsc aped areas, walls and fenc es and all other fac ilities and installations used, or capable of being used or enjoyed in common ; 

 [emphasis added] 

58     The element of c ommon usage was therefore woven into the definition for the first time. This was a theme that had resonated in the parliamentary speec hes on the bill. 

59     As the parliamentary debates and Selec t Committee Report did not disc uss the definition of “c ommon property”, why the LTSA definition was not adopted is a matter for spec ulation. Given the BCPA’s _raison d'être_ of ensuring that statutory duties c onc erning the maintenanc e and repair of c ommon property would be ac tively enforc ed, it might be supposed that draftsmen hoped a more c onc rete definition of “c ommon property” would c larify the duties of the management c orporation and aid the Commissioner in the disc harge of his duties. 

60     Three years after the enac tment of the 1973 BCPA, the 1967 LTSA’s definition of “c ommon property” was substantially amended by the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Ac t 1976. The 1976 version of the LTSA (“1976 LTSA”) appears to have gone the way of the 1973 BCPA, substituting the previous c lean-c ut definition of “c ommon property” with the following: 

 “c ommon property” – 

 ( a ) in relation to subdivided buildings in an approved plan bearing the title of ‘c ondominium’ and issued by the relevant authority, means so muc h of the land for the time being not c omprised in any lot shown in a strata title plan or in any parts of any building unit (partially erec ted or to be erec ted) intended to be inc luded as lots in a strata title plan to be lodged with the Registrar after 


 strata subdivision of the building unit has been approved by the relevant authority; 

 ( b ) in relation to any subdivided building whic h is c omprised in any plan approved by the relevant authority other than a plan bearing the title of ‘c ondominium’, means so muc h of the land for the time being not c omprised in any lot shown in a strata title plan; and 

 ( c ) unless otherwise desc ribed spec ific ally as c omprised in any lot in a strata title plan and shown as c apable of being c omprised in suc h lot, inc ludes – 

 (i) foundations, c olumns, gardens and external beams, supports, main walls, roofs, walls, lobbies, c orridors, stairs, stairways, fire esc apes, entranc es, exits of the building or buildings; 

 (ii) c ar parks, rec reational or c ommunity fac ilities, gardens, parking areas, roofs, and storage spac es; 

 (iii) c entral and appurtenant installations for servic es suc h as power, light, gas, hot and c old water, heating, refrigeration, and air-c onditioning and inc inerators; 

 (iv) esc alators, lifts, tanks, pumps, motors, fans, c ompressors, duc ts, and in general all apparatus and installations existing for c ommon use; 

 (v) all fac ilities desc ribed as c ommon property in any plan approved by the relevant authority for a c ondominium development and all fac ilities whic h may be shown in a legend of a strata title plan as c ommon property; and 

 (vi) all other parts of the land not c omprised in any lot nec essary or c onvenient to the existenc e and maintenanc e and for the reasonable c ommon use and safety of the c ommon property. 

61     Sub-ss ( _a_ ) and ( _b_ ) essentially retained the princ iple that land not c omprised in any lot was c ommon property, the only variant being whether the building was c lassified as a c ondominium or otherwise. Sub-s ( _c_ ) deemed c ertain spec ified features to be c ommon property unless the feature was spec ific ally desc ribed as c omprised in a lot and c apable of being so c omprised. 

62     Unfortunately and somewhat surprisingly, the parliamentary debates and Selec t Committee Report again shed no light on the rationale behind the reworking of the definition. I surmise that three objec tives were at play. The first was to make c lear that the overarc hing requirement was that the area in question was not desc ribed as c omprised in any lot in the strata title plan. The sec ond was to fac ilitate the management c orporation’s disc harge of its day-to-day duties by giving it assuranc e that the spec ified features in sub-ss ( _c_ )(i) to (v) were indeed within its purview. Suc h guidanc e would have been vital, given that the distinc tion between c ommon property and private property undergirds the division of responsibility for maintenanc e and c are of areas in the development – responsibility for c ommon property falling on the management c orporation and responsibility for individual lots on the relevant subsidiary proprietor. The advent of strata-titled c ondominium developments perhaps made the need for c larity and guidanc e in this regard more urgent. The third objec tive was to emphasise the element of c ommon use. Under the reworded definition, the mere fac t that the land or area in question was not part of any lot did not automatic ally mean that it was c ommon property. The land or area must also be meant for c ommon use as opposed to the sole use of a lot. This is evident from the nature of the areas and installations identified in sub-ss ( _c_ )(i) to (v) and most so in relation to sub-s ( _c_ )(vi), whic h had c ommon use as its c entral theme. It is quite c lear that sub-s ( _c_ )(vi) would have served no purpose if the sole c riterion was whether the area was c omprised within a lot. That was 


already stated c learly in sub-ss ( _a_ ) and ( _b_ ). It appears c lear that sub-ss ( _c_ )(i) to (vi) were an expansion of the definition of “c ommon property” in s 2 of the 1973 BCPA. 

63     In 1982, the definition of “c ommon property” in the 1973 BCPA was partly revised in line with that in the 1976 LTSA. It is not nec essary to set out the amended definition for my present purposes. It suffic es to say that the effec t of the 1982 amendment was to adopt the 1976 LTSA definition of “c ommon property” in relation to _completed_ strata developments while retaining the definition of “c ommon property” in the 1973 BCPA with c osmetic amendments in respec t of non-strata developments and _uncompleted_ strata developments. This bifurc ation persisted (with minor amendments to both the LTSA and BCPA definitions) until 2004. 

64     In 2003, the prevailing LTSA definition of “c ommon property” was c onsequentially amended by the Planning (Amendment) Ac t 2003. The amendment abolished the distinc tion between subdivided buildings bearing the title of “c ondominium” and those that did not, substituting the old sub-ss ( _a_ ) and ( _b_ ) with a new merged sub-s ( _a_ ). The definition of “c ommon property” in the 2003 version of the LTSA (“2003 LTSA”) immediately prior to its revision in the Building Maintenanc e and Strata Management Ac t 2004 largely mirrored the definition in the 1976 LTSA and was as follows: 

 “c ommon property” – 

 ( a ) in relation to any subdivided building, means so muc h of the land for the time being not c omprised in any lot shown in a strata title plan or in any parts of any building unit (partially erec ted or to be erec ted) intended to be inc luded as lots in a strata title plan to be lodged with the Registrar; and 

 ( c ) unless otherwise desc ribed spec ific ally as c omprised in any lot in a strata title plan and shown as c apable of being c omprised in suc h lot, inc ludes – 

 (i) foundations, c olumns, beams, supports, walls, roofs, lobbies, c orridors, stairs, stairways, fire esc apes, entranc es and exits of the building and windows installed in the external walls of the building; 

 (ii) c ar parks, rec reational or c ommunity fac ilities, gardens, parking areas, roofs, storage spac es and rooms approved by the relevant authority for the use of a management c orporation and its members; 

 (iii) c entral and appurtenant installations for servic es suc h as power, light, gas, hot and c old water, heating, refrigeration, air-c onditioning and inc inerators; 

 (iv) esc alators, lifts, tanks, pumps, motors, fans, c ompressors, duc ts, and in general all apparatus and installations existing for c ommon use; 

 (v) water pipes, drainage pipes, sewerage pipes, gas pipes and elec tric al c ables whic h serve 2 or more lots; 

 (vi) all fac ilities desc ribed as c ommon property in any plan approved by the relevant authority for a c ondominium development and all fac ilities whic h may be shown in a legend of a strata title plan as c ommon property; and 

 (vii) all other parts of the land not c omprised in any lot nec essary or c onvenient to the existenc e and maintenanc e and for the reasonable c ommon use and safety of the c ommon 


 property; 

**_Revision in the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act_** 

65     That Parliament had no intention of substantively c hanging the meaning of “c ommon property” in the Ac t from its meaning pre-2004 is evident from the progress of the draft bill, originally introduc ed as the Building Maintenanc e and Management Bill (Bill No 6/2004) (“the Draft Bill”). At the time of its first reading in Parliament on 6 February 2004, the Draft Bill proposed the following definition of “c ommon property”: 

 “c ommon property”, in relation to any land and building not c omprised in a strata title plan, means 

- 

 ( a ) the foundations, c olumns, beams, supports, roofs, external walls (inc luding any window installed in any external wall of the building), lobbies, c orridors, stairways, fire esc apes, entranc es and exits of any building c omprised in the parc el; 

 ( b ) the c ar parks, gardens, rec reational or c ommunity fac ilities for the c ommon use of oc c upiers of lots or proposed lots within any suc h building; 

 ( c ) the esc alators, lifts, tanks, pumps, motors, fans, c ompressors, duc ts and in general all apparatus and installations existing for the c ommon use of oc c upiers of all lots or proposed lots within any suc h building; 

 ( d ) the pipes, wires, c ables, c hutes, duc ts and other fac ilities for the passage or provision of water, sewage, drainage, gas, oil, elec tric ity, telephone, radio, television, garbage, heating and c ooling systems, or other similar servic es, if they are loc ated – 

 (i) within a floor, wall or c eiling that forms a boundary – 

 (A) between a lot or proposed lot and another lot or proposed lot in any suc h building; 

 (B) between a lot or proposed lot and the c ommon property; or 

 (C) between a lot or proposed lot or the c ommon property and another parc el; or 

 (ii) wholly or partially within a lot or proposed lot, if they are c apable of being and intended to be used in c onnec tion with the enjoyment of the c ommon property; and 

 ( e ) all other parts of the parc el not c omprised in any lot or proposed lot and nec essary for the c ommon use of oc c upiers of all lots or proposed lots in that parc el, 

 and in the case of any land and building comprised in a strata title plan, “common property” has the same meaning as in the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap. 158 ). 

 [emphasis added] 

66     The Draft Bill thus originally maintained a distinc tion between strata and non-strata developments. Strata developments would c ontinue to utilise the 2003 LTSA definition of c ommon property. Non-strata developments, on the other hand, would adopt a definition of c ommon property substantially based on the 2003 LTSA definition, but whic h interwove elements whic h were either new or borrowed from the BCPA definition as amended. 


67     As a segue, the evolution of the definition of “c ommon property” from the LTSA in 1967 to the Draft Bill in 2004 shows that the element of c ommon usage ac quired growing signific anc e over time. The 1967 LTSA had adopted NSW’s broad definition, by whic h all property not c omprised in any lot was by definition c ommon property. The 1973 BCPA introduc ed a far more prac tic al definition whic h enumerated c onc rete examples of c ommon property, presumably to aid management c orporations and proprietors in distinguishing c ommon property from individual lots on a day-to-day basis. The 1973 BCPA definition inc luded “all other fac ilities and installations used, or c apable of being used or enjoyed in c ommon”. The LTSA followed suit in 1976, supplying its own expanded list of features that were deemed to be c ommon property unless otherwise desc ribed (see [60] above). Some of these features implic itly or explic itly inc orporated a referenc e to c ommon usage. Sub-s ( _c_ )(ii), for example, referred to “rec reational or c ommunity fac ilities” and other areas whic h were approved “for the use of a management c orporation and its members”. Sub-s ( _c_ )(iv) referred to “all apparatus and installations existing for c ommon use”. Sub-s ( _c_ )(v) referred to pipes and c ables whic h “serve two or more lots”. In addition to listing spec ific instanc es of c ommon property, the 2003 LTSA definition also stated in sub-s ( _c_ )(vi) that “c ommon property” would inc lude “all other parts of the land not c omprised in any lot nec essary or c onvenient to the existenc e and maintenanc e and for the reasonable c ommon use and safety of the c ommon property”. 

68     The definition proposed in the Draft Bill c ontinued this trend by adopting the 2003 LTSA definition for strata developments. The draft definition of “c ommon property” for non-strata developments also inc orporated this princ iple, adopting referenc es to rec reational or c ommunity fac ilities “for the c ommon use of oc c upiers of lots or proposed lots” (sub-sub-s ( _b_ )), “all apparatus and installations existing for the c ommon use of oc c upiers of all lots or proposed lots” (sub-sub-s ( _c_ )) and “all other parts of the parc el not c omprised in any lot or proposed lot and nec essary for the c ommon use of oc c upiers of all lots or proposed lots” (sub-sub-s ( _e_ )). Notably, the definition further stated that pipes, wires, c ables, c hutes, duc ts and other fac ilities for the provision of elec tric al, water, gas and other suc h servic es would be c onsidered c ommon property _even if_ they were loc ated within a lot, provided they were “ _capable of being and intended to be used in connection with the enjoyment of the common property_ ” (sub-sub-s ( _d_ )(ii)). The requirement of c ommon use was thus firmly entrenc hed in the definition of “c ommon property” proposed in the Draft Bill. 

69     However, the proposed definition was eventually substituted with the c urrent and sleeker s 2(1) definition. The rationale for the substitution c an be gleaned from the following remarks in the _Report of the Select Committee on the Building Maintenance and Management Bill (Bill No 6/2004)_ (Parl 5 of 2004, 7 Oc tober 2004) (“the Selec t Committee Report”): 

 10 Some representors felt that the definition of c ommon property for non-strata developments in this Bill should be similar to that for strata developments in the LTSA. The definition of common property in the LTSA was well-accepted by the industry and it would cause less confusion if there was a standard definition. 

 11 The Committee ac c epted this suggestion and rec ommended that the Bill be amended to inc orporate a generic definition of c ommon property to c over both strata and non-strata developments. 

 [emphasis added] 

70     This move appears to have been in response to two papers presented to the Selec t Committee. One paper, submitted by the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers (“SISV”), c ontained the following c omments: 


 2.1 The definition of “Common Property” as provided in this Bill makes a distinc tion between land and buildings not c omprised in a strata title plan and those c omprised in a strata title plan. ... 

 2.2 Common Property is defined to great tec hnic al details [ sic ] in this Bill. We are of the opinion that this very detailed definition of “common property” can create confusion and give rise to ambiguity in interpretation. This is partic ularly in relation to the definition as provided in (d)(i) (A) to (C), (d)(ii) and (e) whic h attempts to enumerate all types of sc enarios with regard to the loc ation of pipes, wires etc between lots, buildings, c ommon property, another land parc el etc. It is envisaged that with changing technology and architecture, it is not possible to be exhaustive in providing for all types of scenarios regarding common property. 

 2.3 We propose that to avoid confusion, the Bill should adopt the same definition of common property as in the LTSA which is already known and accepted by people in the industry. 

 [emphasis added in italic s and bold italic s] 

71     These c omments were ec hoed in the paper submitted by the Assoc iation of Property and Fac ility Managers (“APFM”): 

 6.2.1 A new definition of c ommon property has been inc luded in the legislation whic h makes a distinc tion between land and building not c omprised in a strata title plan and those c omprised in a strata title plan. The definition further provides that in the c ase of land and building c omprised in a strata title plan “c ommon property” has the same meaning as in the Land Titles (Strata) Ac t. The current definition of common property under the LTSA is generally known to people in the industry. We suggest that the definition of common property provided in the LTSA be adopted in order to avoid confusion. To c ater for land and buildings whic h are not under the strata title legislation, the present definition of c ommon property spelt out in the Buildings and Common Property (Maintenanc e and Management Ac t) (Cap 30) may be inc orporated. 

 [emphasis added in italic s and bold italic s] 

72     Both papers thus stressed that members of the industry were familiar with the 2003 LTSA definition of c ommon property, and that introduc ing a new and separate definition of c ommon property for non-strata developments would c ause c onfusion. The SISV also noted the c omplexity of the proposed definition and c autioned against attempting to be exhaustive. It was on ac c ount of this feedbac k that Parliament “dec ided to simplify the definition of c ommon property without having to list any struc ture that are generally c onsidered as part of c ommon property” ( _Lee Siew Yuen_ at [22]). It did this by removing the lengthy list of features previously c ontained in sub-s ( _c_ ) of the LTSA 2003 definition and harmonising the definitions of c ommon property in strata and non-strata developments. It also introduc ed limb (ii) of the definition of c ommon property in s 2(1)( _a_ ) of the Ac t (see [42] above). Limb (ii) enc apsulated the c onc ept of c ommon usage that had run through sub-ss ( _c_ )(i) to (vi) of the 2003 LTSA definition, while limb (i) preserved the overarc hing requirement that the area was not part of any lot. 

73     Thus, based on the Selec t Committee’s deliberations, I agree with the parties that despite rewording the definition of c ommon property in s 2(1) of the Ac t, Parliament intended to essentially preserve the 2003 LTSA definition of c ommon property as this was ac c epted by the industry. It is ac c ordingly important to asc ertain the pre-2004 meaning of c ommon property not only with referenc e to the (admittedly unwieldy) 2003 LTSA definition, but also to its prac tic al applic ation, whic h would have guided the c ommon understanding of industry stakeholders. In this regard, I found that the 


element of c ommon usage was equally prominent in the c ases pre-2004. Two c ases are instruc tive: 

 (a) In Re Faber Garden (Strata Titles Plan No. 1047) [1993] SGSTB 1 (“ Re Faber Garden ”), it fell to be determined whether a solar hot water heater, elec tric ally heated hot water storage tank and water tank were c ommon property. The three struc tures were situated on the apartment roof, whic h was c ommon property. The water heater and storage tank served to supply hot water to the applic ant’s apartment exc lusively, but the water tank served more than one lot. The Board observed that “the requirement of c entral or c ommon usage is repeated in many provisions of the Ac t”, c iting the list of features in sub-s ( c ) of the 1988 Revised Edition LTSA definition of c ommon property. The Board henc e “interpret[ed] sec tion 3 of the Ac t to require the ingredient of c ommon usage for c ommon property”. Sinc e the water heater and storage tank served the applic ant exc lusively, they were not c ommon property. 

 (b) In Tsui Sai Cheong and another v MCST Plan No. 1186 (Loyang Valley) and others <span class="citation">[1995] 3 SLR(R) 713</span> (“ Tsui Sai Cheong ”), it fell to be determined whether a water pipe whic h had c orroded was c ommon property. The water pipe exc lusively served the subsidiary proprietors’ unit and was embedded in the c onc rete floor both inside and outside the unit. The sec tion of the pipe whic h had c orroded was embedded in the c onc rete floor outside the unit, whic h parties agreed was c ommon property. The High Court Judge held that the fac t that part of the pipe was embedded in a c onc rete slab whic h was c ommon property did not automatic ally turn that part of the pipe into c ommon property. Instead he found that the pipe was the property of the appellants. This was c onsistent with the princ iple in Re Faber Garden that installations situated outside a lot but whic h serve the exc lusive use of the proprietors of that lot are the property of the proprietors. 

I therefore found that the meaning of “c ommon property” prior to 2004, and whic h is unc hanged by the Ac t, required the area to be for c ommon use. 

74     This analysis is admittedly not without diffic ulty. On its fac e, the LTSA definitions state no requirement of c ommon usage. Sub-ss ( _a_ ) and ( _b_ ) of the 2003 LTSA definition (see [64] above) appear to straightforwardly define “c ommon property” as all property not c omprised in any lot in the strata title plan, while the long list of fac ilities in sub-ss ( _c_ ) seems to merely c lassify spec ific fac ilities as c ommon property for the avoidanc e of doubt. (This interpretation appears to have been adopted by _MCST Plan No 958 v Tay Soo Seng_ <span class="citation">[1992] 3 SLR(R) 818</span> (“ _Tay Soo Seng_ ”) at [13].) 

75     However, this ignores sub-s ( _c_ )(vii) of the 2003 LTSA definition (see [64] above), whic h stated that c ommon property inc luded “all other parts of the land not c omprised in any lot nec essary or c onvenient to the existenc e and maintenanc e and for the reasonable c ommon use and safety of the c ommon property”. If the operative definition of “c ommon property” stopped short at all land not c omprised in any lot in the strata title as stated in sub-s ( _a_ ), sub-s ( _c_ )(vii) would have been totally redundant. Sub-s ( _c_ )(vii) c an only be read c oherently if understood to inc orporate an additional element of c ommon use in the c harac terisation of c ommon property, a theme whic h runs through subss ( _c_ )(i) to (vi). I also do not c onsider _Tay Soo Seng_ to be authoritative on this point: sinc e the c ourt had found that the installation in question—a glass panel in that c ase— _was_ c omprised in the subsidiary proprietor’s lot, the argument that it was c ommon property fell at the first hurdle. The question whether property _not_ c omprised in any unit, but nevertheless not intended not for c ommon use, would still c onstitute c ommon property did not arise on the fac ts. 

76     I was further fortified in my analysis by the newly proposed amendments to the Ac t, whic h were available on the Building and Construc tion Authority’s website for the purpose of public c onsultation in February 2017 (the text of the amendment is reproduc ed at paragraph [87] below). The c urrent meaning of “c ommon property” under s 2(1) of the Ac t was desc ribed as follows: 


 "Common property" in a strata development refers to an element in relation to any land and building shown in the strata title plan whic h is not c omprised in any unit and is also used or c apable of being used or enjoyed by oc c upiers of 2 or more units. 

 [emphasis added] 

77     In the final analysis, I agreed with the appellant that the two limbs in the definition of c ommon property in s 2(1) of the Ac t are to be read c onjunc tively. Common property refers to that part of the land whic h is _both_ “not c omprised in any lot or proposed lot in that strata title plan”, _and_ “used or c apable of being used or enjoyed by oc c upiers of 2 or more lots or proposed lots”. 

**_The proper application of s 2(1)_** 

78     Having established that the two limbs were to be read c onjunc tively, I was of the view that the c orrec t way to apply the sec ond limb of the definition was to ask whether the area/installation in question was for the exc lusive use of the oc c upier of the unit in question (rather than whether it was for the use of the oc c upiers of two or more lots). If so, it followed as a matter of logic that it c ould not c onc urrently be used or c apable of being used by two or more oc c upiers. There is a subtle but signific ant purpose to reading the sec ond limb in this manner, whic h is believe is more c onsonant with the purpose of the definition. I will c ome to this shortly. 

79     The princ iple underlying the definition of “c ommon property” in s 2(1) of the Ac t was desc ribed in the following terms in _Lee Siew Yuen_ at [33]: 

 The purpose behind the definition of c ommon property under s 2(1) of the BMSMA is to exc lude from c ommon property those objec ts that are solely c onstruc ted within the subsidiary proprietor’s unit for the enjoyment of the subsidiary proprietor only. This is c onsistent with the term “c ommon”, whic h indic ates that the partic ular property must serve a c ommon purpose. 

 [emphasis added] 

80     This same princ iple was ec hoed in _Strata Title in Singapore and Malaysia_ at para 6.22: 

 Where the items in question are not desc ribed as c omprised in any lot in a strata title plan, they would not be regarded as common property if they are not for common usage but are for the exclusive use of a lot , with the c onsequenc e that they are the responsibility of the subsidiary proprietor of the lot c onc erned. 

 [emphasis added] 

81     A long line of dec isions by the Board also enshrines this princ iple (see [83] below). 

82     While “exc lusive use” and “c ommon usage” are for the most part two sides of the same c oin, one being the c onverse of the other, there is a subtle but signific ant differenc e in the applic ation of the two tests. If the area or installation is intended for use by the oc c upiers of two or more lots, it follows that it c ould not have been meant for the _exclusive_ use of any one lot. However, the fac t that the area or installation c annot be used by the oc c upiers of two or more lots does not _a fortiori_ mean that it is intended for the exc lusive use of a single lot. _It may not in fact be intended for the direct use of any occupier at all._ The wide ledges on whic h Work 1 was loc ated were a c lear illustration of this – they were neither meant to be used nor c apable of being used by the oc c upants of the Unit. 


83     On the appellant’s approac h, so long as the area or installation was inc apable of being used by the oc c upiers of two or more lots, it would not be c ommon property (even if the first limb in s 2(1) of the Ac t is satisfied). It would not be nec essary to examine whether the area or installation is for the exc lusive use of the oc c upants of a lot. I did not believe that was the c orrec t way to read the sec ond limb of the definition of c ommon property in s 2(1). The primary question, as the authorities and lineage of the definition suggest, must be whether the area or installation is used or only c apable of being used exc lusively by the oc c upier of a lot, thereby negating c ommon use. This requirement of exc lusive use is inherent in limb (ii) of the definition of “c ommon property” and represents the true legislative intention. Ac c ordingly, the c orrec t inquiry is whether the area or installation is for the exc lusive use of the lot in question or not. This is borne out by the c ases c ited by the parties: 

 (a) In Tsui Sai Cheong (disc ussed at [73(b)] above), the water pipe was found not to be c ommon property bec ause it delivered water to one apartment exc lusively. 

 (b) Similarly, in Re Faber Garden (disc ussed at [73(a)] above), the fac t that the solar hot water heater and elec tric ally heated hot water storage tank existed for the applic ant’s exc lusive use was c ritic al to the Board’s finding that they were not c ommon property. 

 (c ) In Lee Siew Yuen , the question was whether beams that were loc ated in between the respondent’s unit and the unit above, but whic h served the purpose of supporting the building bloc ks of the development, were c ommon property. The High Court found that they were. The beams served no useful purpose to the respondent. While they c ould not be physic ally ac c essed by any of the other oc c upants of the development, the beams existed for their c ollec tive benefit. The beams were evidently not for the exc lusive use of the respondent. 

 (d) In Sujit Singh Gill v MCST Plan No. 3466 [2015] SGSTB 2, the Board held that a planter box on the balc ony of the applic ant’s unit was not c ommon property. Unlike the present c ase, the balc ony was openly ac c essible by the oc c upiers of that unit and intended for their private use. It was also demarc ated as part of the applic ant’s strata lot in the strata title plan. As suc h, the planter box was c learly for their exc lusive use. The Board thus held that it was not c apable of being used and enjoyed by other oc c upiers and was not c ommon property. 

84     I should add that _MCST Plan No 3727 v Ho Kok Wei/Ng Xiang Rui_ [2015] SGSTB 7, on whic h the appellant relied heavily, was of no relevanc e here. In that c ase, the management c orporation sought a mandatory injunc tion requiring the subsidiary proprietors to remove unauthorised installations on a flat roof whic h was adjac ent to the roof terrac e of the subsidiary proprietors’ lot. The Board’s refusal to grant the injunc tion was _not_ predic ated on a finding that the flat roof was not c ommon property. In fac t, parties agreed that the flat roof was c ommon property and it was referred to as “c ommon property” throughout the Board’s grounds of dec ision. The Board’s remark at [26] that “it is c lear that this area of the c ommon property was not c ommon property that was to be ac c essed and enjoyed by all the subsidiary proprietors in the estate” went rather to its assessment of whether it would be “just and fair” to grant the injunc tion. Given that the installations did not affec t the ac c ess and enjoyment of the other subsidiary proprietors, were not visible to anyone else and had improved rather than damaged the property, the Board saw no point in granting the injunc tion. As the Board ac c epted that the installations had been done on c ommon property, I did not see how this c ase c ould assist the appellant. 

85     Moreover, the appellant’s approac h would c reate an absurdity regarding the issue of ownership and responsibility for maintenanc e. For strata developments, only two forms of ownership are statutorily rec ognised: c ommon ownership over c ommon property and individual ownership in relation to the lot. This is not a distinc tion without differenc e but one of seminal importanc e. Responsibility for 


 Existing provision Content of amendment Rationale 

 "Common property" in a strata development refers to an element in relation to any land and building shown in the strata title plan whic h is not c omprised in any unit and is also used or c apable of being used or enjoyed by oc c upiers of 2 or more units. 

 (a) To make c learer the definition of “c ommon property” to inc lude key struc tural elements (foundations, beams, c olumns) of the building. (b) To make c lear that fire sprinkler and c entral airc onditioning systems are also part of c ommon property to be maintained by the MCST. (c ) To make c lear that any c onduit, pipe, c able, duc ts that servic es two or more lots but may be embedded within one strata lot is to be c onsidered c ommon property. ... 

 Rec ognise that c ritic al c omponents suc h as struc tural elements and systems spanning ac ross strata lots are better maintained by the MCST bec ause MCSTs have a c ollec tive interest in maintaining these struc tures and systems. Also fac ilitate emergenc y repairs and minimise disputes between MCST and individual lot owner on whic h party is to maintain suc h c ommon property rightfully. 

the former falls on the management c orporation and the latter on the owner of the lot. The appellant’s approac h would leave areas or installations whic h c annot be used by the oc c upiers of two or more lots, but whic h are not meant for the exc lusive use of a lot, in a state of unc ertainty. They would not be c ommon property. At the same time, they c ould not be said to form part of a lot. In suc h a situation, in whom would ownership reside and on whom would responsibility for maintenanc e fall? By c ontrast, adopting the exc lusive use approac h that I have suggested removes any unc ertainty as to the ownership and responsibility for maintenanc e. 

86     I had posed this c onundrum to c ounsel for the appellant. However, he was unable to satisfac torily resolve it. He suggested that there c ould be a third c ategory of property (in addition to c ommon property and individual lots) as regards whic h the legal title and responsibility for maintenanc e would be unc ertain. Suc h spec ulation is not logic al. The c reation of suc h unc ertainty would burden management c orporations and subsidiary proprietors, and c ounterac t the pursuit of c larity and c ertainty whic h motivated the definitional amendments from 1967 to 2004. Moreover, Parliament c ould not have intended to subvert, through a mere definitional amendment, the wellestablished sc heme of dual property rights as regards c ommon property and individual lots. No suc h third c ategory of ownership existed under the LTSA prior to 2004. Had Parliament intended to enac t any c hanges to the nature of ownership of strata-titled property, it would doubtless have done so expressly (as it in fac t did in relation to the introduc tion of “limited c ommon property” – see Division 7 of Part V of the Ac t). Parliament would undoubtedly not have intended to c reate an anomalous unc ertain c ategory for no good reason. A review of Hansard did not suggest that suc h a c onc lusion was warranted. 

87     The proposed key amendments to the Ac t whic h underwent public c onsultation also supported my approac h. The proposed amendment to the definition of “c ommon property” is as follows: 

88     The proposed amendment, partic ularly limb (c ), reinforc ed the point that elements of the building whic h serve a c ommon purpose and are not for the exc lusive use of any partic ular subsidiary proprietor are c ommon property. 

**_The Works were installed on common property_** 


89     Applying this approac h, it bec ame evident that the Works were situated on areas that satisfied the sec ond limb of the definition and were henc e c ommon property. The wide ledges on whic h Work 1 was installed were c learly neither intended to be used nor c apable of being used by the oc c upiers of the Unit. The position was even c learer as regards the openly ac c essible flat roof where Works 2 and 3 were installed. These areas were not for the exc lusive use of the oc c upiers of the Unit. 

90     Moreover, these areas were demarc ated as c ommon property in the strata title plan. Under sub-s ( _c_ )(vi) of the 2003 LTSA definition, “c ommon property” inc luded fac ilities whic h were demarc ated or desc ribed as c ommon property in the strata title plan. The development existed prior to 2004, at whic h time the 2003 LTSA definition of “c ommon property” would have applied. The relevant areas would therefore have been the responsibility of the respondent. It was inc onc eivable that those areas were no longer the respondent’s responsibility as a result of the rewording of the definition of “c ommon property” in the Ac t. It is c lear from the foregoing disc ussion of “c ommon property” that no suc h c hange was intended and I agree the Ac t “was not meant to exc lude from the definition of c ommon property the spec ific struc tures listed in the previous edition of the LTSA” ( _Lee Siew Yuen_ at [22]). Sinc e the areas in question would have been c ommon property under the 2003 LTSA definition due to their demarc ation as suc h in the strata title plan, they should c ontinue to be regarded as suc h under the reworded definition in the Ac t. 

**Issue 2: whether the Additional By-Laws were breached** 

91     The Board had found the appellant in breac h of by-laws 8.1.1 and 8.2.5 of the Additional ByLaws and by-law 5 of the Presc ribed By-Laws, whic h state: 

 [Additional By-Laws] 

 8.0 RENOVATION 

 8.1 Submission & Approval 

 8.1.1 The Subsidiary Proprietor shall submit to the Management the presc ribed applic ation form for renovation works together with a detailed work sc hedule at least 10 working days prior to c ommenc ement of any renovation works. 

 ... 

 8.2 Type of Work 

 ... 

 8.2.5 The Subsidiary Proprietor and his c ontrac tor c an only c arry out the type of work spec ified in the approval letter given by the Management. 

 [Presc ribed By-Laws] 

 Alteration or damage to common property 

 5.—(1) A subsidiary proprietor or an oc c upier of a lot shall not mark, paint, drive nails or sc rews or the like into, or otherwise damage or defac e, any struc ture that forms part of the c ommon property exc ept with the prior written approval of the management c orporation. 


## ... 

 (3) This by-law shall not prevent a subsidiary proprietor or an oc c upier of a lot, or a person authorised by suc h subsidiary proprietor or oc c upier from installing — 

 ( a ) any loc king or other safety devic e for protec tion of the subsidiary proprietor’s or oc c upier’s lot against intruders or to improve safety within that lot; 

 ( b ) any sc reen or other devic e to prevent entry of animals or insec ts on the lot; 

 ( c ) any struc ture or devic e to prevent harm to c hildren; or 

 ( d ) any devic e used to affix dec orative items to the internal surfac es of walls in the subsidiary proprietor’s or oc c upier’s lot. 

 ... 

92     The appellant argued that he had not breac hed these by-laws bec ause he had obtained the nec essary approval for the Works by his written applic ation in November 2011 and his letter to the respondent on 3 September 2013. He also asserted that the Additional ByLaws were inapplic able in any event as they were inc onsistent with the Ac t. This was bec ause by-law 4 of the Additional ByLaws purported to govern “c ommon areas”, whic h was defined as “all the area in the c ondominium with the exc eption of the strata lots”. This was, it was argued, wider than the definition of “c ommon property” in the Ac t. Ac c ording to the appellant, the two c o-existing definitions gave rise to a situation where even if the Works were not installed on areas defined as “c ommon property” under the Ac t, the appellant would still be in breac h of the Additional ByLaws as the relevant areas would fall within the definition of “c ommon areas”. 

93     The respondent rightly submitted that the Board’s finding that the appellant had not obtained the nec essary approval for the Works was a finding of fac t not open to c hallenge under s 98 of the Ac t, whic h is limited to points of law. In any event, I found that the evidenc e did not support the appellant’s c ontention. By-law 5 of the Presc ribed ByLaws made it amply c lear that works installed on c ommon property were prohibited. By-law 8.1.8.9 of the Additional By-Laws likewise stated: 

 8.1.8 The following alteration and reloc ation works are stric tly prohibited: 

 ... 

 8.1.8.9 Any works that affec t the struc tural integrity, and / or appearanc e of the faç ade and c ommon property of the building. 

94     The fac t that the Works were c arried out on c ommon property ought therefore to have been spec ific ally highlighted in any applic ation under by-law 8.1.1 of the Additional ByLaws. The appellant’s relianc e on the renovation applic ation that he submitted in November 2011 was thus misc onc eived as the applic ation omitted to mention that the Works were to be c arried out on areas desc ribed as c ommon property. On the c ontrary, a letter appended to the applic ation form authorised Dec olines Construc tion Pte Ltd to “c arry out the renovation work _in this flat_ ” (emphasis added). Anyone reading the November 2011 applic ation would reasonably have understood it as an applic ation to renovate the Unit, and it was on that basis that the respondent approved it. The respondent c ould not be taken to have approved alterations to c ommon property as that was not stated in the applic ation. The 3 September 2013 letter was even less persuasive in this regard, as it only pertained 


to Work 1 and was never approved. The fac t remained that the appellant installed the Works without having obtained the respondent’s approval to install them on c ommon property. I therefore agreed with the Board that the appellant did not c omply with by-laws 8.1.1 and 8.2.5 of the Additional ByLaws. 

95     I did not ac c ept the appellant’s argument that the Additional ByLaws were inc onsistent with the Ac t bec ause they purport to regulate “c ommon areas” as opposed to merely “c ommon property”. The Additional ByLaws define “c ommon areas” as “all the area in the c ondominium with the exc eption of the strata lots”. This falls well within the management c orporation’s authority to make by-laws “for the purpose of c ontrolling and managing the use or enjoyment of the parc el c omprised in the strata title plan” under s 32(3) of the Ac t. Given the sundry matters that may be regulated by by-laws under s 32, suc h as “safety and sec urity measures”, “details of any c ommon property of whic h the use is restric ted”, “the keeping of pets”, “behaviour” and “suc h other matters as are appropriate to the type of strata sc heme c onc erned”, it is evident that the management c orporation’s power to make by-laws is a wide one. This power is “c learly intended for the purpose of c ontrolling and managing the use or enjoyment of the strata sc heme, _including_ the c ommon property” but not limited to it ( _Strata Title in Singapore and Malaysia_ at para 15.25) (emphasis added). In any event, the Board did not find the appellant in breac h of by-law 4 (whic h relates to “Common Areas”) but only of by-laws 8.1.1 and 8.2.5, whic h make no referenc e to “c ommon areas”. Henc e, it was diffic ult to see how the appellant’s argument that by-law 4 was beyond the sc ope of the respondent’s purview c ould assist it in the Applic ation. 

**Issue 3: whether Works 2 and 3 fell within by-law 5(3)(** **_c_** **) of the Prescribed By-Laws** 

96     Ac c ording to the appellant, the Board erroneously c onflated the wording of by-law 5(3)( _a_ ) with 5(3)( _c_ ) of the Presc ribed By-Laws, and thus wrongly stated by-law 5(3)( _c_ ) to be c onfined to “ _safety_ ” devic es or struc tures (as opposed to devic es or struc tures _simpliciter_ ) to prevent harm to c hildren. The appellant submitted that this was not merely a semantic or tec hnic al error but one whic h direc tly led to the Board’s determination that the Works were not permitted under by-law 5(3)( _c_ ). Work 2 had been installed allegedly bec ause the original c ement sc reed flooring of the flat roof was prone to bec ome slippery when wet, and the appellant’s c hildren might slip and fall on it as a result. The appellant further asserted that Work 3 had been installed bec ause the lac k of proper ventilation in the Unit was harmful to his three c hildren (aged five, three and one) who had sensitive throats and respiratory trac t allergies. 

97     By-law 5(3)( _c_ ) entitles a subsidiary proprietor to install “any struc ture or devic e to prevent harm to c hildren” without the prior written approval of the management c orporation. This is an exc eption to the general requirement that the management c orporation must approve any alterations to c ommon property and should therefore not be over-liberally c onstrued. I did not think that by-law 5(3)( _c_ ) of the Presc ribed By-Laws assisted the appellant here. 

98     The Board’s adoption of the phrase “safety devic e” in [37]–[38] of its dec ision was not signific ant. The appellant did not explain what differenc e was alleged to exist between a “ _safety_ devic e to prevent harm to c hildren” and a “devic e to prevent harm to c hildren” _simpliciter_ , or how that differenc e would have been material to the Board’s finding. At [34] of its dec ision, the Board ac c urately stated that “the subsidiary proprietor is also allowed to install any struc ture or devic e to prevent _harm to children_ ” (emphasis in original), with no mention of suc h struc ture or devic e needing to be a “safety” devic e. At [35], the Board stated that a “safety devic e” would inc lude “an objec t or piec e of equipment that has been designed for or c an be used [...] to prevent harm to c hildren”, essentially repeating by-law 5(3)( _c_ ) without superimposing any additional requirement. The relevant paragraph showed that the Board’s analysis foc used primarily on whether Works 2 and 3 c ould be said 


to _prevent harm_ to the appellant’s c hildren, rather than on whether they were “safety” devic es: 

38\. The by-law allows a subsidiary proprietor to install a safety devic e to _prevent harm_ to his c hildren. Whilst an air-c on and ventilation system c an improve air quality, the Board c annot find that the air-c on ventilation unit and timber flooring on the flat roof are safety devic es installed to _prevent harm_ to the c hildren. 

 [emphasis in original] 

99     In my view, by-law 5(3)( _c_ ) must properly be c onstrued as allowing a subsidiary proprietor to erec t a struc ture or devic e that is nec essary to prevent harm to the c hildren residing with him in his lot, rather than c hildren generally residing in the development. Whether the c ommon property of the strata development poses a risk to the safety of c hildren in general is the responsibility of the management c orporation and a matter for its assessment and ac tion. By-law 5(3)( _c_ ) c annot be a lic enc e for individual oc c upiers to take matters into their own hands and rec onstruc t parts of c ommon property to a standard of safety that they find satisfac tory, simply bec ause their c hildren are amongst the possible users of those parts. 

100    I saw no reason to disturb the Board’s finding that the Works did not fall within by-law 5(3)( _c_ ). The appellant did not c hallenge the Board’s finding as regards Work 1, and rightly so, sinc e there was c learly no basis to c onc lude that the purpose of the timber dec king was to prevent harm to the appellant’s c hildren. The applic ation submitted on the appellant’s behalf to the respondent on 3 September 2013—whic h, notably, referred to the wide ledges as “c ommon areas”—ac knowledged that the ledges were not ac c essible from the Unit. The appellant’s intentions appeared to have been primarily aesthetic. The applic ation emphasised that the ledges were “c learly visible from the interior of the Penthouse Unit” and “not a pretty sight”, due to disc oloured, c rac ked and dirty tiles, poor workmanship, a gap between the tiles and the parapet and c rystallisation of the c onc rete edge at the flooring near the parapet. 

101    I was similarly unpersuaded that Works 2 and 3 were intended to prevent harm to the appellant’s c hildren. As regards Work 2, the respondent took the position that ac c ess to the flat roof was intended only for maintenanc e purposes by the respondent’s staff and there was henc e no reason for the appellant’s c hildren to frequent it for play. This seemed to be a fair point. The c orrespondenc e between the appellant (and/or Glory) and the respondent bore no mention of c onc ern for his c hildren’s safety, save for one vague allusion to the fac t that “the original floor was very dirty and slippery when it was wet”. In fac t, the appellant’s intention again appeared to have been primarily aesthetic. During the AGM on 25 April 2015, the appellant’s representative (Mr Sin Lye Kuen, the head of Glory’s legal department) desc ribed the flat roof as “one of those plac es that [...] none of us will go to on an ordinary day” and “not a plac e that is really usable in any sense” as there was “no view, you get sun straight onto your head, and there is absolutely nothing”. He explained that Work 2 had been installed for “aesthetic and also for safety reasons bec ause c ement sc reed over time bec omes slippery, bec omes smooth if you walk on it”. He added that “I don’t think [the appellant] intends to c ome up there oh, he go up to 30th floor, look at the terrac e area, no c hairs, nothing [...] I think there are better plac es for the [appellant] to rest and to enjoy the premises than to use that plac e and all”. He emphasised that the timber dec king was “nic e” and “aesthetic ally more pleasing”. There was no mention at all of the appellant’s c hildren visiting the area, muc h less running around on wet ground and running the risk of falling and injuring themselves. 

102    As regards Work 3, I agreed with the Board that there was insuffic ient evidenc e of a direc t c orrelation between the installation of the air-c onditioning ventilation unit and the prevention of harm to the appellant’s c hildren. The appellant’s representative made no mention of any safety c onc erns 


during the AGM on 25 April 2015. No evidenc e was adduc ed to suggest that the air quality within the Unit posed a risk of harm to his c hildren, or that the installation of Work 3 removed this risk. One moreover wonders why other options for improving the air quality _in_ as opposed to outside the Unit were not explored. In any event, this was a finding of fac t not open to c hallenge by the appellant. 

**Issue 4: whether the Board erred in its interpretation and application of ss 33 and 58 of the Act as regards Work 3** 

103    The Board had found that Work 3 amounted to “exc lusive use” within the meaning of s 33 of the Ac t, whic h states: 

 Exc lusive use by-laws 

 33.—(1) Without prejudic e to sec tion 32, with the written c onsent of the subsidiary proprietor of the lot c onc erned, a management c orporation may make a by-law —

 ( c ) pursuant to a 90% resolution , c onferring on the subsidiary proprietor of a lot spec ified in the by-law, or on the subsidiary proprietors of the several lots so spec ified, for a period which exceeds 3 years —

 (ii) spec ial privileges in respec t of, 

 the whole or any part of the c ommon property, upon c onditions (inc luding the payment of money at spec ified times or as required by the management c orporation, by the subsidiary proprietor or subsidiary proprietors of the lot or several lots) spec ified in the by-law; or 


 ( d ) amending, adding to or repealing a by-law made in ac c ordanc e with paragraph ( a ), ( b ) or ( c ), as the c ase may be. 

 [emphasis added] 

104    The appellant submitted that Work 3 did not amount to exc lusive use sinc e it “neither deprived other subsidiary proprietors from the use of the exterior wall, nor c onverted or earmarked any partic ular segment of the exterior wall for the [appellant’s] own exc lusive use”. In this regard, he relied on _Automobile Association of Singapore v MCST Plan No. 918_ <span class="citation">[2014] 1 SLR 164</span> (“ _Automobile Association of Singapore_ ”) and _Lee Lay Ting Jane_. Even if Work 3 did amount to exc lusive use, the appellant argued, relying on s 33(1) read with s 58(4) of the Ac t, that the respondent nonetheless had jurisdic tion to authorise Work 3 for a period not exc eeding one year. As the argument went, bylaws granting a subsidiary proprietor the exc lusive use of c ommon property for a period not exc eeding one year need only be passed by ordinary resolution under s 33(1)( _a_ ) of the Ac t, whic h the appellant submitted did not fall within the definition of a “restric ted matter” in s 58(4). 

105    I agreed with the Board’s finding at [45]–[47] that there was exc lusive use of the c ommon property as regards Work 3 within the meaning of s 33 of the Ac t. The authorities c ited by the respondent ( _Mark Wheeler_ , _Anne Lee_ and _Yap Sing Lee_ ) were analogous and helpful. In fac t, the installation of an air-c onditioning unit on a wall of the c ommon property had been given as an example of exc lusive use in Alex Ilkin, _Strata Title Management and the Law_ (The Law Book Company Limited, 1989) at p 229, whic h was c ited in _Mark Wheeler_ at [43]. On the other hand, the authorities c ited by the appellant were c learly distinguishable: 

 (a) In Automobile Association of Singapore , the c ourt held that by-laws alloc ating 66 of 94 c ar park spac es to the plaintiff did not have the effec t of c onferring exc lusive use of those spac es on the plaintiff. The 94 c ar park spac es were available on a “first-c ome-first-available” basis, meaning that “no one partic ular spac e was earmarked for the exc lusive use of any one subsidiary proprietor” (at [19]). In fac t, eac h subsidiary proprietor was free to use any of the lots in the entire c ar park as long as he/she did not exc eed the number of spac es alloc ated to him/her. This was unlike the present c ase, where as a result of the installation of Work 3, the area in question c ould no longer be used by any other subsidiary proprietor as it was permanently physic ally oc c upied by the air-c onditioning ventilation unit. 

 (b) In Lee Lay Ting Jane , the Board found that upgrading the applic ant’s units’ elec tric ity supply from 63 Ampere Single Phase to 100 Ampere Three Phase did not amount to exc lusive use of c ommon property. Although the upgrading would require the applic ant to make adjustments and c onnec tions to c ertain elec tric al switc hboards and c ables, whic h were c ommon property, these adjustments and c onnec tions would not deprive other subsidiary proprietors of the use of the switc hboards and c ables. There was therefore no “exc lusive” use of the switc hboards and c ables. As for the ac tual elec tric ity to be supplied, this was to c ome from the development’s unused elec tric ity supply and would not detrac t from other subsidiary proprietors’ existing elec tric ity supply. Although the upgrading might have amounted to “exc lusive” use of the spare elec tric ity supply, whic h was finite, the elec tric ity supply was not c ommon property (at [37]). Lee Lay Ting Jane was plainly distinguishable from the present c ase bec ause the installation of Work 3 nec essarily exc luded other subsidiary proprietors from the area of the wall whic h it oc c upied, and whic h was c ommon property. 

106    Sec tions 58(1) and 58(4) of the Ac t did not assist the appellant for three princ ipal reasons. These provisions state: 


 Council’s decisions to be decisions of management corporation 

**58.** —(1) Subjec t to the provisions of this Ac t, the dec ision of a c ounc il on any matter, other than a restric ted matter, shall be the dec ision of the management c orporation. 

 ... 

 (4) In subsec tion (1), “restric ted matter”, in relation to a c ounc il of a management c orporation, means — 

 ( a ) any matter a dec ision on whic h may, in ac c ordanc e with any provision of this Ac t or the by-laws, only be made by the management corporation pursuant to a unanimous resolution, spec ial resolution, 90% resolution, c omprehensive resolution, resolution by c onsensus or in a general meeting of the management corporation , or only by the c ounc il at a meeting; and 

 ( b ) any matter referred to in sec tion 59 and spec ified in a resolution of that management c orporation passed for the purposes of that sec tion. 

 [emphasis added] 

107    First, I take the view that a by-law falling within s 33(1)( _a_ ), whic h may be passed by ordinary resolution, is in fac t a restric ted matter within the meaning of s 58(4). I took this view tentatively when I gave oral grounds and have sinc e bec ome firm in my view. 

108    Sec tion 58(4)( _a_ ) restric ts the c ounc il of the management c orporation (“management c ounc il”) from taking dec isions whic h may only be made, _inter alia_ , by the management c orporation _in a general meeting_. Sec tion 2(2) of the Ac t states that a motion is passed by ordinary resolution if it is passed at a “ _duly convened general meeting_ ” of the management c orporation with the requisite proportion of votes. An ordinary resolution must therefore be taken at a “general meeting of the management c orporation”, and is henc e a “restric ted matter” within s 58(4) of the Ac t. A by-law c onferring exc lusive use not exc eeding one year, whic h must be passed by ordinary resolution, is thus a restric ted matter. 

109    This is supported by the genealogy of s 33(1). Prior to the Ac t, s 41(8)( _a_ ) of the 2003 LTSA stipulated that a management c orporation c ould only make by-laws c onferring the exc lusive use of c ommon property on a subsidiary proprietor (“exc lusive use by-laws”) pursuant to a _unanimous_ resolution, regardless of the intended duration of that exc lusive use. The making of “exc lusive use bylaws” was thus c learly a “restric ted matter” within the meaning of s 63(4)( _a_ ) of the 2003 LTSA (now s 58(4) of the Ac t) (see, _eg_ , _Mark Wheeler_ at [47]). In _Re Bukit Timah Shopping Centre (Strata Titles Plan No. 1601)_ [1996] SGSTB 6, the Board unambiguously held at [10] that a proposal for an exc lusive use by-law under s 41(8) of the 1988 Revised Edition of the LTSA (now s 33(1) of the Ac t) c ould not be delegated to the management c ounc il for determination for prec isely this reason: 

 ... [A]ny proposal for an alteration or addition to the c ommon property of the order desc ribed in any of Sec tions 22(1), 23(1), 41(8) or 48(l)(d) must be subjec t to the proc edure of a general meeting being properly c onvened to pass a unanimous or spec ial resolution (as the c ase may be) to approve the adoption of suc h proposal. The language of the Sec tions is very c lear. This statutorily mandated proc ess of dec ision-making by the general body of the management c orporation in [a meeting] c annot be short-c irc uited by the delegation of this dec ision-making func tion to the Counc il. It is c lear why this must be so. Every subsidiary proprietor of a lot is 


 also, together with his fellow subsidiary proprietors, an owner of the c ommon property, albeit only proportional to the share value allotted to his lot, and fundamental to suc h ownership is the right to use and enjoy the c ommon property. Any of the ac tions envisaged in Sec tions 22(1), 23(1), 41(8) or 48(l)(d) would take away or c urtail or modify his said right. Therefore, if there is a proposal for any of the said ac tions to be taken, it must be ensured that suc h proposal is duly brought to his notic e and the opportunity given to him to disc uss it with his fellow subsidiary proprietors in general meeting before it is implemented. ... Reading Sec tions 63(1) and 63 (4)(a) stric tly, without exc eption a c ounc il may not on behalf of the management c orporation make a dec ision on a restric ted matter... 

110    Sec tion 41(8)( _a_ ) was repealed by the Ac t, whic h provides that only an ordinary resolution, spec ial resolution or 90% resolution is nec essary to make an exc lusive use by-law, depending on the intended duration of the exc lusive use. The Selec t Committee Report revealed (at para 14) that the purpose of introduc ing these resolutions was to moderate some of the diffic ulty that management c orporations previously experienc ed in garnering the requisite perc entage of votes: 

 The Committee noted that the 2 new resolutions [ ie , the 90% resolution and c omprehensive resolution] were introduc ed to fac ilitate the MC’s dec ision-making on issues that normally required unanimous resolution or resolution without dissent (ie unanimous c onsent)... Unanimous resolution or resolution without dissent might be diffic ult to proc ure. As suc h, the 2 new resolutions should be retained to fac ilitate self-governanc e by MCs. 

111    Indeed, the overarc hing objec tive of the Ac t was to “provide for more effec tive management and maintenanc e of strata developments, rec ognising differenc es in interests amongst stakeholders” and “provide flexibility by empowering MCs to make dec isions, and therefore enc ourage selfregulation”: _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (19 April 2004) vol 77 at c ols 2743–2744 (Mr Mah Bow Tan, then Minister for National Development). The Selec t Committee Report also inc luded a paper dated 10 May 2004 from five residents of “Summerdale Exec utive Condominium”, c omplaining prec isely of the diffic ulty of obtaining a unanimous vote for the installation of a window in a wall c onstituting c ommon property. 

112    The question therefore was whether Parliament, in moderating the diffic ulty of passing exc lusive use by-laws, also intended to thereby remove by-laws c onferring exc lusive use not exc eeding one year from the c ategory of “restric ted matters” altogether. I was of the view that it did not. 

113    Interestingly, prior to the c onvening of the Selec t Committee, the Draft Bill did not originally inc lude what is now s 33(1)( _a_ ). It provided only that an exc lusive use by-law not exc eeding three years must be made by spec ial resolution (originally draft c lause 32(1)( _a_ )) and that an exc lusive use by-law exc eeding three years must be made by 90% resolution (originally draft c lause 32(1)( _b_ )). No mention was made of a resolution requirement for an exc lusive use by-law not exc eeding one year. The exac t same approac h was taken as regards leases of c ommon property (now s 34 of the Ac t): leases exc eeding three years required a 90% resolution and leases not exc eeding three years required a spec ial resolution, but leases not exc eeding a year made no mention of a resolution requirement. This was deliberate, as seen from the c omments of Mr Mah Bow Tan at the sec ond reading of the Bill ( _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (19 April 2004) vol 77 at c ol 2748): 

 The Bill will also empower the MC to lease out c ommon property or c onfer spec ial privileges for its use to SPs and others. Decisions on short-term leases of up to one year can be made without the need for a resolution to be passed at a general meeting. However, leases up to three years will require a spec ial resolution, ie, c onsent of 75% of valid votes, while longer leases will require 


 90% of valid votes. 

 [emphasis added] 

114    It therefore appears that the Draft Bill c ontemplated a uniform approac h towards leases of c ommon property and exc lusive use by-laws, under whic h leases or by-laws not exc eeding one year c ould be exec uted without the need for a general meeting. Critic ally, however, the position vis-à-vis exc lusive use by-laws c hanged after the Draft Bill was c ommitted to the Selec t Committee, following its c onsideration of a paper submitted by the APFM. The APFM’s paper noted at para 5.8.1 that “[t]he situation when the period of use or privileges for not exc eeding one year has not been provided for”, and rec ommended for “c larity” that a new s 32(1)( _a_ ) be inc luded, whic h would require an exc lusive use by-law not exc eeding one year to be made by ordinary resolution. 

115    The Selec t Committee adopted this rec ommendation. At the c lause-by-c lause c onsideration of the Draft Bill on 27 September 2004, c lause 32(1) was amended to inc lude what is now s 33(1)( _a_ ) of the Ac t and agreed to as amended. Mr Mah Bow Tan explained that (Selec t Committee Report at p E23): 

 Amendments (1) and (2) are in response to a representation from APFM. This is to enable a management corporation to make an exclusive use by-law for a period not exceeding one year, via ordinary resolution at a general meeting. 

 [emphasis added] 

116    Parliament’s dec ision to require majority approval of an exc lusive by-law not exc eeding one year, at a general meeting of the management c orporation, was therefore evidently quite intentional. By legislating s 33(1)( _a_ ), Parliament c learly c hose not to allow the management c ounc il to unilaterally c onvert c ommon property to the exc lusive use of individual proprietors. Sec tion 33(1)( _a_ ) was inserted to retain a proc edural safeguard for the making of exc lusive use by-laws not exc eeding one year in duration. Evidently, that purpose would be undermined if s 58(1) of the Ac t, a general provision allowing the management c ounc il to make dec isions on behalf of the management c orporation, were to override the more spec ific s 33(1)( _a_ ) and render it otiose. 

117    It may be observed that this amendment c reated a divergenc e in the requirements for leases of c ommon property and exc lusive use by-laws. Under the Ac t, the management c orporation does not require a general meeting to exec ute a _lease_ of c ommon property not exc eeding a year, but requires an ordinary resolution to make an exc lusive use by-law not exc eeding a year. This might seem strange given that a lease of c ommon property may be thought to detrac t more signific antly from other subsidiary proprietors’ ability to enjoy the c ommon property than a by-law c onferring spec ial privileges. Nevertheless, strange though this may be, it does not affec t the foregoing analysis. 

118    Sec ondly, even if I was wrong in this view, the appellant’s argument presupposed that he was really only seeking an annual lic enc e. This was a wholly inac c urate c harac terisation of the true state of play. Given the reasons advanc ed by the appellant for the installation of Work 3, it must follow he sought a lic enc e for so long as he c ontinued to oc c upy the Unit. There was nothing to suggest that the appellant intended to install the air-c onditioning ventilation unit only temporarily. The lic enc e sought therefore did not have a shelf life of one year. To require the respondent to authorise Work 3 would have allowed the appellant to c irc umvent s 33(1) of the Ac t, whic h requires the general body to approve suc h a signific ant derogation from c ommunal ac c ess to c ommon property, under the guise of an applic ation for an annual lic enc e. 


119    Thirdly, the appellant had sought approval from the general body at the AGM on 25 April 2015, and had been roundly rejec ted (see [18] above). In the c irc umstanc es, it was c lear that the management c ounc il c ould not arrogate to itself the right to grant the appellant’s request. It should be noted that s 58(3) of the Ac t prevents the management c ounc il from making a dec ision if it is opposed by subsidiary proprietors owning not less than one-third of the lots. This has the effec t of removing seriously c ontested matters from the sc ope of the management c ounc il’s authority. It would have been inc onsistent with that princ iple for me to find that the management c ounc il was wrong to deny the appellant exc lusive use of c ommon property, when that very issue had been dec ided quite c onc lusively against the appellant at a general meeting of the management c orporation. 

120    It behoves me to add that, whether or not Work 3 resulted in the exc lusive use of the area in whic h it was situated, the appellant would not have been entitled to c arry it out. Whether or not an installation results in exc lusive use only goes to whether a by-law c onferring suc h exc lusive use is required under s 33 of the Ac t. Just bec ause an installation does not result in exc lusive use of c ommon property does not automatic ally mean that it was authorised or permitted: the written approval of the management c orporation is still required under by-laws 5 of the Presc ribed ByLaws and 8 of the Additional ByLaws. The absenc e of exc lusive use does not _ipso facto_ c reate an entitlement to install works on c ommon property. The fac t remained that the appellant installed the Works on c ommon property without any entitlement to do so. For this reason, I was of the view that there was no value in addressing prayer 1(f ) of the applic ation, whic h sought a dec laration that the Board had erred in law by failing to make a dec laration that Works 1 and 2 did not amount to exc lusive use of the relevant areas. 

**Issue 5: the proper interpretation of s 111(** **_a_** **) of the Act** 

121    The appellant submitted that s 111( _a_ ) of the Ac t allowed the Board to order the management c orporation to retrospec tively c onsent to works that had already been c arried out without c onsent. Sec tion 111 states: 

 Order with respect to consents affecting common property 

**111.** Where, pursuant to an applic ation by a subsidiary proprietor, a Board c onsiders that the management c orporation or subsidiary management c orporation to whic h the applic ation relates — 

 ( a ) has unreasonably refused to c onsent to a proposal by that subsidiary proprietor to effec t alterations to the c ommon property or limited c ommon property; or 

 ( b ) has unreasonably refused to authorise under sec tion 37(4) any improvement in or upon a lot whic h affec ts the appearanc e of any building c omprised in the strata title plan, 

 the Board may make an order that the management c orporation or subsidiary management c orporation, as the c ase may be, c onsents to the proposal. 

122    The appellant c ited _Mark Wheeler_ at [37] for the proposition that even where the proposed alteration works had already been effec ted, the proposal itself remained effec tive and c ould be approved or rejec ted notwithstanding the work already done. The appellant further submitted that the Board had erred in law by failing to authorise Works 1 and 2 despite having found that those works did not amount to exc lusive use and enjoyment or c onferment of spec ial privileges. The respondent, on the other hand, argued that ss 111( _a_ ) and 111( _b_ ) had no applic ation to works that had already been effec ted, c iting _Mark Wheeler_ at [69]. As I do not see how the argument of 


prospec tive applic ation c an apply to s 111( _b_ ), whic h does not require a “proposal” for alterations, I will address the argument only in respec t of s 111( _a_ ). 

123    I am of the view that s 111( _a_ ) of the Ac t operates prospec tively. However, that is not to say that an appellant c ould not avail himself of s 111( _a_ ) where the works had been c arried out without prior approval. That said, where a c ourt is invited to review the Board’s dec ision in respec t of s 111( _a_ ), it must approac h the applic ation as if the work in question had not been c arried out instead of ac c epting the work as a _fait accompli._ The c ourt must freshly c onsider the merits of the applic ation without attributing any weight whatsoever to the fac t that resourc es have already been expended on c arrying out the work, sinc e it was undertaken without sanc tion. 

124    In _Mark Wheeler_ , the applic ant (“Wheeler”) had wanted to install a retrac table awning on c ommon property in front of his unit to shield his unit from the sun’s heat and glare. Wheeler c omplained to a member of the management c ounc il about his problem and asked whether he c ould erec t a shade. Wheeler c laimed that the c ounc il member agreed to bring the matter before the management c ounc il for c onsideration; the c ounc il member denied this and testified that he had told Wheeler to write to the management c ounc il. Wheeler never submitted a written proposal to erec t an awning and did not obtain the management c orporation’s approval to do so, but proc eeded to install the awning anyway. He subsequently sought from the Board an order that the management c orporation c onsent to his proposal under s 104 of the LTSA, whic h was _in pari materia_ with s 111( _a_ ) of the Ac t. The management c orporation objec ted on the basis, _inter alia_ , that Wheeler had already erec ted the awning and it therefore did not c ome within the ambit of s 104 of the LTSA. 

125    Wheeler c ited the NSW c ase of _Proprietors of Strata Plan No 1627 v Schultz_ (1978) 2 BPR 9443 (“ _Schultz_ ”), whic h the Board referred to at [37] of its dec ision. There, the defendant (“Sc hultz”) had fitted out a shop in a strata building as a c oin-operated laundry. She installed duc ts, pipes and vents in part of the c ommon property to provide ventilation and exhaust for the laundry and attac hed an advertising sign to the building’s external wall. After the work was done, Sc hultz sought the body c orporate’s permission for the work, whic h it refused. Sc hultz then applied to the Strata Titles Commissioner under s 106 of the NSW Strata Titles Ac t 1973 (c orresponding to our s 111( _a_ )). Holland J of the NSW Supreme Court held that s 106 applied to alterations proposed and not ac c omplished, and did not empower the Commissioner to make an order “approving or ratifying alterations already made to the c ommon property”. However, the fac t that the alterations proposed had already been effec ted did not nec essarily mean that Sc hultz’s earlier proposal had c eased to exist. Sc hultz’s applic ation c ould still be entertained notwithstanding that the works had already been installed. The proposal c ould be c onsidered to have a life of its own. Nevertheless, the Commissioner would be bound to c onsider the applic ation as one for c onsent to a proposal, disregarding the fac t that the work already had been done exc ept insofar as the work done was illustrative of the proposal. He c ould not, for example, have regard to any financ ial or other hardship that would be oc c asioned to Sc hultz if she had to remove the works. 

126    The Board in _Mark Wheeler_ did not expressly approve or disapprove _Schultz_ , although it noted at [51] that the fac ts were distinguishable in that Wheeler had not submitted a written proposal to the management c orporation either before or after installing the awning. Wheeler had therefore never made a “proposal” to the management c orporation within the meaning of s 104 of the LTSA. Although this suffic ed to dispose of Wheeler’s applic ation under s 104, the Board went on to state at [69] that: 

 In c onstruing sec tion 104 of the Ac t c onc erning alterations or additions to c ommon property without c onsent, the Board will refuse to order a management c orporation to give its c onsent where alterations or additions have already been c arried out. 


The respondent relied on this _dictum_ for the proposition that s 111( _a_ ) is unavailable to an applic ant who has already installed the works proposed. I don’t believe this proposition is c orrec t. 

127    I do not agree that the Board lac ks jurisdic tion under s 111( _a_ ) to order the management c orporation to c onsent to works that have already been effec ted. In my opinion, the dec ision in _Mark Wheeler_ should be viewed as grounded upon the Board’s findings that there was no “proposal” for the works in question and henc e s 104 of the LTSA did not apply (at [52]) and that, even if it had, it would not have been unreasonable for the management c orporation to refuse its c onsent (at [68]). I agree with the approac h in _Schultz_ : the fac t that the works proposed have already been c arried out c annot automatic ally deprive the Board of jurisdic tion to c onsider the proposal. After all, it would be a needless waste of resourc es to require the subsidiary proprietor to first dismantle the installations before presenting a sec ond applic ation to the Board, only for the Board to then order the management c orporation to c onsent to the works. It is far more sensible for the Board to c onsider the proposal _de novo_ , without regard to any financ ial hardship that would be oc c asioned to the subsidiary proprietor in the event that c onsent is withheld. 

128    At any rate, given my views on ss 58(1) and 58(4), I was unable to entertain any submission that Work 3 ought to have been authorised under s 111( _a_ ) of the Ac t. Should the Board have authorised Works 1 and 2 under s 111( _a_ )? I was of the view that there was no basis to disturb the Board’s finding that the respondent’s refusal of c onsent to Works 1 and 2 was not unreasonable. The evidenc e did not, in my view, make a c ompelling c ase for the installation of Works 1 and 2 on the grounds alleged by the appellant. I have alluded at [100] and [101] above to the pauc ity of the evidenc e in this regard. It appeared that these works were to be installed primarily for aesthetic rather than health reasons. The respondent took the position that the areas on whic h Works 1 and 2 were to be installed were to be ac c essed by staff for maintenanc e purposes. Indeed the respondent asserted that the installation of Work 2 made it diffic ult for the respondent to properly upkeep the area as it obstruc ted the floor trap and drainage system. Moreover, the general body of subsidiary proprietors had withheld its support for the appellant’s intended use of the property during the AGM on 25 April 2015. 

129    I make two further observations. First, the appellant had c aused the fixed glass panels that separated the Unit from the wide ledges to be removed and replac ed with sliding glass panels in order to c arry out Work 1. It must be observed that the fixed glass panels were fixed for a purpose – to prevent ac c ess by the oc c upants of the Unit, presumably for safety reasons. They were therefore not meant to be removed and the ledges not meant to be ac c essed. It appeared that the appellant took matters into his own hands and ac ted inappropriately by doing something he was barred from doing whatever his motivations might have been. To hold that the respondent withheld c onsent unreasonably in suc h c irc umstanc es would c ountenanc e suc h c onduc t. That did not seem right. Sec ond, the reason offered by the appellant for Work 2 was that of safety. No other reason was offered. I have found that reason to be unsustainable. It thus seems c orrec t to c onc lude that there was no basis to say that the respondent withheld c onsent unreasonably. To say otherwise would imply that a sensible basis to install Work 2 existed in the first plac e. In light of these fac tors I saw no reason to disturb the Board’s dec ision. 

**Issue 6: whether the Board erred in its interpretation of s 37 of the Act** 

130    The appellant submitted that the Board had erred in finding that the respondent c ould not authorise the Works under s 101(1)( _c_ ) read with s 101(4) or s 111 of the Ac t bec ause they were not improvements “in or upon” the Unit within the meaning of s 37(4). Sec tions 37 and 101 of the Ac t state: 


 Improvements and additions to lots 

**37.** — ...

 (3) Exc ept pursuant to an authority granted under subsec tion (4), no subsidiary proprietor of a lot that is c omprised in a strata title plan shall effec t any other improvement in or upon his lot for his benefit whic h affec ts the appearanc e of any building c omprised in the strata title plan. 

 (4) A management c orporation may, at the request of a subsidiary proprietor of any lot c omprised in its strata title plan and upon suc h terms as it c onsiders appropriate, authorise the subsidiary proprietor to effec t any improvement in or upon his lot referred to in subsec tion (3) if the management c orporation is satisfied that the improvement in or upon the lot — 

 ( a ) not detrac t from the appearanc e of any of the buildings c omprised in the strata title plan or will be in keeping with the rest of the buildings; and

 ( c ) the exerc ise or performanc e of, or the failure to exerc ise or perform, a power, duty or func tion c onferred or imposed by this Ac t or the by-laws relating to the subdivided building or limited c ommon property, as the c ase may be. 

 ... 

 (4) For the purposes of this sec tion, where a management c orporation or subsidiary management c orporation has a disc retion as to whether or not to exerc ise or perform a power, duty or func tion c onferred or imposed on it by this Ac t or the by-laws, it shall be deemed to have refused or failed to exerc ise or perform that power, duty or func tion only if it has dec ided not to exerc ise or perform that power, duty or func tion.

131    The appellant argued that to c onfine s 37 to works installed within a subsidiary proprietor’s lot would render the distinc tion between “in” and “upon” nugatory. He asserted that the language of s 37 ( _ie_ , improvements “in or upon [a] lot”) was broad enough to inc lude improvements whic h, although not tec hnic ally within a lot, were nevertheless “in respec t of” the lot. In this regard, the appellant referred me to the following exc erpts from _Strata Title in Singapore and Malaysia_ : 


 [ 10.95 ] A subsidiary proprietor of a lot is not permitted to effec t any improvement in or upon his lot for his benefit whic h inc reases or is likely to inc rease the floor area of the land and building c omprised in the strata title plan. However, the management c orporation may, at his request and upon suc h terms as it c onsiders appropriate, by 90% resolution, authorise him to effec t the improvements in respect of his lot. ... 

 [ 10.96 ] A subsidiary proprietor is also prohibited from effec ting any other improvement in respect of his lot for his benefit whic h affec ts the appearanc e of the building unless he is authorised by the management c orporation to do so and upon suc h terms as it c onsiders appropriate. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

132    The appellant submitted that the learned author’s referenc es to improvements “in respec t of [a] lot” supported his c ontention that the works need not be physic ally situated within the lot in question. 

133    I did not ac c ept the appellant’s argument that the term “improvement in or upon [a] lot” inc ludes work c arried out on c ommon property so long as it is with referenc e to a lot. That term, in my view, must be read to be c onfined to works done “in” or “on”, as opposed to simply “in relation to”, the Unit. As muc h c an be deduc ed from the heading of s 37, whic h is “Improvements and additions _to lots_ ” (emphasis added). I do not think that the learned author of _Strata Title in Singapore and Malaysia_ intended, by referring to improvements “in respec t of” a lot, to enc ompass works installed _outside_ the lot. This would take the phrase “in or upon” beyond its natural meaning. 

134    Sec tion 37 was newly introduc ed in the Ac t and had no predec essor in either the LTSA or the BCPA. The Draft Bill originally only c ontained what are now sub-ss (1), (2) and (5) of s 37. Sub-ss (3) and (4) were only inserted after the Selec t Committee’s deliberations. Mr Mah Bow Tan’s c omments in the Selec t Committee Report on ss 37(3) and 37(4) of the Ac t shed light on the reason for their insertion (at page E25): 

 Sir, following the exc lusion of external windows from the definition of “c ommon property”, this c hange [ ie , inserting ss 37(3) and 37(4)] is nec essary so that management c orporations retain the power to c ontrol c hanges to external windows, whic h will affec t the appearanc e of buildings within the strata development. The provision also c overs any improvement that will affec t the appearanc e of the buildings. ... 

 This is also an existing provision in the statutory by-laws, whic h is now transferred to the main Ac t. 

135    The last sentenc e of his c omments must be taken to refer to by-law 12 of the by-laws presc ribed in the First Sc hedule of the LTSA 2003, as follows: 

 A subsidiary proprietor or oc c upier shall not make any alteration to the windows installed in the external walls of the subdivided building without having obtained the approval in writing of the management c orporation. 

136    For c ontext, the LTSA 2003 definition of “c ommon property” had inc luded windows installed in any external wall of the building (see [64] above). Sec tion 2(9) of the Ac t altered this by providing that c ertain types of external windows (namely, louvres, c asement windows, sliding windows and windows with any moveable part) would be part of the lot and not c ommon property. This made sense 


bec ause it would be prac tic ally easier for the subsidiary proprietor than the management c orporation to maintain moveable external windows. However, this gave rise to c onc erns that subsidiary proprietors would alter suc h windows and thereby disrupt the c onsistenc y and aesthetic of the faç ade of the buildings within the strata title plan (see, _eg_ , Selec t Committee Report at p B136, APFM’s paper at para 5.9.1). 

137    In response to these c onc erns, ss 37(3) and 37(4) were inserted into the Draft Bill to ensure that the management c orporation nevertheless retained c ontrol over the external windows even though they were no longer c ommon property. The intended effec t of these sub-sec tions was to subjugate a subsidiary proprietor’s right to make improvements _to his lot_ to the supervision of the management c orporation insofar as they affec ted the appearanc e of the building. The insertion of ss 37(3) and 37(4) would not have been nec essary had the external windows remained part of the c ommon property, whic h was all along subjec t to the management c orporation’s c ontrol by virtue of s 32 of the Ac t and by-law 5 of the Presc ribed ByLaws. This analysis was supported by the very text o f _Strata Title in Singapore and Malaysia_ whic h the appellant relied on, although the appellant’s submissions omitted to reproduc e the following portion of para 10.96: 

 [10.96] ...the management c orporation must be satisfied that the improvement in respec t of the lot will not detrac t from the appearanc e of any of the buildings or will be in keeping with the rest of the buildings and will not affec t the struc tural integrity of any of suc h buildings. Given that external windows that are openable (such as louvres, casement or sliding windows or windows with any movable part) are excluded from the definition of common property, it is important that management corporations retain the power to control changes to such windows. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

138    Given this bac kground, it was c lear that ss 37(3) and 37(4) were not intended to regulate improvements to c ommon property, but to a subsidiary proprietor’s lot. In ac c ordanc e with my foregoing analysis of c ommon property, I was of the view that ss 37(3) and 37(4) should be restric ted to improvements within a given lot, or within areas for the exc lusive use of the appellant’s lot although not c omprised in any lot. Suc h areas would not c onstitute c ommon property. 

139    Sinc e s 37(4) did not apply to works on c ommon property, the Board c ould not have ordered the respondent to c onsent to the Works under s 101 or s 111 of the Ac t. 

**Conclusion** 

140    Ac c ordingly, I dismissed the Applic ation with c osts to the respondent. I wish to rec ord my apprec iation to both c ounsel for their c arriage of this matter.
