## Judgment 

### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

### BACKGROUND 

1\. P.T. Permona (Permona) is an Indonesian c ompany. On 29 January 1996, it filed an applic ation to register a trade mark in respec t of c igarettes and tobac c o produc ts; all inc luded in Class 34. The trade mark was CHUNG HWA (Permonas trade mark). 

2\. The applic ation was ac c epted with a disc laimer on CHUNG. The ac c eptanc e of the applic ation was advertised in Gazette Notific ation 12/98 on 3 April 1998. 

3\. The applic ation was opposed by Shanghai Tobac c o Group (Shanghai Tobac c o) and the China Tobac c o Import and Export Shanghai Corporation (CTIESC) although in the Originating Motion before me, the latter was referred to as China Import and Export Shanghai Corporation i.e without Tobac c o. CTIESC is a state-owned Chinese c orporation. I will refer to both Shanghai Tobac c o and CTIESC as the Opponents. 

4\. The Notic e of Opposition was lodged on 26 June 1998 after a suc c essful applic ation for an extension of time to do so. 

5\. Pleadings were deemed c losed on 11 November 1998. On 26 April 2001, the parties appeared before Ms Lee Li Choon, Princ ipal Assistant Registrar. She ordered the Opponents to lodge direc t evidenc e of c ertain matters and in partic ular the evidenc e of an alleged distributor of the Opponents in Singapore, one Paradise Trading Pte Ltd (Paradise). 

6\. The opposition proc eedings resumed on 5 June 2001 wherein the oral evidenc e of one Mr Cheng Kwee Kiang, a direc tor of Paradise, was taken and submissions made. 

7\. On 10 August 2001, Ms Lee allowed the opposition on the basis of s 15 of the Trade Marks Ac t (Cap 332) and the applic ation by Permona was refused. 

8\. Permona appealed against this dec ision and on 22 Oc tober 2001, I dismissed the appeal. 

9\. Permona has appealed against my dec ision. 


### ALLEGATIONS 

10\. The Notic e of Opposition stated that the Opponents manufac ture and spec ialise in the import and export of tobac c o sinc e 1985. The Notic e exhibited a broc hure of CTIESC whic h desc ribes itself as having set up its business on 1 January 1985 spec ialising in the import and exprt of tobac c o. 

11\. The Notic e of Opposition also stated that the Opponents have been manufac turing and marketing tobac c o produc ts under various brands, one of whic h is the CHUNGHWA brand of c igarettes. 

12\. It was also alleged that the CHUNGHWA mark was used in China by them for the last 25 years (from 1998 being the date of the Notic e of Opposition). Bearing in mind that the Opponents only started in this business sinc e 1985, the 25 years referred to should mean 12 or 13 years instead, at least in so far as tobac c o produc ts are c onc erned. 

13\. It was alleged that their goods were promoted and sold through the use of (a) the Chinese c harac ters , (b) the English transliteration whic h is CHUNGHWA and (c ) a pagoda devic e. The pac kaging illustrated showed (a) a pagoda devic e with two dec orative poles on eac h side of the pagoda (the pagoda devic e) with the Chinese c harac ters above the pagoda devic e and (b) a devic e showing one dec orative pole (the pole devic e) with the English words of Chunghwa (stylised) ac ross the pole devic e. 

14\. Advertisements by Paradise exhibited in the statutory dec laration dated 12 April 1999 of Xu Hu Lie showed the use of CHUNGHWA in bloc k letters, the Chinese c harac ters and the pagoda devic e on a pac k of c igarettes. 

15\. The advertisements by Paradise also stated that the c igarettes were available at airport duty free shops in Singapore, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia. 

16\. However, it was not c lear exac tly when the goods were sold in these regions and under exac tly whic h mark. 

17\. Ac c ording to the Notic e of Opposition, the Opponents began marketing and selling their goods through their Singapore distributor Paradise to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam under the CHUNGHWA mark in 1989. However there was no c onc rete evidenc e of this. 

18\. The Notic e of Opposition and the statutory dec laration of Mr Xu also alleged that in 1989, the Opponents had applied to register the mark CHUNGHWA and pagoda devic e in Singapore. This was done through one of their Hong Kong distributors. 

19\. This attempt purportedly inc luded the Chinese c harac ters. The applic ation was objec ted to and the applic ant was direc ted by the Registrar of Trade Marks to delete the Chinese c harac ters. Eventually registration was granted under registration no 43247 in respec t of the devic e only whic h was the pagoda devic e. 

20\. It was alleged that by virtue of an assignment between the Hong Kong distributor and the Opponents, the trade mark registration now stands in the name of CTIESC. 

21\. Mr Xus statutory dec laration went on to say that the Opponents understood the basis of the objec tion and c onsequent deletion of the Chinese c harac ters to be that these c harac ters, when translated, mean China and henc e unregistrable in Singapore on the ground that that is a 


geographic al name. Ac c ordingly, there was no applic ation then to register the English transliteration CHUNGHWA on the assumption that it would be objec ted to also. 

22\. Permona did not c ontest the allegations regarding the bac kground as to how CTIESC obtained the benefit of the registration of the pagoda devic e, without the Chinese c harac ters and without CHUNGHWA, in Singapore. 

23\. However, the c ertific ate whic h was exhibited to Mr Xus statutory dec laration stated that it was with effec t from 18 January 1968 and not 1989. 

24\. The c ertific ate was issued to Messrs Tec k Soon Hong Limited whic h might well have been a Singapore c ompany. No searc h was provided of Tec k Soon Hong Limited. Also, the identity of the Hong Kong distributor was not stated in Mr Xus statutory dec laration or in the Notic e of Opposition. 

25\. Mr Xus statutory dec laration also exhibited a trade mark searc h on 28 June 1998. While showing China Tobac c o Import & Export Corporation, Shanghai branc h (slight differenc e in name from CTIESC) as the applic ant/proprietor, it also showed the applic ation date to be 18 January 1968. 

26\. In the next page of the searc h, the ownership history was stated to be c urrently not available. The new proprietor was China Tobac c o Import & Export Corporation, Shanghai Branc h and the ac quisition date was stated to be 15 May 1989 and the lodgment date 24 May 1989. These dates appeared to pertain to the date when CTIESC ac quired the mark and not the date when the original applic ation was made. 

27\. In the light of the doc umentary evidenc e, it appeared that the bac kground to CTIESC bec oming the proprietor of the pagoda devic e, as alleged, was not c orrec t. Consequently the allegation about the reason for the Chinese c harac ters of CHUNGHWA being rejec ted was probably also not c orrec t. 

28\. It might even be that there was no attempt to register the Chinese c harac ters originally. 

29\. In any event the burden was on the Opponents to establish what they asserted. In my view they failed to disc harge that burden on this point. 

30\. The Opponents c laimed that between 1992 to 1998, they had spent about US$1m on advertising. However the supporting doc uments did not c onfirm this figure. Some were in Chinese whic h were not translated. The others added to about US$144,000 and S$65,000, say S$320, (using an exc hange rate of US$1 = S$1.75). 

31\. Ms Anjali Iyer, Counsel for the Opponents, provided me with a list of the amounts spent on advertisements from May 1989 to 29 January 1996. She said it was based on the supporting doc uments. The total amount spent for advertisements during this period i.e up to 29 January 1996 was about S$160,000 although I had to take into ac c ount the fac t that, at least in Singapore, there have been restric tions on advertising c igarettes for sale for some time. 

32\. The dollar value of sales through Singapore to the region till 1996 was supposed to be S$121,600,000 but there was no supporting doc ument to substantiate this. 

33\. For Singapore, the sales from 1994 to 1998 was also supposedly about US$4.5m or about S$7.9m (at an exc hange rate of US$1 = S$1.75). However, the supporting doc uments i.e invoic es were only in Singapore c urrenc y. Moreover they added up to about S$2m. From February 1994 to 29 January 1996, the figure was substantially less i.e about S$340,000. 


34\. The sales in Singapore were sales from Paradise to DFS Venture Singapore (Pte) Limited (DFS Venture) whic h operates duty-free shops. Ms Iyer said that one duty-free shop was at Changi Airport and another in the c ity. 

35\. The Opponents also c laimed that they had registered trade marks in other c ountries. Most of these were after 29 January 1996 and the evidenc e for some of them was not c lear. I list out the information gleaned from the supporting doc uments whic h were supposed to be c ertific ates of registration of trade marks: 

 (a) There is supposed to be a registration of a mark in Taiwan but the doc ument is entirely in the Chinese language and no English translation was provided. 

 (b) 25 Marc h 1994 There is supposed to be a registration of the pole devic e in Vietnam but the c opy of the doc ument before me did not have an English translation. Also it was not c lear from the c opy whether the pole devic e has Chunghwa (stylised) printed ac ross the pole. The proprietor of the mark is supposed to be CTIESC. 

 (c ) 17 Dec ember 1996 There is a trade mark registration of the pole devic e with Chunghwa (stylised) printed ac ross the pole. The applic ant is CTIESC. 

 (d) 1997 There is supposed to be a trade mark registration in Myanmar of Chunghwa (stylised) and the pole devic e but the doc ument appears to be more of a statutory dec laration. 

 (e) 20 January 1999 There is a trade mark registration of the Chinese c harac ters used by the Opponents and pagoda devic e in Canada whic h c orrec ts an earlier registration on 19 November 1998. However the name of the proprietor or applic ant is not obvious from the doc uments exhibited. 

 (f ) 25 January 1999 There is a trade mark registration of the Chinese c harac ters used by the Opponents and pagoda devic e in Australia. The owner of the mark is CTIESC. 

 (g) 2 February 1999 There is a trade mark registration of the Chinese c harac ters used by the Opponents and the pagoda devic e in the United States Patent and Trademark Offic e. The registrant is CTIESC. 

36\. Permonas Counter Statement was very brief c onsisting mainly of denials. Its c ase was based on a statutory dec laration by its Export Sales Manager Ratna Tanuwidjaja dec lared on 21 August 1999. 

37\. The statutory dec laration was also rather brief. It did not disc lose the nature of Permonas business. It stated that the applic ation was advertised on 3 April 1998 and that Permona intended to use and apply its trade mark in the near future in Singapore. 

38\. Paragraph 3 thereof stated: 

3\. The Applic ant [i.e Permona] derived the Trade Mark from the idea of Chinese Culture where Chinese are known as people who have a high respec t to their c ulture, tradition and anc estor. Most of Singaporean (sic ) are Chinese, it will be a good prospec t to our c igarette market if we c an c reate a brand name whic h 


 related to Chinese and market it to Singapore. So we c hoose Chung Hwa as a brand whic h is given from the pronunc iation and meaning of 

 Annexed hereto marked as Exhibit "A" is a c ertified English translation of the Chinese Charac ter. 

39\. The c ertific ation was from Coleman Commerc ial & Language Centre dated 17 August 1999. 

40\. It c ertified that the transliteration of the Chinese c harac ters relied on by Permona c an be CHUNG HWA. However if the Hanyu Pinyin system is used, it would be CHONG HUA. 

41\. The c ertific ate went on to give some meanings of eac h of the two Chinese c harac ters eg. : high, lofty, sublime, and : c hange, transform. 

42\. However it did not purport to asc ribe any meaning to these two Chinese c harac ters when c onsidered together. 

43\. Mr Xus statutory dec laration in reply exhibited, inter alia, a transliteration and translation from a sworn interpreter of the Supreme Court of Singapore of the Chinese c harac ters relied upon by Permona. The transliteration was CHONG and HUA. The translation of eac h of the Chinese c harac ters used by Permona was given and was similar to that provided by Coleman Commerc ial & Language Centre. 

44\. However, the last sentenc e of the translation from the sworn interpreter stated: 

 The c ombination of the 2 Chinese c harac ters, ( ), when read together, c onveys no meaning. 

45\. Ms Iyer also submitted that the New Century Chinese-English Dic tionary does not have a c ombination of these two Chinese c harac ters. 

### MY DECISION 

46\. The applic able law was the Trade Marks Ac t (Cap 332) Revised Edition 1992. Ms Iyer relied on various provisions therein to oppose Permona. 

**_Section 12(1)_** 

47\. Sec tion 12(1) of the Trade Marks Ac t (Cap 332) states: 

 12(1) Any person c laiming to be the proprietor of a trade mark used or proposed to be used by him who is desirous of registering it shall apply in writing to the Registrar in the presc ribed manner for registration in Part A or B of the register. 

48\. In Tiffany & Co v Fabriques de Tabac Reunies SA [1999] 3 SLR 147, Chief Justic e Yong Pung How, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal said, at para 27: 

 27. In Cornish on Intellec tual Property (2nd Ed) whic h deals with the English position, the author c omments that while the c onc ept of proprietor c learly extends to a person who bona fide intends to use as well as one already using, it 


 does not c over a person who c opies anothers mark, even if the latter mark is not in use in the jurisdic tion. The key ingredient in a suc c essful opposition under s 12 of the Ac t is a misappropriation of the mark by the applic ant. 

49\. It was obvious that Permonas CHUNG HWA was very similar, if not identic al, to the Opponents CHUNGHWA. The only differenc e was that Permonas mark was in two words whereas the Opponents mark was in one word. Permonas CHUNG HWA was also similar phonetic ally and in spelling to the Opponents Chunghwa in stylised form. For ease of referenc e, the following parts of my grounds of dec ision will refer to the Opponents CHUNGHWA only i.e without the stylised version. 

50\. Permona had not used CHUNG HWA or the Chinese c harac ters it relied on in any trade prior to its applic ation or sinc e then, even up to the time of the hearing before me. 

51\. I have already alluded to the brief affidavit of Ratna Tanuwidjaja. 

52\. What was more signific ant was that the two Chinese c harac ters from whic h Permonas CHUNG HWA was purportedly derived were supposed to mean Chinese c ulture. However, although eac h c harac ter has its own meaning, the two c harac ters have no meaning when c onsidered together. 

53\. As for the fac t that the Opponents did not apply to register their CHUNGHWA mark prior to 29 January 1996, two c ases were helpful to me. 

54\. In _Vitamins Application_ [1951] RPC 1, the opponents had earlier sought to apply for registration of their mark but dec ided to withdraw their applic ation, after the applic ants refused to c onsent to the opponents registration. The applic ants then sought to register their mark. 

55\. Mr Justic e Lloyd-Jac obs said, at p 12, starting from line 51: 

 There (sic ) mere fac t that the evidenc e available may not be suffic ient to establish the right of a party to be entered upon the Registrar, does not of itself negative the proprietary right whic h that party had asserted by making his applic ation nor does he nec essarily deny suc h right by the withdrawal of the applic ation. 

56\. This reasoning was mentioned with approval by Mr Justic e Wynn-Parry in Brown Shoes Applic ation [1959] RPC 29 at p 33 line 29 to 34 who said: 

 In this c ase, the Appellants applied for registration in 1952. They were met by an objec tion by the Registrar under Sec. 9 of the Ac t, and in the event, did not pursue their applic ation: but on the reasoning of Lloyd-Jac ob, J., in the Vitamins c ase I am not prepared to ac c ept that the fac t that the Appellants did not pursue their original c laim c an be regarded as c omplete abandonment of their rights. 

57\. Although, in these two c ases, there was a prior applic ation by the party opposing the c urrent applic ation, whic h prior applic ation had been withdrawn, and in Brown Shoes Applic ation, the prior applic ation was in fac t re-submitted, the legal position of the Opponents before me was no different from those in the said two c ases. 

58\. The fac t that the Opponents did not apply to register their CHUNGHWA mark prior to 29 January 1996 did not nec essarily mean that they had no proprietary right to it. Neither did it mean that 


Permona was a bona fide proprietor of its mark. 

59\. Permona also avoided saying who in its organisation c ame up with the two Chinese c harac ters as c ombined together and the English transliteration. 

60\. In my view, the two Chinese c harac ters had been put together by Permona in a belated and desperate attempt to explain how it had derived the English transliteration CHUNG HWA. Obviously Permona did not want to rely on the same Chinese c harac ters as the Opponents did. 

61\. It was c lear to me that this was a blatant attempt by Permona to c opy and misappropriate the Opponents CHUNGHWA. I also ac c epted Ms Iyers submission that Permona was hoping to register its mark so as to extrac t a payment from the Opponents. 

62\. Ac c ordingly I c onc luded that Permona was not a bona fide proprietor of the mark CHUNG HWA. 

**_Section 15(1)_** 

63\. Sec tion 15(1) of the Trade Marks Ac t (Cap 332) states: 

 15(1) It shall not be lawful to register as a trade mark or part of a trade mark any matter the use of whic h would, by reason of its being likely to dec eive or c ause c onfusion or otherwise, be disentitled to protec tion in a c ourt of justic e, or would be c ontrary to law or morality, or any sc andalous design. 

64\. Previously, the legal position appeared to be that there would be a likelihood of dec eption or c onfusion if the mark or a similar one was already enjoying a reputation in Singapore and this reputation c ould only be established by use of the mark in Singapore by someone opposing the applic ation or someone else other than the applic ant. 

65\. However in Tiffany, Yong Pung How CJ said, at paras 36 and 40: 

 36 We are of the opinion that the views of the New Zealand Court of Appeal, and therefore Kan Ting Chiu Js as well, should be preferred in this regard. As Lord Upjohn himself c ommented in Bali, s 15 of the Ac t was designed not so muc h for the protec tion of other traders in the use of their marks or their reputation, but for the protec tion of the public. In this c ase, if true likelihood of c onfusion and dec eption c an be shown, we are unable to see why use of the opposing mark is required within the jurisdic tion before this may be established. Even without the appellants use of the mark Tiffany in Singapore at the time of the respondents applic ation, there c ould be a real c hanc e that a substantial number of members of the public would be c onfused into thinking that the respondents goods were somehow c onnec ted to or originated from the appellants. Furthermore, the Bali c ase was dec ided in 1969, during a time when tourism and the dissemination of information was not quite as widespread. Sinc e then, modern tec hnology and c ommunic ation have improved at suc h a rapid rate that we in Singapore may be as familiar with famous international marks as someone in the c ountry where the mark is ac tually in use. In this day and age, Lord Upjohns assertion that the prac tic al likelihood of c onfusion or dec eption c an only be shown by proving the existing user of the mark by someone else in the same jurisdic tion c an no longer hold true. In this respec t, the learned judges example of the loc al public s 


 knowledge of the name Viagra before it was launc hed here is espec ially apt in showing that reputation in Singapore is suffic ient for c onfusion and dec eption to arise amongst members of the Singaporean public that would otherwise lead the mark applied for to be disentitled to protec tion in a c ourt of justic e. 

 37 

 38 

 39 

 40 We have therefore established that there need not be use of the mark Tiffany by the appellants or anyone else in Singapore for likelihood of dec eption or c onfusion amongst the loc al public that would lead the respondents mark being disentitled to protec tion in a c ourt of justic e to arise, so long as this fac t itself c an be shown in some other way. Of c ourse it must be emphasised that proof of reputation of some other person, in relation to the mark alone, does not automatic ally mean that likelihood of c onfusion or dec eption has been shown. This is a separate element whic h must be established by the appellants in this c ase. However, the fac t is that c onfusion or dec eption have no borders and c an arise as easily from knowledge, c ognisanc e or awareness of an international reputation. It c learly does not arise only where the other mark has been used in Singapore previously. 

66\. Although it was not nec essary for the Opponents to establish that CHUNGHWA c igarettes had been sold in Singapore, it would strengthen their opposition if they c ould do so. 

67\. On this point, Permona disputed that the sales through duty-free shops c onstituted sales in Singapore. 

68\. One of its arguments was that the sales were targeted at foreigners who were purc hasing for c onsumption outside Singapore. 

69\. However, there was no evidenc e that suc h sales were in fac t c onfined to foreigners leaving Singapore. 

70\. Mr Xus statutory dec laration in reply c hallenged Permonas assertion. He pointed out that Singaporeans, who travel frequently, also have ac c ess to the duty-free shops and often purc hase items from these shops for personal c onsumption or as gifts for c onsumption in and outside Singapore. That is why there are limits on duty free goods being brought into Singapore. 

71\. I was of the view that Mr Xus position on this point was c orrec t. 

72\. Furthermore, even if the purc hases were made by foreigners only, this did not mean that the sales were outside Singapore. 

73\. Permona also said that c igarette pac kets sold at the duty-free shops did not c ontain a health warning or c omply with loc al requirements regarding tax and nic otine levels, unlike those sold in Singapore other than the duty-free shops. Ac c ordingly, Mr Paul Teo, Counsel for Permona, argued that the sales were tainted with illegality and henc e c ould not c onstitute sales in Singapore. 


74\. Mr Xus statutory dec laration in reply said that duty-free shops were required by Singapore law to ac quire a lic enc e from the relevant authority to sell tobac c o produc ts in Singapore and he exhibited a c opy of a lic enc e granted to DFS Venture dated 24 August 1998 from the Direc tor of Medic al Servic es. Eac h lic enc e is for one year. 

75\. Ms Iyer also referred me to the Smoking (Control of Advertisements and Sale of Tobac c o) (Labelling) Regulations. 

76\. Regulation 3 provides for health warnings to be printed on every c ontainer of tobac c o produc ts. Regulation 2 defines c ontainer to inc lude a box, tin or pac ket. 

77\. Regulation 4 requires the nic otine level to be also printed on eac h c ontainer of c igarettes. 

78\. Regulation 4A(1) prohibits the sale of any tobac c o produc t whic h fails to c omply with any requirement under Regulation 3 or 4. 

79\. However, Regulation 4A(2) permits the import or supply of tobac c o produc ts whic h do not c omply with Regulation 3 or 4 if (a) the tobac c o produc ts are to be exported out of Singapore; (b) the tobac c o produc ts are not to be offered for sale, sold or c onsumed in Singapore; and (c ) the c onditions that the Direc tor or Direc tor-General of Customs and Exc ise may impose are satisfied. 

80\. Ms Iyer argued that the sales were permitted under Regulation 4A(2) and were not c ontrary to law. I agreed. So long as DFS Venture possessed the requisite lic enc e, the sales were permitted by law, unless the lic enc e was obtained under false pretenc es. 

81\. However, if the sales were permitted by virtue of Regulation 4A, then this would appear to lend support to the first argument of Permona i.e that the sales were not sales in Singapore. 

82\. In my view, the intention was for these c igarettes to be c onsumed outside Singapore but the fac t was that they might be and some were probably c onsumed in Singapore. Besides, whether they were c onsumed in or outside Singapore, the sales would still have been made in Singapore. The duty- free shops were loc ated in Singapore territory and were subjec t to Singapore lic ensing laws. 

83\. It was therefore not nec essary for me to dec ide on Ms Iyers relianc e on s 76 of the Trade Marks Ac t to establish use of the Opponents CHUNGHWA in Singapore. 

84\. I would add that the c ase of Future Enterprises Pte Ltd v Tong Seng Produc e Pte Ltd [1998] 1 SLR 1012 whic h Mr Teo relied on was not applic able. The fac ts there were different as the c offee produc ts were produc ed in Singapore for export to Russia. 

85\. The question then was whether the evidenc e c onsidered as a whole gave rise to some reputation of the Opponents CHUNGHWA in Singapore. 

86\. On this point, Tiffany is also authority for the proposition that in c onsidering the evidenc e, regard should be had not only to the evidenc e as at the date of the applic ation to register the trade mark but also at the time when the opposition proc eedings were heard. 

87\. I c onsidered the evidenc e as at both c ut-off dates. 

88\. As at 29 January 1996, being the date of Permonas applic ation, the amount spent on advertisements was about S$160,000. By 1998, this had inc reased to about S$320,000 (see paras 31 


and 30 above). By June 2001, it would probably have inc reased. 

89\. As at 29 January 1996, the sales from Paradise to DFS Venture was about $340,000. By 1998, it was about S$2m (see para 33 above). Again, by June 2001 suc h sales would probably have inc reased. 

90\. Also by June 2001, the sales to other c ountries would probably also have inc reased. 

91\. On the other hand, I took into ac c ount the fac t that the sales by DFS Venture were from duty- free shops and the Opponents goods were not freely available. 

92\. I c onc luded that, even as at 29 January 1996, CHUNGHWA enjoyed some reputation in Singapore. That reputation had inc reased sinc e 29 January 1996. 

93\. More importantly, the point was not so muc h whether the Opponents business had enjoyed suffic ient reputation in Singapore so as to be ac c orded protec tion but the protec tion of the public (see Tiffany again). 

94\. Bearing in mind that the two marks were phonetic ally identic al and visually very similar, it was obvious to me that there was a likelihood of dec eption and c onfusion among the public between Permonas CHUNG HWA and the Opponents CHUNGHWA. Duty-free shops are not patronised only by foreigners leaving Singapore, but also by (a) tourists entering Singapore, (b) travelling foreigners resident in Singapore and (c ) travelling Singaporeans. It was likely that these persons would be dec eived and c onfused if Permona were to attempt to sell c igarettes under the CHUNG HWA mark from other outlets in Singapore. 

**_Section 10_** 

95\. Ms Iyer also made a submission based on s 10(1)(d) of the Trade Marks Ac t whic h stipulates that the intended mark must c ontain a word or words having no direc t referenc e to the c harac ter or quality of the goods and is not a geographic al name. 

96\. She submitted that the meaning of the Chinese c harac ters must be taken into ac c ount, even though the mark Permona wanted to register was the English transliteration. 

97\. For this submission, she relied on the assertion that the Chinese c harac ters relied on by the Opponents means China and for that reason, it was rejec ted in the original applic ation by the Opponents alleged Hong Kong distributor. 

98\. This submission was premised on the alleged bac kground as to how the pagoda devic e c ame to be registered in Singapore alone (in the name of Tec k Soon Hong Limited) without the Chinese c harac ters and also without the English transliteration. 

99\. I have dealt above with this alleged bac kground. The Opponents failed to establish it, even if the Chinese c harac ters they relied on means China, or, for that matter, Chinese. 

100\. In any event, the issue was not so muc h what the Chinese c harac ters relied on by the Opponents mean but what the Chinese c harac ters relied on by Permona mean. 

101\. As it was the Opponents c ase that the latter have no meaning, whic h I ac c epted, it was not open to Ms Iyer to use the meaning of the Chinese c harac ters used by the Opponents to oppose 


Permonas applic ation. 

**_Section 12(2)_** 

102\. Ms Iyer also sought to rely on s 12(2) of the Trade Marks Ac t whic h gives the Registrar of Trade Marks a disc retion to refuse or ac c ept an applic ation absolutely or subjec t to suc h c onditions as he may impose. 

103\. Even if this c ould have been a separate ground of objec tion in addition to s 12(1) and s 15(1), it was not nec essary for me, in the c irc umstanc es, to make a ruling under s 12(2). 

104\. Ac c ordingly, the opposition was suc c essful under s 12(1) and s 15(1) of the Trade Marks Ac t.
