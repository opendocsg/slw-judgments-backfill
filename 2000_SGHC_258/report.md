: The two appeals (MA 180/2000 and MA 201/2000) were brought by the ac c used who was appealing against his sentenc e only. The first appeal MA 180/2000 was against the dec ision of Distric t Judge Seng Kwang Boon, who, on 12 July 2000, had sentenc ed the appellant to reformative training. The sec ond appeal MA 201/2000 was against the dec ision of Distric t Judge Mavis Chionh on 26 July 2000 to impose a sec ond sentenc e of reformative training whic h was to run c onc urrently with the one ordered earlier. 

**_Background facts_** 

On 3 February 1998, at the age of 14 years and 8 months, the appellant was found guilty and c onvic ted by the Juvenile Court on two c ounts of theft under s 379 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and a further two c ounts of theft under s 379A of the Penal Code. Consequently, the appellant was sentenc ed by the Juvenile Court to stay in the Singapore Boys` Home (`the Boys` Home`) for 30 months. On 30 June 1998, I heard and dismissed his appeal against c onvic tion and sentenc e and ordered him to c ommenc e serving his 30-month term in the Boys` Home from that day onwards. 

During his stay at the Boys` Home, the appellant was ill-disc iplined and a rec alc itrant trouble-maker who failed to c omply with the rules and regulations of the Home. The following ac ts of misc onduc t and its surrounding c irc umstanc es were rec orded by Mr Koh Ann Keong, the Superintendent of the Boys` Home: 

(i) On 20 Marc h 2000, the appellant and two other residents of the Boys` Home vandalised the Segregation Room by forc ing open the sec urity grille of the toilet exhaust louve, removing a piec e of metal rod and using it to make a hole the size of a c omputer mouse on the ventilation wall. They then used the metal rod to reac h for the light switc h outside the Segregation Room to switc h off the light. 

(ii) On 22 Marc h 2000, the appellant attempted suic ide by drinking shampoo in the dormitory. He was later examined by the psyc hiatrist of the Institute of Mental Health, who assessed him as non-suic idal 


and no follow-up treatment was required. The appellant c laimed that he attempted suic ide bec ause he was unhappy with the punishment of four strokes of the c ane that was meted out to him by the Superintendent. He had been punished for being rude, defiant and refusing to c arry out the teac her`s instruc tions to c lean the c lassroom properly. 

(iii) On 14 April 2000, the appellant esc aped from the lawful c ustody of one Mohan s/o Franc is Xavier, the Senior House Master of Bloc k E of the Boys` Home. The appellant had been brought to the Jurong Polyc linic for medic al attention after he c omplained of asthmatic problems. The appellant absc onded after rec eiving medic al attention and whilst waiting for his presc ription. 

(iv) At the time of his esc ape, the appellant`s hands were c uffed with a pair of Smith and Wesson handc uffs. After esc aping, he managed to remove the handc uffs whic h he threw away after that. 

(v) On 27 May 2000, the appellant was arrested by the polic e and taken bac k to the Boys` Home. On the same night, the appellant vandalised the Segregation Room again. This time he removed a metal showerhead and tied it to one end of his T-shirt, making a potentially dangerous weapon whic h c ould c ause serious injuries if swung at another person`s head. The appellant then demanded to be released from the Segregation Room and to see a psyc hiatrist as well as the Superintendent immediately. When his demands were not ac c eded to, the appellant banged his head against the wall to protest. Eventually, he had to be restrained to a bed in order to protec t him from further selfharm. Thereafter, he abused the staff with vulgarities. 

**_The proceedings_** 

On 29 May 2000, following these ac ts of misc onduc t by the appellant, the Superintendent of the Boys` Home made representations to the Juvenile Court under s 44(2) of the Children and Young Persons Ac t (`CYPA`) (Cap 38). The information provided by the Superintendent referred to the appellant`s misbehaviour, as enumerated earlier, and stated that the appellant was of so unruly a c harac ter that he c ould not be detained in the Boys` Home. 

On 20 June 2000, after c onsidering the information from the Superintendent, the Juvenile Court was satisfied that the appellant was of so unruly a c harac ter that he c ould not be detained in the Boys` Home. As the appellant was already 17 years old at the time of the hearing, the c ourt c alled for a Reformative Training Report to assess his suitability for a sentenc e of reformative training. After rec eiving a report stating that the appellant was suitable for reformative training, the Juvenile Court invoked its powers under s 44(2)(e) of the CYPA to refer the appellant to a Distric t Court so that he may be dealt with under s 13 of the Criminal Proc edure Code (Cap 68). For the ease of referenc e, s 44(2)(e) CYPA states as follows: 

 (2) Where a Juvenile Court is satisfied, on the representations of the manager of a place of detention, an approved school or an approved home, that a person ordered to be detained in the place of detention, approved school or approved home is of so unruly a character that he cannot be so detained , the Court may 

 ... 

 (e) where the person is a male and has attained the age of 16 years and the Court is satisfied that it is expedient with a view to his reformation that he should undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre, the Court 


 may order him to be brought before a District Court to be dealt with under section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Cap. 68. 

The matter c ame before Distric t Judge Seng Kwang Boon on 12 July 2000, who, after reading the information provided by the Superintendent of the Boys` Home and the pre-sentenc e report, agreed with the Juvenile Court that reformative training was appropriate for the appellant. The appellant was thus sentenc ed to undergo a period of reformative training. This formed the bac kground leading to MA 180/2000. 

At the same time, two fresh c harges (DAC 23944/2000 and MAC 3929/2000) were brought against the appellant in relation to his esc ape from the Boys` Home. The first c harge was for esc aping from the lawful c ustody of Mohan s/o Franc is Xavier when they were at the Jurong Polyc linic , an offenc e under s 224 of the Penal Code. The sec ond c harge related to the appellant`s disposal of his handc uffs after making his esc ape. The polic e were not able to rec over these handc uffs even after the arrest of the appellant. The ac t of throwing away the handc uffs, whic h c ost around $48-$60, c onstituted an offenc e under s 427, Penal Code. 

The proc eedings for the two fresh c harges were first heard by Distric t Judge Mavis Chionh on 20 June 

2000\. It should be noted that this hearing took plac e prior to that before Distric t Judge Seng Kwang Boon, as mentioned earlier. The appellant pleaded guilty to the two c harges and in mitigation, said that he was `very sorry` and asked for lenienc y from the c ourt. After taking into ac c ount his previous c onvic tions and his disc iplinary rec ord in the Boys` Home, DJ Mavis Chionh was of the view that reformative training should be c onsidered. A pre-sentenc e report was therefore c alled for. The first report that was presented by the Prisons Department c ertified that the appellant was physic ally and mentally fit and suitable for reformative training. The appellant`s c ounsel, however, informed the c ourt that the report failed to make any referenc e to the appellant`s admittanc e into the Institute of Mental Health after he drank shampoo. DJ Mavis Chionh thus direc ted that a supplemental report be prepared in order to take into ac c ount the c onc ern raised over the appellant`s mental health history. A further report was thereafter prepared and c onsidered by DJ Mavis Chionh on 26 July 2000. The supplemental report c onfirmed that the appellant was suitable for reformative training. Ac c ordingly, a sentenc e of reformative training was ordered by DJ Mavis Chionh. As DJ Seng Kwang Boon had, about two weeks earlier on 12 July 2000, also imposed the same sentenc e on the appellant, the sec ond sentenc e of reformative training was ordered to c ommenc e running from the same date as the term imposed earlier. This was in c onsideration of the princ iple laid down in **Ng Kwok Fai v PP** <span class="citation">[1996] 1 SLR 568</span> , where it was held that `c onsec utive terms of reformative training are wrong in princ iple and c ould give rise to problems in prac tic e`. The appeal against DJ Mavis Chionh`s dec ision formed the subjec t-matter of MA 201/2000. 

**_The appeals_** 

**MA 180/2000 (against the decision of DJ Seng Kwang Boon)** 

The sentenc e of reformative training was imposed here as a result of the Juvenile Court invoking its powers under s 44(2)(e) of the CYPA. Under this provision, it must be established that the appellant was `of so unruly a c harac ter` that he c annot c ontinue to be detained in the Boys` Home and it is expedient with a view to his reformation that he should undergo a period of training in a reformative 


training c entre. 

On the question of what would c onstitute `of so unruly a c harac ter` in the c ontext of the CYPA, there did not seem to be any relevant c ase authority that had previously interpreted suc h a phrase or the word `unruly`. In suc h c irc umstanc es, the appropriate approac h was to adopt the plain and literal meaning of the term and phrase. For that purpose, I found it useful to refer to some of the definitions of the word `unruly` as stated in various dic tionaries. In **_West`s Legal Thesaurus/Dictionary_** , the word `unruly` was defined as `diffic ult to manage or c ontrol; hyperac tive`. In **_The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary_** , the same word was defined to mean `not easily c ontrolled or disc iplined; ungovernable; disorderly` and in the **_Longman Dictionary of the English Language_** , the meaning stated was `diffic ult to disc ipline or manage` and `not submissive to c ontrol`. 

Whether or not the appellant was `of so unruly a c harac ter` was c learly a question of fac t whic h must be determined from the fac tual c irc umstanc es of the c ase. I noted from his rec ord that, sinc e his early sec ondary sc hool days, the appellant had shown himself to be disobedient, disruptive and obdurate. He was expelled from Thomson Sec ondary Sc hool in November 1996 after spending a year there. The basis for his expulsion was his c ontinual misc onduc t whic h inc luded possession of c igarettes, theft, molestation, rude behaviour towards teac hers, assault and c ausing hurt to c lassmates. While the appellant was still at Thomson Sec ondary Sc hool, the princ ipal had referred him to the Child Guidanc e Clinic managed by the Ministry of Health. He was diagnosed as having a `c onduc t disorder`. The appellant was then given another c hanc e at sc hooling and was plac ed in First Toa Payoh Sec ondary Sc hool. However, he failed to learn from his errant ways and c reated a series of problems in the short period of three months that he spent there. It was observed by his teac hers that the appellant was disruptive and rude in c lass, he vandalised sc hool property, refused to do his work and was found in possession of c igarettes. He was a persistent trouble-maker to the extent that the sc hool was left with no c hoic e but to expel him in Marc h 1997. Subsequently, the appellant voluntarily admitted himself into the Singapore Boys` Town in July 1997. Onc e again, he failed to make use of the opportunity to improve himself. Soon after his admission, he ran away from the institution to avoid punishment for his misbehaviour and even after his return some time later, he got into fights and other forms of trouble again. After he was c aught and c onvic ted for a series of thefts, the appellant was sentenc ed to stay in the Singapore Boys` Home for 30 months. Probation was not rec ommended for him as it was observed that the appellant was not at all remorseful for his misdeeds and required a stric ter and more regimented environment to instil in him greater selfdisc ipline and respec t for the law and authority. 

It was evident from the fac ts that the rehabilitative experienc e whic h the Boys` Home was intended to provide had not been ac hieved. The report prepared by the Superintendent of the Boys` Home for the Juvenile Court, listed out the whole litany of misdemeanours c ommitted by the appellant even after he had been admitted to the Boys` Home. He remained defiant towards authority and refused to take any responsibility for his various wrong-doings. I did not have any doubt that the appellant was c learly of an `unruly` c harac ter. He had demonstrated himself, time and again, to be a rebellious and deviant youth, almost inc apable of c ontrol. The stay in the Boys` Home was plainly not able to provide the suitable environment for his rehabilitation and reformation. In suc h a situation, and in view of the fac t that the appellant had attained the age of 16 years, I was of the view that the Juvenile Court was entitled to exerc ise its powers under s 44(2)(e) of the CYPA, to order the appellant to be brought before a Distric t Court to be given a sentenc e of reformative training. 

Taking into c onsideration the young age of the appellant and his unfortunate family bac kground, I dec ided that it was appropriate to give him another c hanc e at rehabilitation. Sinc e young, the appellant had lac ked proper parental guidanc e and supervision, his parents having separated sinc e he was three years old, and this was probably the fundamental c ause of his unruliness. The appellant 


was in serious need of some stric t guidanc e and enforc ed reformation. This would not be suitably provided in a c ustodial sentenc e. In the c ase of **PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice** <span class="citation">[1999] 1 SLR 138</span> at 142, I had stated that: 

 Rehabilitation is the dominant consideration where the offender is 21 years and below. Young offenders are in their formative years and chances of reforming them into law-abiding adults are better. The corrupt influence of a prison environment and the bad effects of labelling and stigmatisation may not be desirable for young offenders. Compassion is often shown to young offenders on the assumption that the young dont know any better and they may not have had enough experience to realise the full consequences of their actions on themselves and on others. Teens may also be slightly less responsible than older offenders, being more impressionable, more easily led and less controlled in their behaviour. 

These c onsiderations were similarly applic able to the present fac ts of the c ase. A c ustodial sentenc e was therefore unsuitable for the appellant. 

However, it was obviously not a satisfac tory arrangement for the appellant to c ontinue his sentenc e at the Boys` Home, it being apparent that a more severe and regimented environment was nec essary to steer the appellant in the right path. Thus, I was of the view that a sentenc e of reformative training was the most apposite in suc h c irc umstanc es and was not exc essive at all. The appeal against the dec ision of DJ Seng Kwang Boon was therefore dismissed. 

**MA 201/2000 (against the decision of DJ Mavis Chionh)** 

For the earlier stated reasons, the sentenc e passed by DJ Mavis Chionh was similarly not exc essive. The two fresh offenc es under s 224 and s 427 of the Penal Code eac h provided for punishment `with imprisonment for a term whic h may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both`. Applying the princ iples I laid down in **_Ng Kwok Fai v PP_** (supra), a c ustodial sentenc e was not suitable on the present fac ts sinc e the appellant had already been sentenc ed to reformative training by DJ Seng Kwang Boon. The appellant`s antec edents and long history of misc onduc t, however, ruled out the mere imposition of a fine for the two offenc es. In the light of all the foregoing, I found the c onc urrent sentenc e of reformative training ordered by DJ Mavis Chionh to be the most appropriate sentenc e for the appellant. Ac c ordingly, I ordered for this appeal to be dismissed too. 

## Outcome: 

Appeals dismissed.
