22 April 2015 

**Valerie Thean JC:** 

**Introduction** 

1       This was an appeal against a dec ision of a Distric t Judge (“the Judge) to grant a stay of a nullity suit on the ground of _forum non conveniens_. I heard and dismissed the appeal and now give my grounds of dec ision. 

2       I should mention that this was a dec ision of the High Court in exerc ise of its c ivil appellate jurisdic tion in family matters heard on 8 January 2015. Under s 34(7) of the Supreme Court of Judic ature Ac t (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed), leave must be obtained for suc h an appeal and no leave has been sought. 

**The facts** 

3       The ac tion c ommenc ed by the husband was for the marriage to be annulled on the ground that the marriage was not c onsummated owing either to the wilful refusal and/or inc apac ity of the wife. 

4       The husband was born in India and bec ame a Singaporean c itizen in 2007 after working here for a number of years. He is c urrently residing in Singapore. The wife, also born in India, is an Indian c itizen and c urrently resides in Haryana, India. 

**_The marriage and separation_** 

5       Husband and wife first married on 28 February 2011 in a traditional Hindu setting in ac c ordanc e with Hindu c ustom and rites under the Hindu Marriage Ac t (Ac t No 25 of 1955) (India) (“HMA”) in New Delhi, India. They then followed with registration in an Indian c ourt pursuant to the Spec ial Marriage Ac t (Ac t No 43 of 1954) (India) (“SMA”) on 14 Marc h 2011 in Yamuna Nagar, Haryana, India. 

6       After the marriage, both moved to Singapore on 25 Marc h 2011. After a month here, the wife returned to India to seek medic al treatment. The husband was at the same time offered a job in San 


Franc isc o. As a result, both reloc ated to San Franc isc o sometime in September 2011. 

7       In January 2013, the husband returned to Singapore, while the wife returned to India to live with her family in Yamuna Nagar, Haryana, India. 

**_The legal proceedings_** 

8       On 8 April 2013, the husband c ommenc ed nullity proc eedings in Singapore against the wife on the following grounds: 

 (a) that the marriage has not been c onsummated owing to the inc apac ity of the wife to c onsummate it; or 

 (b) that the marriage has not been c onsummated owing to the wilful refusal of the wife to c onsummate it. 

9       The wife thereafter initiated separate proc eedings in Yamuna Nagar, Haryana, India against the husband in relation to dowry harassment, domestic violenc e, and for maintenanc e. On 4 June 2013, the wife filed the present applic ation for the nullity proc eedings in Singapore to be stayed on the basis of _forum non conveniens_. 

**The decision below** 

10     The Judge stayed the ac tion on 2 January 2014, with the following orders: [note: 1] 

 1) The Nullity Proc eedings herein are stayed on c ondition that the Defendant c ommenc es divorc e proc eedings in India within one month from the date of this Order. The Plaintiff is at liberty to c ommenc e Nullity Proc eedings in India. 

 2) The Plaintiff is at liberty to restore these proc eedings in the event that the c ondition above is not c omplied with by the Defendant. 

After the delivery of the judgment, the wife, whose position is that the marriage has been c onsummated, c ommenc ed divorc e proc eedings against the husband in New Delhi, India on 24 January 2014. 

11     Against the dec ision of the Judge the husband appealed to the High Court and the appeal was heard before me. The issue is whic h is a more c onvenient forum for the resolution of the dispute: the Court in India or the Court in Singapore. 

**The legal context** 

**_The legal test applicable_** 

12     Both parties agreed that the test applic able is that of the House of Lords dec ision of _Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd_ [1987] AC 460 (“ _Spiliada_ ”), adopted by our Court of Appeal on many oc c asions: see _Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp v PT Airfast Services Indonesia_ <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR(R) 345</span>, _Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern_ <span class="citation">[1995] 2 SLR(R) 851</span>, _CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinworth Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543</span> (“ _CIMB v Dresdner_ ”) and _JIO Minerals FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2011] 1 SLR 391</span> (“ _JIO Minerals v Mineral Enterprises_ ”). 


13     In brief, the applic able test is a twostage test: 

 ( a ) Is India the appropriate forum for trial? At this stage, in whic h the defendant bears the burden of persuasion, the c ourt looks to see what fac tors there are whic h point in the direc tion of another forum as being the forum with whic h the ac tion has the most real and substantial c onnec tion. This is a fac torsbased test: the weight to be plac ed on the various fac tors varies with eac h fac tual matrix: BDA v BDB <span class="citation">[2013] 1 SLR 607</span> (“ BDA v BDB ”) at [23] per Chao Hic k Tin JA. 

 ( b ) Are there any other special circumstances requiring the trial to take place in Singapore? At this sec ond stage, the plaintiff bears the burden of proof. A stay would ordinarily be granted where there is another more appropriate forum for trial. 

**_The appellate context_** 

14     As I dealt with this matter in an appellate c ontext, I bore in mind the guidanc e of the Court of Appeal that in determining whether or not to grant a stay of proc eedings, the first instanc e judge will invariably be exerc ising a disc retion. The appellate c ourt should not interfere with suc h an exerc ise of disc retion “unless the judge had misdirec ted himself on a matter of princ iple, or he had taken into ac c ount matters whic h he ought not to have taken into ac c ount or failed to take into ac c ount matters whic h he ought to have taken into ac c ount, or his dec ision is plainly wrong” (see _CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543</span> (“ _CIMB Bank_ ”) at [84], referring to _The Abidin Daver_ [1984] AC 398 at 420 _per_ Lord Brandon of Oakbrook). This rule was applied to appeals to the High Court from the Distric t Court in _BDA v BDB._ 

**My decision** 

**_Is India the most appropriate forum for trial?_** 

15     The first stage of the test c onc erns a balanc ing of the various c onnec ting fac tors. 

16     The husband’s view was that the marriage was held in India as a matter of c onvenienc e, and that parties intended to live in Singapore in the longer term. Arising from registration of the marriage under the SMA (whic h is similar to our Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed (“Women’s Charter”)), he thought the dispute fairly straightforward, and more speedily dealt with in Singapore. 

17     The wife, on her part, pointed out that the marriage had been advertised in India and c elebrated there, first as a traditional Hindu marriage valid under the HMA and then only later registered under the SMA. Indian laws of nullity under the HMA were different from the SMA, for whic h her evidenc e was that the registration was simply for ease of obtaining a visa to the USA. On the issue of c onsummation, her relevant medic al experts are based in the USA and India. The Indian c ourts are best plac ed to c onsider disputes c onc erning loc al experts, Indian domestic law and aspec ts of maintenanc e. 

18     The Judge held that there are more c onnec ting fac tors to India than Singapore: parties were married in India and the wife is an Indian c itizen residing in India. As the husband had c hosen to marry in India in ac c ordanc e with Indian law and c ustoms, the Judge felt that it is not for the husband to then c laim that he would be denied justic e in India. 

19     I disc uss in turn the various relevant c onnec ting fac tors raised in argument. 

_The domicile and residence of the parties_ 


_The domicile and residence of the parties_ 

20     The wife is an Indian c itizen and is presently domic iled in India. She has been residing in Haryana, India sinc e the separation in 2013. The husband, on the other hand, is a Singaporean c itizen who resides in and is domic iled in Singapore. In this regard, the domic ile and residenc e of the parties do not point to any spec ific jurisdic tion. 

21     While the wife attempted to highlight that the husband remained an “Overseas Citizen of India” and there was argument and exc hange of expert evidenc e as to the effec t of this, I found it useful to refer to the rec ent High Court dec ision (on appeal from the Distric t Court), _BDA v BDB_ , where Chao JA observed (at [29]) that nationality is of limited signific anc e: 

 ... While not entirely disc ounting nationality as a c onnec ting fac tor, nationality per se is of limited signific anc e. In an inc reasingly globalised world, multiple nationalities are bec oming the norm. Residency and/or domicile are better indicators of the strength of a party's connection to a particular forum. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

_The availability of evidence and witnesses_ 

22     The husband’s argument was that the only potential witnesses in the present ac tion were the parties themselves and the husband’s parents. 

23     In c ontrast, the wife, who has sought all the while to argue that the marriage has been c onsummated, c ontended that medic al reports whic h “c learly indic ate her c apac ity to c onsummate” resulted from medic al examinations in USA and India. She had rec eived no medic al attention in Singapore. 

24     The Court of Appeal has highlighted in _CIMB Bank_ (at [69]) that the plac e of residenc e of witnesses may not be a signific ant issue in the light of the easy availability of video c onferenc ing. Nevertheless, in this partic ular c ase, _some_ weight should be given, as the defendant will likely require witnesses from either USA or India, given the medic al proc edures that were c arried out there. Her earliest postmarriage medic al treatment, a c ouple of months after the marriage, was in India. 

_Availability of ancillary relief_ 

25     The wife argued that the Court in India is better plac ed to asc ertain an appropriate quantum for any maintenanc e order, whic h she would require on termination of the marriage. 

26     In _BDA v BDB_ , Chao JA dealt with this issue (at [32]) in the c ontext of two earlier Distric t Court dec isions. In _Helen Diane Womersley (m.w.) v Niger Maurice Womersley_ <span class="citation">[2003] SGDC 186</span> at [14], it was held that an “English c ourt would be in a better position to c onsider the c ost of living in England”. In _Prapavathi d/o N Balabaskaran v Manjini Balamurugan_ <span class="citation">[2002] SGDC 354</span> at [48], it was ac c epted that it would be easier for a Singapore c ourt to c onsider the wife’s c ost of living in Singapore. While Chao JA ac c epted that as a general proposition it would be easier for a c ourt to c onsider the c ost of living in its own jurisdic tion, he went on to make the observation that a Singapore c ourt was, as a whole, not at a c omplete disadvantage in the determination of maintenanc e for a wife residing in India when c ompared to an Indian c ourt (at [33]): 

 ... First, the wife must show that she needs maintenanc e and that the husband has neglec ted or refused to provide reasonable maintenanc e for her and any c hild of the marriage. Sec ond, the 


 c ourt will have to determine the quantum required for maintenanc e. On the first question, the c ourt in Singapore is as well plac ed as any other to rule on the issue. As regards the sec ond question, the advantage of an Indian c ourt is at best limited bec ause of two c onsiderations. First, the Wife has stated that she intends to return to live in Singapore. Sec ond, in determining the quantum of maintenanc e, the c ourt shall have to take into ac c ount the standard of living enjoyed by the Wife and the son before the Husband's neglec t or refusal to maintain them (see s 69(4)( f ) of the Women's Charter). On this aspec t, a Singapore c ourt would be better plac ed than an Indian c ourt to determine that matter as the parties were then living in Singapore. Thus while a Singapore c ourt may be at a slight disadvantage vis-à-vis the question of the c ost of living in India, it is at an advantage vis-à-vis the question of the previous standard of living of the parties in Singapore. In other words, a Singapore c ourt will not be at a c omplete disadvantage, when c ompared to an Indian c ourt, in determining the proper quantum of maintenanc e. 

27     In _BDA v BDB_ , a stay was refused bec ause the other c onnec ting fac tors were strong. It was a maintenanc e c laim where the wife and son previously lived in Singapore. The defendant husband, who sought the stay, was working and resident in Singapore, with assets in Singapore. Further, the wife had indic ated that she intended to return to live in Singapore. 

28     In c ontrast, in this c ase at hand, it is the party resident in India who sought the stay. Aside from an initial four weeks, the parties’ previous standard of living while together is premised on an Americ an quality of life. The wife’s future standard of living is premised on Indian c osts of living. One c ould say that quantum is a matter of evidenc e and it follows as a matter of logic that a Singaporean c ourt c ould still make the relevant judgment onc e presented with the appropriate evidenc e. In the light of the lac k of other c onnec ting fac tors, however, this fac tor weighed against the husband. 

_The applicable law_ 

29     The issue c onc erning the applic able domestic statute was the main dispute that arose between the parties in the present applic ation. _Both parties accepted that Indian law would be the law governing their dispute._ As a result, the main argument before me was c onfined to the question of whether the annulment of the marriage was governed by the HMA or the SMA. 

(1) Applic able statute: the HMA or the SMA? 

30     The wife took the view that both parties had undergone a traditional marriage on 28 February 2011 and the HMA would be the relevant statute governing the dissolution of the marriage. Bec ause the rules under the HMA were signific antly different from those found in the Women’s Charter, whic h was, for all intents and purposes, a sec ular framework, the wife c ontended that it would be more appropriate for an Indian c ourt to resolve the dispute between the parties. 

31     On the other hand, the husband took the position that the marriage was governed by the SMA, as opposed to the HMA. Mr Shri, the husband’s Indian c ounsel, referred to s 18 of the SMA, whic h expressly provides that the marriage shall, from the date of entry into the marriage register, be deemed to be a marriage solemnised under the SMA. In the c irc umstanc es, it was argued that a marriage c annot be governed by both the HMA and the SMA. Mr Shri c ontended that upon registration under the SMA, the marriage would thereafter be governed by the rules therein and a Singapore c ourt would have no diffic ulty in view of its similarity with the Women’s Charter. 

32     The wife relied on the fac t that the HMA marriage was the first in time. In the opinion dated 31 August 2013 authored by Mr Bimlesh (the wife’s Indian c ounsel), it was stated that when the parties were Hindus and the marriage was solemnised under Hindu c ustoms, even if it were registered later, it 


would still be governed by the HMA. She also stated that nullity as a c ause of ac tion was barred 

under the HMA after one year of marriage [note: 2] ; Mr Shri’s answer was that this issue does not 

arise in SMA proc eedings, whic h applied [note: 3]. 

33     Mr Bimlesh relied on two c ases. In _Y Narasimha Rao and Others v Y Venkata Lakshmi and Another_ (1991) 3 SCC 452 (“ _Narasimha Rao_ ”), parties first performed Hindu rites in ac c ordanc e with the HMA and then registered the marriage under the Foreign Marriage Ac t. The HMA was held to have prevailed. This was followed in _R Sridharan v The Presiding Officer_ (9 July 2010) (unreported) 

(“ _Sridharan_ ”), [note: 4] where the husband, a US c itizen, argued that although the marriage had been solemnised in the USA in ac c ordanc e with Hindu rites rec ognised by the HMA, it was later registered in the USA. The c ourt held that the HMA applied. 

34     Mr Bimlesh and Mr Shri appeared to be arguing at c ross purposes. Mr Bimlesh’s point was that the first Hindu marriage was the first valid marriage under loc al Indian law: as he had no spec ific c ase on point, he used a sc enario where the other marriage had been one under foreign law. In _Narasimha Rao_ and _Shridiran_ , the HMA prevailed bec ause the Hindu rites were prior in time to the registration. The reasoning of the c ourts was that parties knew and c ontrac ted their marriage at the point of the first solemnisation, and to allow them to later alter that c ould lead to “c haos in applic ability of the 

laws”. [note: 5] Mr Shri’s point was that s 18 of the SMA deemed the marriage a marriage solemnised under the SMA and the deeming provision was c lear; however, he was unable to show any law whic h dealt with the interplay between the two loc al statutes. There was no provision in the SMA or Indian c ase law to state whether termination of a marriage first valid under the HMA and then registered under the SMA should be dealt with under the first domestic statute or the sec ond. 

35     The fac t that the issue of whether the SMA or the HMA was applic able garnered suc h a great divergenc e in opinion between both Mr Shri and Mr Bimlesh made c lear that this issue of the applic able statute is more appropriate for an Indian c ourt. It is a matter of interpretation of Indian domestic law. 

36     Related to this is the wife’s c onc ern about the enforc eability of a Singapore nullity dec ree in India. Both parties ac c epted that the Supreme Court of India in _Narasimha Rao_ stipulated that foreign matrimonial judgments would be rec ognised “ _only if the jurisdiction assumed by the foreign court as well as the grounds on which the relief is granted is in accordance with the matrimonial law under which the parties are married.”_ The three exc eptions to this rule did not apply: (i) where the ac tion is _filed_ where the _respondent_ is domic iled or habitually resides (this would have nec essitated filing in India), (ii) where the respondent submits to the jurisdic tion, or (iii) where the respondent c onsents to the relief. Mr Bimlesh’s point is that neither the jurisdic tional c lauses of the HMA nor the SMA allow the filing of any petition outside of India unless it was where the parties last resided together or 

where the respondent resides. [note: 6] While Mr Shri was sure the judgment of the Singapore c ourt c ould be enforc ed in India in line with _Narasimha Rao_ , this spec ific jurisdic tional point was not dealt 

with by Mr Shri. [note: 7] 

(2) A c omment on the parties’ assumption on governing law 

37     Parties did not make c lear the basis on whic h they c onc luded that Indian law governed the parties’ dispute. The husband did not attempt to argue that any other law was applic able. It c ould possibly have stemmed from a potential interpretation of _Narasimha Rao_ as the Supreme Court there referenc ed (see [36] above) the matrimonial law under whic h the parties are married. However, if the ac tion is not stayed, a Singapore c ourt dealing with the issue of applic able law would have to deal with the applic able law _as a matter of Singapore conflict of laws rules, as mandated by s 108 of the Women’s Charter, not as a matter of Indian enforcement rules._ 


38     In fac t, the rules to determine whic h law should govern applic ations for nullity of marriage on the grounds of inc apac ity or wilful refusal to c onsummate a marriage are not settled in Singapore. As for English authorities dealing with this issue, they have been desc ribed as being “undeveloped and unc lear” (see United Kingdom, The Law Commission and The Sc ottish Law Commission, _Private International Law Choice of Law Rules in Marriage_ (Law Com No 165 and Sc ot Law Com No 105, 1987) at para 2.4). 

39     In suc h c ases, the following laws may govern the dispute: 

 (a) the lex loci celebrationis ( ie , the law of the land where the marriage was c elebrated); 

 (b) the lex fori ( ie , the law of the forum); or 

 (c ) the lex domicilii ( ie , the law of the domic ile). 

 I deal with the various alternatives in turn. 

4       0 _Lex loci celebrationis._ The parties appeared to assume Indian law governed for this reason. However, while the English dec ision of _Robert (otherwise de la Mare) v Robert_ [1947] P 164 is often c ited for the proposition that the _lex loci celebrationis_ is the governing law for nullity proc eedings, the reasoning in that c ase has been c ritic ised on many grounds (see, for example, David Mc Clean, _Morris: The Conflict of Laws_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2000) at pp 205–206). Subsequent English dec isions dealing with inc apac ity or wilful refusal to c onsummate a marriage have either ignored or expressly rejec ted the _lex loci celebrationis_ as the governing law save for formal defec ts (see _Way v Way_ [1950] P 71; _Ponticelli v Ponticelli (orse Giglio) (by her guardian)_ [1958] P 204 (“ _Ponticelli_ ”)). 

4       1 _A common lex for dual causes of nullity, whether fori or domicilii._ Inc apac ity is often regarded as going towards the essential or substantive validity of a marriage; wilful refusal is often seen as a postnuptial defec t, more akin to a ground of divorc e. Could it be argued that the _lex domicilii_ should be applic able for c ases of inc apac ity while the _lex fori_ , the c hoic e of law for divorc e proc eedings, should be applic able for c ases of wilful refusal to c onsummate? In _Ponticelli_ , Sac hs J, following the judgment of Denning LJ in _Ramsay-Fairfax (orse Scott-Gibson) v Ramsay-Fairfax_ [1956] P 115 that esc hewed any suc h distinc tion, pointed out that both were grounds of nullity, whether the want of c onsummation is due to inc apac ity or to wilful refusal. This was also rejec ted in United Kingdom, The Law Commission and the Sc ottish Law Commission, _Private International Law Choice of Law Rules in Marriage_ (Working Paper No 89 and Consultative Memorandum No 64, 1985) at para 5.30, where it was reasoned that the grounds of wilful refusal and impotenc e were frequently pleaded in the alternative, and it would be undesirable and inc onvenient if different rules were to apply. 

4       2 _Lex fori._ While the applic ation of the _lex fori_ is widely ac c epted in the c ase of divorc e proc eedings, c ases have generally preserved a distinc tion between nullity and divorc e, preferring not to apply it for nullity bec ause of the possibility of arbitrary and inc onsistent results. In _Ponticelli_ , Sac hs J opined that it would be “unfortunate indeed if a marriage were to be held valid or invalid ac c ording to whic h c ountry’s c ourts adjudic ated on the issue” (at 215). 

4       3 _Lex domicilii._ In the present c ase, parties are domic iled in different jurisdic tions. In earlier English dec isions suc h as _Ponticelli_ , the c ourts have proc eeded on the basis that the law of the husband’s domic ile should prevail. However, a married woman is now c apable of ac quiring a separate domic ile: see s 47(1) of the Women’s Charter. James Fawc ett & Janeen M Carruthers, _Cheshire, North & Fawcett Private International Law_ (Oxford University Press, 14th Ed, 2008) (“ _Cheshire, North &_ 


_Fawcett_ ”) c ommented (at pp 981–982) that _Ponticelli_ must be viewed in the c ontext of the legal framework subsisting at that point in time, where a wife c ould not ac quire a separate domic ile from her husband. The learned authors also proffered a view (at p 982) that the law of the domic ile of the spouse who is alleged to have wilfully refused or was inc apable of c onsummating the marriage is the most appropriate c hoic e of law rule. 

44     Certainly in a c ase suc h as the present, where the wife is an Indian c itizen domic iled in India who married in India under Indian law, the rec ommendation in _Cheshire, North & Fawcett_ would seem more just. Apart from her short stay in Singapore prior to the parties’ reloc ation to the US, she has no c onnec tion with Singapore. It would not seem fair to judge a party on suc h personal issues with referenc e to a foreign law whic h he or she has limited c onnec tion with. In the dec ision of _Ross Smith v Ross Smith_ [1963] AC 280, Lord Reid, in dec lining jurisdic tion as the husband was resident outside England, c ited a similar c onc ern (at 306): 

 ... Suppose a c ase where the law of the parties’ domic ile gives no relief on this ground. It seems to me quite c ontrary to princ iple that the wife should be able to c ome here and seek relief on that ground. ... 

45     In the absenc e of proper argument by the parties, it was not nec essary or proper for me to arrive at a final c onc lusion on this issue. I make this c omment on the governing law here for c ompleteness, as _it would be an issue to be decided by the Singapore court if the action is not stayed_. 

_Summation on the first stage of the Spiliada test_ 

46     Having looked at the matrix of c onnec ting fac tors, India is, in my judgment, a c learly and distinc tly more appropriate forum than Singapore. There is, in addition to the points raised above, a c lose fac tual c onnec tion between the wife’s divorc e suit in India and the husband’s nullity suit in Singapore. As a prac tic al matter, it would be best for a single forum to deal with all the issues. The first issue would be the governing law of the parties’ dispute (whic h is not settled if heard in Singapore), and if that were Indian law, whether the HMA or the SMA applied (an issue of domestic statutory interpretation more appropriately dealt with by the Indian c ourt). The question whic h followed c losely was whether, under the HMA or SMA, there was legal remedy for the three possible sc enarios alleged: the wife’s inc apac ity, her wilful refusal to c onsummate, or, the marriage being c onsummated, whether the petition of divorc e on the ground of c ruelty was merited, again a c ontext appropriate for an Indian c ourt. What would then be needed would be a spec ific fac tual finding as to whic h sc enario was applic able, whether a ground for divorc e or nullity was made out. Having then drawn the marriage to a c lose one way or another, that c ourt c ould dec ide if maintenanc e or any other anc illary relief was in order and if so, what quantum should be set. An Indian c ourt would be best plac ed to dec ide the quantum in this c ase. 

**_Is there any special reason to nevertheless refuse a stay?_** 

47     On the sec ond stage of the test, the husband bore the legal burden of establishing the existenc e of spec ial c irc umstanc es by reason of whic h justic e requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused. The husband relied on two points: 

 (a) exc essive delay in the resolution of litigation proc eedings in India, partic ularly matrimonial proc eedings; and 

 (b) substantial disadvantage to the husband in India due to a “hostile legal environment” 


 c reated by the wife there. 

_Excessive delay_ 

48     The husband c ontended that the resolution of the present dispute in India will likely involve grave delays and protrac ted proc eedings. This would greatly prejudic e and impede a speedy trial. The husband relied on the opinion of Mr Shri that a realistic timeframe for the resolution of the present dispute would be between _five_ to _seven_ years, taking into ac c ount the time required for any potential appeal by either party. In support of this estimate, Mr Shri referred to a number of materials, suc h as newspaper artic les and c ase authorities disc ussing the purported c hronic bac klog of the Indian judic iary. 

49     The husband’s arguments were not persuasive. Mr Shri c ited a number of c ase authorities whic h 

were reported more than ten years ago. [note: 8] These inc lude the dec isions of _Smt Guru Bachan Kaur v Preetam Singh_ [1998] 1 AWC 275, _R N Engineers v K H Desai_ [2003] 2 Bom CR 833 and _K A Abdul Jaleel v T A Shahida_ (2003) 4 SCC 166. These c ases are of limited utility for the purpose of asc ertaining the exac t situation in the Indian c ourts _today_. Furthermore, Mr Shri has also c ited a number of _specific_ c ases where an appellate c ourt had berated the lower c ourt for allowing a 

matrimonial dispute to drag on unnec essarily. [note: 9] For instanc e, Mr Shri has c ited the Indian Supreme Court dec ision of _Bhuwan Mohan Singh v Meena & Ors_ [2014] INSC 365, where it was observed that it was “unfortunate that the c ase c ontinued for nine years before the Family Court”. Suc h referenc es to _specific_ c ases where there existed an inordinate delay is not suffic ient to establish that there is a _systemic_ delay ac ross _all_ c ases in the Indian c ourts. In fac t, the strong disapproval of the appellate c ourts with regard to the delay that had ensued in those spec ific c ases suggests that those c ases may very well be the exc eption rather than the norm. Mr Bimlesh also 

highlighted the option of using spec ial Fast Trac k Courts in his affidavit of 29 September 2014. [note: 10] 

50     Looking at the evidenc e as a whole, I am not satisfied that the present dispute will nec essarily be plagued by delays if it were to be tried in India. Nor would delay be nec essarily a suffic ient reason. In _Mala Shukla v Jayant Amritanand Shukla (Danialle An, co-respondent)_ <span class="citation">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 920</span> (“ _Mala v Jayant_ ”), for example, the petitioner wife had raised a similar argument that the proc eedings in Singapore would be heard faster than in India. Woo Bih Li JC (as he then was) explained (at [60]) that the fac t that proc eedings may be dealt with more slowly in another jurisdic tion than in Singapore is not, in itself, a suffic ient basis for a stay to be avoided: 

 I note that the proc eedings in India in respec t of Jayant’s appeal to the Delhi High Court and for spec ial leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of India have not been unduly slow. Even if, for the sake of argument, divorc e proc eedings will be dealt with more slowly than in Singapore, this is not sufficient for me to avoid a stay. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

_Other pending actions in India_ 

51     The husband c ontended that the wife had initiated a number of proc eedings in India against the husband, inc luding an applic ation for maintenanc e, a c omplaint for dowry harassment and an allegation of domestic violenc e. This c ast him in a negative light before the Indian c ourts. 

52     Of relevanc e was the husband’s fear of arrest upon arrival in India. While both parties do not 


dispute the fac t that an arrest warrant has been issued against the husband, Mr Bimlesh has, in his opinion dated 5 Dec ember 2013, explained that there exists an avenue for the husband to apply for 

antic ipatory bail pursuant to s 438 of the Code of Criminal Proc edure (Ac t No 2 of 1974) (India). [note: 11] In effec t, an ac c used is allowed to seek bail in antic ipation of being named or ac c used of having 

c ommitted a nonbailable offenc e. In the event that the c ourt is satisfied that there exists suffic ient grounds for the grant of antic ipatory bail, suc h an order c an be issued _prior_ to the ac c used being taken into c ustody. Mr Bimlesh further explained that an applic ation for antic ipatory bail c ould be made either by the ac c used himself or through his lawyer. In a further legal opinion provided by way of an affidavit dated 29 September 2014, Mr Bimlesh elaborated that while the presenc e of the ac c used is not required in an applic ation for antic ipatory bail, the ac c used will be under an obligation to be present at the time of the final hearing in the event that the c ourt c onsiders suc h presenc e to 

be nec essary in the interests of justic e. [note: 12] While Mr Shri in his affidavit filed on 1 Oc tober 2014 stated that Mr Bimlesh has “underplayed the severity of the c onsequenc es” and that it was “highly 

unlikely” that the husband will be granted antic ipatory bail, [note: 13] the fac t remains that he has not disputed the availability of the remedy, and that the husband has not attempted to obtain it. 

53     Thus the husband’s argument that the wife intentionally put him in a bad light before the Indian c ourts rings hollow. Although the evidenc e suggests that he has avenues to defend himself before those c ourts, the husband has not taken any ac tion. Indeed, the evidenc e suggests that he does not have _any intention_ to take any ac tion. At the same time, he has not produc ed any evidenc e to suggest that if he were to defend those proc eedings, he would not be entitled to a fair trial before the Indian c ourts. If there is any negative impression of the husband on the part of the Indian c ourts, it would most likely be attributable to his c omplete disregard for the Indian c ourts. 

54     I would mention that the husband has, on multiple oc c asions, referred to the wife’s c omplaints as being “baseless” and “financ ially motivated”. These are broad assertions, for whic h the c ourt has no evidenc e from whic h to draw any c onc lusion that the legal proc eedings c ommenc ed by the wife are, as suggested by him, wholly devoid of any merit. Indeed, on the issue of maintenanc e, there was no evidenc e that the husband offered the wife any maintenanc e after she left the USA. Thus the wife’s c ounsel’s argument that the wife was merely ac ting within her rights under Indian law is a logic al one. 

_Summation on the second stage of the Spiliada test_ 

55     Courts, being tasked with ac c ess to justic e, are c onc erned to ac t in ac c ordanc e with fair rules, and yet, at the same time, to ensure equitable outc omes for eac h individual c ase. The twostage _Spiliada_ test well illustrates this twofold objec tive of judic ial disc retion. In the first stage, the c ourt examines a c ase to find logic al rationale for its jurisdic tion. Having failed to do so, to ensure no injustic e, the c ourt, prior to sending a suit away, satisfies itself that there is no spec ial reason that ought to oblige it to hear the suit in order to do justic e between the parties. This marriage having broken down, the husband sought a swift resolution, but sought also to avoid the inc onvenienc e of a proper disentanglement of his obligations anc illary to marriage and its termination. Whilst the c ourt may have sympathy for the former, it ought not to exerc ise its disc retion to aid the latter. 

**Conclusion** 

56     For the reasons set out above, I dismissed the husband’s appeal against the Judge’s dec ision. 

57     Costs, after hearing c ounsel, were ordered in favour of the wife. The c osts of the appeal and the husband’s applic ation to adduc e further evidenc e (whic h c osts were earlier ordered by another 


High Court Judge to be in the c ause), were fixed at $5,000.
