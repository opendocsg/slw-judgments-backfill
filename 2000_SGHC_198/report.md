: This is a c ase in whic h the plaintiffs sued the three defendants under a letter of indemnity that the three had signed indemnifying the plaintiffs against all losses the plaintiffs may suffer as a result of issuing, at the request of the defendants, a performanc e bond for the sum of $383,222 to a c ompany known as Low Keng Huat (S) Ltd for the due performanc e by the third defendants (Hua Tong Marble Works Pte Ltd) of its obligation to Low Keng Huat (S) Ltd under a supply and installation c ontrac t that the third defendants had entered into with Low Keng Huat (S) Ltd. 

The first and sec ond defendants were direc tors of the third defendants. There was a third direc tor of the third defendants, one Lee Chee Sit; although provision was made in the letter of indemnity for a third direc tor to sign, Lee Chee Sit had not signed the letter of indemnity. 

Low Keng Huat had c alled on the performanc e bond and the plaintiffs had paid $383,222 under the bond to Low Keng Huat. In this ac tion, the plaintiffs sought reimbursement of the said sum from the three defendants. Judgment in default of appearanc e was entered against the third defendants and, as the sec ond defendant (Poh Ah Beng) had been adjudic ated a bankrupt, the plaintiffs had filed proof of debt against him. The ac tion therefore proc eeded only in respec t of the first defendant (Quah Boon Hua). 

The first defendant raised a number of defenc es to the c laim. Amongst them was a c laim that he had been misled by the plaintiffs and by the sec ond defendant into believing that the doc ument he was signing was not a letter of indemnity but an applic ation, to be signed by the third defendants and all the direc tors of the third defendants, for the issue of a performanc e bond. Lengthy submissions and c opious authorities were c ited in support of the defenc es raised. I saw no merit in these defenc es save for the plea in para 8 of the defenc e that it was a c ondition prec edent to the signing of the letter of indemnity that all the direc tors of the third defendants would sign the said doc ument and that as Lee Chee Sit was not a signatory, the doc ument was ineffec tive as against the first defendant. 

The evidenc e before me was that the first defendant was a minority shareholder of the third defendants (holding only 4.5% of the shares) and that, although he was a direc tor, he was not involved in the day-to-day running of the third defendants. The first defendant told the c ourt that when the sec ond defendant asked him to sign the letter of indemnity (whic h at that time he was told 


was to apply for a performanc e bond), he was told by the sec ond defendant that all the direc tors of the third defendants would sign. The first defendant told the c ourt that he signed only bec ause he was told that all the three direc tors would sign. It was his evidenc e that as he was only a 4.9% shareholder, he would not have signed if he had known that the third direc tor of the c ompany was not going to sign. The letter of indemnity sent to the defendants by the plaintiffs for signature had provision for it to be signed by the third defendants and three direc tors. The letter of indemnity therefore ac c orded with what the sec ond defendant was alleged to have told the first defendant. 

As the sec ond defendant was not a witness in the proc eedings, the plaintiffs objec ted, on the grounds of hearsay, to the first defendant adduc ing evidenc e of what the sec ond defendant was alleged to have said to him. Suc h evidenc e would be hearsay and inadmissible if the purpose for adduc ing the evidenc e was to prove the truth of what was said. In this c ase, however, the first defendant was adduc ing the evidenc e not in order to prove its truth but to explain his frame of mind when he signed the doc ument. The evidenc e is admissible for suc h purpose. I ac c ept the evidenc e of the first defendant that the sec ond defendant in fac t made those representations to him. 

In this c ase, the plaintiffs would have been c ontent if two out of the three direc tors of the third defendants had signed the letter of indemnity. In a letter to the third defendants they had so informed the third defendants. The letter of indemnity sent by the plaintiffs to the third defendants, however, did not provide for the signatures of only two direc tors but had spec ific provision in it for the signatures of three direc tors. The plaintiffs were unable to give any satisfac tory explanation as to why they sent a letter of indemnity requiring the signature of three direc tors if they in fac t required the signatures of only two. 

The first defendant, although a direc tor, played no exec utive role in the running of the third defendants. He c ould not therefore be expec ted to know the c ontents of the letter from the plaintiffs. His evidenc e that he did not know its c ontent was c redible and I ac c epted it. The plaintiffs, in submitting a doc ument that required the signature of three direc tors of the third defendants, reinforc ed what the sec ond defendant had represented to the first defendant, namely, that all the direc tors of the third defendants would be signing the doc ument. 

In **Indian Bank v Raja Suria & Ors** <span class="citation">[1993] 2 SLR 497</span> , the letter of indemnity c ontemplated that seven direc tors of a c ompany were to sign the letter of indemnity but only six in fac t did so. It was held that the letter of indemnity was ineffec tive. In arriving at this dec ision, the Court of Appeal rec ognised that it was not a rule of law that where an instrument of guarantee was in the form or in terms that imply that it is to be exec uted by more than one guarantor who are to be jointly and severally liable, all must sign the instrument before any is bound. The c ruc ial test, as stated by the Court of Appeal, is: what was the intention of the parties? 

In this c ase, there were only three persons who were direc tors of the third defendants. The letter of indemnity sent to the first defendant for signature by the plaintiffs, on the fac e of it, made provision for all three direc tors of the third defendants to sign. By making suc h provision the plaintiffs were representing to the first defendant that the plaintiffs required all three direc tors of the third defendants to sign the letter of indemnity. I ac c ept the evidenc e of the first defendant and find that the first defendant, in signing that doc ument, did so under the impression that all three direc tors of the third defendants were expec ted to and would sign the doc ument. I ac c ept the first defendant`s evidenc e that as a minority shareholder he would not have signed unless all the direc tors were signing. 

As, c ontrary to the intention of the parties, the letter of indemnity was signed by only two direc tors, that indemnity, following the princ iple in the **_Indian Bank_** c ase, would have no legal effec t as against 


the first defendant. The plaintiffs` c laim against the first defendant is therefore dismissed with c osts. 

## Outcome: 

Plaintiffs` c laim dismissed.
