**Introduction** 

1       This is a dispute between the plaintiff, Pang Swee Kang (“the Husband”), and the first defendant, Foreen Low Chui Ying (“the Wife”), over 54,000 shares in the sec ond defendant, Animal Prac tic e Pte Ltd (“the Company”). The Company was inc orporated on 27 Marc h 2006, with a share c apital of S$90,000 put up by the Wife’s mother, Mdm Lau Bee Eng (“Mdm Lau”). 

2       After some adjustment, I am told, the Wife held 54,000 shares (60%) and Mdm Lau held 36, shares (40%) in the Company. It was not disputed that both the Husband and the Wife did not c ontribute to the initial c apital of the Company. The Husband c laimed that the 54,000 shares held by the Wife belonged to him and the Wife c laimed otherwise. 

3       This c ase started as an Originating Summons where the Husband sought a c ourt dec laration that the transfer of shares from the Husband to the Wife on 28 July 2008 be dec lared null and void and a c ourt order for the Company to rec tify its share register to reflec t the Husband as the holder of 54,000 shares in the Company. The Originating Summons was ordered to be c onverted to a writ ac tion and the affidavits filed by the Husband and the Wife were ordered to stand as pleadings. 

4       The parties had already obtained an interim judgment for divorc e by the time of the hearing before me. However, the anc illaries had not yet been dealt with as the parties were awaiting the outc ome of these proc eedings. I gave oral judgment with brief grounds on 27 July 2011. The Husband, being dissatisfied with my dec ision, filed an appeal on 23 August 2011 and I now give my full grounds of dec ision. 

**Issues** 

5       At trial, the parties agreed that the issues before me were: 

 (a) whether the signature alleged to be that of the Husband on the share transfer doc ument dated 28 July 2008 was genuine or whether it was a forgery; and 


 (b) if the signature was a forgery, then a dec laration was sought that that doc ument was null and void and the Husband seeks a dec laration that he was still the owner of the 54,000 shares in the Company. 

6       Counsel on both sides were initially of the view that the c ase c ould be dec ided on the evidenc e of the handwriting experts only. Consequently, the doc umentary and affidavit evidenc e of the Husband and the Wife and their c ross-examination at the first tranc he of the trial was, with respec t, very c ursory. Many questions relating to the fac ts in my mind were left unanswered. 

7       Having reflec ted on the matter, I c onsequently c alled c ounsel bac k and gave eac h of them a list of the queries I had for eac h of their c ases, as well as a list of queries I had for the other side. I also asked for more doc umentation, suc h as the Company’s c orporate registers and rec ords. As a result, there was a sec ond tranc he of trial where more fac ts and doc uments were put forward and further c ross-examination was c onduc ted. 

**The Husband’s Case** 

8       The Husband c laimed that he owned 54,000 shares in the Company and that the Wife, as the c ompany sec retary, had forged his signature and surreptitiously transferred the 54,000 shares to herself. The Husband c laimed that the Wife c ould do that bec ause he had left the running of the Company to her. The Husband’s pleadings rather artfully implied, but did not explic itly say, that he was behind the setting up of the Company. The Husband rec ited that whilst he only had a sec ondary sc hool educ ation, his strength was in the veterinary business in whic h he was involved for many years. By c ontrast, the Wife, who was a university graduate with a Masters Degree, had no prior experienc e in this kind of business. 

9       In his Counsel’s Opening, the Husband alleged that the Company was set up by him after borrowing $90,000 from Mdm Lau on the c ondition that Mdm Lau would hold 60% of the shares in the Company until the loan was fully repaid whereupon she would transfer her interest in the 60% of the shares to him, making him the majority shareholder. Thereafter, Mdm Lau would remain as the minority shareholder by taking over the shares of her daughter, the Wife, who held the remaining 40% of the shares. I pause to note that this does not square with the Plaintiff’s Affidavit filed on 19 August 2009, (whic h was ordered to stand as his pleading), where at paragraphs 3 and 5 the Husband deposes that Mdm Lau held 40% of the shares and the Wife held 60% of the shares. 

10     The Husband further alleged that he had already repaid Mdm Lau the S$90,000 he borrowed, and she had transferred to him her 60% stake, making him the majority shareholder of the Company. This was evidenc ed by him being paid dividends, whic h exc eeded S$90,000, as the majority shareholder. In or around June 2009, he disc overed that the Wife had unilaterally and without his knowledge transferred his 60% shareholding to herself and bac kdated the transfer to 28 July 2008. The Husband then lodged a polic e report. 

**The Wife’s Case** 

11     The Wife c laimed that the Company was inc orporated on 27 Marc h 2006 by Mdm Lau, with an initial c apital c ontribution of S$90,000. The Wife was allotted 63,000 shares (70% of the share c apital) and Mdm Lau was allotted the remaining 27,000 shares (30%). Shortly thereafter, the Wife took steps to run the Company and she managed the Company with the assistanc e of paid employees. At the time of inc orporation, the Husband was running a Dog Breeding Farm and he helped out at the Company on an _ad hoc_ basis. The Husband was paid for that help and was given free or disc ounted veterinary treatment for the animals from the Dog Breeding Farm. Unfortunately, the 


Husband c eased operating the Dog Breeding Farm in April 2007 and was unemployed with no future plans for his c areer path. 

12     The Wife then suggested that the Husband join her in the Company. The Husband agreed and was paid a monthly salary like the other employees. However, onc e the Husband started working at the Company, work related disagreements started to oc c ur between them and that exac erbated the existing marital problems between them. The Wife began to suffer from depression in early 2008 and harboured thoughts of suic ide. She then dec ided to transfer her shares in the Company to the Husband, on the c ondition that he was to transfer the shares bac k to her if she rec overed. This was bec ause she thought that, should she die or bec ome inc apac itated, then the Husband c ould c ontinue the business. Transferring her shares to Mdm Lau was not a viable option bec ause Mdm Lau did not know how to run a veterinary c linic and, in any c ase, Mdm Lau was gainfully employed at that time. 

13     The Wife then told the Husband of her intention and made it c lear that he was to hold her shares as her nominee and he was to transfer the shares bac k to her upon request. On that understanding, she transferred her shares in the Company to the Husband on 27 Marc h 2008. The Husband did not make any payment for the shares transferred to him. 

14     However, soon thereafter, as a result of their deteriorating marital relationship, the Wife asked the Husband to transfer the shares bac k to her. She prepared the transfer doc ument and the Husband signed the doc ument voluntarily on 28 July 2008. However, the Wife did not register the transfer doc ument with the Ac c ounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) until 18 February 

2009\. The Wife c laimed that this was bec ause, in the interim period, she was still unwell and suffering from bouts of depression; and she did not c onsult a psyc hiatrist until 13 August 2008 and she was only presc ribed the nec essary medic ation then. It was only when she felt better in February 2009 that she registered the transfer with ACRA elec tronic ally. 

15     The Wife also c laimed that, in order to effec t the share transfer with ACRA elec tronic ally, she required the Husband’s ‘Singpass’ password. The Husband had voluntarily given to her his password in order for her to transfer his shares bac k to her elec tronic ally. 

**Findings of Fact** 

16     Having heard the Husband and the Wife and c onsidered the evidenc e, I made the following findings of fac t: 

 (a) The Husband only had a primary educ ation and dropped out of sc hool at an early stage around 1988; he said he did so bec ause his family lac ked the means to pay his sc hool fees and he wanted to earn money whic h he c ould also use to help out his family. He proc eeded to do oddjobs: as a c onstruc tion worker, a farmer, working in a ‘kelong’, selling vegetables in a market, and some work related to assisting vets in their c linic s and dog handling. He started Pets Man in Lor Halus around 1997 and sold puppies, did pet grooming and managed to house abandoned dogs. He alluded to being misunderstood by SPCA and to some apparently adverse newspaper report. His business venture failed after a few months. In 2002, he ventured into importing Smoke Pet Treats but this failed when the imports deteriorated due to our high temperatures and humidity. He also worked at Animal Rec overy Centre, Simei East Branc h, (“ARC”), 4 days a week and spent the other 3 days pursuing his pet grooming and pet transport ventures. The Husband met the Wife around 2001 when he was working for ARC and doing his own pet grooming and transport. 

 (b) Around 2004, he started a Dog Breeding Farm under Pets Culture, whic h was a sole proprietorship registered in or around February 2002 under the Wife’s name. I ac c epted the Wife’s 


evidenc e that her name was used in this sole proprietorship bec ause the Husband was in debt at that time. I also ac c epted the evidenc e of the Wife that the Dog Breeding Farm was not doing well. It needed c apital to c ontinue and there were diffic ulties in relation to raising this money. The Husband c laimed otherwise but he had not submitted any evidenc e to substantiate his c laims, _viz_ , that it was profitable, he managed to pay off his loans and that he sold it for the “highest pric e ever” (a rec ord pric e) of S$48,000. The Husband c laimed that the Company was his projec t and it was his efforts that brought it into existenc e; yet I find it telling that none of the alleged money he made was available for the Company; a type of business that the Husband said was his dream of some 20 years’ standing. 

(c ) The Company was inc orporated on 27 Marc h 2006 with funds from Mdm Lau, the Wife’s mother. Subjec t to my findings below, on the premise of the c ase presented before me by both parties, (where the 70:30 shareholding bec ame a 60:40 shareholding, without explaining how or when that happened), the Wife held, (or was, and I make no c onc lusive finding on this for the reasons set out below, at least benefic ially entitled to), 60% of the shares (54,000) and Mdm Lau held (or was, and I also make no c onc lusive finding on this, at least benefic ially entitled) to the other 40% (36,000). It was not disputed that the Husband did not direc tly c ontribute to the share c apital. The Company started off with a vet, one Dr Tharm Sook Keng (“Dr Tharm”) 

(d) From the evidenc e, the Wife obviously loved the Husband very muc h and wanted to help provide an alternative for him in the likely event the Dog Breeding Farm failed. There was evidenc e of problems in that business between the Husband and the other princ ipals in the Dog Breeding Farm. The Husband also had problems with Mdm Lau but the Wife prevailed over both of them to start the Company. The Dog Breeding Farm c eased operating in April 2007. I find as a fac t that it did not c ease bec ause the Husband wanted to c onc entrate on the Company, but bec ause of other problems, suc h as financ ial and viability issues. 

(e) The Husband had originally tried to get funding from other sourc es, but it was obvious that none of these materialized. The evidenc e showed that he had no funds to invest in suc h a venture. It was the Wife who had to persuade the Husband to use the money offered by Mdm Lau to assist them in their start-up. I find that there was an agreement to pay bac k Mdm Lau her investment. Pursuant to this agreement, Mdm Lau rec eived various sums between November 2006 and early June 2007 amounting to about S$80,000; and another S$55,000 on 15 January 2008. At the time of inc orporation, I find that the Husband treated the Company as the Wife’s business. As he still had his Dog Breeding Farm, he only helped out at the Company when he c ould, and was paid for those servic es. 

(f ) I also ac c ept that it was the Husband who wanted to set up the Company. However, the Husband was not a qualified vet and c ould not enrol in a university to study to bec ome a vet. A vet c linic required a qualified vet and had to be lic ensed by the AgriFood & Veterinary Authority of Singapore. It is telling that in all the years before the Company was set up, the Husband had never set up or attempted to set up a vet c linic. Instead in 2004, the Husband ac quired a Dog Breeding Farm with others. The Wife was not unfamiliar with the business of pets and running a pet shop. I ac c ept her evidenc e that she had previously helped one Mr Wee Pan Lee set up his pet shop “Wags to Whiskers”. I find that in addition to not having any c apital, the Husband was inc apable of putting in plac e the administrative, regulatory and logistic al work nec essary to start and set the Company up. On the other hand, I find that the Wife was c apable, as she had the nec essary qualific ations, experienc e and resourc es. 

(g) The evidenc e showed that the Wife took proac tive steps by getting her mother to provide the funds for the Company. Further, she bore the burden of persuading the Husband to ac c ept 


that arrangement even though she felt that the Husband was distanc ing himself from her. She c hose to undertake all that was nec essary to set up the Company despite the detrimental effec t it had on her marriage. I find that the Wife did this whilst harbouring the hope that things would improve between them – if the Company was suc c essful, the Husband would have more selfrespec t and they would not quarrel so muc h over financ ial matters. 

(h) Unfortunately, well before Marc h 2006, there were already some deep seated problems between the Husband and the Wife. There is evidenc e of this as early as February 2004. On 13 February 2004, the Wife wrote: 

 ... Furthermore treats you better, take c are of you, manage and maintain the household better, and help you out with your work. 

 ... If you c an hang out that long with the previous 2, [referring to the previous 2 women in the Husband’s life] even if I started to inherit some of their life’s value, [referring to the first woman as pestering, ill-mannered and foul mouthed, not having c hildren for the Husband to maintain or being high maintenanc e and spendthrift referring to the sec ond] I rec kon you c an bear with me as were the amount of time you c ould with them. Its more than enough for me. 

 I had lived with other people. Even they had maids and servants serving them all their life till they had to take c are of themselves, they had better self-respec t and respec t for me (their temporary house keeper). 

 Me? Your wife... do more, earn less, get sc rewed, get into more shit, more errands, give more love, more time, more effort, greater c are, put in money... yet treated worse off than these people’s maid/housekeeper. 

(i) I find that this state of affairs did not improve as the years moved on. It only got worse with the starting of the Company and the c losure of the Dog Breeding Farm. 

(j) Returning to the Company, I find that at the beginning stages, bec ause the Husband was still involved in his Dog Breeding Farm, and bec ause there was some resentment on his part that Mdm Lau had financ ed it, it was the Wife and Dr Tharm who ran the Company. At a later stage, between September 2006 and July 2007, one Dr Blair joined them. The Husband normally turned up at the Company in the late afternoon or evenings. 

(k) It was also c lear from the evidenc e, and I so find, that Mdm Lau wanted the shares to be in the Wife’s name so that the Wife would have something to fall bac k on when Mdm Lau passed on. Mdm Lau also harboured the hope that with this arrangement the Husband would treat the Wife with more respec t and not bully her. I do not find, as c ontended by the Husband, that there was any agreement between them for Mdm Lau to put up the money for the Company, to be repaid the “loan” as and when the Company made money and then to transfer the business and shares to the Husband. There was evidenc e, whic h I ac c ept, that the Wife holding the shares 

with her mother in the Company was an issue [note: 1] whic h was artic ulated in a letter whic h I 

find was written by the Wife sometime in Marc h or April 2008 [note: 2] : 

 Feel that the share distribution is not fair for you? 

 My mum say to put the share under my name? 

 Afraid that if c linic did well, you don’t get what you deserve? Or I will snatc h it away from 


 you? (if anyone also has the possibility of doing this, you’d prefer benefitting outsider?) 

 ... 

 Afraid you got no time? (but in the first plac e, u offer the 10% to Kevin c oz of lac k of fund and also so that he c ould help u tend to the farm while you set up the c linic. You ask me to manage after you set it up c oz you afraid you got no time and lousy with administrative stuff. I know you busy, so I also help set up. You should have more time than you should be having if you set it up alone now with extra help. 

 ... 

 You simply c annot swallow your pride for getting a loan from mother-in-law? 

 Cannot swallow your pride for what my mum says? 

(l) I find that the Wife worked very hard to make the Company suc c eed. I find that in the formative period, the Husband did make some c ontributions, like giving ideas, assisting in getting some information relating to pets, medic ine, c linic equipment, and viewing premises and equipment with the Wife. But it was c hiefly the Wife’s work that set up the Company, by getting in supplies and getting the operations running with Dr Tharm. As noted above, the Wife wanted to set up this business so that if the Husband’s Dog Breeding Farm folded up, he would have something else to do. I find, c ontrary to the Husband’s c ontention, that there was no agreement for the Husband to own any shares in the Company bec ause Mdm Lau was the sole person providing the funds and she would not have agreed to plac ing any shares in the Husband’s name. As for the Wife, I find that she was neutral at best, as it did not matter if whether or not the Company made money – she treated her money as c ommon property belonging to herself and the Husband anyway. The Wife must have felt that she would eventually be able to let the Husband have some shares in the Company onc e Mdm Lau was no longer around; or perhaps at some later stage when Mdm Lau c ould be persuaded otherwise. 

(m) I find that the Husband also c ontributed to the Company but to a muc h lesser extent onc e it was set up and running. He seemed muc h more interested in his pet grooming and pet transportation work. The Wife ran the Company with the vets working there. The main inc ome of the Company c ame from veterinary work, and the Company had always hired qualified and duly registered vets. The Husband would not be in a position to do this work. I do not find that the vets hired by the Company c arried out their veterinary work under the supervision and c ontrol of the Husband. On the c ontrary, there was evidenc e whic h I am sure will surfac e in the Family Court, that the Husband was disruptive: there is evidenc e that the vets in the Company resented his interferenc e with their work; and that the Husband often abused his position (by virtue of his relationship with the Wife) in the Company, sometimes resulting in losses to the Company. 

(n) Having heard the Husband and the Wife’s evidenc e, and having observed their respec tive demeanour during c ross-examination, I preferred the evidenc e of the Wife. I did so bec ause the Husband’s evidenc e and c laims did not square with the fac ts. He also c ontradic ted himself at times. For example, he filed a polic e report stating that his ‘Singpass’ was kept by the Wife; yet in his Affidavit filed on 13 Oc tober 2009 he said that the Wife had obtained his ‘Singpass’ by stealing a look at it from a booklet in the drawer where all their passwords were kept. I also find that the Husband’s view of himself and his abilities were inflated. He obviously had a problem sustaining a job or a business. He had no bank ac c ount and did not know anything about how a c ompany was run. Further, he merely tirelessly repeated that he was very knowledgeable about 


dogs and was apparently often referred to as a “walking enc yc lopedia” on dogs. Yet today, he was still c arrying on with his pet grooming and pet transportation and had made no headway in this area of his professed love and passion. His professed knowledge, c lose ties to the animal industry and to the vets in the Company (who presumably also c alled him the “walking enc yc lopedia” on dogs) had c ertainly not enabled him to set up any c linic. On the other hand, the Wife was still suc c essfully running the Company sinc e the Husband departed in June 2009 and I ac c epted the Wife’s evidenc e that the Company c ontinued to be profitable. 

(o) The Husband c losed down the Dog Breeding Farm in or around April 2007 and he did more “work” at the Company. Unfortunately, their relationship quic kly deteriorated with the Husband c oming into the Company. They had frequent quarrels and differenc es not only at home but also at the Company. I find that these problems, and the realization by the Wife that no matter what she did, she c ould not keep or even get any love from the Husband, drove her into depression in the beginning of 2008. Her random entries showed a tortured soul, with little self-worth and 

wanting to shut herself up. [note: 3] She resented the Husband for making dec isions and even dec isions to whic h she had strong objec tions to, and then asking her to put her name down and ac c ept the legal liability. I ac c epted her evidenc e that she harboured thoughts of suic ide. She said, and I ac c epted, that she attempted suic ide during her depression. One of the entries read: 

 It is good if after saying all these, the anger in you for me to be a permanent feeling. Please hate me and make it last forever. My enduranc e for pain might be strong ... but I am already psyc hologic ally sc rewed. Please do a kind deed and left [ sic ] me alone. Even if I were to die quietly, I will be ever grateful to you for letting me out of this living hell. ... I just want to finish up this last bit of work and I want to just be left alone ... to live, to die, to rest, to rot ... just leave me alone. [note: 4] 

(p) I find that during the Wife’s period of depression, thinking that she would die or bec ome inc apac itated, she transferred her 60% shareholding in the Company to the Husband sometime in or about Marc h 2008. There was no evidenc e as to how this transfer was c arried out, whether it was by the usual Share Transfer From or a signed resolution like the doc ument in question or whether it was just an elec tronic entry at ACRA. Indeed, the Share and Direc tor’s Registers in the Wife’s and the Company’s Supplementary Bundle of Doc uments were all blank and the rec ords were not updated. I find that despite her hurt and despair, the Wife’s love for the Husband still made her leave the business to him when she was no longer around. That was her final sac rific e and ac t of love before she left this world. It was not disputed that the Husband did not pay anything for the shares. Although the Husband c laimed that the loan was paid, I find that the money used to repay the loan c ame from either the profits of the Company (in whic h he held no shares) or the Wife’s ac c ount. The loan was not repaid with his own money. I note the Husband drew a salary from the Company and was reimbursed and paid for any “extra” work he did for the Company. The Wife was also paid a salary. 

(q) I find that the Wife was not of full mental c apac ity and sound mind and was suffering from Depressive Disorder with Panic Attac ks when she transferred her 60% shareholding to the Husband. I rejec t the Husband’s c laim that she voluntarily transferred the 60% shares to him pursuant to the agreement that when Mdm Lau’s loan was paid up, he would get these shares. The evidenc e showed that there was no suc h agreement. So long as Mdm Lau was around, the shares had to remain in the Wife’s and Mdm Lau’s names. 

(r) I also do not ac c ept the Wife’s c laim that there was an agreement between her and the Husband to the effec t that she would transfer her 60% shares in the Company to the Husband; and if she rec overed, the Husband had to re-transfer the shares bac k to her. At the time of the 


transfer the Wife did not think about rec overy as she was severely depressed and was not c apable of forming an agreement with the Husband. 

(s) The Wife sought psyc hiatric help sometime in August 2008. From August to Dec ember 2008, I find that the Wife only made marginal improvement. However, she began to get better with treatment thereafter. I find that when she rec overed suffic iently, whic h was in late Dec ember 2008 or early 2009, she c ould think more c learly. She realized what she had done in transferring her shares. At the same time, the staff started telling her what was going on whilst she stayed away from the Company due to her illness. She then ac c epted the fac t that she and the Husband were through as man and wife and that he had severely disrupted the running of the Company during the period of her illness. On top of that, the Husband was having an affair with a part-time nurse that worked at the Company. There is evidenc e and I ac c ept that the Company staff were on the Wife’s side and resented the Husband’s unreasonable interferenc e in the Company. 

(t) I also find that the c ontrol and management of the Company was, until the Wife bec ame ill and transferred the shares to the Husband, with the Wife. The Husband did not dec ide salary levels, espec ially the Wife’s salary, nor the bonuses or payments out to the staff or Mdm Lau. There was an allegation from the Wife that the Husband insisted on handing out the bonuses in “c ash” to the staff so that he c ould siphon off a portion of their bonus. This too was disc overed when she rec overed from her illness. When the Wife rec overed suffic iently in early 2009, she c ontinued to make the final dec isions as owner of the Company. 

(u) I ac c ept the Wife’s evidenc e that there was wrongdoing on the Husband’s part as far as the Company was c onc erned. I also ac c ept her evidenc e that what brought matters to a head and his termination was Mdm Lau and the Wife going to the Company one day and finding the Husband there with his mistress, in the c linic grooming her own c lient’s dog. As a result of an alterc ation between Mdm Lau, the Husband and his mistress, the polic e were c alled in. The Husband’s employment was terminated with immediate effec t. It is telling that the Husband never protested then and there that he was the owner and majority shareholder of the business and that Mdm Lau had no authority to fire him. 

(v) The preponderanc e of evidenc e was that the Husband interfered with the employees and vets at the Company. These persons (for instanc e, a vet named Dr Theo) did not like or ac c ept the Husband’s interferenc e. The Husband’s evidenc e did not answer many of these allegations. His demeanour on the stand and his answers to the questions put to him were not as satisfac tory when set against that of the Wife and the staff of the Company. In fac t, I find his first Affidavit dated 19 August 2009 in effec t, bland and misleading. Even at this stage, he had not answered the voluminous allegations of wrong doing that have been made against him. 

(w) I formed the impression that the Husband was the type of person who c ould not be bothered or did not bother with administrative details and paperwork. His low level of educ ation may have been a c ontributory fac tor but it is more bec ause of his nature and make-up. For the reasons set out below, I find that the signature on doc ument in dispute, the ‘Direc tor’s Meeting for Transfer of Shares’ dated 28 July 2008 was signed by him. I find that, on a balanc e, the Wife managed to get him to sign this doc ument; it would not have been diffic ult bec ause he was likely not to have bothered to read what he was signing. Neither, on his own evidenc e, did he bother to keep c opies. Insofar as it is nec essary, I find that this doc ument was signed sometime on or before 18 February 2009 and bac kdated to 28 July 2008. On his own evidenc e, everything was going fine until June 2009, when he disc overed the allegedly unilateral and unauthorized transfer of 54,000 shares to the Wife. There would have been no reason for him to have been suspic ious 


 of anything in February 2009. His bland affidavit on this issue also spoke for itself. 

**The “Forged” Signature and Expert Evidence** 

17     Eac h side put forward a handwriting expert. The Husband engaged Mr William Pang Chan Kok (“Mr Pang”) who opined that there was strong support for the proposition that the impugned signature was not that of the Husband. The Wife engaged Mr Yap Bei Sing (“Mr Yap”) of the Health Sc ienc es Authority (“HSA”) who c ame to the opposite c onc lusion as Mr Pang, _viz_ , that it was probable that the writer of the signatures in the spec imens “S1” to “S26” was the same as that in “Q” (the share transfer doc ument in question). 

18     The Husband alleged that the signature on the share transfer form was a forgery. Forgery of a doc ument said to effec t a transfer of shares was a very serious allegation and was akin to fraud. It was settled law that the burden of proof was on the Husband, and it was a high burden. 

19     Having heard and c onsidered the evidenc e, I preferred the expert evidenc e of Mr Yap over that of Mr Pang for the following reasons: 

 (a) Mr Pang’s report failed to c omply with Order 40A of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”). This was a very serious defec t. Although I allowed its c orrec tion by oral evidenc e-in-c hief, the damage was already done. At the time of forming his opinion and writing his report, the important requirements were not in his mind. 

 (b) The bulk of Mr Pang’s experienc e was in graphology. His apprentic eship in doc ument examination and forensic examination only c ommenc ed in 2004 and he rec eived his c ertific ation in 

2006\. In c ontrast, Mr Yap from HSA had about 20 years’ experienc e in forensic doc ument examination, and he had handled more than 3,900 c ases and had testified in c ourt on more than 70 oc c asions. His report also c omplied with Order 40A of the Rules. 

 (c ) Mr Yap had c arefully set out 27 signatures of the Husband against the impugned signature. He c onvinc ingly explained, and it was evident from the Comparison Chart, that the Husband’s signature had a large natural variation in many respec ts and in many different parts of his signature, viz , in the size, the slant and the formation and relative positioning of the strokes. The debate over the “2” figure exc eeding the height of the inverted “e” was settled in my mind when Mr Yap was able to refer me to some signatures, like S6, S4 and S25 where the same c ould be seen. Mr Pang also c onc eded that the spec imen signatures “exhibited a wide range of variation” and he c onsidered this normal. He also ac c epted that the signatures were pic torially similar, whic h he defined as “some level of pic torial resemblanc e that is observable and c annot be attributed to c oinc idenc e or c hanc e.” 

 (d) Mr Pang referred to c ertain details like the inverted “e” being elliptic al in shape in the impugned signature whereas the spec imen signatures resembled a “boat” struc ture. A look at Mr Yap’s Comparison Chart immediately revealed that Mr Pang’s relianc e was misplac ed. There were so many variations to the inverted “e”. Similar c omments on the details of the impugned signature when c hec ked against the Comparison Chart showed that his c onc lusion was not borne out by the spec imen signatures. The weakness of Mr Pang’s c onc lusion was that eac h feature he pointed out in the impugned signature was only c ompared against one other signature without referenc e to the many other sample signatures. 

**The Company records** 


20     During the c ourse of the evidenc e, I asked for the Company’s c orporate registers and rec ords. 

The c orporate sec retarial rec ords were produc ed in evidenc e. [note: 5] The rec ords showed that the Company was inc orporated on 26 Marc h 2006 with a share c apital of S$90,000 divided into 90, shares of S$1.00 eac h with Mdm Lau holding 27,000 ordinary shares (30%) and the Wife holding 

63,000 ordinary shares (70%). [note: 6] There was an unsigned Direc tor’s Resolution [note: 7] bearing the date of 6 August 2009 c onfirming the allotment of ‘subsc riber’ shares and that Share Certific ates 

Nos. 1 and 2 were issued with the c ompany seal affixed thereto [note: 8] but without signatures. 

21     There was a ‘Post AGM Memorandum’ dated 14 Dec ember 2008 rec ording a resolution of the direc tors, Mdm Lau and the Wife, bearing their signatures, to pay a dividend of A$50,000 in November 2008 and S$50,000 in Dec ember 2008 to themselves in the proportion of 40% and 60% respec tively. 

22     Other than the c ontested doc ument entitled “DIRECTOR’S MEETING FOR TRANSFER OF SHARES” 

dated 28 July 2008 [note: 9] , many other doc uments in the register were effec tively blank. The blank doc uments inc luded: 

 (a) the Register of Applic ation for and Allotment of Shares [note: 10] ; 

 (b) the Register of Transfers [note: 11] ; 

 (c ) the Register of Members [note: 12] ; and 

 (d) the Register of Direc tors’ Shareholdings and other interests [note: 13] ; 

23     Only the following forms were filled in: 

 (a) the partic ulars of Mdm Lau and the Wife as direc tors [note: 14] in the Register of Direc tors; 

 (b) the Form 45 c onsent to ac t as direc tor [note: 15] signed by the Wife and Mdm Lau; 

 (c ) the partic ulars of the Wife as c ompany sec retary [note: 16] in the Register of Sec retaries and a c onsent to ac t as sec retary signed by the Wife; 

 (d) the c ontested ‘share transfer’ doc ument [note: 17] ; 

 (e) an unsigned Direc tor’s Resolution pursuant to Artic le 90; and 

 (f) two post-AGM memoranda. 

**The applicable law** 

24     Artic le 20 of the Artic les of Assoc iation of the Company states [note: 18] : 

 Transfer of shares 

20\. Subjec t to these Regulations, any member may transfer all or any of his shares by instrument in writing in any usual of c ommon form or in any other form whic h the direc tors may approve. The instrument shall be exec uted by or on behalf of the transferor and the transferor shall remain the 


 holder of the shares transferred until the transfer is registered and the name of the transferee is entered in the register of members in respec t thereof. 

25     Artic le 20 stipulates two requirements for the valid transfer of shares. First, an instrument in writing in any usual or c ommon form, (there being no evidenc e of the third option), was to be exec uted by or on behalf of the transferor. Sec ond, the registration of shares and the entering the name of the transferee in the register of members. Both these requirements were not c omplied with. 

26     Sec tion 126(1) of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”) provided as follows: 

 Instrument of transfer 

126\. **—(1)** Notwithstanding anything in its artic les, _a company shall not register a transfer of shares_ or debenture _unless a proper instrument of transfer has been delivered to the company_ , but this subsec tion shall not prejudic e any power to register as a shareholder or debenture holder any person to whom the right to any share in or debentures of the c ompany has been transmitted by operation of law. 

[emphasis added in italic s] 

27     Although c ounsel for the Wife informed me that there was a subsequent adjustment of shares from the original 70:30 shareholding to the present 60:40 shareholding between Mdm Lau and the Wife, there were no transfer forms reflec ting this c hange. There was also no transfer form reflec ting the alleged transfer of shares from the Wife to the Husband. In both c ases, the transfer of shares was not effec ted on the register of members. 

28     In _Jamat bin Awang v Lai Wee Ngen_ <span class="citation">[1995] 3 SLR(R) 496</span> (“ _Jamat_ ”), the Court of Appeal held that shares were generally transferable in the manner provided by the c ompany’s artic les of assoc iation, subjec t only to s 126(1) CA whic h required a proper instrument of transfer exec uted by the person registered as the holder of the share in question. A transferee would not have the c apac ity to exec ute the instrument of transfer in favour of himself. The Court of Appeal in _Jamat_ also c ited with approval _Hawks v McArthur_ [1951] 1 All ER 22 for the proposition that to suc c essfully transfer legal title in a share, the transferees name must be entered into the register of members maintained by the c ompany. Both these requirements must be c omplied with, _viz_ , a valid instrument of transfer within the meaning of s 126(1) CA and c omplianc e with the artic les, whic h in this c ase required the entry of the transferee’s name into the register of members. See also Gower & P L Davies, _Principles of Modern Company Law_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2008) at p 939, para 27-5. 

29     However, for the purposes of this c ase, I make no findings on the benefic ial ownership of the shares. First, that was not a question before me; sec ondly, the evidenc e on this issue is inc omplete as Mdm Lau had not given any evidenc e; and thirdly, this is an issue that is more properly addressed by the Family Court dealing with the anc illaries and division of matrimonial property. Therefore, for the purposes of this c ase, I find that Mdm Lau held the legal title to 27,000 shares and the Wife held the legal title to 63,000 shares in the Company. This is so despite the Register of Members being blank, the unsigned Resolution upon inc orporation allotting the 27,000 shares to Mdm Lau and 63,000 shares to the Wife and the two Share Certific ates Nos. 1 and 2 with the c ompany seal affixed to eac h of those c ertific ates but without the signatures of two direc tors or a direc tor and the c ompany sec retary. It is c ommon ground that Mdm Lau put up the S$90,000 c apital in the Company. 

**Conclusion** 


30     I find that the alleged transfer of the 54,000 shares from the Wife to the Husband was null and void as the Wife was in a state of deep depression and was not c apable at that time to make a valid disposition. It was also made without any c onsideration. Lastly the alleged transfer did not c omply with s 126(1) CA and Artic le 20 of the Artic les of Assoc iation of the Company. I therefore find and hold that there was no valid transfer of the c ontested 54,000 shares from the Wife to the Husband in or around 27 Marc h 2008. 

31     Insofar as it is nec essary to do so, I find and hold that the Husband signed the doc ument entitled “Direc tor’s Meeting for Transfer of Shares” bearing the date 28 July 2008. This doc ument was signed around or before 18 Marc h 2009. On balanc e, I find and hold that the Husband signed this doc ument without reading it. Insofar as it purported to transfer any shares from the Husband to the Wife it was of no effec t as it was only a note of a vote for a resolution; it did not amount to an instrument of transfer within the meaning of s 126(1) CA and it does not c omply with Artic le 20 of the Artic les of Assoc iation of the Company for the transfer of shares. 

32     It followed that the Husband did not hold any shares in the Company and was therefore not entitled to an order for the rec tific ation of the share register. But that was not to say that the Husband had no “share” in the Company. I noted above (at [29]) that I make no findings as to the benefic ial ownership of the shares. However, it was c lear to me that the c ontested 54,000 shares in the Company was matrimonial property, whic h was ac quired by the c ouple during their marriage. Both the Husband and the Wife had put some effort and c ontribution into running the Company. What eac h party’s respec tive exac t share was in the c ontested 54,000 shares is for the Family Court hearing the anc illaries to determine after reading all the affidavits made for those proc eedings. From the evidenc e before me, it was c lear that the c ontributions from the Wife to this asset were more than that of the Husband. However what evidenc e is made available to the Family Court is another matter. It should also be borne in mind that Mdm Lau has worked at the Company sinc e she resigned from her previous job at OCBC as a result of the Husband’s c omplaints to her employer and besides c ontributing to the value of the Company from that date, Mdm Lau still holds the legal title to 27,000 shares in the Company. 

33     As a result of my findings above, I refused to grant the dec larations sought by the Husband and dismissed his ac tion. 

**Costs** 

34     Having heard the parties on c osts, I ordered 50% c osts to the Wife to be agreed or taxed, and no c osts to the Company.
