(delivering the grounds of judgment of the c ourt): 

**_Introduction_** 

This c ase involves a right of way. The two piec es of land c onc erned are situated in the East Coast and the c losest roads are Marine Parade Road, St Patric k`s Road, and Jalan Rendang. Originally, they were both part of a bigger plot of land bounded to the south by the sea (whic h has now been pushed bac k and replac ed by Marine Parade Road), to the east by Telok Kurau Road and to the north by St Patric k`s Road. At that time Jalan Rendang did not exist. 

The dominant tenement is known as Lot 5915X of Mukim 26 (formerly known as Lot 120-12) and it is now the site of a c ondominium c alled Grac ious Mansions. The servient tenement is the land known as Lot 98082L (formerly known as Lot 120-13). It is c urrently undeveloped. The right in issue is a right for the owners of Grac ious Mansions to have full and free right of way and passage over the servient tenement in order to have ac c ess to St Patric k`s Road. 

The named plaintiff is Frontfield Investment Holding (Pte) Ltd (`Frontfield`). Ac c ording to the desc ription in the ac tion, Frontfield sues on their own behalf and also under a power of attorney. Frontfield owns five equal undivided one-sixth shares in the servient tenement. The owner of the remaining one-sixth share is Madam Lee Seok Chee, the donor of the power of attorney. 

The first defendant in the ac tion is the Management Corporation Strata Title No 938, the management c orporation of Grac ious Mansions (`the MC`). The subsidiary proprietors of the strata title lots forming part of Grac ious Mansions are not parties to the ac tion. The sec ond, third and fourth defendants are the owners of adjac ent lots whic h had originally been given the same right of way as 


the owners of the dominant tenement. These defendants c onsented to having judgment entered against them and their purported right of way over the servient tenement was dec lared to have been extinguished pursuant to an order of c ourt dated 22 November 2000. The ac tion before me was, therefore, against the MC only. 

The relief sought by Frontfield is a dec laration that the right of way and passage and all other rights and easements appurtenant to the dominant tenement subsisting over the servient tenement have been extinguished. The grounds of the applic ation are: 

(1) that the right of way over the servient tenement has effec tively been abandoned and therefore should be extinguished by operation of law; 

(2) alternatively, there has been a partial abandonment of the right of way in that the right to have vehic ular ac c ess enjoyed by the dominant tenement has been abandoned, leaving only a right to use the servient tenement as a footway; 

(3) alternatively, the easement c an, and in this c ase should be, extinguished on the basis of a c hange of c irc umstanc es whic h has made the easement obsolete. 

**_Background facts_** 

Attac hed to this judgment as an appendix is a c opy of a c ertified government plan of the area in question whic h shows the respec tive positions of the dominant tenement (marked `C` in the plan) and the servient tenement (marked `B`). The map also shows the adjac ent lots. One of these, the one marked `A` on the map, was formerly known as Lot 120-8. It c ontains a pre-war bungalow known as 398 Telok Kurau Road and some other buildings. 

The servient tenement is a rec tangular parc el of land. It has an average width of about 11m and a length of about 90m. The servient tenement was approved by the government to be used as a road in November 1951. It is vac ant, grassy and unfenc ed exc ept for the portion fronting St Patric k`s Road. 

The parc el of land as it existed before the right of way was first established was some five ac res in area and was known as Lot 120 of Mukim 26. It was a rec tangular parc el then bounded by the sea towards the south, Telok Kurau Road towards the east, St Patric k`s Road towards the north and another plot of land towards the west. It was sold by Sir John Anderson to Ong Tiang Soon in July 1912. 

In 1950, an applic ation was made to c ourt in c onnec tion with the trusts of the will of Ong Tiang Soon, dec eased. Consequently permission was given for the sale of a portion of the original plot on the basis that the vendors would be allowed to retain a 36-foot wide right of way over the plot to be sold from either Telok Kurau Road or St Patric k`s Road. Various movements on the title took plac e thereafter and on 31 January 1952, the servient tenement, together with various other plots c arved out of the original parc el, was c onveyed to six members of the Lee Kong Chian family inc luding Lee Seok Chee as tenants-in-c ommon in equal one-sixth shares eac h. This c onveyanc e c ontained a provision reserving unto the vendors `full and free right of way and passage to their other land adjoining the land hereby c onveyed ... over the portion of land c oloured green and marked "Road Reserve 36[quot ] 0" wide" ...`. 

In the same year, approval for the subdivision of Lot 120 with the right of way on Lot 120-13 was given. Subsequently the area on whic h the right of way was loc ated was approved as a `Reserve for 


Road` in the Master Plan. 

In Oc tober 1953, there was a deed of partition between Lee Seok Chee and the other five Lees who were parties to the c onveyanc e of 31 January 1952. The purpose of this deed was to alloc ate the various lots purc hased in 1952 among the various family members. By this deed, inter alia, Lot 120(ie the dominant tenement) was c onveyed to Lee Seng Tee: 

 TOGETHER with full and free right of way and passage to the said land with horses carts carriages motor cars and other vehicles in common with all others entitled to a like right of way over the land coloured green and marked "Road Reserve 36[quot ] 0" wide" in the plan annexed to the Principal Indenture and now forming the whole of the land marked on the Government Resurvey Map as Lot 120-13 of Mukim XXVI and part of the land marked on the Government Resurvey Map as Lot 120-14 of Mukim XXVI ... 

At that time, the dominant tenement was loc ked in by various adjoining lots as well as the sea in the south. Jalan Rendang did not exist then and there was therefore no ac c ess to St Patric k`s Road from the dominant tenement. The purpose of the right of way over the servient tenement was thus to give the land-loc ked dominant tenement vehic ular ac c ess to St Patric k`s Road. 

The dominant tenement was subsequently c onveyed in Dec ember 1957, April 1961 and Dec ember 

1980\. Eac h c onveyanc e c ontained an express provision purporting to transfer the right of way over the servient tenement. In the meantime, in 1967, Jalan Rendang c ame into being as a public road. 

The main witness of fac t on the events of the past 50 years was one Mr M Edaris bin Hussin. In about 1957 when Mr Edaris was ten years old his father found work as a grounds-keeper at 398 Telok Kurau Road, ie the property marked `A` on the map whic h is adjac ent to both the dominant and servient tenements. Ac c ommodation was provided for the family at 398 Telok Kurau Road and Mr Edaris has lived there ever sinc e. After his father passed away, sometime in 1986, Mr Edaris took over the job of grounds-keeper for 398 Telok Kurau Road. His duties inc lude taking c are of the servient tenement. 

Mr Edaris testified that in the early 1960s the c ompound of 398 Telok Kurau Road inc luded the dominant tenement and therefore stretc hed all the way to what is now Jalan Rendang. There was no barrier between the two properties. Sometime in the 1970s, the dominant tenement was fenc ed up (thus preventing ac c ess to the servient tenement) but it remained as vac ant land until Grac ious Mansions was built in the 1980s. 

The dominant tenement was c onveyed to a c ompany c alled Penford Pte Ltd in Dec ember 1980. It was this c ompany that proc ured the c onstruc tion of Grac ious Mansions. This is a four-storey residential development c ontaining 16 strata-title maisonette units. The building fac es Jalan Rendang to the west and is fronted by a tarmac driveway while to the rear and eastern flank of the site is a turfed area. At the northern flank of the site are other site improvements whic h inc lude a swimming pool and three other small buildings whic h ac c ommodate the c hanging room, guardroom and bin c entre. There are c overed c ar parking lots available on part of the ground floor. 

The boundaries of the dominant tenement are demarc ated by c hain-linked fenc ing with two sets of wide-span metal grille gates for vehic ular/pedestrian ac c ess along Jalan Rendang. There is another gate at the southern flank of the site whic h allows pedestrian ac c ess to Marine Parade Road via a small bridge over a monsoon drain. There is also a gate along the c ommon boundary with the servient tenement. This last gate was only erec ted in 1997. Until then, ac c ording to Mr Edaris, there had been 


no gate or any opening leading from Grac ious Mansions onto the servient tenement. 

Mr Edaris said that, to the best of his memory, before the dominant tenement was fenc ed up in the 1970s, no one from the c ompound of that property and 398 Telok Kurau Road c ould gain ac c ess to St Patric k`s Road through the vac ant servient tenement. Neither was there any ac c ess from St Patric k`s Road to Jalan Rendang through the servient tenement. This was bec ause although there was and still is a gate in the fenc ing on the servient tenement fac ing St Patric k`s Road, this gate was usually kept loc ked. It was only opened on the oc c asions when the landowners` c ontrac tors went onto the land to mow the grass of the servient tenement. 

Between the c ompletion of Grac ious Mansions in the mid-1980s and 1997, no one living there c ould have ac c ess to St Patric k`s Road by moving through the servient tenement bec ause of the absenc e of a gate in the fenc ing around the dominant tenement. Even after the gate was c onstruc ted in 1997, ac c ess was restric ted bec ause the gate on the servient tenement fac ing St Patric k`s Road remained loc ked. The foregoing was part of the testimony of Mr Edaris. As far as he was c onc erned, the servient tenement was never used by anyone over all of the years that he lived at 398 Telok Kurau Road. The only persons he saw there were the landowners` grass-c utters. 

**_Preliminary issues_** 

There were two preliminary issues raised on behalf of the defenc e by Mr Harry Wee, c ounsel for the MC. The first one was that the owners of the servient tenement were not both before the c ourt. The only party named in the ac tion was Frontfield. Whilst it held a power of attorney from the other c oowner of the property, Madam Lee Seok Chee, that would have permitted it to do so, it had not made her a named party to the ac tion. In the title of the ac tion, Frontfield had inserted after its name the following words in parenthesis `ac ting on its own behalf and under a Power of Attorney No 7393/2000`. This, however, was insuffic ient to make Madam Lee a party to the ac tion. The objec tion was that all parties making the c laim had to be before the c ourt as otherwise a dec ision would not be binding on the absentee c laimant. 

In response to this point, Mr Shanmugam, c ounsel for Frontfield, gave an undertaking on behalf of Madam Lee (who was then in c ourt) that she would be bound by the dec ision in the c ase. He rec ognised that, tec hnic ally, she was not a party to the ac tion but submitted that her nonpartic ipation did not nullify the proc eedings as Frontfield had a suffic ient interest to prosec ute the same. In a c ase like this where the relief sought was a dec laration of the existenc e of a state of affairs, what was required for the matter to proc eed was that there had to be a real question to be dec ided between two parties on opposing sides who had an interest in the matter. As long as that situation existed it was irrelevant that other interested parties had not been joined. I agree. In this c ase it was not essential for Madam Lee to be a party. Her partic ipation was not required as the parties already before the c ourt had (as I disc uss below) an interest on opposite sides of a live issue. 

The next preliminary issue was also on the proper parties who had to be before the c ourt for the c orrec t determination of the issues. The c ontention was that the plaintiff had sued the wrong defendants, ie the MC. They should instead have sued the subsidiary proprietors of Grac ious Mansions. This submission was based on s 116(1) of the Land Titles (Strata) Ac t (Cap 158, 1999 Ed) (`the Ac t`) whic h reads: 

 Where all or some of the subsidiary proprietors of the lots in a subdivided building are jointly entitled to take proceedings against any person or are liable to have proceedings taken against them jointly (any such proceedings being proceedings for or with respect to common property), the proceedings may be 


 taken by or against the management corporation as if it were the subsidiary proprietors of the lots concerned. 

Counsel submitted that the above sec tion permitted the MC to represent the subsidiary proprietors only in proc eedings `for or with respec t to c ommon property`. He asserted that the right of way enjoyed by the dominant tenement over the servient tenement was not c ommon property. The definition of c ommon property in s 3 of the Ac t in relation to a c ondominium means `so muc h of the land for the time being not c omprised in any lot shown in a strata title plan`. `Proprietorship of land` in turn is defined by the same sec tion to inc lude `the right of ac c ess to any highway onto whic h the land abuts`. Relying on **_Words and Phrases Judicially Defined_** by Roland Burrows, c ounsel stated the word `abut` means `to ac tually touc h` and a `highway` is a way over whic h all members of the public are entitled to pass or re-pass. The result of these definitions was that the right of way was not part of the c ommon property bec ause the dominant tenement here did not abut a highway. It abutted the servient tenement whic h was only a reserve for road, not a highway. The only highway in the c ase was St Patric k`s Road and that was separated from the dominant tenement by other plots of land inc luding the servient tenement. 

It was further submitted that the MC was not the owner of the right of way and any dec ision against the MC would be ineffec tual as the right of way was owned by the subsidiary proprietors. All of the subsidiary proprietors would have to be joined as defendants as eac h of them was an owner (as a tenant-in-c ommon) of the c ommon property under s 9(3) of the Ac t. 

The submission that in order for the MC to be sued in this c ase the issue had to involve the c ommon property is c orrec t. This is shown both by s 116(1) and by s 33(2) whic h sets out the general situations in whic h a management c orporation c an sue or be sued. There are four of these situations. Only two are relevant. These are ss 33(2)(b) and (d) whic h provide that the management c orporation may: `(b) sue and be sued in respec t of any matter affec ting the c ommon property;` and `(d) be sued in respec t of any matter c onnec ted with the parc el for whic h the subsidiary proprietors are jointly liable`. 

I do not, however, agree with Mr Wee`s submission that a right of way is not part of the c ommon property. The definition of land in the Ac t makes it c lear that `the proprietorship of land **_includes_** natural rights to air, light, water and support and the right of ac c ess to any highway on whic h the land abuts` (emphasis is added) (see s 3, under the definition of `land`). The quoted words were obviously aimed at insuring that there was no doubt that the c ommon property also c omprised an easement over the land of a third party. So, both natural and ac quired rights are referred to. The word used to prefac e these rights is `inc ludes` whic h implies that apart from the right of ac c ess to a highway, there may in addition be other rights to whic h proprietorship of land entitles the proprietor but whic h have not been spelt out. In my judgment, the phraseology used c ontemplates that a right of way whic h had been c reated for the benefit of a piec e of land whic h was subsequently brought under the Ac t would c ontinue to be part of the rights belonging to the proprietor of that land. The fac t that suc h right of way might not be c overed by the phrase `right of ac c ess to any highway on whic h the land abuts`, c annot of itself exc lude suc h right from being part of the c ommon property. 

In any c ase, in this instanc e, it c an be argued that St Patric k`s Road is a highway on whic h the dominant tenement abuts and that the right of ac c ess over the servient tenement is c overed by the definition of land. This is bec ause, as Mr Shanmugam pointed out, if the word `abut` were to be given its stric t dic tionary meaning only, the referenc e to a right of ac c ess would be absurd. It is unnec essary to give the owners of a piec e of land ac c ess to a highway whic h that land abuts if in 


fac t the land is immediately adjac ent to the highway. In that c ase, the owners would be able to walk direc tly from their land onto the highway and no right of ac c ess would be required. The granting of the right of ac c ess implies ac c ess to a parc el of land that separates the dominant tenement from the highway so that without suc h ac c ess, persons using the dominant tenement would not be able to reac h the highway. 

It should also be noted that it has previously been taken for granted that a management c orporation was a proper party in a c ase involving a right of way asserted over land whic h had been developed into a c ondominium. The c ase was **MCST Plan No 549 v Chew Eu Hock Construction Co** <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 366</span>. In that c ase, the management c orporation c onc erned was sued by the owners of adjoining land who c laimed a dec laration of a right of way over a driveway on the land oc c upied by the c ondominium. The c ase went right up to the Court of Appeal without anyone even suggesting that there had been a misjoinder of parties and that the subsidiary proprietors should have been made defendants instead of the management c orporation. 

Further, the fac t that the MC does not own the c ommon property inc luding the right of way, is irrelevant. As the person c harged by the Ac t with the responsibility of maintaining the c ommon property for the benefit of all proprietors, the MC has an interest in all matters relating to the c ommon property. As has been judic ially rec ognised, the MC has something akin to possession of the c ommon property (see **RSP Architects Planners & Engineers v Ocean Front** <span class="citation">[1996] 1 SLR 113</span> ). The right of way being part of the c ommon property it would be the MC`s responsibility to ensure that it remains available for use by the subsidiary proprietors. In my opinion, it has a suffic ient interest in the subjec t matter of the ac tion to be sued. Additionally, under s 116(1) it c ould have been sued as if it were the subsidiary proprietors sinc e proc eedings c ould have been brought against the latter jointly as owners of the c ommon property. 

I am satisfied that there is no substanc e in either of the preliminary issues and that I should go on to c onsider the c ase on its merits. 

**_Principles of abandonment of easements_** 

Onc e an easement exists it is very diffic ult to extinguish it. This is bec ause as stated in **_Gale on Easements_** (16th Ed) at [sec t ]12-15 unless the easement is granted for a term of years, the rights c onferred by it are perpetual and ac c ordingly are ac tually or potentially valuable rights. Therefore, it is not lightly to be inferred that the owner of suc h a right should give it up for no c onsideration. Nonetheless, sinc e the existenc e of an easement is a restric tion on the alienability of the servient tenement, the law has rec ognised over the years that an easement may be brought to an end in c ertain limited ways. One of these is by abandonment of the use of the easement. Proving abandonment is, however, no easy matter. 

**_Gale on Easements_** summarises the princ iples on abandonment of an easement in [sec t ]12-45. It states: 

 Although it was stated in earlier editions of this book that: 

 There seems to be no doubt that discontinuous easements may be lost by mere non-user, provided such cessation to enjoy be accompanied by the intention to relinquish the right, 

 that statement could be misleading. The true rule would appear to be that 


 mere non-user without more, however long, cannot amount to abandonment. Such non-user is evidence from which abandonment may be inferred but must be regarded in the context of the circumstances as a whole. The non-user may be explained by the fact that the dominant owner had no need to use the easement, in which case it will not be enough to establish abandonment. A presumption of abandonment will arise where there are circumstances adverse to the user and sufficient to explain the non-user, combined with a substantial length of time during which the dominant owner has acquiesced in that state of affairs or where the dominant owner does some act clearly indicating the firm intention that neither he nor any successor in title of his should thereafter make use of the easement. It has been said that abandonment is not to be lightly inferred: owners of property do not normally wish to divest themselves of it unless it is to their advantage to do so, notwithstanding that they may have no present use for it. Further, if the dominant owner does not have any present need to exercise his right and does not object to conduct of the servient owner which temporarily renders the exercise of those rights difficult or impossible, it would be undesirable if such general and good neighbourly conduct could not be indulged in for fear of losing those rights for all time. 

There is also a useful summary of the pronounc ements of various judges on this issue as it arose before them over the years, in the Australian c ase of **McIntyre v Porter** [1983] 2 VR 439. There Anderson J had to c onsider whether the plaintiff was c orrec t in his c ontention that the defendant or his predec essors had abandoned a right of way over the plaintiff`s land. The judge analysed the previous authorities and their effec t at p 444 of his judgment: 

 The plaintiff contends that the right of way claimed by the defendants was abandoned during the occupancy of the defendants land by the defendants predecessors over a long period. If the plaintiff is correct in his contention, it is immaterial that the defendants believed that they had the easement claimed and sought to take steps to assert their right, for an easement once abandoned is abandoned forever: Tapling v Jones [1865] 11 HL Cas 290, at p. 319; Scott v Pape [1886] 31 Ch D 554, at p. 558. In a case where an easement has existed, it may be determined by agreement (of which there is no evidence before me) or by abandonment. Abandonment is a question of intention of the owner of the dominant tenement, in this case one or more of the predecessors of the defendants ( Tapling v Jones and Scott v Pape ), and whether there was any intention may be inferred from the whole of the facts before the Court. 

 Mere non-user of itself is not conclusive of abandonment of a right of way, though it may be evidence of abandonment. So much is clear from the observations of several Judges in several cases. In Swan v Sinclair [1924] 1 Ch 254 , at p. 266, Pollock, MR said: "Non-user is not by itself conclusive that a private right of easement is abandoned. The non-user must be considered with, and may be explained by, the surrounding circumstances. If those circumstances clearly indicate an intention of not resuming the user then a presumption of a release of the easement will, in general, be implied and the easement will be lost." 

 There is thus no minimum time. "It is not so much the duration of the cesser as the nature of the act done by the grantee of the easement, or the adverse act acquiesced in by him, and the intention in him which either the one or the other indicates, which are material for the consideration of the jury", said Lord Denman, CJ in R v Chorley [1848] 12 QB 515, at p. 519; 116 ER 960. His Lordship further said: "The period of time is only material as one element from which the grantees intention to retain or abandon his easement may be 


 inferred against him; and what period may be sufficient in a particular case must depend on all the accompanying circumstances." 

 In Crossley & Sons Ltd v Lightowler [1867] 2 Ch App 478, in which the remarks of Lord Denman, CJ were approved, Lord Chelmsford, LC, at p. 482, stressed that the intention was always a question to be decided on the facts of each particular case when he said: "The authorities upon the question of abandonment have decided that a mere suspension of the exercise of a right is not sufficient to prove an intention to abandon it. But a long continued suspension may render it necessary for the person claiming the right to shew that some indication was given during the period that he ceased to use the right of his intention to preserve it. The question of abandonment of a right is one of his intention, to be decided on the facts of each particular case. Previous decisions are only so far useful as they furnish principles applicable to all cases of the kind." 

 In recent times, in Treweeke v 36 Wolseley Road Pty Ltd [1973] 128 CLR 274 at p. 288, Walsh, J said: "But in my opinion the authorities do not warrant the view that the length of time during which non-use continues is unimportant. I think the longer it continues the more readily will the conclusion be reached that the person entitled to the benefit of the easement may be deemed to have abandoned it, unless of course there is proof of facts or circumstances which provide a satisfactory explanation for the non-user which negative any intention of abandonment." 

In **_McIntyre_** itself the judge c onc luded on the evidenc e that the right of way had been abandoned. The fac ts that led him to this c onc lusion were that the right of way in c ontention had not been used between 1923 and the date of the ac tion (about 1982), that a gate had been erec ted in the fenc ing that divided the two plots of land c onc erned and that gate was so small that only a person c ould pass through it (although the right granted was inter alia for horses, c arts, wagons and other c arriages to pass and re-pass over the right of way), that the only use made of the gate had been as a means for soc ial visits between the oc c upants of the two premises, that the gate had been nailed up in the 1930s and, in the 1960s, trees had been planted along the boundary whic h had grown into a substantial barrier between the dominant and servient tenements. Further, the defendants had had available and had made use of, other more c onvenient means of ac c ess. 

**_Review of authorities_** 

**Crossley & Sons v Lightowler** [1867] LR 2 Ch App 478, one of the c ases mentioned in Anderson J`s judgment (supra), dealt with a right to disc harge effluent material into a river. It was one of the earliest c ases in whic h it was ac c epted that an easement had been abandoned. The plaintiff was the owner of land on the banks of a river and he sought to restrain the defendants from fouling the river. The defendants oc c upied land whic h had for 20 years up to 1839 c ontained a dye-works. While the dye-works were operating, foul water from those works had been disc harged into the river. The dyeworks were, however, dismantled in 1839 and afterwards, the buildings were gradually removed. The plaintiff c ontended that the right to foul the river had been abandoned. In giving judgment for the plaintiff, Lord Chelmsford LC stated (at pp 482-483): 

 With respect to the prescriptive right derived from the Messrs. Irving, the Plaintiffs say, that if such right was ever acquired it had been abandoned long before the Defendants commenced business at their works. The authorities 


 upon the subject of abandonment have decided that a mere suspension of the exercise of a right is not sufficient to prove an intention to abandon it. But a long continued suspension may render it necessary for the person claiming the right to shew that some indication was given during the period that he ceased to use the right of his intention to preserve it. The question of abandonment of a right is one of intention, to be decided upon the facts of each particular case. Previous decisions are only so far useful as they furnish principles applicable to all cases of the kind. The case of Reg. v. Chorley (Unreported) shews that time is not a necessary element in a question of abandonment as it is in the case of the acquisition of a right. Lord Denman, in delivering the judgment of the Court in that case, said: "We apprehend that an express release of the easement would destroy it at any moment, so the cesser of use, coupled with any act clearly indicative of an intention to abandon the right, would have the same effect without any reference to time." And again: "It is not so much the duration of the cesser, as the nature of the act done by the grantee of the easement, and the intention in him which it indicates, which are material for the consideration of the jury." It is, therefore, a question of fact, whether the acts of the parties who succeeded the Messrs. Irving were of so unequivocal a nature as clearly to denote an intention to relinquish the right to foul the stream which they had exercised previously. 

Another c ase in whic h abandonment of an easement was found, and one on whic h Mr Shanmugam plac ed a great deal of relianc e, was **Swan v Sinclair** [1924] 1 Ch 254. The fac ts were that in 1871, houses and shops in Essex Road, Islington, were put up for sale at auc tion in 11 lots. One of the c onditions was that a strip of land 15ft in width running the entire length of the lots and being the rear portions of the bac k gardens of the houses should be formed into a roadway, and that the lots were sold subjec t to and with the benefit of a right of way from the bac k garden of eac h house along the proposed roadway into Churc h Road, whic h bounded the side of lot 1, on the south-west. Lot 1 was c onveyed subjec t to the right of way of the owners of the other lots, and lots 2 and 3 were eac h c onveyed with the benefit of and subjec t to the right of way. In eac h of the c onveyanc es, an obligation was c ast on the purc haser to c ontribute towards the expense of forming the road. In the subsequent title deeds relating to the plaintiff`s and the defendant`s properties, the existenc e of the right of way was expressly mentioned. In 1873, a purc haser of lot 1 granted a lease of it to the plaintiff`s father subjec t to the right of way. In July 1904, that lease was assigned to the plaintiff subjec t to the right of way of the owners of the other lots. In 1911, the plaintiff purc hased lots 2 and 3, subjec t to and with the benefit of the right of way. It appeared that at the time of sale in 1871, the several lots were divided from one and another by fenc es whic h extended ac ross the 15ft strip and that a bric k wall separated lot 1 from Churc h Road. It also appeared that from 1871 to 1922 the roadway was physic ally inc apable of being used as suc h. The c ondition of the site of the proposed roadway had never been altered throughout that period and the plaintiff himself did nothing from 1911 to 1922 to assert his rights. In 1883, the plaintiff`s father by levelling up part of the site of lot 1, c aused a sheer drop of 6ft to oc c ur on the strip between that lot and the adjoining lot 2. In 1919, the plaintiff pulled down part of the wall whic h had sinc e 1871 separated the end of the strip from Churc h Road and erec ted gates there. The plaintiff`s lease of lot 1 expired in 1922 and shortly thereafter, the defendant, who was then the owner of lot 1, c hallenged the plaintiff`s right to have ac c ess to Churc h Road through lot 1 by erec ting a wall ac ross the site of the roadway between lot 1 and lot 2. The plaintiff sought a dec laration that he was entitled as the owner of lots 2 and 3 to a general right of way along the site of the proposed roadway at the rear and forming part of lot 1 into Churc h Road. 

In the headnotes of the c ase, it was stated that the c ourt by a majority, had held that although the mere non-user of the right of way was not c onc lusive evidenc e of its abandonment, yet having regard 


to the fac ts (as stated in [para ]36) and the c onduc t of the plaintiff and his predec essors in title, there was suffic ient evidenc e of the abandonment of the right of way in question. Indeed the dec ision of the dissenting judge turned on the point that there was not suffic ient evidenc e, apart from nonuser, to indic ate an intention of abandoning and not resuming the use of the right. The majority judges were fully aware that non-user by itself was insuffic ient but their interpretation of the fac ts satisfied them that the additional requirement had been met. 

One of the judges in the majority, Warrington LJ, analysed the situation as follows (at p 269): 

 In the present case the user of the road has been rendered impossible by not only the continuance of obstructions existing at the date of the grant, but also by the creation of a fresh one by the raising, in 1883, of the level of the land over which the way would pass. It seems to me that these circumstances, adverse to user, and sufficient in themselves to explain the non-user, combined with the great length of time during which no objection has been made to their continuance, nor effort made to remove them, are sufficient to raise the presumption that the right has been abandoned, and has now ceased to exist. It is contended that we ought to hold that the right was merely in abeyance, and could at any time be revived when occasion arose. I cannot myself see anything in the circumstances to suggest that the owners of the dominant tenement contemplated a future use of the way, and if they had done so I think they ought to have made their position clear. 

The other judge in the majority, Sargant LJ, stated that the question that had to be fac ed was whether there had been, by the end of the year 1918, or indeed by the date of the c onveyanc e to the plaintiff in 1911, suc h an ac quiesc enc e in, or implied ac c eptanc e of, the c ontinuing and inc reased obstruc tion of the proposed bac k road as to evidenc e an abandonment. His answer (at p 275) was that the fac ts of this c ase showed that during a period of at least 38 years there had not merely been non-user of the way but ac quiesc enc e (in the sense of quiesc enc e without ac tive protest or assertion of right) in an indefensible and inc reased obstruc tion of the right. The c ase subsequently went up to the House of Lords where it was dec ided against the plaintiff but on a different ground, ie that the right of way had never c ome into existenc e in the first plac e. The issue of abandonment was thus irrelevant. 

**_Submissions of the parties_** 

Frontfield`s submission was that in this c ase all the requirements of abandonment of easement were present. First, there had been a substantial period of non-user and, in fac t, as established by the unc hallenged evidenc e of Mr Edaris, there had been no user at all of the right of way from the time it was first granted up to the date of the ac tion. That was a period of some 48 years. Sec ondly, the non-user did not stand alone but was part of a whole range of c irc umstanc es whic h indic ated a positive intention on the part of the owners of Grac ious Mansions never to use the right of way. 

These c irc umstanc es related to the c onstruc tion of the c ondominium. In the first plac e, by the time it was built, there was a public right of way, Jalan Rendang, immediately abutting the dominant tenement whic h gave ac c ess to St Patric k`s Road and whic h therefore made the right of way over the servient tenement superfluous. Sec ondly, the c ondominium was designed so that the main ac c ess to it was from Jalan Rendang by a dual c arriageway over whic h both pedestrians and vehic les c ould pass. It was wide enough, in fac t, to allow two-way vehic ular traffic. Then, there was a fenc e built all around the c ondominium whic h made it impossible for persons on the dominant tenement to have 


ac c ess to the servient tenement. There was no gate in this fenc e leading to the servient tenement until 1997. Thirdly, the swimming pool, the guardhouse, the bin c entre and the c hanging room had been built in suc h a way as to make it impossible for vehic les to gain ac c ess to the servient tenement from the dominant tenement even before the gate was c onstruc ted. The c onstruc tion of the gate did not c hange this position. It only made pedestrian ac c ess a possibility. The c hairman of the MC who gave evidenc e c onfirmed that it had never even c rossed the MC`s mind to tile up the swimming pool in order to make it possible for vehic les to use the right of way. 

Mr Shanmugam submitted that the ac ts desc ribed above were so unequivoc al in nature as c learly to denote an intention to abandon the easement. He drew a parallel with the dismantling of the dyeworks in **_Crossley_** `s c ase (supra) as an indic ation of a permanent intention. He pointed out that it had not been proved in that c ase that there was a positive intention not to build any further dyeworks but that this had been inferred from the removal of the first building. In this c ase he asked the c ourt to infer from the manner of c onstruc tion adopted by Penford Pte Ltd, then the owner of the dominant tenement, that they had no intention of using the right of way. He also drew parallels with the situation in **_Swan v Sinclair_** (supra) where at all material times the land intended for the right of way was not usable as suc h due to no road having been built and bec ause of the obstruc tion c aused by dividing fenc es and the differenc e in ground levels. Here, he said the ac c ess to St Patric k`s Road over the servient tenement was fenc ed up and the gate was loc ked. Thus, nobody c ould use it exc ept the owners of the servient tenement. Sec ondly, that from the 1970s up to 1997, bec ause of the existenc e of a fenc e around the dominant tenement, no one c ould have ac c ess from there onto the servient tenement and thirdly, right from 1952 when the right of way was first c reated up to date, no road had been made. It was a grass patc h. So, Mr Shanmugam submitted, nobody asserted the right of way and nobody used it and in fac t everyone ac quiesc ed in not using it as a right of way. 

Mr Wee was not impressed by Mr Shanmugam`s arguments. He emphasised the value to the dominant tenement of an easement and quoted several authorities to demonstrate the diffic ulty that the servient tenement has in ridding itself of the burden of the easement. Mr Wee submitted that his authorities showed that length of time of non-user (up to 175 years in one c ase) and physic al impediments in relation to the use of a right of way (like ditc hes and fenc es) were not suffic ient to establish abandonment and, a fortiori, that the c irc umstanc es relied on here were inadequate for that purpose. The right of way had not been used in this c ase simply bec ause there was a c onvenient alternative route. Thus, it c ould not be inferred from the non-user that there was an intention to abandon the right of way. 

**_My views_** 

I apprec iate the arguments made by Mr Wee and have no quarrel with the princ iples of law expounded by him. I rec ognise that an easement suc h as the one in dispute here is part of a bundle of property rights belonging to a landowner and therefore c annot be easily disc arded. In my view, however, the c irc umstanc es here go beyond simple non-user and do evinc e the nec essary intention to abandon. In this c onnec tion, it is signific ant that despite knowing about the right of way (as it must have sinc e the same was mentioned in the c onveyanc e in 1980) Penford Pte Ltd went about the c onstruc tion of Grac ious Mansions as if the right of way did not exist at all. No intention to use it was displayed in the design of the development. A road c ould have been c onstruc ted over the right of way. Instead the money went to c onstruc ting a main ac c ess leading onto Jalan Rendang. Sec ondly, the fac ilities of the c ondominium were plac ed so that they bloc ked vehic ular ac c ess to the servient tenement. Thirdly, not even the possibility of pedestrian ac c ess was c onsidered sinc e no gate was c onstruc ted leading to the servient tenement. What is signific ant in this c onstruc tion is that all these items are permanent items, or at least as permanent as man-made edific es c an be. They are not easily or c heaply removed 


and some of them at least were designed as selling points aimed at attrac ting the persons who subsequently bec ame the subsidiary proprietors. Suc h persons would not have expec ted extensive rec onstruc tion to take plac e in the foreseeable future or that the driveway, swimming pool and other amenities would be removed or switc hed around so as to allow them to use a right of way whic h they would then have had to c onstruc t as a tarred road at c onsiderable expense. It appears to me that Penford Pte Ltd not only evinc ed an intention to abandon the right of way for itself but also for its intended suc c essors in title as it provided them with fac ilities that were not c ompatible with the full use of the right of way. 

I also note that at all times there had been a fenc e and a padloc ked gate between the front of the servient tenement and St Patric k`s Road whic h made it impossible for anyone to exit onto St Patric k`s Road from the servient tenement. This bloc king of the right of way was not objec ted to by either the present or the previous owners of the dominant tenement. Their quiesc enc e in the fac e of an ac tion that was c ontrary to the right granted while not c onc lusive of abandonment is further indic ation of their disinterest in the right of way. 

One of the c ases c ited by Mr Wee was **Wilsons Brewery v West Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council** (Unreported) where it was held that in order for there to be an abandonment of easement there must be overt and unequivoc al evidenc e of an intention upon the part of the dominant tenement to abandon that easement. In my judgment, the fac ts of this c ase as I have disc ussed them plainly display the requisite overt and unequivoc al intention. 

**_Other cases considered_** 

I should, however, deal with the other c ases whic h Mr Wee c ited. The first of these is **Ward v Ward** [1852] 7 Exc h 838(Unreported) where the right of way in question had not been used for about 26 years. The right of way was upheld. It was found that the reason for the non-user was that there was a more easy and c onvenient means of ac c ess to the dominant tenement than that provided by the right of way. The rationale of this c ase was that apart from non-user there were no other c irc umstanc es to raise the presumption of abandonment. It was also signific ant that if the right of way was struc k down, the owner of the dominant tenement would have been without the means of any ac c ess to his property. There is a useful c ommentary by Anderson J in **_McIntyre_** `s c ase (supra) on the fac tors that distinguish **_Ward_** `s c ase (supra) from a c ase like that before him and the one before me. He said (at p 446): 

 In my opinion, Ward s Case depends on its own facts, and does not lay down any principle that the use of an alternative means of access to the dominant tenement is necessarily irrelevant to the question whether non-user may amount to an abandonment of a right of way. Ward s Case dealt with agricultural land, where the temporary availability of an easier means of access might encourage the use of a shorter route over other land. In the present case the defendants land is town land, already in the throes of subdivision even in 1855, and has always had a permanent frontage to Fredericks Court, to which the disputed land likewise gave access, and the apparent lack of utility of the right of way over so many years emphasizes the probability of its abandonment. As the judgment in Ward s Case indicates, it was a case determined on the facts and it does not assist the defendants in this case. It is no more than an illustration of the proposition that a long period of non-user may call for an explanation which may be provided by the circumstance that there had been for the time being a shorter and more convenient means of access to the dominant tenement. 


With respec t, I entirely agree. 

The next c ase c ited by Mr Wee was also c ited in the **_McIntyre_** c ase (supra). It is **Gotobed v Pridmore** [1970] 115 Sol Jo 78. The defendants there oc c upied a lane whic h ran from the southern boundary of the plaintiff`s land. The defendants owned the land on either side of the lane. The plaintiff c laimed a right of way over the lane. The previous owner of the plaintiff`s land had maintained a dyke and a post and rails fenc e between it and the lane. The lane itself had been c ultivated by the defendants for four years between 1942 and 1946 and surrounded by a barbed wire fenc e sinc e 1948, being used thereafter for c hic kens and grazing. The judge held that the right of way had been abandoned but his dec ision was reversed on appeal. The report of the dec ision stated that Buc kley LJ had said: 

 To establish abandonment the conduct of the dominant owner must have been such as to make it clear that he had at the relevant time a firm intention that neither he nor any successor in title should thereafter make use of the easement ... The defendants had relied on the long absence of use of the lane by the plaintiffs predecessor, the absence of any indication on his part to resume use and his failure to protest about the uses to which the defendants had put the lane. However, the ploughing of the plaintiffs land was not in the least inconsistent with an intention to retain the right of way. The cultivation of the lane had been mostly during the second world war when an objection to such use might have been unpatriotic. The fence around the lane was an insubstantial kind and the failure to object to it would be a very slight ground for inferring any intention to abandon. The failure to maintain an earth bridge across the dyke and the maintenance of the fence on the plaintiffs land were not proper matters from which to infer a resolution to abandon. The court was impressed by ease with which the physical state of affairs could have been altered so as to restore the use of the right of way. 

The above ac c ount shows very c learly how different the c irc umstanc es were in **_Gotobed_** from the c irc umstanc es before me. There again, the land involved was agric ultural land and the struc tures and usage whic h prevented the use of the right of way were not only temporary but also insubstantial and easily removed so as to enable the re-use of the right of way. The struc tures and usage of the dominant tenement here have not been dic tated by patriotic c onc erns. They are solid struc tures intended to be permanent fixtures and removing them would take time and c ost a great deal. **_Gotobed_** `s c ase does not help the MC. 

The next two c ases c an be dealt with quic kly. First, **James v Stevenson** [1893] AC 162. This was c ited mainly for the observation of Sir Edward Fry at p 168 that `it must not be forgotten that it is one thing not to assert an intention to use a way, and another thing to assert an intention to abandon it`. I have no quarrel with that statement but it does not help the MC sinc e I c onsider the ac tions of the dominant owners here do assert an intention to abandon. The sec ond c ase **Obadia v Morris** [1974] 232 EG 333, is not relevant as it is a c ase where the owners of the dominant tenement were unaware of the existenc e of the right of way and it was held that if you were ignorant of a right you c ould not form an intention to abandon it. Ignoranc e is not in issue here. 

**Treweeke v 36 Wolseley Road** [1973] 128 CLR 274 was a dec ision of the High Court of Australia. The right of way in issue there was to enable the oc c upiers of lot A to pass over a strip of land in lot B to get ac c ess to the beac h at Double Bay, Sydney. The right was c reated in 1927 and at all times parts of it had been impassable by reason of vertic al roc k fac es and, sinc e 1928, by reason of an impenetrable bamboo plantation. Further, in 1956 the owner of lot B installed a swimming pool ac ross 


part of the right of way and in 1958 she erec ted an iron fenc e ac ross the way. At no time had the owners or oc c upiers of lot A used the entire right of way. They had used an alternative way along lot C but this bec ame unavailable in 1967. In 1971 the owner of lot B sought a dec laration that the right of way had been abandoned. It was held by a majority of two to one that the non-user of the right of way and other ac ts and omission of the owner of lot A did not require the inferenc e of abandonment of the right of way. 

Certain passages from the judgment of Mc Tiernan J, one of the judges who found in favour of the dominant tenement, show the reasoning of the majority. He said: 

 It was always impossible to use the right of way at the place where each fence was put, by reason of the steepness of the place. In any case, neither fence is immovable. It would appear that at the place where the low retaining wall is built the strip of land was usable as a means of passage towards the beach. The wall is not immovable. As regards the obstruction caused by the growth of bamboo, this could be dealt with by removing some of the growth by a job of pruning. It is a curious feature of the case that the owner of the servient tenement is relying upon things done by herself which she says are obstructions to passage along the strip of land subject to the right of way. [at p 280] 

 ... I do not think that it is a reasonable conclusion that the building of the fence [in 1933] amounted to an abandonment of the right of way or was intended as such. The evidence shows that it was not expensive; it is movable; and it is within the dominant tenement. A gate could be inserted in the fence to admit of egress from and access to the servient tenement. The evidence of this incident is not, in my opinion, so cogent that it is reasonable to find that the erection of the fence amounted to a renunciation or disclaimer of the right of way ... 

 The important element in the case is non-user of the total length of the strip of land as a way. Part of it was frequently used as far as an opening in the boundary fence to which the strip of land is adjacent. Residents of the home units [built on Lot A] went through that opening and proceeded from there over the neighbouring allotment to the beach. Their reason for turning aside from the boundary would appear to be that the strip of land was not passable further on. The grant by which the right of way was created imposes no obligation on either the servient owner or the dominant owner to make the strip of land passable. An obligation to do so does not arise at law or at equity. The case is one of mere non-user ... The non-user of the total length of the way can reasonably be put down to its precipitous condition at places. It is not reasonable to attribute non-user to renunciation of such a pleasant amenity as a path to the beach at Double Bay. There is ample evidence of the utilisation of passable parts of the locus in quo of the right of way as the first stage of daily journeys to the beach by residents of No. 36 Wolseley Road, the dominant tenement ... In my opinion, upon the whole of the evidence there is clear proof of the intention of the respondent to retain the right of way. [at pp 283-285] 

The differenc es between that c ase and the present are many. First, the major obstruc tions to the right of way there were c reated by the owner of the servient tenement and not the owner of the dominant tenement as here. This led to a disc ussion of ac quiesc enc e in the c reation of suc h obstruc tions whic h is not relevant in our c ase. Sec ondly, part of the right of way was always used. Thirdly, it was found that the reason for non-use of c ertain parts of the right of way was that those areas were physic ally impassable. That situation does not exist here. It is possible to walk and even drive ac ross the servient tenement though doing so may not be a c ompletely pleasant experienc e. 


Fourthly, Mc Tiernan J was able to find on the evidenc e there that there was positive proof of the intention of the dominant owner to retain the right of way. Suc h proof positive is not available here. 

The final c ase I need deal with is **Benn v Hardinge** (Unreported) whic h is the one where the right of way had not been used for 175 years before the proc eedings started and yet the Court of Appeal, reversing the judge at first instanc e, held that the right of way had not been abandoned. There were two issues, the first being whether the laying out of a private c arriageway along c ertain farmland c reated a right of way in favour of Mr Benn and the sec ond was whether although the c arriageway had not been used for 175 years, Mr Benn c ould still c laim the right of way whic h he now needed sinc e his alternative ac c ess had bec ome waterlogged. 

The main judgment was delivered by Dillon LJ. He found that the existenc e of the right of way had been established and then went on to c onsider the issue of abandonment. In this c onnec tion, he noted that little had happened to either the servient or dominant tenement sinc e the grant whic h had c hanged the situation. The land remained `pleasantly rural`. There had been no erec tion on either side. He also noted that there was virtually no evidenc e at all that anyone oc c upying Mr Benn`s farm had ever sought to use the right of way for any purpose at all. But the simple explanation for that was that there was no need bec ause they had alternative ac c ess. The judge examined many previous authorities inc luding the **_Crossley_** and **_Treweeke_** c ases (supra). He also c onsidered **_Swan v Sinclair_** (supra) in some detail and c onc luded (at p 257): `It seems to have been established by **_Ward v Ward_** and **_Swan v Sinclair_** that mere non-user, whic h c an be explained by having no need to use, if so explained, is not enough to amount to an abandonment.` Dillon LJ then turned to **_Gotobed v Pridmore_** (supra) and observed that its c irc umstanc es bore some resemblanc e to the c irc umstanc es of the c ase before him. After quoting in detail from the judgment, he c onc luded: 

 I take the law to have been laid down in clear terms by the judgment of the court in Gotobed v Pridmore. In view of that and the many expressions of the high authority in the cases to which I have referred, to the effect that there must be an intention to abandon, I do not feel it is open to us in this court to say that the way must be presumed to have been abandoned merely because it was not used because no one had occasion to use it, even for so long as 175 years. It is important in this context that the photographs show such a rural and unchanged situation on the servient owners site of the boundary line. This is not an area where there has been great change and the plaintiffs land is used for farming sheep rather than for any matter which could not have been in contemplation at the time of the enclosure. [at pp 260-261] 

Hirst LJ also expressed his views on the issue of abandonment. He c onsidered that the princ iple that a c ourt had to apply was authoritatively laid down by the Court of Appeal in the **_Gotobed_** c ase (supra) and that was that mere abstinenc e from the use of an easement was insuffic ient to establish an intention to abandon its benefit. He went on: 

 In the present case, apart from the clear evidence of non-user, there are in my judgment no other circumstances to raise the presumption of abandonment. The matters relied upon by Mr. Wood, namely the broken-down gate B and the continuous ditch, are easily remediable by the installation of a new gate and the construction of a small bridge over the ditch, and, in consequence, those two factors do not justify an inference that any previous owner resolved to give up the right of way altogether. Compare the similar facts in Gotobed s case. If there were any onus upon the plaintiff to explain the non-user which in my judgment there is not in the present case then he could readily do so by the fact there were other means of egress into Hackhurst Lane. [at p 261] 


### ... 

 In Gotobed s case, Buckley L.J. concluded his judgment in the passage, which my Lord has just quoted, pointing out that the right of way, although it was of no particular significance to the owner for the time being, was nevertheless a piece of property of potential value. In my judgment, the same applies mutatis mutandis here. The right of way was always a piece of property of latent value, though not actually exploited because of the alternative means of egress into Hackhurst Lane, to which I have just referred. The abandonment of such a valuable latent piece of property should not be lightly inferred since it might be of significant importance in the future, as has in fact occurred during the present plaintiffs ownership. Mrs. Benns [evidence] is that the gates into Hackhurst Lane get "waterlogged in bad weather [and are] not passable at certain times of year," whereas the right of way "once [the] ditches are drained [is] not such [a] difficult route. [at p 262] 

Mr Wee`s emphasis was the same as that of Lord Justic e Hirst. He impressed upon me that I should not deprive the dominant tenement of a valuable right simply bec ause that right had not been exerc ised for years. In this c ase, there was no c ause to use the servient tenement for ac c ess to St Patric k`s Road before the c onstruc tion of Grac ious Mansions sinc e the dominant tenement was unoc c upied. After the erec tion of that building, the use of the right of way was still unnec essary bec ause of the existenc e of Jalan Rendang. If non-use was the only relevant fac t, Frontfield would fail. The fac tor whic h distinguishes **_Benn v Hardinge_** (supra) from the present c ase is the issue of development. Both judges, as c an be seen from the analysis above, were impressed by the essentially unc hanged nature of the two piec es of land over the period of 175 years. The situation at the date of the hearing was very muc h as it had been at the date the right of way was c reated. Here, signific ant c hanges have taken plac e. First, a public road has been built whic h offers c onvenient and permanent ac c ess to St Patric k`s Road. Sec ondly, the dominant tenement has been so developed as to take advantage of the ac c ess offered by the public road and to put obstac les in the way of the use of the right of way. The importanc e to Mr Benn of the right of way over Mr Hardinge`s land was that waterlogging would from time to time make the alternative route impassable. Here, given the state of development of the public road c ompared with that of the right of way, it is diffic ult to envisage a situation in whic h the road would be impassable and the grassy vac ant land offer the only possible ac c ess to St Patric k`s Road. This fac tor of latent need to use the right of way whic h played suc h an important part in **_Benn v Hardinge_** is c ompletely absent from this c ase. In my judgment, the present c ase is more akin to **_McIntyre v Porter_** (supra) than **_Benn v Hardinge_**. 

**_Conclusion on abandonment_** 

I c onc lude therefore, that the right of way over the servient tenement has been abandoned by the owners of Grac ious Mansions. The c ases c ited by Mr Wee are distinguishable on the fac ts. 

**_Partial abandonment_** 

The alternative argument put forward by Mr Shanmugam was that if there had not been a total abandonment of the right of way, there had at least been a partial abandonment in that the right to have vehic ular ac c ess to the servient tenement had been given up. On this argument, the right of way would be limited to pedestrian ac c ess. His submission was that the authorities c learly show that the law rec ognises that an easement c reates a parc el of separate rights and some of these rights c an 


be abandoned without nec essarily affec ting the others. 

The authority c ited in support of this proposition was an Australian c ase, **Proprietors Strata Plan No 9968 v Proprietors Strata Plan No 11173** [1979] 2 NSWLR 605. That was a c ase where the right of way granted was for vehic ular ac c ess. The c ontention put forward was that the easement had been abandoned wholly or in part meaning that the right to use it otherwise than on foot had been abandoned. Needham J reasoned: 

 As a matter of pure theory, there seems to be no reason why the law should not recognise such a partial abandonment. An easement is not unlike a fee simple, in the sense that it comprises a number of rights. In each case, they are rights which enure to the benefit of the dominant tenement, and to the detriment of the servient. It is open to contracting parties to provide that an easement, particularly in the case of a non-continuous easement such as a right of way, shall include certain of such rights and shall exclude others. An obvious example, in relation to a right of way, can be found in Parts I and II of Sch. VIII to the Conveyancing Act , that is, rights of carriageway and rights of footway. If such separation of rights can be achieved expressly, I can see no reason why they cannot be achieved by implication from conduct. 

 ... [the judge then considered two cases which had been cited to him and continued] 

 I do not think that either of these cases requires me to hold that abandonment of one of the rights included in the parcel of rights created by the grant is not possible. I think it may well be more difficult to establish such abandonment where there is user of other rights over the locus, but that is, of course, a different question. There is a decision directly in point admittedly given prior to the two decisions I have mentioned in which Macfarlan J. held that a right of carriageway could be pruned down to a right of footway by virtue of such acts and omissions as would at common law be sufficient to infer abandonment: Webster v Strong (33). The land in that case was under the Torrens System, and the trial judge stated a case to the Full Court on the question whether the fact that the grantees certificate of title stated that he was entitled to a right of carriageway over the site of the way was conclusive in his favour that he was so entitled. The Full Court answered the question in the affirmative, and their conclusion was followed and applied by Gillard J. in Riley v Pentilla (34). These decisions must, of course, be considered in the light of the provision of s. 89 of the Conveyancing Act , but the conclusion of Macfarlan J. as to implied abandonment of a right to use vehicles, other than vehicles able to go through a 4-foot gateway, supports the view I have reached as a matter of principle. I am, therefore, of opinion that, where the grant of an easement creates a parcel of rights, the grantee may, by reason of his appropriate acts or omissions, be held to have abandoned one or more of such rights. 

Sinc e Needham J went on to hold that the fac ts of his c ase did not disc lose an intention to abandon any part of the right of way and the dominant tenement still had vehic ular ac c ess over the way, his views as stated above were dic ta. Mr Wee submitted that I should therefore disregard them. Ac c epting that they are dic ta and also persuasive rather than binding, I c onsider Needham J`s opinion to be logic al and c oherent. I c annot see any logic al reason why a party should not be able to evinc e an intention to give up part of his rights without affec ting the whole of his rights as long as the part surrendered is severable from that retained. In this c ase, the owners of the dominant tenement had made it impossible for themselves to enjoy vehic ular ac c ess to the servient tenement and at the 


least, they have evinc ed an intention to abandon that right. If nec essary, therefore, I would have found in favour of Frontfield on this argument on this issue. 

**_Obsolescence_** 

The final argument put forward by Frontfield was that I should strike down the easement as being obsolete and unnec essarily enc umbering the servient tenement. I listened to Mr Shanmugam`s arguments with great interest as indeed did Mr Wee though he did not find it nec essary to reply to them. I need not deal with the c ontentions in detail in view of my earlier findings. I will, however, express my views briefly. 

As the law stands at present, I do not ac c ept that there is any doc trine that entitles me to do what Mr Shanmugam wants me to. Case after c ase has emphasised the value of an easement to the dominant tenement and the weight of evidenc e that must be adduc ed to allow the c ourt to infer that the easement has been voluntarily given up. Suc h a situation is inimic al to any right on the part of the c ourt to unilaterally strike down an easement bec ause it c onsiders the easement obsolete. In other jurisdic tions it has been found nec essary to statutorily empower the c ourts to do this. It is c lear that suc h powers do not spring from the c ommon law as it c urrently stands. Our Parliament has not given the c ourt any powers of extinguishment of easements. It has only empowered the c ourt to, in c ertain c irc umstanc es, extinguish or vary restric tions on land whic h has been brought under the land titles system. For the time being, Parliament has not seen fit to legislate on the extinguishment of easements for obsolesc enc e. In the absenc e of suc h legislation, I do not think that I c an, sitting as a judge of first instanc e, exerc ise any suc h power. 

**_Conclusion_** 

Having found that the easement has been abandoned I therefore dec lare that the right of way and passage and all other rights and easements appurtenant to land marked on the Government Resurvey Map as Lot 5915X (being part of the former Lot 120-12) of Mukim 26 subsisting over that piec e of land marked on the Government Resurvey Map as Lot 98082L (formerly known as Lot 120-13) of Mukim 26 have been extinguished. I will hear the parties on c osts and any other c onsequential order that may need to be made. 

## Outcome: 

Dec laration granted.
