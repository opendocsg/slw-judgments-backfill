### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

1\. This is an applic ation by the plaintiff for leave to c ommenc e a derivative ac tion in the name of the third defendant c ompany against the first and sec ond defendants. The plaintiff as well as the first and sec ond defendants were at the material times, direc tors of the third defendant. The thrust of the plaintiff's applic ation is founded on breac h of fiduc iary duties of direc tors. The subjec t matter were payments made in 1997 and 1998 by the Australian Wheat Board (later renamed and rec onstituted as the Australian Wheat Board Limited) by way of rebates known as "volume rebates" for the purc hase of wheat by the third defendant from them. Nothing signific ant turns on the c hange of name of the Australian body so it may c onveniently be referred to as the Australian Wheat Board. The plaintiff c laims that the third defendant c ompany, as the c ustomer of the Australian Wheat Board, was the rightful party entitled to these rebates but it never rec eived them bec ause the Australian Wheat Board gave the rebates to various other parties on the instruc tions of the first defendant and one Tom Goh, a manager of the third defendant. The third defendant was not a party when the plaintiff took out this applic ation. Counsel for the c ompany asked for leave to make submissions on behalf of t h e c ompany. Leave was refused sinc e the c ompany was not a party to the proc eedings. Consequently, an applic ation was made and the c ompany bec ame the third defendant in these proc eedings. 

2\. Mr. Lim appearing on behalf of the first and sec ond defendants oppose the plaintiff’s applic ation on two grounds. First, he says that the third defendant was not entitled to the rebates; and sec ondly, that the applic ation must fail bec ause the plaintiff himself c onsented to the rebates being paid to some external parties, and thus he has not ac ted in good faith when he brought the present proc eedings before the c ourt. Mr. Bull, on behalf of the third defendant, made a similar submission in opposing this applic ation. In support of their respec tive positions, the parties filed numerous and lengthy affidavits. Notwithstanding that, Mr. Lim sought leave to file some more affidavits to refute "serious and wrongful assertions of fac ts" by the plaintiff. He also submitted that c ross-examination of some deponents would be nec essary for the c ourt to determine who speaks the truth. I shall address these points shortly, but first, it will be helpful to lay down some relevant details. 


3\. The plaintiff was a major shareholder of the third defendant and was one of its direc tors until his removal in August 2000, the reason for whic h he c laims, was to prevent him from making further inquiry into the rebate payments in question. He is presently a 40% shareholder of the third defendant. The first defendant now holds 20% of the shares and a c ompany c alled Intermilling Hong Kong Limited holds the remaining 40% shares and whose interests are being represented by the sec ond defendant on the board of direc tors of the third defendant. The plaintiff avers that the third defendant began purc hasing wheat from the Australian Wheat Board in 1997 and it was only in late Dec ember 1999 that he disc overed that rebates were paid to c ustomers and that the third defendant enjoyed rebates of US$1.75 per metric tonne in 1997 and US$2.25 per metric tonne in 1998. However, he learnt from James Dewan, the regional marketing manager of the Australian Wheat Board, that the rebates amounting to US$950,000 were paid to third party bank ac c ounts (one of whic h was said to be in Hong Kong) on the instruc tions of the first defendant. Consequently, in June 2000, the plaintiff through his solic itors demanded to inspec t the third defendant's ac c ounts. Instead, he was removed as a direc tor on 11 August 2000 and was denied ac c ess to the ac c ounts. 

4\. The first and sec ond defendants initially denied that the third defendant was entitled to any rebate from the Australian Wheat Board. They also deposed that the c ompany purc hased wheat for an Indonesian entity known as BULOG (an ac ronym for _Banda Urusan Logistik_ ) and that if any rebate was given it would have been rightfully given to BULOG. On my direc tion, parties obtained the evidenc e from the Australian Wheat Board. It wrote a letter dated 8 November 2001 to the plaintiff stating that Citra Flour Mill was its c ustomer from 1997 to 1999. The Australian Wheat Board also stated in its 8 November letter that it paid rebates to whic hever ac c ount as may be instruc ted by the first defendant or Tom Goh. It also said that the Australian Wheat Board did not know what relationship BULOG had with the third defendant and neither did it have any dealings with BULOG. The said letter suggested that rebates due to Citra Flour Mill in 1997 and 1998 were paid Mitsubishi Australia Limited, and a c ompany c alled Gismo Investments Limited, a c ompany in whic h the first defendant was also a direc tor until 21 August 2001. In addition to these rebates, whic h were known as "volume rebates", the Australian Wheat Board also gave "pric e rebates" on the pric e of wheat sold. The plaintiff avers that these pric e rebates, like the volume rebates, were also paid to unauthorized third party ac c ounts when they ought rightfully be paid to the third defendant. The pric e rebates c ame to a sum of US$9,168,083.33 and were paid to a c ompany c alled Milling Consultants whic h is owned by the first defendant and his wife. 

5\. The first and sec ond defendants' version of the story was this. Before the third defendant was c reated, there was a c ompany c alled Comfez whic h ac ted as the broker in purc hasing wheat from the Australian Wheat Board on behalf of BULOG whic h in turn sold the wheat to Citra Flour Mills Persada (Citra Flour Mills - Citra Flour Mills is now known as PT Panganmas Inti Persada and the plaintiff is its majority shareholder as well as President Direc tor). In the sc heme of arrangement, all rebates from the Australian Wheat Board were paid to an ac c ount of a c ompany c alled Wheatrac Limited; and the money in this ac c ount went to the individual shareholders of Citra Flour Mills. After the third defendant was inc orporated on 7 August 2001 and took over the role previously played by Comfez, the rebates (hitherto paid to Wheatrac ) were paid to Gismo Investments Ltd, and presumably, the plaintiff and his father who were its shareholders. No rebates were ever paid to Comfez or the third defendant. And on this ac c ount, it was submitted on behalf of all the defendants, that the plaintiff's applic ation must fail bec ause the third defendant was not entitled to any rebate, and sec ondly, given the role of Gismo Investments Ltd and the plaintiff's shareholding in it, the plaintiff obviously did not ac t in good faith when he made the applic ation. 

6\. Miss Hing responded on behalf of the plaintiff by asserting that the bank ac c ount of Gismo Investments Ltd was operated solely by the first defendant who did not ac c ount to him or his father. This was a strange state of affairs, the how’s and why’s of whic h were not adequately explained. 


Counsel also referred me to the plaintiff's fourth affidavit whic h explains the purpose of Gismo Investments Ltd and why the first defendant was employed by that c ompany, namely to provide c onsultanc y servic es to a c ompany c alled Citra Flour Mills Nusantara. She also pointed to the apparent weaknesses in a Pric e Waterhouse Coopers’ report of 14 Dec ember 2001 whic h stated in its c onc lusion that it was BULOG whic h is entitled to the rebates. The plaintiff also denied any knowledge of payment of rebates into or out of Gismo Investments Ltd's ac c ount in his fourth affidavit. Henc e, Mr. Lim sought leave to file a further affidavit in response to this, and also to have the plaintiff c rossexamined. I do not see any need to expand or broaden the c ase at this stage. At this stage the c ourt need not and ought not be drawn into an adjudic ation on the disputed fac ts. That is what a _prima facie_ legitimate or arguable c ase is all about. Leave to c ross-examine in suc h situations ought to be sparingly granted. I need only c onsider the grounds and points of c hallenge raised by the defendants to see if they are suffic ient in themselves to destroy the c redibility of the plaintiff's propounded c ase without a full sc ale hearing to determine who was truthful and who was not. 

7\. The requirements under s 216A of the Companies Ac t that the applic ant has to satisfy are straightforward and are set out in sub-s 3 of that sec tion. The defendants in this c ase c hallenged the applic ation on all three requirements. I shall deal quic kly with the shortest one first. Mr. Bull argued that the plaintiff did not give the requisite 14 days notic e bec ause he applied to amend the applic ation to inc lude a c laim for the pric e rebate when his applic ation was initiated on the basis of a c laim for "volume rebates". In my view, the amendment was in respec t of the partic ulars; the ac tion for whic h leave was sought c onc erned a breac h of fiduc iary duties and I am satisfied that the defendants were in no way prejudic ed by the inc lusion the additional item espec ially sinc e the basic position of the defendants is the same in respec t of both rebates. Sec ondly, in respec t of the argument that the ac tion c annot be in the interests of the c ompany. Mr. Bull referred to the dec ision in _Teo Gek Luang v Ng Ai Tiong & Ors_ <span class="citation">[1999] 1 SLR 434</span> for his argument that the phrase " _prima facie_ in the interests of the c ompany" means that the applic ant must show a good arguable c ase. I set out below the passage relied upon by c ounsel, for ease and c onvenienc e: 

 "Although it was and is a piec e of remedial legislation enac ted to put in plac e a proc edure to protec t the interests of minority shareholders, the interpretation of the provisions should be purposive and I entertained some reservation that a ‘liberal interpretation in favour of the c omplainant should be given as stated by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd v Kalmacoff (1955) 123 DLR (4th) 628, 636. Management dec isions should generally be left to the Board of Direc tors. Members generally c annot sue in the name of the c ompany. A minority shareholder c ould attempt to abuse the new proc edure, whic h would be as undesirable as the tyranny of the majority direc tors who unreasonably refuse to ac t. The Canadian appellate c ourt, however, at the same page went on to say that ‘( b)efore granting leave, the court should be satisfied that there is a reasonable basis for the complaint and that the action sought to be instituted is a legitimate or arguable one. ’ I agree with this latter formulation and adopted that approac h" [Emphasis added] 

8\. I, in turn, agree entirely with what was said in the above c ase. The terms "legitimate" and "arguable" must be given no other meaning other than what is the c ommon and natural one, that is, that the c laim must have a reasonable semblanc e of merit; not that it is bound to suc c eed or likely to suc c eed, but that if proved the c ompany will stand to gain substantially in money or money's worth. But it is axiomatic that ordinarily, legal ac tion is best left to the dec ision of the board of direc tors. It will not be in the interests of a c ompany if all shareholders are at liberty to take it to c ourt on Quixotic c rusades. This is obviously more pertinent where there are many diverse groups of shareholders in the c ompany. In the present c ase, there are admittedly, only three groups of 


shareholders divided into two c amps, one the majority and the other the minority. Furthermore, in this c ase, if the plaintiff is right and proves his c ase, the third defendant stands to gain a large sum of reimbursement from the first and sec ond defendants muc h more than the $13,322.58 that the applic ant in _Teo Gek Luang_ c ase was granted leave to pursue. These are c learly important c onsiderations. However, the requirements under s 216A must first be satisfied. In this regard, one must not lose sight of what the plaintiff sought to ac hieve with this applic ation. That was made c lear from the beginning, namely, that the first and sec ond defendants were in breac h of their fiduc iary duties in c ausing rebates from the Australian Wheat Board to be c hanneled to a third party. The _prima facie_ c ase that he must show is that the c ompany was entitled to these rebates. The affidavits and doc uments that were filed in this c ase, as well as the numerous submissions made by c ounsel for all parties have at best raised some suspic ion that the plaintiff and the first defendant might not have told their stories to c ourt, the full and true. Cutting away the verbiage, dust and smoke, I am satisfied that on the doc umentary evidenc e that Mrs. Thio (who took over as c ounsel for the first and sec ond defendants midway through the proc eedings) drew my attention to in partic ular, the doc uments from the Australian Wheat Board the benefic iary to any rebate from the Australian Wheat Board is the c ompany c alled Citra Flour Mill and not the third defendant. For this reason alone, the plaintiff's applic ation must fail. I ac c ept that there are some unanswered questions, for example, it is c ertainly baffling as to why the first defendant was running a personal ac c ount for Gismo, the c ompany in whic h the plaintiff and his father were at all material times the shareholders and through whic h rebates from the Australian Wheat Board to Citra Flour Mill were paid. Questions suc h as this, by themselves, are not, however, relevant in an applic ation under s 216A. Whether they may be more relevant in some other c ause of ac tion is not nec essary for my c omment, although it will not have esc aped the parties that if the defendants are right, Citra Flour Mill (whic h I understand was and still is under the c ontrol of the plaintiff ) is the proper party to c laim the rebates. That, of c ourse, is another story. Having perused and c onsidered the doc uments and submissions here, I am satisfied that there is no nec essity to file any further affidavit or for any deponent to be c ross-examined. Ac c ordingly, those applic ations are dismissed. 

9\. Counsel for the defendants submitted that the applic ation proper ought to be dismissed bec ause the plaintiff did not ac t in good faith. It is not an important point in view of my finding above, but I will address an argument by Mr. Bull that the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that he ac ted in good faith. The question of the burden of proof on this spec ific issue may end up in the great heap of irrelevanc e, but all that s 216A(3)(b) says is that the c ourt must be satisfied that the applic ant ac ted in good faith. If at all, the burden would be on the opponent to show that the applic ant did not ac t in good faith; for I am entitled, am I not, to assume that every party who c omes to c ourt with a reasonable and legitimate c laim to be ac ting in good faith - until proven otherwise. What the term _good faith_ ac tually means in this c ontext has baffled many an ac ademic sc holar of the law - see, for 

example, _Corporate Law In Canada: The Governing Principles_ (2nd Ed) by GB Welling, at page 528, and _Minority Shareholders' Rights And Remedies_ , M Chew at page 246. It would appear, in my view, that this requirement overlaps in no small way with the requirement that the c laim must be in the interests of the c ompany. Beyond that, whether malic e or vindic tiveness of the applic ant ought to be taken into ac c ount must be left to the touc h and feel of the c ourt in eac h individual c ase bec ause, as in most requirements of the law that repose a measure of disc retion with the c ourt, there are bound to be matters and fac tors that defy any or any prec ise desc ription. Having address my mind thus, I revert to the present c ase. In this regard, I shall have to reiterate my doubts that the parties have been fully c andid. But it must be remembered for the purposes of an applic ation under s 216A, the party whose good faith is put in issue is that of the applic ant. In taking the c irc umstanc es as set out in the affidavits and gleaned from the doc uments, regardless of whose burden it was to prove or disprove good faith, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff c ame before me in good faith. Good faith would have required him to set out the story in full from the beginning but he did not do so. I am not persuaded that he had no idea that the Australian Wheat Board had been giving and paying rebates 


through the c ompany Gismo Investments in whic h he and his father were shareholders and direc tors. The plain statement that the bank ac c ounts of that c ompany were operated by the first defendant alone is not a suffic ient explanation bec ause it raises further questions suc h as to how and why that was allowed to be so. 

10\. For these reasons this applic ation fails and is ac c ordingly dismissed. I shall hear the parties as to the question of c osts at a later date if they are unable to agree.
