### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

**_Introduction_** 

1\. The infant, who was the subjec t of the appeal before me, was born in the mid-1990s. He is a male Malay. 

2\. On 21 Marc h 1997, an adoption order was made (‘the Adoption Order’) in respec t of the infant in favour of the Appellants whose names I am also not mentioning bec ause of the sensitive nature of the matter before me. The Appellants are also Malays. 

3\. At the time the Adoption Order was made, the full name of the infant c onferred by the Adoption Order inc luded his original name whic h in turn referred to the name of his natural father e.g the adopted name was XYZ Bin M, ‘M’ being the name of his natural father. 

4\. As a result, the birth c ertific ate of the infant issued on 30 May 1997 reflec ts the adopted name but save as aforesaid, there is no suggestion therein that the infant is adopted by the Appellants whose names are rec orded in the birth c ertific ate as his father and mother. 

5\. In 2002, the Appellants applied to amend the Adoption Order to delete any referenc e in the adopted name to the infant’s original name and for an order that the Registrar-General of Births and Deaths be direc ted to re-register the birth and issue a new birth c ertific ate in ac c ordanc e with the amended Adoption Order. 

6\. In their supporting affidavit, the Appellants said they had not deleted the original name of the infant from the adopted name at the time when they applied to adopt him bec ause they believed that neither the natural father, his wife or his family would disc lose to the infant his true identity after the Adoption Order was made. I should add that the natural father is a brother of the adopting mother. 

7\. As events turned out, the infant was in c ontac t with his natural siblings. 

8\. Apparently for the last three months before the applic ation was made, these c hildren, as well as other c ousins of the infant, have been telling him that he is not the natural son of the Appellants 


but of his natural father. This c aused him to be very sad and inquisitive. By then, he was about seven years of age. 

9\. For better or worse, the Appellants did not respond to his inquisitiveness by telling him the truth. Instead, they told him that he is their son, meaning their natural son. The infant then insisted on seeing his birth c ertific ate thus c ausing the Appellants to be afraid that he would be ‘terribly emotionally affec ted’ when he learns the truth. 

10\. Henc e, the applic ation was made to amend the Adoption Order. The applic ation was heard by Distric t Judge Regina Ow. The Attorney-General who was the guardian ad litem for the infant pending the making of the Adoption Order appeared and objec ted to the applic ation on the basis that the c ourt had no jurisdic tion to amend the Adoption Order as the c ourt was func tus offic io after the Adoption Order was made. 

11\. The Distric t Judge dismissed the applic ation on the ground that she had no jurisdic tion to amend the Adoption Order. The Appellants then appealed and I heard their appeal. After hearing submissions, I dismissed the appeal. I now give my written reasons. 

**_My reasons_** 

12\. Ms Dyan Zuzarte, from the Attorney-General’s Chambers, drew my attention to an unreported dec ision of Mic hael Hwang JC (as he then was) in Adoption Petition No 143 of 1990 where he held that he had no power to allow amendment of an infant’s name to inc lude his Hanyu Pinyin name after the adoption order was made and perfec ted. However, no written reasons were given. 

13\. Counsel for the Appellants, Ms Halimah Bte Abdul Jalil argued that that dec ision was wrong. 

14\. She submitted that the c ourt had jurisdic tion to amend the Adoption Order notwithstanding that it had been made and perfec ted. She relied on s 16 and 17 of the Supreme Court of Judic ature Ac t (Cap 322) but it was quite c lear to me that those provisions did not address the question whether the c ourt had jurisdic tion to amend an order after it was made and perfec ted. Moreover, the initial applic ation of the Appellants for amendment was made to the Distric t Court and not to the High Court (whic h is part of the Supreme Court). 

15\. Counsel for the Appellants then submitted that para 14 of the First Sc hedule to the Supreme Court of Judic ature Ac t (Amendment) Ac t 1993 provides that the c ourt has ‘powers to grant all reliefs and remedies at law and in equity’ but again, for the same reasons I have mentioned, this provision did not help. 

16\. Counsel for the Appellants also relied on O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court whic h states: 

 ‘4 For the removal of doubt it is hereby dec lared that nothing in these Rules shall be deemed to limit or affec t the inherent powers of the Court to make any order as may be nec essary to prevent injustic e or to prevent an abuse of the proc ess of the Court.’ 

She then c ited _Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore_ <span class="citation">[2001] 4 SLR 25</span>. 

17\. However the fac ts in the c ase she c ited were different and did not involve the question of amending an order that had been made and perfec ted. 

18\. Furthermore, as far as I was aware, O 92 r 4 has never been used by a c ourt or any party to 


amend an order already made and perfec ted. Rather it is used to persuade a c ourt to make an order before the c ourt makes its order. 

19\. I was of the view that the Distric t Judge was c orrec t in c onc luding that the c ourt had no jurisdic tion to amend the Adoption Order after it had been made and perfec ted, unless the amendment was being sought under what is known as the slip-rule. This was not the c ase before me. 

20\. I also c onsidered whether a c ourt c ould vary the Adoption Order, as opposed to amending it, on the basis of a c hange of c irc umstanc es akin to a variation of maintenanc e for a woman and/or a c hild under the Women’s Charter Ac t (Cap 353). However, that variation is allowed under spec ific provisions of the Women’s Charter and, even then, suc h a variation does not relate bac k to the date of the original maintenanc e order. 

21\. Having c onsidered the sc heme under the Ac t and in partic ular s 12 thereof, I was of the view that the c hange of name for an adopted infant arises only when an adoption order is made. 

22\. The material parts of s 12 state: 

 ‘12.(1) Where an adoption order has been made, the Registrar of the c ourt by whic h the adoption order was made shall forthwith send to the RegistrarGeneral of Births and Deaths a notic e in the form set out in the Sc hedule, setting out the following partic ulars so far as they are known to the c ourt: 

 (a) the full name of the c hild before the making of the adoption order; 

 (b) the full name of the c hild c onferred by the adoption order; 

 [the other sub-provisions are not material.] 

 (2) .... 

 (3) Upon rec eipt of the form referred to in subsec tion (1), the RegistrarGeneral shall if the birth of the adopted c hild has been registered in Singapore c ause the entry in the relevant registrar of births to be marked with the word "Adopted". Partic ulars as to the birth of the c hild shall then be registered separately substituting the name c onferred by the adoption for the name of the c hild prior to adoption, and rec ording the name, address and desc ription of eac h adopting parent in substitution for the partic ulars as to the natural or last adopting parents. 

 (4) .... 

 (5) Where a c opy of the entry as to the birth of any c hild to whic h this sec tion relates is required for any purpose, the RegistrarGeneral, subjec t to any regulations as to payment of fees as are presc ribed, shall supply a c opy of the last entry made pursuant to subsec tion (3) omitting in the c opy of the word "Adopted" that appears in the original or former entry.’ 

 [Emphasis added.] 

23\. If an adopted infant or his adopting parents are not happy with the name c hosen at the time the adoption order is made, then the c hange of name has to be effec ted by a deed poll but this will not alter the name in the birth c ertific ate. 

24\. My attention was also drawn to a dec ision by Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) in _Re ABZ_ 


_(An infant)_ <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR 445</span>. In that c ase, the infant was a Chinese and his natural parents were Chinese. However the natural father had died and the mother married a man, Mr Z, of Japanese origin. They adopted the infant with Mr Z’s surname. Subsequently, Mr and Mrs Z were divorc ed and the mother had c ustody of the infant and had no intention of settling in Japan. The infant went to sc hool in Singapore and, ac c ording to the mother, was humiliated by other students bec ause of the Japanese surname. The mother then applied to set aside the adoption order and Mr Z had no objec tion to the applic ation. 

25\. Justic e Chan dec ided this c ould not be done. He went on to say that the infant’s surname c ould be c hanged by a deed poll, but added, at p 445 A/B: 

 ‘... However, I note that the Ac t makes no provision for a birth c ertific ate issued pursuant to s 12 to be c hanged to reflec t a c hange of name.’ 

I agreed. 

26\. I should add that Justic e Chan was also of the view that the mother in the c ase before him was not without rec ourse as she c ould invoke s 9 of the Ac t to re-adopt the infant under the intended new name. 

27\. Sec tion 9 states: 

 ‘9. An adoption order or an interim order may be made in respec t of an infant who has already been the subjec t of an adoption order, and, upon any applic ation for suc h further adoption order, the adopter or adopters under the adoption order last previously made shall, if living, be deemed to be the parent or parents of the infant for all the purposes of this Ac t.’ 

 [Emphasis added.] 

28\. I was of the view that on the fac ts before me, it was not possible for both the Appellants to apply to re-adopt the infant under s 9 bec ause s 9 envisages re-adoption by different adopting parents. It is not nec essary for me to express a view whether one of the Appellants c an apply to re- adopt the infant sinc e suc h an applic ation will c reate other problems for the infant as the name of one of the Appellants will then drop out from the birth c ertific ate to be issued. 

29\. There is also one more point whic h I would wish to make. Although the Appellants might have good intentions, they were in effec t asking the c ourt to assist them to c ontinue to bluff the infant. I had serious reservations as to whether the c ourt should be an ac c omplic e in this endeavour even if it had the jurisdic tion and power to do so. 

30\. Ultimately, the Appellants have no legal rec ourse. However, it is prec isely bec ause there may be no rec ourse that adopting parents must take great c are in the c hoic e of the adopted name.
