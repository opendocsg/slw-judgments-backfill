**Counsel Name(s)** :Engelin Teh SC and Thomas Sim (Engelin Teh & Partners) for the plaintiffs; Philip Fong and Melanie Ho (Harry Elias Partnership) for the defendants in both suits 

**Parties** :De Souza Tay & Goh (suing as a firm) — Singapore Press Holdings Ltd 

Tort – Defamation – Libel – Natural and ordinary meaning – Innuendos meaning – Applicable principles – Whether words and graphics of article defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning 

- Whether words and graphics of article defamatory in their innuendos 

: The plaintiffs are a partnership c arrying on business as a law firm. The partners in the plaintiffs are David De Souza, Cedric Tay Yat Hoc k and Goh Kok Yeow. The defendants in Suit 858/2000 are the owners of The Straits Times (`TST`), the princ ipal daily English newspaper in Singapore. The defendant in Suit 859/2000 is a journalist with TST. 

In these ac tions, the plaintiffs c laim damages from both defendants for libel in respec t of the public ation of an artic le (`the Artic le`) whic h appeared in the 27 September 2000 edition of TST. The plaintiffs assert that the words, together with the photographs and graphic al representations (c ollec tively c alled `the graphic `) of the Artic le are, in their natural and ordinary meaning, defamatory of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs also assert that the said material, when read in the light of an earlier artic le published in the 26 September 2000 edition of TST (`the 26 September artic le`), is also defamatory of the plaintiffs in their innuendo meaning. 

On 4 Dec ember 2000, the plaintiffs filed separate applic ations in these ac tions under O 14 r 12 for the determination of: 

(1) the natural and ordinary meaning; and 

(2) the innuendo meaning, 

of the words and the graphic of the Artic le. 

The plaintiffs have pleaded in their statement of c laim that the words and the graphic , in their natural and ordinary meaning and/or in their innuendo meaning, meant that: 

(1) the plaintiffs are partic ipants and/or are direc tly or indirec tly involved in the suspec ted illegal and/or fraudulent ac tivity of Lernout & Hauspie and/or its c o-founders and/or its lic ensees whic h ac tivity is being investigated into by the United States Sec urities and Exc hange Commission; and 

(2) the plaintiffs` c onduc t when c ontac ted by the defendants prior to the public ation of the words, the graphic illustration and the c aptioned photograph was evasive, thus lending further weight and c redenc e to the above allegation. 

The senior assistant registrar who heard the applic ations below disagreed with this and held that the 27 September artic le was not defamatory of the plaintiffs. Consequently, he ordered the plaintiffs` statement of c laim in both ac tions to be struc k out on the ground that there was no reasonable 


c ause of ac tion against the defendants in both ac tions and ac c ordingly dismissed those ac tions. 

Before me, the plaintiffs appealed against the whole of that dec ision. 

**_The 27 September article_** 

The subjec t matter of these ac tions was published in the `Money` sec tion of the 27 September 2000 edition of TST, at p 88. The Artic le c an be divided into two parts: (1) the words; and (2) the graphic. Together they c over 32%, or almost a third, of the entire page. The graphic appears at the top of the Artic le. It c omprises a flow c hart indic ating transac tions between a number of c ompanies with ac c ompanying words and a photograph that appears to be the name plate of the plaintiffs` offic e. The words of the Artic le c omprise a headline in large bold print, a sub-headline in medium bold print and the text of the Artic le. 

The princ ipal subjec t of the Artic le is a Belgian c ompany known as Lernout & Hauspie (`L&H`). The following self-explanatory desc ription is found on its internet home page: 

 Lernout & Hauspie is the worlds leading provider of speech and language technology products, solutions, and services to businesses and individuals worldwide. It is our mission to break down language barriers through advanced translation technology and to enable people to interact by voice-in any language-with the machines that empower them. Through such enhanced communication, we believe people will lead richer, more fulfilling lives. 

The graphic itself has a headline and it proc laims `Belgian-Singapore Connec tion`. This is followed by a flowc hart whic h indic ates a c irc ular flow of transac tions between various entities inside four boxes. Beginning with the princ ipal subjec t, the first box states as follows: 

 Lernout & Hauspie (L&H) 

 Belgian maker of Speech recognition software. 

 Listed on Nasdaq. Asia-Pacific HQ in Singapore 

An arrow emanates from this box towards the sec ond box whic h states as follows: 

 L&H co-founders Messrs Lernout & Hauspie 

 are among the investors who started FLV Fund. 

A sec ond arrow emanates from this box to the third box whic h says: 

 FLV Fund 

 Listed in Brussels 


A third arrow emanates from this box to the fourth box whic h states: 

 15 Singapore registered companies 

Ac c ompanying this third arrow are the following words: 

 Paid millions last year for stakes in some companies. Sold the stakes months later to a South Korean company. 

These words would be understood to mean that FLV Fund had, in the previous year, paid the `millions` for stakes in the 15 Singapore-registered c ompanies whic h it subsequently sold to a South Korean c ompany. 

From the fourth box, a fourth arrow emanates towards the first box with the following words next to it: 

 Pays US$57 million, boosting L&Hs Singapore revenue from US$29,000 in 1998 to US$80.3 m last year. 

These words would be understood as asserting that the 15 c ompanies had paid out US$57m in total to L&H, c ausing its revenue to rise from US$29,000 to US$80.3m the previous year. 

There is a fifth arrow emanating from the first box towards the fourth box and this is ac c ompanied by the words: `Sells software rights`. This would be understood to mean that the software rights were sold by L&H to those 15 c ompanies in c onsideration for the US$57m. 

At the bottom of the fourth box relating to the 15 c ompanies are the following words: `Common address in law firm De Souza Tay & Goh in Shenton Way`. Underneath those words is the photograph of what appears to be the name plate of the plaintiffs` offic e. 

Finally, at the bottom left c orner of the graphic are the following words in bold print: 

 FLV FUNDS INVOLVEMENT IN THE SINGAPORE COMPANIES RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT L&HS FAST SALES GROWTH MAY NOT BE ALL THAT IT APPEARS Asian Wall Street Journal 

This would be understood to be a quote from the Asian Wall Street Journal. 

Below the graphic is the headline of the Artic le whic h states, in large bold print: `L&H lic ensees: Two sat on 678 boards`. 

And below that is a sub-headline in smaller bold print whic h states: 

 They were directors for just a couple of weeks in many instances; the figures 


 are high but legal, says lawyer 

Below all that, the text of the Artic le appears. I reproduc e it in full below (with paragraph numbers added for ease of referenc e): 

 1 Two of the shareholders of Lernout & Hauspies (L&Hs) licensees here have been directors of a total of some 670 companies in the past few years, according to official records. 

 2 The pair are Messrs Soh Leng Woon and Lee Li Ching, according to a check with the Registry of Companies and Businesses yesterday. 

 3 Going by their identification numbers, both are in their mid-30s. 

 4 They are listed as shareholders of at least three L&H licensees in Singapore: IMail, I-News and I-Office. 

 5 These companies are among the 15 sharing a single address in Shenton Way, which L&H said paid it US$57 million (S$100 million) last year for rights to L&Hs speech-recognition software. 

 6 They and another four also relatively unknown companies helped propel L&Hs revenue from Singapore to US$80.3 million last year from a mere US$29,000 the year before, making the Republic the Nasdaq-listed companys biggest customer. 

 7 L&H said it had experienced a jump in revenue from Asia. But a cloud has been cast over this with the launch of a probe into the recent surge in its Asia sales by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 8 The Asian Wall Street Journal (AWSJ) had reported the investigation which has since been confirmed. 

 9 It had also said that some of these Singapore companies had in fact received millions in investments from a venture-capital fund set up by the two L&H cofounders. 

 10 In Singapore, L&H Asia-Pacific president Louis Woo, when asked about what the 19 companies registered here did or who owned or managed them, told The Straits Times: "Im not familiar with the shareholders of these companies." 

 11 Official records show that Messrs Soh Leng Woon and Lee Li Ching have been directors briefly a couple of weeks in many instances of over 500 and 178 companies respectively. 

 12 A lawyer said these are high figures but legal. 

 13 "So long as the law allows, why cant a citizen lend his name for a fee? But he is liable should anything go wrong in the company," he said. 


 14 It is not uncommon for people to be appointed directors to form companies and then replaced when long-term shareholders are found. 

 15 Many of the 678 firms are not listed in the telephone directory, and some could be shell companies. 

 16 Details on the 15 Singapore licensees of L&Hs software are hard to come by. What is known is that they have a common registered address in a law firm at UIC Building in Shenton Way. 

 17 Ms Tan Lee Chin who works in the law firm, is listed as their secretary and director but she declined to comment when contacted by The Straits Times. 

 18 Attempts to reach the partners of the law firm, De Souza Tay & Goh, were unsuccessful. 

 19 Other lawyers said it was common for companies to use law firms or accountancy firms as their registered addresses. 

 20 Explained one: "Its a matter of convenience. They may not be active here and they appoint the law firms lawyers as company secretaries and sleeping directors. The address is for the purpose of official correspondence and public notices." 

 21 L&H has declined to say where the 15 licensee companies operate. 

 22 An AWSJ report quoted a L&H spokesman in Belgium saying they have operations "in Belgium and other parts of the world". 

 23 But he could not provide exact addresses for the operations of any of the companies, said the journal. 

 24 He also said that the journals report had raised doubts unfairly about whether the start-up companies had real operations. [Paragraphs are numbered for ease of reference.] 

At the last page of that edition of TST there is a referenc e to the Artic le (`the blurb`). It oc c upies a small c entral bloc k at the top of the page. It is plac ed there to attrac t the reader`s attention to the Artic le and direc t him to the relevant page. The blurb c omprises (1) a c olour photograph of what appears to be the entranc e to the plaintiffs` offic e showing their name plate; and (2) a c aption whic h reads as follows: 

 Keeping Busy 

 Two shareholders of Lernout & Hauspies licensees have been directors of 670 companies.[emsp ]PAGE 88 


### NATURAL AND ORDINARY MEANING OF THE ARTICLE 

The plaintiffs pleaded that the words and the graphic of the Artic le have the same meaning in their natural and ordinary meaning and innuendo meaning. I first c onsider the natural and ordinary meaning of the Artic le. In **Microsoft Corp v SM Summit Holdings** <span class="citation">[1999] 4 SLR 529</span> , the Court of Appeal stated that the general princ iples pertaining to the determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of words in a defamation ac tion were well established. The c ourt summarised these princ iples as follows (at [para ]53 and 54): 

 53 The principles applicable in determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of in a defamation action are well-established. The court decides what meaning the words would have conveyed to an ordinary, reasonable person using his general knowledge and common sense: Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Goh Chok Tong [1984-1985] SLR 516 [1985] 1 MLJ 334 and Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew , supra. The test is an objective one: it is the natural and ordinary meaning as understood by an ordinary, reasonable person, not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal. The meaning intended by the maker of the defamatory statement is irrelevant. Similarly, the sense in which the words were actually understood by the party alleged to have been defamed is also irrelevant. Nor is extrinsic evidence admissible in construing the words. The meaning must be gathered from the words themselves and in the context of the entire passage in which they are set out. The court is not confined to the literal or strict meaning of the words, but takes into account what the ordinary, reasonable person may reasonably infer from the words. The ordinary, reasonable person reads between the lines. This court in the latter case said at pp 318-319: 

 In determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of, the sense or meaning intended by the appellant is irrelevant. Nor for such purpose is the sense or meaning in which the words were understood by the respondent relevant. Nor is extrinsic evidence admissible in construing the words. The meaning must be gathered from the words themselves and in the context of the entire speech made by the appellant on that occasion. It is the natural and ordinary meaning as understood by reasonable members of the audience at the Bedok car park on that evening using their general knowledge and common sense. Such meaning is not confined to a literal or strict meaning of the words, but includes any references or implications which could reasonably be drawn by such persons ... 

 54 Lord Reid said in the oft-cited case of Rubber Improvement Ltd v Daily Telegraph Ltd [1964] AC 234 at p 258: 

 What the ordinary man would infer without special knowledge has generally been called the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. But that expression is rather misleading in that it conceals the fact that there are two elements in it. Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the words themselves, as where the plaintiff has been called a thief or a murderer. But more often the sting is not so much in the words themselves as in what the ordinary man will infer from them, and that is also part of their natural and ordinary meaning. Here there would be nothing libellous in saying that an inquiry into the appellants affairs was proceeding: the inquiry might be by a statistician or other expert. 


 The sting is in inferences drawn from the fact that it is the fraud squad which is making the inquiry. What those inferences should be is ultimately a question for the jury, but the trial judge has an important duty to perform ... 

 This passage has time and again been approved by our courts and also by this court: see Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin and another action <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 337</span> at p 346. In that case, this court also held that, in considering the inferences to be drawn, it is relevant to bear in mind the observations made by the English Court of Appeal in Skuse v Granada Television Ltd [1996] EMLR 278 at p 285: 

### `... 

 (2) The hypothetical reasonable reader [or viewer] is not naïve but he is not unduly suspicious. He can read between the lines. He can read in an implication more readily than a lawyer, and may indulge in a certain amount of loose thinking. But he must be treated as being a man who is not avid for scandal and someone who does not, and should not, select one bad meaning where other non-defamatory meanings are available. 

### ... 

 (3) While limiting its attention to what the defendant has actually said or written, the court should be cautious of an over-elaborate analysis of the material in issue. We were reminded of Diplock LJs cautionary words in Slim v Daily Telegraph Ltd [1968] 2 QB 157 at p 171: "... In the present case, we must remind ourselves that this was a factual programme, likely to appeal primarily to a seriously minded section of television viewers, but it was a programme which, even if watched continuously, would have been seen only once by viewers, many of whom may have switched on for entertainment. Its audience would not have given it the analytical attention of a lawyer to the meaning of a document, an auditor to the interpretation of accounts, or an academic to the content of a learned article. In deciding what impression the material complained of would have been likely to have on the hypothetical reasonable viewer we are entitled (if not bound) to have regard to the impression it made on us." 

From the foregoing the following general princ iples for determining the natural and ordinary meaning of words in a defamation ac tion may be distilled: 

(1) It is an objec tive test involving the determination of the meaning that would be c onveyed by the words to an ordinary, reasonable person: 

(a) using his general knowledge and c ommon sense; 

(b) who is not unduly suspic ious or avid for sc andal. 


(2) The following c onsiderations are irrelevant: 

(a) the meaning intended by the maker of the statement; and 

(b) the sense in whic h the words were understood by the plaintiff. 

(3) Extrinsic evidenc e is not admissible in c onstruing the meaning of the words. 

(4) The nature of the audienc e is to be taken into ac c ount. 

There are of c ourse spec ific princ iples formulated for various c irc umstanc es that have arisen in the authorities and these will be c onsidered in the analysis below. 

In the Artic le, the direc t referenc es to the plaintiffs are as follows: 

(i) Three statements, one in the graphic and two at paras 5 and 16 of the text (read with paras 17 and 18), that the 15 Singapore-registered c ompanies involved in the matter have a c ommon address in the plaintiffs` premises at Shenton Way. 

(ii) One of the plaintiffs` employees, Ms Tan Lee Chin, is the sec retary and direc tor of the 15 c ompanies. She dec lined to c omment when c ontac ted by TST (para 17). 

(iii) Attempts by TST to reac h the partners of the plaintiffs were unsuc c essful (para 18). 

As for the blurb, there is no referenc e to the plaintiffs in the c aption, but the photograph shows the name plate of the firm. However, the c ombination of the size and font of the letters and the lac k of c ontrast in the photograph, the name is not easily made out at a glanc e. 

The literal meaning of the direc t referenc es to the plaintiffs in the Artic le are c learly not defamatory. Neither is it the plaintiffs` c ase that they are. Instead, they rely on the inferenc es that may be drawn from the words and graphic of the Artic le. The plaintiffs agree with the defendants that the main foc us of the Artic le is the investigation mounted by the United States Sec urities and Exc hange Commission (`the SEC`) into the suspec ted c riminal ac tivities of L&H and their lic ensees. However, the plaintiffs argue that the effec t of the Artic le is to suggest an insidious link or c onnec tion between the plaintiffs and suc h c riminal ac tivities and in the proc ess they were ` **_tarred by the same brush_** `. 

It is therefore nec essary to first c onsider what this brush has tarred in respec t of the villain of the piec e, L&H. The bold headline is the first thing that c atc hes one`s attention. It states `L&H lic ensees: Two sat on 678 boards`. From there one would either glanc e at the graphic immediately above it, or the sub-headline below it. The message c onveyed by the graphic and the sub-headline is that L&H had c hannelled their funds, via an inc estuous network of c ompanies, bac k to themselves disguised as sales of their software. In this manner, L&H had fraudulently boosted their revenue from suc h sales in a single year from a minusc ule US$29,000 to US$80.3m. Proc eeding to the text, paras 1 to 6 desc ribe how two of the shareholders of three of L&H`s lic ensees in Singapore had been direc tors of some 670 c ompanies in the past few years. Those three lic ensees shared the same `address` in Shenton Way as 15 other c ompanies that had paid L&H US$57m in 1999 for their software. Together with four other obsc ure c ompanies, they ac c ounted for the US$80.3m revenue that L&H reported rec eiving in that year. Paragraphs 7 and 8 state that the SEC had launc hed a probe into this surge in sales and therefore ` **_a cloud has been cast_** ` over the matter. The remaining paragraphs provide further details of the story, alternatively highlighting the unusual nature of the 


arrangement and quoting from lawyers who said that suc h arrangements were not unusual. 

The first question is whether the Artic le is defamatory of L&H. A statement that a person is under investigation by an enforc ement agenc y is not c apable of meaning that suc h person is guilty of the c rime being investigated, but it may bear the defamatory meaning that the person is under suspic ion or that there are reasonable grounds for suspic ion: **Lewis v Daily Telegraph** [1964] AC 234[1963] 2 All ER 151. In the present c ase, there is a referenc e to a probe by the SEC whic h is desc ribed as c asting a c loud over the jump in revenue. Added to this is the emphasis in the Artic le on the fac t that two individuals had ac ted as direc tors of 678 c ompanies, many of whic h appear to be shell c ompanies. These two individuals are in turn linked to 15 c ompanies with the same `address` whic h had paid L&H US$57m for software lic enc es. I would c onc lude that the Artic le would be interpreted by the ordinary, reasonable reader to mean that L&H had used these c ompanies to manipulate financ ial transac tions to c reate the impression that they had ac hieved a high sales turnover in 1999 and were therefore guilty of fraudulent c onduc t. At the very least, the Artic le is defamatory of L&H in that it means that there are reasonable grounds for suspic ion that they are guilty of fraud. 

I next have to determine whether there is anything in the Artic le that would reasonably suggest that the plaintiffs had anything to do with suc h fraudulent prac tic es. The plaintiffs argue that the link is in the mention that the 15 Singapore lic ensees have a ` **_common address_** ` in the plaintiffs` offic e. Further, the Artic le mentioned that one of the plaintiffs` employees, Ms Tan Lee Chin who was the sec retary and direc tor of the 15 c ompanies, had dec lined to c omment when c ontac ted by TST and that attempts to reac h the partners of the firm were unsuc c essful. These give the impression that the plaintiffs were being evasive and deliberately avoided c ontac t, thereby indic ating they had something to hide. Counsel for the plaintiffs then stated that the reports of evasiveness were not true and he gave reasons for saying that. However, as this has absolutely no relevanc e in respec t of the determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of the Artic le I need not deal with those reasons. Additionally, the plaintiffs c ontend that the photograph in the blurb at the bac k page further links the plaintiffs to the allegations against L&H. 

The defendants submit firstly that the Artic le did not c ontain anything that was defamatory of the plaintiffs. They submit that even if there were parts of the Artic le that c ould singly or c ollec tively c ast the plaintiffs in a bad light, the bane in those parts were neutralised by the antidote in other parts. In partic ular the defendants point out that in paras 12, 13 and 14, some lawyers were quoted who said that the holding of a large number of direc torships was legal and a c ommon prac tic e. Also in paras 19 and 20 other lawyers were quoted as saying that it was c ommon for c ompanies to use law firms or ac c ountanc y firms as their registered addresses as a matter of c onvenienc e. 

In my opinion the natural and ordinary meaning of the Artic le is not any of the two meanings pleaded in the statement of c laim. Neither does it c ontain any lesser defamatory meaning. In c oming to this c onc lusion, I have borne in mind the princ iples summarised by the Court of Appeal in **_Microsoft Corp v SM Summit Holdings_** (supra). While I have arrived at this determination from reading the Artic le as a whole, the following points were relevant: 

(1) a reasonable reader would not think that there is anything wrong with a law firm permitting its address to be used as the registered offic e of a large number of c ompanies; 

(2) this is espec ially so in the light of the remarks quoted from lawyers that suc h a prac tic e was legal and that it was c ommonly done; 

(3) a reasonable person would not assoc iate the law firm with the operations of the c ompanies; 


(4) the referenc e to the plaintiffs` employee, Ms Tan Lay Chin, being the sec retary and direc tor of 15 of the c ompanies and dec lining to c omment when c ontac ted by TST does not nec essarily mean that she was being evasive. In the c ontext of the Artic le, espec ially the statement of the lawyer at para 14 of the Artic le (that interim direc tors are often appointed), a reasonable person would not infer any c onnec tion between Ms Tan, who is merely desc ribed as an employee, and the nefarious ac tivities of those c ompanies; 

(5) similarly, in respec t of para 18 of the Artic le, the fac t that TST had made unsuc c essful attempts to reac h the partners of the firm need not nec essarily have a defamatory meaning and in the c ontext of the Artic le c annot reasonably be c onstrued to have suc h a meaning. If the partners had been reac hed but dec lined c omment, that c ould have given a different pic ture. But it would not be reasonable for a reader to infer that the partners had been evasive merely bec ause TST had not been suc c essful in c ontac ting them. 

### INNUENDO MEANING OF THE ARTICLE 

The plaintiffs next rely on innuendo (or `true` or `legal` innuendo). The basis for this is an artic le published the previous day (`the 26 September artic le`), of whic h the Artic le is a follow-up. The 26 September artic le is found at p 70 of that edition and states as follows (with paragraph numbers added): 

 US regulators probe may lead to Singapore 

 15 companies sharing a local address pay $100m to Belgian firm, whose surge in Asian sales sparks scrutiny 

 1 A BELGIAN software company, Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products (L&H), was paid a whopping US$57 million (S$100 million) by 15 companies whose official address is a law firm in Shenton Way. 

 2 This sum totalled nearly 17 per cent of the global revenues of the speechrecognition software company. 

 3 It was payment for licensing rights to its software, says L&H. 

 4 In fact, revenue from Singapore and other parts of Asia boosted the companys sales which grew more than 60 per cent last year. 

 5 Singapore, in particular, saw turnover jumping from a lowly US$29,000 the year before to US$80.3 million, making the Republic the companys biggest customer. 

 6 However, the figures have drawn the attention of US regulators. 

 7 The Asian Wall Street Journal (AWSJ) has reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking into the recent surge in Nasdaq-listed L&Hs South-east Asian sales. 

 8 Yesterday, the business daily said nearly all of L&Hs revenue in Singapore came from the 15 companies and another four with a common address in 


Geylang. 

9       The paper`s latest report is a follow-up to its earlier disclosures about L&H, a global leader in speech and linguistic technologies with its Asia-Pacific headquarters at the International Business Park in Jurong East. 

10     Responding to the AWSJ article, L&H Asia-Pacific president Louis Woo told The Straits Times that the 15 companies did pay the US$57 million to the company. 

11     However, he declined to provide details about them. 

12 "You should talk to them about it. As far as we are concerned, they are our customers," said Dr Woo. 

13     The documents filed with the Registry of Companies named a Ms Tan Lee Chin at the Shenton Way law firm as their secretary and director. 

14     She was not available for an interview. 

15     And when reached by telephone yesterday, she would say only, "I have nothing to say." 

16     The partners of the law firm were not available for comment. 

17     The other officer of the companies is a Belgian national with a Belgium address. 

18     AWSJ said nearly all the 19 companies were launched last year. 

19     Eight of them had financial ties to a Belgian venture-capital fund that was linked closely to L&H. 

20     The FLV Fund, which was set up by a group of investors including Messrs Lernout and Hauspie, last year paid millions for 49 per cent stakes in some of the Singapore companies. 

21     Said the AWSJ: "FLV Fund`s involvement in the Singapore companies raises the possibility that L&H`s fast sales growth may not be all that it appears." 

22     Dr Woo told The Straits Times he reserved comment on the article as the SEC probe was in progress. 

23     But he insisted: "The bottom line is that the fundamentals of L&H are there and we are doing the right things." 

24     Also, the company had commissioned an independent audit of its worldwide operations and this would be completed soon. 

25 "I believe we will be vindicated," he said. 

26     L&H chief executive Gaston Bastiaens has resigned. 


 27 In Belgium, new chief executive John Duerden said last week that L&H would cooperate fully with the SEC in its probe. 

 28 Meanwhile, Reuters reported yesterday that shares in the FLV Fund fell sharply on the Brussels-based Easdaq market amid concern about the funds exposure to L&H. 

 29 The fund, which said 31 of its 52 portfolio companies made use of L&H technology, plummeted 57 per cent to an all-time low of US$5.25 before recovering slightly to US$8.40. 

 30 It released a statement yesterday, saying that the "commotion" caused by a story in the Europe edition of the Wall Street Journal had not affected the value of its portfolio or the operations of the fund. 

 31 L&H itself was 9.06 per cent lower at a mid-price US$14.18 on Easdaq. 

Apart from paras 14 to 16, there is substantively no additional information in the 26 September artic le. If it is also defamatory of L&H, it does not add muc h to the damage done by the Artic le published the following day. Paragraph 14 states that Ms Tan (named in the previous paragraph as the sec retary and direc tor of the 15 c ompanies) was not available for an interview. Paragraph 15 goes on to say that when reac hed by telephone, she said that she had nothing to say. Paragraph 16 states that the partners of the law firm were not available for c omment. However, the same information is repeated in the Artic le, the only signific ant differenc e being that the 26 September artic le quoted Ms Tan as saying ` **_I have nothing to say_** `. 

Counsel for the plaintiffs argued that suc h a statement in the c irc umstanc es raises the inferenc e that Ms Tan had something to hide in respec t of the 15 c ompanies. Counsel further submitted that the statement in para 16 that the partners of the law firm were not available for c omment implies that they were evasive about the matter. A person who had read the 26 September artic le would therefore have this bac kground information and upon reading the Artic le the following day, whic h identifies the plaintiffs as the law firm in question, would form the view that they were involved, direc tly or indirec tly in the matter. 

I agree that the statement in para 15 quoting Ms Tan as saying that she had nothing to say, read in c onjunc tion with para 16 that the partners of the firm were not available for c omment, does in the c ontext of the 26 September artic le, raise an inferenc e that Ms Tan and the partners had something to hide. However, as I have desc ribed above, the Artic le c ontained quotes from lawyers who had stated that it was c ommon for people to be appointed direc tors of a large number of c ompanies and to ac t as interim direc tors. The Artic le had also said that it was c ommon, and a matter of c onvenienc e, for c ompanies to use law firms or ac c ountanc y firms as their registered offic e. The Artic le stated that a lawyer explained that suc h addresses are for the purpose of offic ial c orrespondenc e and public notic es. 

In **Charleston v News Group Newspapers** [1995] 2 AC 65[1995] 2 All ER 313, the House of Lords held that where a public ation is not defamatory if c onsidered as a whole, the plaintiff c annot suc c eed ([1995] 2 AC 65 at 69; [1995] 2 All ER 313 at 315-316): 

 ... on the ground that some readers will have read part only of the published 


 matter and that this part, considered in isolation, is capable of bearing a defamatory meaning. 

In arriving at this c onc lusion, Lord Bridge of Harwic h said ([1995] 2 AC 65 at 70-71; [1995] 2 All ER 313 at 316-317) that there was: 

 ... a long and unbroken line of authority the effect of which is accurately summarised in Duncan & Neill on Defamation , 2nd ed. (1983), p. 13, para. 4.11 as follows: 

 In order to determine the natural and ordinary meaning of the words of which the plaintiff complains it is necessary to take into account the context in which the words were used and the mode of publication. Thus a plaintiff cannot select an isolated passage in an article and complain of that alone if other parts of the article throw a different light on that passage. 

 The locus classicus is a passage from the judgment of Alderson B. in Chalmers v. Payne (Unreported) , who said: 

 But the question here is, whether the matter be slanderous or not, which is a question for the jury; who are to take the whole together, and say whether the result of the whole is calculated to injure the plaintiffs character. In one part of this publication, something disreputable to the plaintiff is stated, but that is removed by the conclusion; the bane and antidote must be taken together. 

 This passage has been so often quoted that it has become almost conventional jargon among libel lawyers to speak of the bane and the antidote. It is often a debatable question which the jury must resolve whether the antidote is effective to neutralise the bane and in determining this question the jury may certainly consider the mode of publication and the relative prominence given to different parts of it. I can well envisage also that questions might arise in some circumstances as to whether different items of published material relating to the same subject matter were sufficiently closely connected as to be regarded as a single publication. But no such questions arise in the instant case ... 

Thus it is nec essary to examine the Artic le as a whole and in the c ontext in whic h the words were used. If there is anything in a part of it that is, of itself, defamatory of the plaintiffs, one must c onsider whether there is anything elsewhere that would put the Artic le in suc h a perspec tive that a reasonable reader would not reac h the c onc lusion that it is defamatory of them. In the present c ase I have to c onsider the Artic le in its entirety, together with the information available to the person who has also read the 26 September artic le. Considering the matter from that perspec tive, I c onc lude that the antidote in the Artic le would c learly remove any bane c arried by the innuendo in the 26 September artic le. 

**_Conclusion_** 

In c onc lusion, I would hold that both the natural and ordinary meaning of the Artic le and its innuendo meaning based on the 26 September artic le are not defamatory of the plaintiffs. Ac c ordingly their 


appeals are dismissed. I will hear c ounsel on the question of c osts. 

## Outcome: 

Appeals dismissed.
