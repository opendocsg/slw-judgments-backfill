**Aedit Abdullah JC:** 

1       These are brief grounds of dec ision in respec t of an _ex parte_ applic ation for rec ognition of foreign liquidators of a Hong Kong c ompany, whic h was put into c reditors’ voluntary winding up, as well as for orders empowering these foreign liquidators to obtain information in relation to ac c ounts belonging to the c ompany. These grounds are issued to rec ord the dec ision for the benefit of insolvenc y prac titioners. 

**Background** 

2       The c ompany in question, Gulf Pac ific Shipping Limited (“the Company”), was inc orporated and registered in the Hong Kong Spec ial Administrative Region in the People’s Republic of China. It was the wholly-owned subsidiary of STX Pan Oc ean (Hong Kong) Co Ltd, (“STX HK”). The Company and STX HK were part of the Pan Oc ean Group, whic h was involved in shipping of dry bulk c argo. The ultimate holding c ompany, Pan Oc ean Co Limited, a Korean entity, was eventually put into rehabilitation by the Seoul Distric t Court in 2013. STX HK itself was ordered to be wound up c ompulsorily by the High Court of Hong Kong in November 2013. One of the liquidators of STX HK was appointed a direc tor of the Company in 2016. In 2016, the Company was put into c reditors’ voluntary winding up, with the appointment of the two applic ants, Wong Tec k Meng and Stephen Brisc oe, as liquidators of the Company. The only c laims lodged in the liquidation were by STX HK and the Hong Kong Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 

3       The Company appeared to have had a bank ac c ount with ABN AMRO Bank NV Singapore Branc h (“ABN Singapore”). The ac c ount was apparently c losed in 2013. The applic ants sought c opies of bank statements from 2011 to 2013. ABN Singapore requested that the liquidators obtain a c ourt order giving sanc tion to their appointment and request. That request led to the present applic ation for rec ognition of the liquidators. 

**The Application** 

4       The applic ants c ited a number of dec isions in support of their applic ation, inc luding _Beluga Chartering GmbH (in liquidation) and others v Beluga Projects (Singapore) Pte Ltd (in liquidation) and another (deugro (Singapore) Pte Ltd, non-party_ ) <span class="citation">[2014] 2 SLR 815</span>, _Re Lee Wah Bank Ltd_ [1958] 2 MC 


81, _Re Cosimo Borelli_ Originating Summons No 762 of 2010, and _Re Opti-Medix Ltd (in liquidation) and another matter_ <span class="citation">[2016] 4 SLR 312</span> (“ _Re Opti-Medix_ ”). 

5       Here, rec ognition was sought by liquidators appointed in the plac e of inc orporation; no question in relation to the identific ation of the c ommon law c entre of main interest (“COMI”) thus arose. That COMI would have been Hong Kong in any event as the ac tivities and management of the c ompany were c entred in that territory. No prejudic e would appear to arise in respec t of Singapore persons or entities, as indic ated by the supporting affidavit of the Singapore solic itors for the applic ants: c ause book searc hes turned up empty and advertisements, whic h were plac ed in loc al papers inviting c reditors to c ontac t the solic itors, rec eived no response. As I earlier stated in _Re Opti-Medix_ (at [28]), suc h a supporting affidavit from the Singapore solic itors would be given due weight – c ertainly more than mere assertions from the foreign liquidators – and was thus useful and desirable in applic ations of this nature. 

**The Decision** 

6       On the evidenc e presented, I was satisfied that rec ognition should be granted. Spec ific ally, I noted that no prejudic e would likely arise as there were apparently no assets in Singapore and no c reditors. Rec ognition was sought bec ause of the need for information about the c losed bank ac c ount with ABN Singapore, rather than to realise assets here. Some of the orders sought and granted were fairly wide, but I was satisfied that this was justified as information may be needed on the outflow of funds from the ac c ount. 

7       The only issue that required some deliberation was whether rec ognition should be denied as the c ompany was liquidated through a voluntary winding-up. Counsel for the applic ants, in the disc harge of his duty to the Court, noted the view of Lord Sumption in the Privy Counc il advic e in _Singularis Holdings Ltd v PricewaterhouseCoopers (PC)_ [2015] AC 1675 (“ _Singularis_ ”) (at [25]) that c ommon law powers of assistanc e to foreign liquidation did not extend to voluntary winding up. This position appears to have been born out of a reluc tanc e to enc ourage what Lord Sumption desc ribed as “the promisc uous c reation of ... powers to c ompel produc tion of information”. Voluntary winding up was c harac terised by His Lordship as an essentially private arrangement, and not of the same nature as insolvenc y involving offic ers of a foreign c ourt. Lord Clarke agreed with Lord Sumption on these points. 

8       Counsel for the Applic ants argued that Lord Sumption’s observations were dic ta, that they arose out of different fac ts, and that insuffic ient justific ation was given for drawing suc h a distinc tion. Lord Neuberger’s differing stanc e in _Singularis_ (at [158]) was to be preferred. A US bankruptc y c ourt dec ision interpreting the UNCITRAL Model Law, _In re Betcorp Limited (In Liquidation)_ 400 BR 266 (Bankr. D. Nev. 2009) (“ _In re Betcorp_ ”) was c ited as authority for not distinguishing between voluntary winding up and c ompulsory winding up. 

9       _Singularis_ was indeed c onc erned with a different fac tual situation, in whic h doc uments were sought from auditors of a c ompany. In c ontrast, in the present c ase, the information and doc uments sought were in respec t of assets of the c ompany. But in any event, I did not, with the greatest respec t, adopt the distinc tion drawn by Lord Sumption between voluntary and c ompulsory liquidation. The diffic ulties with the distinc tion were noted by Lord Neuberger in _Singularis_ , who desc ribed it (at [158]) as potentially arbitrary. However, I would note that Lord Neuberger was on the whole c autious about c ommon law assistanc e to foreign liquidators (see [154], [160] and [161]). I suspec t _Re OptiMedix_ would not have attrac ted His Lordship’s approval. 

10     Be that as it may, in my view, as stated in _Re Opti-Medix_ (at [17]), the foundational doc trine in 


the rec ognition of foreign insolvenc y proc eedings is the promotion and fac ilitation of the orderly distribution of assets, as well as the orderly resolution and dissolution of the affairs of entities being wound up. The traditional, territorial foc us on the interests of loc al c reditors no longer has primac y over more internationalist c onc erns. Thus, the prec ise mode of the winding up would not generally be material, and no distinc tion should be drawn between voluntary and c ompulsory proc esses, or between in c ourt and out of c ourt dissolution. That, I believe, was the philosophic al basis of the approac h in _In re Betcorp Ltd_ , in whic h Judge Markell c onsidered a broader approac h to the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the US Bankruptc y Code, international usages and the UNCITRAL Model Law. 

11     US Bankruptc y Court c ases are of c ourse largely c onc erned with a regime that, at present, has few parallels to our own statutes. The relevanc e of US c ases may inc rease should the Model Law be adopted. Even without that development, however, the jurisprudenc e of the US Bankruptc y Courts has muc h to offer a Singapore c ourt fac ed with an insolvenc y c ase whic h engages issues of either philosophic al approac h (at one end) or prac tic al solutions (on the other). 

12     I should also note that there are, no doubt, other aspec ts of the dec ision in _Singularis_ whic h may require fuller argument and c onsideration as and when the oc c asion presents itself. Sinc e those aspec ts did not need to be c onsidered for the disposal of the present applic ation, I did not (and shall not) dwell on them further. 

13     The applic ation was thus granted, with liberty to apply extended to any affec ted party.
