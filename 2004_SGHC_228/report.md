**MPH Rubin J:** 

1       This is a sequel to my dec ision in the above originating summons delivered on 22 September 2004 ([2004] SGHC 210). The dispute in the c ase revolved around the c onstruc tion and validity of a will made by a Malay Muslim testator and the issue was whether a partic ular segment of the will was in ac c ord with Muslim law. The c ourt was asked to resolve an apparent c onflic t between the princ ipal restric tions on bequests under Muslim law and the notion that by employing an ec lec tic mix of words, a testator c ould overc ome those restric tions. In the event, the plaintiffs prevailed and the dec ision was delivered in their favour against the defendant who is the exec utor of the estate of the testator. However, before I delivered my judgment, I had direc ted both c ounsel to forward to the c ourt their written submissions on the question of c osts, whic h they did on 21 September 2004, a day before the delivery of judgment. 

2       Interestingly, the submission from Mr Namazie who appeared for the losing defendant was that regardless of the outc ome of the c ase, his c lient ought to be awarded c osts on an indemnity basis on the ground that the defendant is the exec utor of the estate. This argument was found by me to be palpably one-sided and seemed to ignore the fac t that that the defendant took part in these proc eedings, not just as an exec utor but also as an interested party with a vested interest in the outc ome of the proc eedings. He stood to gain if the plaintiffs did not prevail in their applic ation. The manner in whic h the defendant marshalled and presented his defenc e through his c ounsel left the c ourt with an impression that this was an “interest suit” and a c ontest between two fac tions for a larger share in the estate of the testator. 

3       As stated by the authors of _Tristram and Coote’s Probate Prac tic e_ (26th Ed, 1983) at p 729, “[a] party who fails to prove his c ase in an interest suit is, exc ept in spec ial c irc umstanc es, c ondemned in c osts” (see _Wiseman v Wiseman_ (1866) LR 1 P & D 351). 

4       My attention was drawn, by c ounsel for the defendant, to the propositions set out by Austin J in a New South Wales c ase, _Drummond v Drummond_ ([1999] NSWSC 923, 10 September 1999, unreported), referred to in Ford and Lee’s _Princ iples of the Law of Trusts_ (Lawbook Co) at para [14040], pp 25–26, where it is stated under the heading “Trustees’ c osts in litigation” that: 

- Costs are generally in the disc retion of the Court to be exerc ised judic ially. 


- The ordinary rule is that c osts follow the event, exc ept where it appears to the Court that some other order should be made. 

- An order that the c osts of an unsuc c essful party in litigation c onc erning a trust or the estate of a dec eased person be paid out of the trust fund or estate operates as an exc eption to the general rule. 

- [It] is normally the c ase that an exec utor who c ommenc es or defends an ac tion in the c apac ity of exec utor is entitled to be indemnified out of the estate for the c osts inc urred in doing so, even if the litigation is unsuc c essful, the exec utor’s c onduc t is found to have been mistaken, and the other party in the litigation is held to be entitled to an order for c osts. The statements also related to trustees. 

- That exc eption to the normal rule that c osts follow the event, whic h permits an exec utor [or trustee] to rec over c osts from the estate, is itself subjec t to some sub-exc eptions. 

- One sub-exc eption relates to impropriety as where an exec utor or trustee takes or defends proc eedings in breac h of trust, c onduc ts proc eedings in suc h a way that the Court, on a general view of the c ase, regards the exec utor’s c onduc t as “not honestly brought forward” ... or “where the c laim or defenc e is one whic h no reasonable person c ould say ought to have been put forward” ... 

- A sec ond sub-exc eption is that the rule whic h gives an exec utor or trustee the prima fac ie entitlement to be indemnified out of the estate for c osts relates only to the c osts inc urred in the administration and distribution of the estate. Suc h c osts are to be distinguished from c osts inc urred by an exec utor in furtheranc e of a personal interest as where, for example, the exec utor or trustee asserts a c laim as a c reditor or benefic iary or a trustee who has plainly bec ome unsuitable to remain trustee and should resign defends an ac tion for his removal ... 

- There is another exc eption to the normal rule that c osts follow the event. The Court may on some oc c asions permit a person who c onduc ts litigation in a private c apac ity to rec oup c osts from a trust fund or estate. One instanc e is where litigation arising from a will has been c aused by the c onduc t of the testator. 

5       Counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr Muzammil, submitted initially that an appropriate order should be that the c osts of both parties be paid out of the estate. In this regard, he referred the c ourt to a passage in _Tristram and Coote’s Probate Prac tic e_ ( _supra_ [3]) at p 726, whic h states that “[if ] the litigation be c aused by the state in whic h the dec eased left his testamentary papers, the c osts of both parties will be ordered to be paid out of the estate”. However, during arguments, Mr Muzammil went on to argue that the suc c essful party’s c osts should c ome from the estate, whereas, the losing defendant’s c osts should c ome from him and not from the estate. The final position adopted by Mr Namazie was that he would not resist an order whic h stated that eac h party should bear its own c osts. 

6       As stated in Ford and Lee’s _Princ iples of the Law of Trusts_ ( _supra_ [4]) at para [14040], p 26: 

 [A] trustee fac ed with the need to bring or defend proc eedings to protec t the trust property as against third persons should, as a matter of prudenc e, seek an indemnity from suc h of the benefic iaries as have c apac ity to give one. If suc h an indemnity c annot be obtained and there is real doubt as to whether the trustee should bring or defend proc eedings, the trustee should, if all risk of personal liability for c osts is to be avoided, seek the direc tions of the Court. 


Although in the c ase c onc luded, the defendant, being the exec utor, c ould have applied to the Court for an indemnity, he did not do so. 

7       It is provided under O 59 r 6(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed): 

 Where a person is or has been a party to any proc eedings in the c apac ity of trustee, personal representative or mortgagee, he shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, be entitled to the c osts of those proc eedings, in so far as they are not rec overed from or paid by any other person, out of the fund held by the trustee or personal representative or out of the mortgaged property, as the c ase may be; and the Court may otherwise order only on the ground that the trustee, personal representative or mortgagee has ac ted unreasonably or, in the c ase of a trustee or personal representative, has in substanc e ac ted for his own benefit rather than for the benefit for the fund. [emphasis added] 

8       After reviewing the fac tual matric es of the c ase, I was of the view that the usual order in other types of litigation, that the c osts should follow the event and the party that suc c eeds should be awarded c osts, was not appropriate. My other immediate c onc ern was that the c ourt, in exerc ising its disc retion, should not also allow c avalier litigation and abuse of proc ess of c ourt. In this regard, the c ourt has a general disc retion to ensure that a losing litigant is not permitted to roam free to pursue his options with impunity in the belief that at the end of the day, he c an, regardless of the outc ome of his ac tions, rec oup his losses from the entitlement of the suc c essful party on the guise that he is an exec utor. 

9       My initial view and order was that eac h party should bear its own c osts. However, upon further reflec tion, I c alled the solic itors for a re-hearing on c osts before my earlier order c ould be perfec ted. My c onc ern was whether my earlier order that eac h party should pay its own c osts would be disproportionately burdensome to the exec utor/defendant. I also, in this regard, bore in mind _dic tum_ by Kekewic h J in _In re Jones. Christmas v Jones_ [1897] 2 Ch 190 at 197, that: 

 A man who fulfils the diffic ult duties of an administrator, exec utor or trustee is, in c ommon sense and c ommon justic e, entitled to be rec ouped to the very last penny everything that he has expended properly – that is to say, without impropriety – in his c harac ter of administrator, exec utor or trustee ... 

In the c ase at hand, no doubt, the defendant mounted a defenc e not merely as an administrator but also as an interested party. He was seemingly not a detac hed party. Nonetheless, the dispute at hand was also not his making and the advic e given to him before the c ommenc ement of litigation left him with little c hoic e but to c ontest the plaintiffs’ c laim. Conversely, sinc e the plaintiffs also had a legitimate and valid grievanc e on their side, it bec ame a c ontest between one perc eived right against another perc eived right. In the c irc umstanc es, an even-handed approac h seemed appropriate. 

10     Consequently, upon further c onsideration, I reviewed my earlier order and ordered that the c osts of both parties, on a standard basis, be paid out of the estate. My c onc ern as to possible abuse of proc ess of c ourt and the inc idenc e of c avalier litigation ( _supra_ [5]) c ould, no doubt, be addressed and c hec ked by the appropriate forum, when the oc c asion arose. 

11     In the result, my earlier order on c osts was substituted by the present order that c osts of both parties, on a standard basis, be paid out of the estate. 

_Ordered ac c ordingly._
