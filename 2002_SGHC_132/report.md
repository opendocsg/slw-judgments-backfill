## GROUNDS OF DECISION 

### INTRODUCTION 

1\. The Plaintiff Dataw ork Pte Ltd (Dataw ork) is a company incorporated in Singapore and carries on business, inter alia, as a manufacturer and distributor of computer related products. 

2\. The Defendant Cyberinc Pte Ltd (Cyberinc) is also a company incorporated in Singapore and carries on business, inter alia, as a manufacturer of computer and telecommunication apparatus. 

3\. In about January 2000, the parties entered into an agreement in w hich Cyberinc appointed Dataw ork as the sole distributor of certain products of Cyberinc called Z-station, Z-media and Z-pac. The Z-pac comprised one Z-station and one or tw o Z-media. It is a mobile hand-held karaoke device. 

4\. The relevant terms of the Distributorship Agreement w ere: 

(a) The distributorship w ould be for a minimum of six months plus one month. 

 (b) The minimum purchase quantity by Dataw ork w as 3,000 units of Z-pac. If this target w as reached, the distributorship w ould continue for another six months w ith another minimum quantity to be purchased. 

(c) The commencement date of the sole distributorship w as the date of the first delivery of the products. 

(d) Dataw ork w as obliged to order 1,000 units of Z-pac for the first three months. 

5\. There w as also a provision i.e Clause 5 of Cyberincs obligations (Clause 5) w hich provided for Cyberinc to buy the unsold units from Dataw ork and its dealers should Cyberinc terminate the distributorship prior to its expiry. In view of the emphasis w hich Dataw ork placed on this provision, I set it out below : 

## 5) In the event that CyberInc Pte Ltd decides to early 

 terminate the sole distributorship agreement w ith Dataw ork Pte Ltd, it w ill have to buy up all the remaining stock of the 


 product from Dataw ork Pte Ltd and its dealers (if Dataw ork Pte Ltd deems necessary) at the same price Dataw ork Pte Ltd has paid to CyberInc Pte Ltd. 

6\. It w as common ground that the first delivery of the products w as on 31 March 2000. Hence the Distributorship Agreement commenced then and expired on 31 October 2000. 

7\. Dataw ork alleged that: 

 (a) In breach of the Distributorship Agreement, Cyberinc appointed TV Media Pte Ltd (TV Media) on or about September 2000 to distribute and/or sell and/or market the products. 

 (b) In so doing, Cyberinc had evidenced an intention not to be bound by the Distributorship Agreement and had repudiated the same. 

 (c) By an e-mail dated 5 October 2000, Dataw ork had accepted the repudiation and required Cyberinc to re-purchase the unsold products still in the possession of Dataw ork and/or its dealers. 

 (d) The acceptance of the repudiation w as repeated on 12 December 2000 by a letter from Dataw orks solicitors to Dataw ork. 

8\. Thus, in so far as the remaining products in the possession of Dataw ork and its dealers had not yet been paid for by Dataw ork, Cyberinc w as effectively to take them back through the re-purchase. In so far as such products had already been paid for by Dataw ork, Cyberinc had to pay for them in its re-purchase. 

9\. There w as also a claim for miscellaneous expenses but this w as eventually resolved w hen the parties appeared before me. Hence, I need say no more about it. 

10\. The defence w as that Dataw ork w as granted only a sole distributorship instead of an exclusive distributorship. This meant that w hile Cyberinc could not legally have appointed another distributor, it could sell the products itself or through its ow n agents. Cyberinc had contracted w ith TV Media to, inter alia, produce a TV commercial to promote the products. TV Media w ould also sell the products at its outlets and such sales w ere made on behalf of Cyberinc for w hich TV Media w ould receive a commission. 

11\. Cyberinc also alleged that Dataw ork w as estopped from alleging any breach by Cyberinc and that Dataw ork had acquiesced in Cyberincs intention to contract w ith TV Media. This w as because Dataw orks SC Ang had know n of and had agreed to the same. 

12\. Lastly, Cyberinc denied that it w as obliged to re-purchase the remaining products in the possession of Dataw ork and its dealers under Clause 5 as Cyberinc did not terminate the Distributorship Agreement. 

13\. Cyberinc also counterclaimed: 

 (a) payment from Dataw ork for the unpaid purchase price of 400 Z-pac units w hich had been delivered to Dataw ork, 

 (b) damages for 600 units w hich Dataw ork had ordered but did not w ant delivery of, 

 (c) damages for failure to order a minimum quantity of 3,000 units. 


### TRIAL JUDGES DECISION 

14\. The trial judge, District Judge Tan Peck Cheng, decided that Cyberinc w as in breach of contract and there w as no acquiescence by Dataw ork. How ever she also concluded that Clause 5 requiring Cyberinc to re-purchase the products from Dataw ork did not apply because it w as not Cyberinc w ho terminated the Distributorship Agreement but Dataw ork and the provision applied only in the former, but not the latter, situation. 

15\. The trial judge also decided that Dataw ork suffered only nominal damages as its sales of the products w ere not doing w ell in any event. 

16\. Accordingly, the trial judge fixed the damages for Cyberincs breach at S$2,500 to be paid by Cyberinc to Dataw ork and dismissed the other reliefs sought by Dataw ork. She also granted judgment against Dataw ork to pay Cyberinc the purchase price of the 400 units delivered but not yet paid for. The rest of the reliefs sought by Cyberinc w ere disallow ed. Dataw ork w as required to pay costs to Cyberinc w hich the trial judge fixed at S$18,000. 

**_THE APPEALS_** 

17\. Dataw ork appealed to the High Court against that part of the trial judges decision w hich: 

 (a) ordered payment of only $2,500 to Dataw ork as damages, 

 (b) dismissed the other reliefs sought by Dataw ork, 

 (c) granted Cyberinc judgment for the purchase price of the 400 units, and 

 (d) costs. 

18\. Cyberinc also appealed to the High Court. Its appeal w as against that part of the decision w hich: 

 (a) ordered Cyberinc to pay $2,500 as damages to Dataw ork, 

 (b) disallow ed the rest of the reliefs sought by Cyberinc, and 

 (c) the quantum of costs fixed by the trial judge. 

**_MY DECISION_** 

19\. Both appeals w ere heard by me on 13 May 2002. After hearing arguments, I dismissed the appeal by Dataw ork and allow ed the appeal by Cyberinc in part (because Cyberincs computation of the balance number of units to make up the minimum quantity w as incorrect). My decision meant that: 

 (a) Cyberinc w as not in breach of contract and did not have to pay any damages to Dataw ork. 

 (b) Cyberinc w as still entitled to be paid for the 400 units delivered to Dataw ork (an earlier batch of 300 units had been delivered and paid for already). 

 (c) Cyberinc w as entitled to damages to be assessed in respect of 600 units w hich Dataw ork had ordered but did not w ant delivery of. 

 (d) Cyberinc w as entitled to damages to be assessed for Dataw orks failure to order 1,700 sets to 


 make up the minimum quantity of 3,000 units. 

20\. I also granted costs of Cyberincs appeal and of the hearing below to Cyberinc and costs of Dataw orks appeal to Cyberinc. 

**_MY REASONS_** 

21\. Although much time and effort w as spent by both Counsel for Dataw ork and Cyberinc on arguments as to w hether TV Media w as or w as not a distributor of Cyberinc and the interpretation of Clause 5, I decided the appeals on the ground that Dataw ork w as estopped from alleging that Cyberinc w as in breach of contract. Dataw ork had also acquiesced in the appointment of TV Media by Cyberinc to promote and sell the products. 

22\. On this issue, the trial judge had ruled against Cyberinc. I set out below the reasons w hy I reached the opposite conclusion. 

23\. Mr Tan Peng Khoon (PK Tan) had joined Cyberinc in September 1999. He w as its Marketing Director. The managing director w as Mr Ng Kai Kong (KK Ng). 

24\. Dataw ork is run by PK Tans sister Lucillia Tan Sok Cheng, also referred to as SC Ang, and their brother Larry Tan. It w as PK Tan w ho introduced Dataw ork to Cyberinc as his sisters company. At all material times, all parties w ere aw are of PK Tans relationship w ith SC Ang. 

25\. Consequently the Distributorship Agreement w as entered into. 

26\. SC Ang did not dispute that she w as aw are of Cyberincs intention to use TV Media to promote and sell the products. Indeed, she learned of this from a meeting w ith KK Ng and her brother PK Tan. How ever she claimed that she had thought that TV Media w ould be buying the products from Dataw ork and not from Cyberinc. 

27\. In her Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (AEIC), she said at paras 32 and 33: 

32\. Sometime in or around the 2nd or 3rd w eek of September 2000, KK Ng and my brother came to the Plaintiffs offices to discuss advertising the Defendants products on television. They informed me that the Defendant w as intending to advertise on television through TV Media. He gave me the impression that TV Media w ould be producing the advertisements and selling the Defendants products at their retail outlets as w ell as through mail order and that any sales by TV Media w ould be made from stock purchased from the Plaintiff. In effect, the impression w hich he gave me w as that TV Media w ould purchase its stock from the Plaintiff directly. Given the practice in the previous marketing efforts outlined above and our understanding of both parties obligations under the Distribution Agreement, I naturally assumed that this w ould continue to be the case. 

33\. I w as therefore quite pleased w hen I heard the new s from KK Ng and my brother as I believed that our sales w ould improve after the advertisements. I had no reason to object to the advertisements as I understood that the terms of the Distribution Agreement w ould be adhered to by the Defendant. 

28\. KK Ngs evidence on this point w as in para 42 of his AEIC w here he said: 

42\. Thus, sometime in August 2000, PK, SC Ang and I had a meeting to discuss advertising through TV Media. I recall that SC Ang w as pleased to hear about the 


 advertisement. She felt that any efforts to promote the product w ould be w orth trying. She also expressed the view that if the product w as put into the ma rke t, albeit by the Defendant, it w ould still increase aw areness of the product and possibly boost the Plaintiffs ow n sales of the product. 

[Emphasis added.] 

29\. In cross-examination, KK Ng accepted that he did not know w hether SC Ang w as aw are that Cyberinc w as selling the products directly to TV Media (NE 189). At NE 190, he also said: 

 Q: Because she does not know TV Media getting (sic) for defendant 

 A: That is possible but not 100% sure. 

30\. PK Tan did not have an AEIC. He gave evidence for Dataw ork, and not Cyberinc w hich he had by then left. He said that SC Ang w as told that TV Media w as being used to help promote her sales (NE 72). He claimed that Cyberinc did not tell Dataw ork that it w ould be selling the products directly to TV Media. If it had told Dataw ork, Dataw ork w ould have jumped (NE 74). He w as the one w ho had negotiated w ith TV Media on behalf of Cyberinc and w ho signed the agreement w ith TV Media but he claimed that the agreement w ith TV Media w as a breach by Cyberinc of the Distributorship Agreement. He alleged that he did not protest to KK Ng because of fear over his ow n salary (NE 102). 

31\. The trial judges conclusion w as as follow s: 

21\.. With regard to paragraph 20(a), Mr K K Ngs evidence w as that he did not tell Mdm Lucilla Tan ("Mrs S C Ang") that TV Media w ould be purchasing the products directly from the defendant or show ed Mrs S C Ang the agreement w ith TV Media. He w as not sure if Mrs S C Ang w as aw are. He assumed that the plaintiff must have know n. He w as asked if it w as reasonable for Mrs S C Ang to assume that TV Media w ould obtain the products from her, he replied that it w as. Mrs S C Ang in her evidence stated that she knew that the defendant w as speaking to TV Media. She w as pleased because she assumed that TV Media w ould be buying from her. I found Mrs S C Angs evidence credible and that there is no evidence to show that the plaintiff had acquiesced to the relationship betw een the defendant and TV Media. 

32\. I found it difficult to accept that PK Tan had thought that w hat Cyberinc w as doing w as in breach of the Distributorship Agreement and that he w ent ahead to negotiate and sign the agreement on behalf of Cyberinc w ith TV Media w ithout even attempting to advise KK Ng that this w ould cause a breach of the Distributorship Agreement or informing his ow n sister, w hom he had introduced to Cyberinc, about the true situation. After all, there w as no evidence that KK Ng w as trying to hide the truth about the sales from Cyberinc to TV Media and, in any event, he w ould have been foolish to think that he could get aw ay w ith it given that he knew PK Tans relationship w ith SC Ang. 

33\. Secondly, KK Ng did not say that it w as reasonable for SC Ang to assume that TV Media w ould obtain the products from Dataw ork. All he said w as that it w as possible that she had this assumption but he w as not 100% sure (see NE 190 w hich I cited in para 29 above). In any event, even if KK Ng had said w hat w as attributed to him by the trial judge, that w ould have been merely an opinion of his and not evidence of a fact w hich he had personal know ledge of. 

34\. Thirdly, and most importantly, the evidence of SC Ang as to w hen she first came to know that TV Media w as obtaining the products directly from Cyberinc w as highly improbable and w as also contradicted by documentary evidence. I elaborate below. 


35\. In SC Angs AEIC, paras 34 to 35, she said: 

34\. On 24 September 2000, I saw the advertisement screened by TV Media on television for the first time. I clearly recall that the advertisement stated that the Defendants products w ere being sold through the retail o u t le t s operated by TV Media. No mention w as made of the Plaintiff or its authorised dealers. 

 3 5. I expected TV Media to contact the Plaintiff shortly after the advertisement w as screened. As explained previously, I had been given the impression that w e w ould be supplying TV Media w ith the Defendants products w hich TV Media managed to sell. How ever, nothing w as heard from TV Media even after the advertisement w as screened. I made several unsuccessful attempts to contact KK Ng and PK Tan to ask for an explanation. Finally, PK Tan returned my calls sometime tow ards the end of September 2000. It w as only then that he informed me that the Defendant had been selling directly to TV Media and by passing the Plaintiff. 

 [Emphasis added.] 

**_First sub-point_** 

36\. It w as common ground that SC Ang had considerable experience in her business. Yet, w hen she learned that TV Media w ould be appointed, she did not ask KK Ng or PK Tan as to w hen she should contact TV Media or w hen TV Media w ould be contacting Dataw ork to order the products from Dataw ork. There w as also no query by her about the volume and timing of the purchases by TV Media from Dataw ork w hich w ould in turn affect the volume and timing of purchases by Dataw ork from Cyberinc. I found this lack of interest telling. It suggested that she must have know n all along that TV Media w ere obtaining the products directly from Cyberinc. 

**_Second sub-point_** 

37\. I found it incredulous that SC Ang could have been under the impression that TV Media w ould be contacting Dataw ork shortly after she noticed an advertisement by TV Media on television on 24 September 

2000\. The advertising campaign had already begun. The public w ere being urged to buy from TV Media. There w as no suggestion that the public w ere told that the products w ould be on sale only in the future. Therefore the advertisements w ould suggest that the products w ere immediately available from TV Media. It w as quite absurd for SC Ang to suggest that w hile the public w ere going to TV Medias outlets to buy the products, TV Media w ould not have the products and had still not contacted her to obtain the products. Indeed, by then, there w as still no discussion betw een TV Media and Dataw ork even on the price w hich TV Media w as supposed to pay for the products from Dataw ork. How then w ould TV Media know w hat price to adopt for its sales to the public? 

**_Third sub-point_** 

38\. SC Angs assertion that she had assumed that TV Media w ould be contacting Dataw ork shortly after the advertisement to obtain the products w as contradicted by a second e-mail from her on 5 October 2000, there being tw o e-mail from her on that day. 

39\. For completeness, I set out below the first e-mail she sent on 5 October 2000 at 10:58am and the second e-mail she sent on the same day at 2:44pm. 

 First e-mail 


Subject: Fw : Promotion partnership 

Dear PK and KK, 

I shall be w riting to you by today the problems that w e are currently facing in the distribution of Zstation and our decision to settle these problems. 

In spite of this, I w ould like to bring to your attention the opportunity that CyberInc can w ork w ith this company, Field Catering & Supplies Pte Ltd, a $500,000 paid up capital company. They have already bought 4 sets of Z-station, normal version from us at $257.50/= each and tested it. Now , they are coming back to us on this proposal w hich I think is a good opportunity to create the aw areness but of course w ith modifications and monitoring from your side. Gerard Lim is the brand manager. His HP: 9 

7506305\. His tel: 759 1771. If you are contacting him directly to discuss the matter, please let me know so that I w ould know how to talk to him if he called me. 

Bye.

Second e-mail 

Subject: Termination of sole distributorship of Z-station in Singapore 

Dear KK & PK 

On 24th September 2000, TV Media Pte Ltd has begun the screening of its advertisement of Z-station on TCS channel 5. This meant that Cyberinc w ould have sold the Z-station to them much earlier on. This in turn meant that Cyberinc has broken one of the major clauses in the letter of understanding. Under the term duration of sole distributorship and quantity commitment of the letter of understanding, it stated the sole distributorship w ill be for a minimum period of seven months 

beginning from the date of first receipt of the stock of Z-station from Cyberinc w hich is 30th March 

2000\. The exclusive period should only expire on 29-10-2000. This demonstrated the fact that Cyberinc has decided to terminate the sole distributorship agreement. 

Under number 5 of the list of things that Cyber Inc Pte Ltd must do as stated in the letter of understanding is as follow s: in the event that CyberInc Pte Ltd decides to early terminate the sole distributorship agreement w ith Dataw ork Pte Ltd, it w ill have to buy up all the remaining stock of the product from Dataw ork Pte Ltd and its dealers (If Dataw ork Pte Ltd deems necessary) at the same price Dataw ork Pte Ltd has paid to CyberInc Pte Ltd. 

We have thought about the past few months business relationship w ith your company and the abovementioned clause, w e have decided to exercise it, i.e to demand CyberInc Pte Ltd to buy up the remaining stock of Dataw ork and its dealers. How ever if CyberInc w ould like to continue to sell to the dealers, Dataw ork, w ith the consent of the dealers, w ill go w ith CyberInc to visit the dealers to expedite the taking over of dealers. 

We look forw ard to ( _sic_ ) letting us know w hen w e can return the products to your company and also about your decision w ith regards to the dealers. Thank you. 


 Yours truly, 

 S.C.Ang 

 Dataw ork Pte Ltd 

 [Emphasis added.] 

40\. The second e-mail from SC Ang clearly stated that w hen TV Media had begun to screen the advertisement, This meant that Cyberinc w ould have sold the Z-station to them much earlier on [my emphasis]. This w as a logical assertion but it contradicted w hat SC Ang had said in her AEIC. 

41\. Mr David Chan, Counsel for Dataw ork, submitted that this sentence in the second e-mail w as the result of SC Angs subsequent telephone discussion w ith PK Tan in w hich PK Tan informed her that Cyberinc had been selling direct to TV Media and by-passing Dataw ork. How ever, the second e-mail did not attribute this know ledge to any telephone discussion w ith PK Tan. On the contrary, the second e-mail attributed this know ledge to logic and there w as no mention of any recent telephone discussion w ith PK Tan. 

**_Fourth sub-point_** 

42\. The first e-mail from SC Ang on 5 October 2000 to PK Tan and KK Ng w as also revealing. It reinforced a point made by Ms Valerie Tan, Counsel for Cyberinc, that Dataw ork w as having difficulty in effecting sales of the products and w as looking for a w ay out. 

43\. The first e-mail suggested that Dataw ork w as going to make a proposal and there w as no hint therein that Dataw ork had thought that Cyberinc w as in breach of contract even though, by then, 10 to 11 days had lapsed after SC Ang had first noticed the advertisement of TV Media on 24 September 2000 and TV Media had not contacted Dataw ork to make purchases. 

44\. About 3 hours later, the substance and tone of the second e-mail w as significantly different. The heading of the second e-mail w as also different from the first. The second e-mail w as not the anticipated follow -up from the first. In my view , Dataw ork had by then changed its mind and decided to use the sale by TV Media as an excuse to get out of the Distributorship Agreement and to require Cyberinc to re-purchase the products in the possession of Dataw ork and its dealers. 

**_Summary_** 

45\. W ith respect, the trial judge did not consider the points I have mentioned above and the tw o e-mail from SC Ang of 5 October 2000. In my view , her conclusion w as plainly w rong. 

46\. In the circumstances, it w as clear to me that SC Ang and Dataw ork w ere aw are and had acquiesced in TV Medias involvement in the promotion of the products as w ell as the purchase thereof from Cyberinc. They w ere even enthusiastic about the involvement of TV Media as they had thought that this w ould give a boost to their ow n flagging sales. Dataw ork w as also estopped from alleging a breach of contract arising from the sales of the products by Cyberinc to TV Media. 

**_SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS SUMMONS-IN-CHAMBERS NO 600900 OF 2002_** 

47\. Subsequent to my decision, Dataw ork sought to appeal against my decision. 

48\. Section 34(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (SCJA) states: 


 (2) Except w ith the leave of the Court of Appeal or a Judge, no appeal shall be brought to the Court of Appeal in any of the follow ing cases: 

 (a) w here the amount or value of the subject-matter at the trial is $250, 

49\. It w as common ground that the jurisdiction of the District Court is $250,000 and that this figure w as inserted as an amendment in the SCJA to meet the increase in the jurisdiction of the District Court to $250,000. 

50\. In view of s 34(2), Dataw ork applied for leave to appeal against my decision to the Court of Appeal by w ay of Summons-in-Chambers No 600900 of 2002. How ever, at the first hearing of this application on 31 May 2002, Mr Vinodh Coomarasw amy, w ho w as appearing w ith Mr David Chan for Dataw ork, made an oral application for a declaration that no leave w as necessary. How ever, if leave w as necessary, then, he w ould seek leave to appeal. As this oral application took his opponent by surprise, I adjourned the application to a date to be fixed. 

51\. At the next hearing on 12 June 2002, Mr Coomarasw amy proceeded w ith both points. After hearing arguments, I decided that leave w as required but that no such leave should be granted. Accordingly, I dismissed the application w ith costs. 

**_ARGUMENTS FOR DATAWORK_** 

52\. As I have mentioned, Mr Coomarasw amys first position w as that no leave w as required under s 34(2) SCJA. He mounted his argument in the follow ing manner. 

53\. In Dataw orks claim, it w as seeking: 

 (a) a declaration that Cyberinc w as obliged to purchase the unsold products held by Dataw ork and its dealers pursuant to the Clause 5 w hich I have mentioned 

(b) an order that Cyberinc pay US$32,819 for the purchase under Clause 5 

(c) alternatively, damages for loss suffered as a result of Cyberincs breach of the Distributorship Agreement. 

54\. In Cyberincs counterclaim, it w as seeking: 

 (a) US$58,318.60 being the price of the 400 units of Z-pac w hich had been delivered to Dataw ork but had remained unpaid 

(b) damages for Dataw orks failure to purchase 1,000 units of Z-pac w ithin the first three months 

(c) damages for Dataw orks failure to order the minimum quantity of 3,000 units. 

55\. Cyberinc had alleged that its damages exceeded S$250,000 but as its counterclaim w as filed in the District Court and not in the High Court, the District Court w ould not grant it judgment and the assessment w ould not be for a sum w hich w ould exceed $250,000, after taking into account the US$58,318.60. 

56\. Mr Coomarasw amy submitted that as Cyberincs damages had not yet been assessed, I should adopt the maximum amount under the District Court jurisdiction as the putative amount of its damages, including the US$58,318.60. Taking the difference betw een this maximum amount i.e S$250,000 on the one hand 


and the US$32,819 w hich Dataw ork itself w as claiming on the other hand, the resultant figure w ould be in excess of S$250,000. This w as the value of the subject matter for the purpose of s 34(2)(a) and, therefore, no leave to appeal w as required. 

57\. Mr Coomarasw amy relied on 2 cases, _Augustine & anor v Goh Siam Yong_ <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 767</span> and the Malaysian case of _Yai Yen Hon v Teng Ah Kok & Sim Huat Sdn Bhd_ [1997] 1 MLJ 136. 

58\. In the _Augustine_ case, the respondent commenced an action in the Magistrates Court to recover damages in respect of a traffic accident. The appellants did not enter an appearance and the respondent obtained interlocutory judgment w ith damages to be assessed. Such damages w ere assessed by a deputy registrar of the subordinate courts at $4,780.89. The appellants appealed to a district judge-in-chambers w ho reduced the damages to $1,177.50. The respondent filed a notice of appeal to the High Court against the reduced assessment. 

59\. The appellants applied to strike out the notice of appeal on the ground that under O 55 r 1(5) of the Subordinate Courts Rules 1986, the respondent had no right of appeal. This application w as heard by the Deputy Registrar of the High Court w ho made no order on the application so as to allow the respondent to apply to a judge of the High Court for a declaration that she had such a right of appeal. After hearing arguments, that declaration w as made and the appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeal against that declaration. 

60\. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal because O 55 r 1(5) w as ultra vives the then s 21 SCJA. The arguments and the ruling on the effect of the then s 21 SCJA on O 55 r 1(5) w ere not relevant to the case before me. How ever, one of the arguments raised by the appellants in that case w as that the respondent w ould in any event require leave to appeal under the then s 21(1) SCJA. That provision stated: 

 (1) Subject to the provisions of this or any other w ritten law , an appeal shall lie to the High Court from a decision of a District Court or Magistrates Court in any suit or action for the recovery of immovable property or in any civil cause or matter w here the amount in dispute or the value of the subject matter exceeds $2,000 or w ith the leave of the High Court if under that amount. 

The appellants there contended that since the district judge-in-chambers had reduced the damages to $1,177.50, that w as the amount in dispute. The Court of Appeal disagreed w ith that contention and held that as the respondent w as disputing the reduction in the original order made by the deputy registrar, the amount in dispute w as the difference betw een the $4,780.89 assessed by the deputy registrar and the $1,177.50 allow ed by the district judge i.e $3,603.39. 

61\. How ever the facts in that case w ere different from those before me. First, the provisions w ere different, i.e one pertained to the then s 21(1) SCJA w hile the present case pertained to the current s 34(2) (a) SCJA w hich w as a different provision. 

62\. Secondly, and more importantly, that w as not a case involving a counterclaim as w ell. 

63\. As for the Malaysian case of _Yai Yen Hon_ , that case w as one in w hich leave to appeal w as required w hen the amount or value of the subject matter of the claim w as less than RM100,000. There, the plaintiffs claim w as w ell in excess of RM100,000 but the High Court gave judgment to the plaintiff for RM62,400. The Federal Court held that w hether or not there w as a right of appeal depended on the value of the claim and not the amount given by the trial judge. 

64\. As can be seen, the provision in that case w as different and the facts w ere also different. Again, there w as no counterclaim there. 


65\. In addition, it seemed to me that despite Mr Coomarasw amys submission, his approach w as not one in w hich the difference betw een w hat Dataw ork might obtain and w hat Cyberinc might obtain is taken. W hat he had done w as to add the tw o together to derive a higher figure in excess of $250,000. 

66\. As for the existence of the counterclaim, Mr Coomarasw amy submitted that even though there w as a counterclaim by Cyberinc, this arose from the same facts and it w as not possible to separate one from the other. He stressed that I should take into account the entire subject matter of the suit and not just the value of Dataw orks claim. According to him, the reference to a trial in s 34(2) SCJA includes a case w here there is a claim and counterclaim heard in one trial. 

67\. Mr Coomarasw amy further submitted that this w as not a case in w hich Dataw ork might obtain judgment for US$32,819 on the one hand, and, on the other hand, Cyberinc might obtain judgment for US$58,318.60 and damages so that the amount adjudged to Dataw ork w ould effectively abate the amount adjudged to Cyberinc. It w as like an all or nothing scenario. Either Dataw ork w ould obtain judgment for US$32,819 or Cyberinc w ould obtain judgment for US$58,318.60 and damages. In his submission, this reinforced his argument that the difference betw een w hat Dataw ork might obtain and w hat Cyberinc might obtain w as the amount or value of the subject matter at the trial. 

68\. Mr Coomarasw amys alternative position w as that if leave to appeal w as required, then such leave ought to be granted to Dataw ork. 

69\. In _Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong_ <span class="citation">[1997] 3 SLR 489</span>, the Court of Appeal considered w hether leave to appeal should be granted in respect of an order of costs under s 34(2)(b) SCJA. After referring to Justice Lai Kew Chais judgment in _Anthony s/o Savarimiuthu v Soh Chuan Tin_ [1989] SLR 607, Chief Justice Yong Pung How enunciated three limbs to be considered w hen leave to appeal is sought: 

 (a) prima facie case of error, 

 (b) question of general principle decided for the first time, 

 (c) question of importance upon w hich further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal w ould be to the public advantage. 

70\. Mr Coomarasw amy submitted that there w as a prime facie case of error of law or an important question of law for the Court of Appeal to decide. It w as not clear to me w hether the latter w as under the second or third limb enunciated by Yong CJ. 

71\. As regards the alleged important question of law , Mr Coomarasw amy submitted that it w as important to establish how the High Court, sitting as an intermediate appellate court, should approach findings of fact by a District Court. According to him, the High Court, as an appellate court, may be required to approach findings of facts differently from the Court of Appeal as the latter w as the final appellate court. W hile the Court of Appeal can in certain situations find itself to be in as good a position as the trial judge to determine facts, Mr Coomarasw amy w as suggesting that the High Court, sitting as an appellate court, should be even slow er to find itself in as good a position as the trial judge to determine facts. He submitted that w hile the precise test for the High Court w as difficult to formulate, the High Court should only reverse the finding of a trial judge if the finding w as manifestly erroneous or in some w ay perverse. He emphasized that the High Courts intermediate role w ill become more important as the jurisdiction of the District Court increases in future. 

72\. As regards the alleged error of law , Mr Coomarasw amy relied on tw o local cases for the proposition that a trial judges finding of fact should not be disturbed unless he w as plainly w rong. They w ere _Seah Ting_ 


_Soon v Indonesian Tractors Co Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2001] 1 SLR 521</span> and _Peh Eng Leng v Pek Eng Leong_ <span class="citation">[1996] 2 SLR 305</span>. How ever, that principle w as not in issue. Besides, in the case of _Peh Eng Leng_ , Karthigesu JA said that the evidence of a w itness should be tested against inherent probabilities or improbabilities and against uncontroverted facts (see p 312 at H/I of the report). Mr Coomarasw amy did not dispute this principle but he submitted that the finding of the trial judge w ould stand up to scrutiny even w hen so tested. 

73\. He also relied on a decision of the Australian High Court in _Baumgartner v Baumgartner_ 76 ALR 75 for the proposition that it w as not legitimate for an appellate court to ignore the resolution of conflicting evidence by a trial judge and to draw inferences from the surrounding area of common ground only. 

**_ARGUMENTS FOR CYBERINC_** 

74\. Ms Tan submitted that as regards the issue w hether leave to appeal w as required, Dataw orks ow n application w as initially for leave to be granted. 

75\. Secondly, she relied on s 9A (1) Interpretation Act (Cap 1) w hich provides that: 

 9A. (1) In the interpretation of a provision of a w ritten law , an interpretation that w ould promote the purpose or object underlying the w ritten law (w hether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the w ritten law or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that w ould not promote that purpose or object. 

76\. Thirdly, under s 9A(3), a speech made in Parliament by a Minister on the occasion of the moving of a Bill and any relevant material in any official record of debates in Parliament could be considered in the interpretation of a provision of w ritten law. 

77\. She then referred to the speech of the Minister of Law on s 34(2)(a) as cited in the judgment of L P Thean JA in _Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Yong Qiang Construction_ <span class="citation">[1999] 4 SLR 401</span> and Thean JAs summary of the purpose of s 34(2)(a): 

 15 Prior to the amendments made by the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act 1998, s 34(2) read as follow s: 

 (2) Except w ith the leave of the Court of Appeal or a Judge, no appeal shall be brought to the Court of Appeal in any of the follow ing cases: 

 (a) w here the amount or value of the subject-matter at the trial is $30,000 or less; 

 The amending Act of 1998 amended para (a) by deleting the sum of $30,000 and substituting therefor the w ords $250,000 or such other amount as may be specified by an order made under subsection (3). All that the amendment did w as to increase the monetary limit from $30,000 to $250,000 and no other changes w ere made. How ever, the underlying purpose of this amendment w as to bring it in line w ith the jurisdiction of the District Court. The jurisdiction of the District Court had as from 1 August 1997, been increased to $250,000 and the amendment made to s 34(2)(a) in 1998 w as to bring it in line w ith the increased jurisdiction of the District Court and to allow an appeal to be brought to this court only w here leave to appeal is obtained from this court or a judge of the High Court. This w as evident from the speech of the Minister for Law , Professor Jayakumar, w hen he moved the Second Reading of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Bill on 26 November 1998. He said: 

 On 1 August 1997, the District Courts jurisdiction in civil matters w as raised from $100,000 to $250,000 In view of the 


 enhanced District Courts jurisdiction to $250,000 in civil matters, the Chief Justice has proposed that the existing $30,000 limit in s 34(2)(a) be raised to $250,000. In other w ords, bring its limit in line w ith the enhancement. If the limit is not raised to $250,000, District Court cases of less than $250,000 can first go on appeal to the High Court and then Court of Appeal. This w ould strain the limited resources of the Court of Appeal. 

 16 It seemed to us abundantly clear that the intention of Parliament in making the amendment to s 34(2)(a) of the SCJA w as to limit the right of appeal to this court. Hence, in any appeal from the decision of the High Court, in w hich the value of the subject matter involved does not exceed $250,000, leave to appeal must be obtained either from this court or a judge of the High Court. 

78\. To reinforce the above summary, Ms Tan referred to a speech by a Member of Parliament Mr R. Ravindran in the Singapore Parliament Report w hen the appropriate Bill w as being debated. In Parliament No 9, Session No 1, Volume No 69, Sitting No 11 of 26 November 1998, Mr Ravindran said (at column 1634): 

 Sir, the effect of the present limits is that cases w ithin the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court are appealable as of right to the High Court, but are not appealable as of right to the Court of Appeal. This is a tw o-tier system. This position is satisfactory, as there is no real need for a three tier-system for Magistrate Court suits. 

 Sir, cases w ithin the jurisdiction of the District Courts are appealable as of right to the High Court and are also appealable as of right to the Court of Appeal. This position is unsatisfactory as there is a three-tier system and it is not something that is really needed. Indeed, the proposed amendments may have been intended to do aw ay w ith this anomaly. Cases w ithin the jurisdiction of the High Court are appealable as of right to the Court of Appeal. Here again, there is a tw o tier system. This position is satisfactory and w as consciously adopted w ith the cessation of appeals to the Privy Council. 

79\. It seemed to me that this view w as implicit in the intention to limit the right of appeal from a decision of the District Court to primarily the High Court. Indeed this w as also recognised by Chao Hick Tin JA in para 13 of his judgment in _Tan Chiang Brothers Marble (S) Pte Ltd v Permasteelisa Pacific Holdings Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2002] 2 SLR 225</span> w here he said, Implicit in the scheme of things is that there should, as a rule, be only one tier of appeal .. 

80\. As for the argument that the court should assume, for present purposes, that Cyberinc w ould obtain the maximum sum under the District Courts jurisdiction after the assessment of damages, Ms Tan submitted that it w as uncertain how much Cyberinc w ould actually get. She argued that Mr Coomarasw amys argument w ould inject uncertainty. She also submitted that such an argument w ould cause an unw orkable or impracticable or inconvenient result. 

81\. Lastly, Ms Tan adopted a point from a question that I had posed to Mr Coomarasw amy. She submitted that if the cross-claim w as by w ay of a separate action, the argument of Mr Coomarasw amy of taking into account each figure to obtain the difference must fail as there w ere tw o separate actions. The fact that the cross-claim w as mounted as a counterclaim in the same action should not give rise to a different outcome. 

82\. As regards the question as to w hether leave to appeal, if required, should be granted, Ms Tan did not advance any submission thereon. 


### MY REASONS ON DATAWORKS APPLICATION 

83\. I w as of the view that Mr Coomarasw amy w as not w rong in adopting the maximum sum under the District Courts jurisdiction for the purpose of his argument in relation to s 34(2)(a). After all, Cyberinc had in its affidavit alleged its damages to be more than the $250,000 maximum sum. The situation w ould be different if Cyberinc w as alleging a sum much less than the maximum for its damages. I did not think that this approach w as injecting an uncertainty or w ould cause an unw orkable or impracticable or inconvenient result. It may be based on an assumption but the purpose w as to inject some certainty into the present application and not the other w ay around. On the contrary, Ms Tans suggestion that one should w ait until the assessment w as concluded w ould itself inject uncertainty and cause an unw orkable or impracticable or inconvenient result. This is because the dead-line to appeal w ill often be earlier than the conclusion of the assessment. Furthermore, after the assessment, there might be a further appeal or appeals. In any event, for the reasons stated below , it did not matter w hether the maximum sum w as used or the actual sum granted to Cyberinc w as used. 

84\. In my view , the case of _Augustine_ and the Malaysian case of _Yai Yen Hon_ w ere not relevant for the reasons I have mentioned. 

85\. It must be borne in mind that a counterclaim is a separate and independent action. If not for O 15 r 2(1) of the Rules of Court, a separate action w ould have to be filed separately. Order 15 r 2(1), how ever, enables, but does not compel, the separate action to be filed as a counterclaim in an existing action. 

86\. W hen the separate action is filed as a counterclaim, it does not cease to be a separate action in substance. Thus The Supreme Court Practice 1999 Volume 1 para 15/2/4 states: 

 15/2/4 To what extent a counterclaim is an independent action A counterclaim is substantially a cross-action, not merely a defence to the plaintiffs claim. It must be of such a nature that the Court w ould have jurisdiction to entertain it as a separate action ( Bow McLachlan & Co. Ltd v. Ship Camosun [1909] A.C. 597; Williams v. Agius [1914] A.C. 522). "A counterclaim is to be treated, for all purposes for w hich justice requires it to be so treated, as an independent action" ( per Bow en L.J., in Amon v. Bobbett 22 Q.B.D. 543 at 548). If after the defendant has pleaded a counterclaim, the action of the plaintiff is for any reason stayed, discontinued or dismissed, the counterclaim may nevertheless be proceeded w ith (para. (3)). Thus, w here the plaintiffs claim w as held to be frivolous, the Court still granted the defendant the relief prayed for by his counterclaim ( Adams v. Adams (1892) 45 Ch.D. 426; [1892] 1 Ch. 369). In short, for all purposes except those of execution, a claim and a counterclaim are tw o independent actions ( per Lord Esher M.R., in Stumore v. Campbell & Co. [1892] 1 Q.B. 314 at 317). 

 [Emphasis added.] 

87\. Therefore, although, as a matter of procedural convenience, a claim and a counterclaim are dealt w ith together at the same directions stage and the same trial, they are still separate actions. 

88\. The reference in s 34(2)(a) to the amount or value of the subject matter at the trial must, in my view , be construed as referring to the trial of an action. In the context of a claim and counterclaim, the trial is of tw o actions. This interpretation w ould advance the purpose of the provision w hich is to restrict appeals from District Court actions to the Court of Appeal. After all, claims and counterclaims are a common feature of litigation and it could not have been the intention of Parliament to allow such appeals to proceed to the Court of Appeal as a matter of right w hen Parliaments intention w as to restrict such appeals generally. 

89\. In addition, if Mr Coomarasw amys argument w as accepted, it w ould result in an anomaly. W hen the cross-claim is filed as a counterclaim, the right of appeal to the Court of Appeal w ould be unimpeded. 


How ever, if there w ere tw o separate actions, the right of appeal w ould be restricted. This could not be right even though I accepted that, generally, the tw o actions w ould be consolidated before the trial. How ever this w ould not alw ays necessarily be the case. 

90\. As for the argument that either Dataw ork w ould obtain payment for the price of the products already paid for or Cyberinc w ould obtain payment of the unpaid purchase price and damages, I w as of the view that such an argument militated against the conclusion that Mr Coomarasw amy w as advocating. In such a scenario, only the higher of the tw o possible judgment sums should be taken instead of adding them up. 

91\. In any event, I w as of the view that it did not matter w hether one party must succeed and the other must fail or the situation w as one in w hich each opposing party could succeed in its respective claims. Parliament did not intend for parties and the courts to engage in an exercise to determine w hich scenario w as applicable for every claim and counterclaim in order to determine w hether leave to appeal w as required. 

92\. Accordingly, I concluded that Dataw ork w as required to obtain leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. 

93\. As for the issue w hether leave to appeal should be granted, I w as of the view that it w as not open to Mr Coomarasw amy to advance the argument about the intermediate role of the High Court w hen his colleague, Mr David Chan, advanced a different argument before me w hen the appeal proper to the High Court w as heard by me. In summary, Mr Chan had advocated only the trite principle that an appellate court should be slow in disturbing findings of fact of a trial court and Ms Tan did not dispute that principle. 

94\. In any event, the High Court is, as a rule, supposed to be the final appellate court for trials in the District Court. It is only in limited situations that an appeal may be made to the Court of Appeal. In emphasizing the likelihood of an increase in the District Courts jurisdiction, Mr Coomarasw amy w as actually reminding me of the concern w hich led to the limiting of appeals from the District Court to the Court of Appeal. 

95\. Ultimately, I w as of the view that how ever Mr Coomarasw amy sought to couch the applicable principle for an appellate High Court, it w ould not have made a difference to my conclusion. I w as of the view that the finding of the trial judge w as plainly w rong or, to use Mr Coomarasw amys w ords, w as manifestly erroneous or perverse. 

96\. The truth of the matter w as that my decision and the reasons for my decision did not involve any important question of law for the Court of Appeal to decide. 

97\. As for w hether my decision involved an error of law , I w as of the view that my decision w as on the facts. How ever, Mr Coomarasw amy had to label it as an error of law to improve Dataw orks chances of securing leave to appeal. For the reasons I have given as to w hy I reached a different conclusion from the trial judge, I could not agree that her conclusion could stand w hen tested against inherent probabilities or improbabilities and against uncontroverted facts. 

98\. I also did not think that the Australian case of _Baumgartner v Baumgartner_ took the matter any further. I did not base my decision solely on w hat w as common ground. W ith respect, my decision w as based more on the application of facts and points w hich the trial judge had not considered. 

99\. Accordingly, leave to appeal w as refused.
