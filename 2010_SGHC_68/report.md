3       Marc h 2010 Judgment reserved. 

**Choo Han Teck J:** 

1       This was an appeal against the dec ision of the Commissioner under the Workmen’s Compensation Ac t (Cap 354, 1998 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”) refusing the Appellant’s c laim for c ompensation for his injury. The Commissioner had ruled that the injury was not c aused by an ac c ident arising out 

of and in the c ourse of his employment with the 1st Respondent. The 2nd Respondent is the 1st Respondent’s insurer. The Appellant appealed to the High Court under s 29 of the Ac t. 

2       The Appellant’s c laim before the Commissioner was made on the basis that he suffered an injury to his bac k when he was dismantling a lift motor. His report of the ac c ident to the Ministry of Manpower stated that he had been c arrying the motor with the assistanc e of three other workers when he heard a c rac king sound in his lower bac k. At the hearing before the Commissioner, however, he c laimed that he had injured himself when he had stretc hed out in order to prevent the motor from falling into the lift shaft. After hearing the Appellant’s testimony, the Commissioner produc ed the Appellant’s statement to the Ministry of Manpower and highlighted the inc onsistenc ies. That statement had only been in the possession of the Commissioner and had not hitherto been available to either the Appellant or the Respondents. The Appellant maintained that the version of events he gave in oral testimony was true. The Respondents applied to impeac h the Appellant’s c redibility. The Commissioner found that the Appellant’s c redibility was impeac hed on ac c ount of the material disc repanc ies between the reported ac c ount of the ac c ident, the statement given to the Ministry of Manpower and the Appellant’s evidenc e before him. The Commissioner stated in his grounds of dec ision that the Appellant’s ac c ount of the ac c ident was not c orroborated by his own witness and the medic al reports. It was also not put to any of the Respondents’ witnesses that they had lied when testifying that there had been no ac c ident on the day the injury was allegedly sustained. As a result, the Commissioner found that the Appellant had failed to establish that his injury had been c aused by an ac c ident arising out of and in the c ourse of his employment and denied his c laim for c ompensation under the Ac t. 

3       In the appeal before me, the Appellant applied for the Commissioner’s dec ision to be set aside as erroneous in law for three reasons: first, the Commissioner failed to apply the presumption found in s 3(6) of the Ac t; sec ond, the Commissioner should not have used the Appellant’s rec orded statement from the Ministry of Manpower to impeac h the latter’s c redit; and third, the Commissioner’s provision 


and use of the statement gave rise to a reasonable doubt of bias against the Appellant and amounted to c onduc t of the proc eedings in an unfair and prejudic ial manner. I shall address the third limb of the Appellant’s c ase first. 

4       The Respondents’ c ounsel argued that allegations of bias on the part of the Commissioner must be made by way of judic ial review and not appeal. This was to enable the AttorneyGeneral to be heard at the proc eedings and respond on the Commissioner’s behalf. Counsel pointed out that in all the authorities c ited by the Appellant, bias was alleged in the c ontext of judic ial review: see _R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy_ [1924] 1 KB 256; _Metropolitan Properties Co. (F.G.C.) Ltd v Lannon & Ors_ and _R v London Rent Assessment Panel Committee, ex parte Metropolitan Properties Co. (F.G.C.) Ltd_ [1969] 1 QB 577; _De Souza Lionel Jerome v A-G_ <span class="citation">[1993] 3 SLR(R) 552</span>; and _Re Singh Kalpanath_ <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR(R) 595</span>. Thus, any allegation of a breac h of the rules of natural justic e must be raised exc lusively within the judic ial review proc ess. Counsel for the Appellant disagreed. It was feared that the c ourt would not grant judic ial review remedies in c ases where Parliament had already provided a spec ific proc ess for appeal. Counsel for the Appellant referred to _R v Epping and Harlow General Commissioners, ex parte Goldstraw_ [1983] 3 All ER 257, _R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Swati_ [1986] 1 WLR 477, and _Ex parte Waldron_ [1986] QB 824 to support his proposition. 

5       This apparent c onflic t of authorities reflec ts a tension between the proc edural exc lusivity of judic ial review and statutory avenues spec ific ally provided by Parliament. In the c ontext of this c ase, it seemed to me that resolution between the two turned on a reading of the statutory provisions of the Ac t. Sec tion 29(1) provides that any person aggrieved by any order of the Commissioner may appeal to the High Court; s 29(2A) states that no appeal shall lie against any order unless it involves a substantial question of law. The c ruc ial question, therefore, is whether the question of alleged bias on the part of the Commissioner amounts to a substantial question of law. If it does, then I may hear the Appellant’s allegations via the statutory appeal route provided in s 29 of the Ac t; if it does not, then the Appellant’s appeal in respec t of the allegation of bias must be dismissed and judic ial review proc eedings brought instead. 

6       Does the question whether there has been bias on the part of the Commissioner amount to a substantial question of law? In my view, it does not. In _Next of Kin of Ramu Vanniyar Ravichandran v Fongsoon Enterprises (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2008] 3 SLR(R) 105</span>, I held that the appellant’s arguments amounted to questions of law bec ause they related to the applic ation of princ iples of agenc y law and presumptions of law in the statute. I found that they were substantial questions as they “[were] likely to feature in most workmen’s c ompensation c ases...” My approac h was similar to that taken in _Northern Elevator Manufacturing Sdn Bhd v United Engineers (Singapore) Pte Ltd (No 2)_ <span class="citation">[2004] 2 SLR(R) 494</span> (“Northern Elevator”), where the phrase “question of law” was defined narrowly in the c ontext of (what was then) s 28 of the Arbitration Ac t (Cap 10, 1985 Rev Ed). The Court of Appeal distinguished between an error of law where the c ourt had no jurisdic tion to c onduc t judic ial review and a question of law where it had, and stated that: 

 18 An opportunity arose for c omment in Ahong Construction (S) Pte Ltd v United Boulevard Pte Ltd <span class="citation">[1993] 2 SLR(R) 208</span>. In that c ase, G P Selvam JC (as he then was) stated at [7]: 

 A question of law means a point of law in controversy whic h has to be resolved after opposing views and arguments have been c onsidered. It is a matter of substanc e the determination of whic h will dec ide the rights between the parties. If the point of law is settled and not something novel and it is c ontended that the arbitrator made an error in the applic ation of the law there lies no appeal against that error for there is no question of law whic h c alls for the opinion of the c ourt... [emphasis added] 


 19 To our mind, a “question of law” must nec essarily be a finding of law whic h the parties dispute, that requires the guidanc e of the c ourt to resolve... 

7       Some c ourts applied the _Northern Elevator_ princ iple more liberally. In the workmen’s c ompensation c ase of _Karuppiah Ravichandran v GDS Engineering Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2009] 3 SLR(R) 1028</span> (“Karuppiah”), Kan Ting Chiu J ac c epted a wider definition of what c onstituted a “question of law” under the Ac t – though he held that not every finding of fac t (even if it were manifestly wrong) nec essarily amounted to a substantial question or error of law (at [15] – [16]). The basis of his reasoning was the dec ision of Andrew Ang J in _Ng Swee Lang v Sasson Samuel Bernard_ <span class="citation">[2008] 1 SLR(R) 522</span> (“Ng Swee Lang”). There, a distinc tion was drawn between appeals on a “question of law” from an arbitrator’s award and appeals from the dec isions of statutory boards. In the latter a “question of law” would inc lude a range of issues whic h, under the _Northern Elevator_ approac h, would have been c onsidered mere errors of law. Kan J ac c epted (as Ang J had before him) the full range of 

errors of law found in _Halsbury’s Laws of England_ vol 1(1) (Butterworths, 4th Ed Reissue, 1989) (“Halsbury’s”), para 70: 

 ... misinterpretation of a statute or any other legal doc ument or a rule of c ommon law; asking oneself and answering the wrong question, taking irrelevant c onsiderations into ac c ount or failing to take relevant c onsiderations into ac c ount when purporting to apply the law to the fac ts; admitting inadmissible evidenc e or rejec ting admissible and relevant evidenc e; exerc ising a disc retion on the basis of inc orrec t legal princ iples; giving reasons whic h disc lose faulty legal reasoning or whic h are inadequate to fulfil an express duty to give reasons, and misdirec ting oneself as to the burden of proof. 

He also ac c epted Lord Radc liffe’s statement (in _Edwards v Bairstow_ [1956] AC 14 at 36) that a fac tual finding whic h was suc h that “no person ac ting judic ially and properly instruc ted as to the relevant law c ould have c ome to the determination upon appeal” amounted to a misc onc eption or error in point of law – though he held that not every wrong finding of fac t would amount to a substantial question of law. The rationale for this broader definition of “question of law” was explained by Ang J in _Ng Swee Lang_ , at [24] and [25]: 

 24 ... there was a c lear and vital distinc tion between statutory tribunals and private arbitrations. Statutory tribunals suc h as the Board performed important func tions of the Government, whic h would generally affec t the wider public interest, as c ompared to private arbitrations. There had to be a greater degree of supervision over suc h tribunals by the c ourts... there was a fundamental differenc e between private arbitrations, whose existenc e was underpinned by the princ iple of party autonomy, and a hearing before the [Strata Titles] Board... 

 25 I am inc lined to agree with Mr Hwang that Northern Elevator’s definition of “question of law” was given in the c ontext of an applic ation for leave to appeal from an arbitral award where different polic y c onsiderations applied... 

Kan J ac c epted this distinc tion and the princ iples and definitions set out above in the c ontext of an appeal from a dec ision of the Commissioner for Labour under the Ac t. 

8       _Karuppiah_ and _Ng Swee Lang_ suggest that there may be good reason to distinguish between appeals from an arbitral award and appeals from the dec isions of a statutory board. In partic ular, the adoption of a wider definition of “question of law” in the c ontext of appeals from the dec isions of the Commissioner for Labour may be ac c eptable. A “substantial question of law” in suc h situations may inc lude administrative law c onc epts of error of law. However, it is not c lear how this would assist the Appellant in his c ase. The list of “errors of law” enumerated in para 70 of _Halsbury’s_ and at [6] above 


does not inc lude breac hes of the laws of natural justic e; even the more rec ent edition of _Halsbury’s_ 

_Laws of England_ vol 1(1) (Butterworths, 4th Ed Reissue, 2001) at para 77 also fails to inc lude either allegations of bias or breac h of the right to a fair hearing within its definition of “error of law”. As suc h, the Appellant in this c ase may not found his appeal to this c ourt on the basis of alleged bias on the part of the Commissioner giving rise to an error of law. His appeal on this point must therefore be dismissed. If he wishes to pursue this allegation of bias, he must apply for leave to bring an ac tion for judic ial review. 

9       I c ome to the c onc lusion in the above paragraph with some reluc tanc e. Ideally, an appeal to the c ourts from the dec ision of the Commissioner for Labour should be the one final stop where a c laimant under the Ac t may have all issues relating to his c laim for c ompensation determined. The purpose of Workmen’s Compensation legislation was to provide for expeditious payment of c ompensation. This objec t was c ited by the then Minister for Labour, Mr Ong Pang Boon, at the sec ond reading of the Workmen’s Compensation Bill (Bill 25 of 1975) (see _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (26 Marc h 1975) vol 34 at c ols 1037 and 1042). It was reiterated again by Mr Gan Kim Yong, then Minister of State (Educ ation and Manpower) at the sec ond reading of the Workmen’s Compensation (Amendment) Bill (Bill 50 of 2007) ( _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (22 January 2008) vol 84 at c ol 259): 

 The Workmen’s Compensation Ac t... provides a simpler and quic ker way to settle c ompensation c laims by avoiding protrac ted legal proc eedings. 

The goals of simplic ity and expedition are not generally served by requiring an appellant to take out two separate ac tions (appeal and judic ial review) in order to c hallenge the dec ision of the Commissioner for Labour. It would also be more c ostly for an appellant to maintain two separate ac tions in the High Court. Under s 2(1) of the 1998 Revised Edition of the Ac t (the applic able Ac t in this c ase), a worker is only entitled to make a c laim if he is a manual labourer or a non-manual one earning less than $1,600 a month. That c overage has sinc e been extended to nearly all employees by the Work Injury Compensation Ac t (Cap 354, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the 2009 Ac t”); however, the majority of c laims under the Ac t are still very likely to be made by manual labourers. They are also more likely to suffer injuries resulting in fatalities and permanent disability. Even with the extended c overage of the 2009 Ac t, the high inc idenc e of c laims in these generally lower-inc ome industries is unlikely to c hange. To require suc h workers to maintain two ac tions in order to c hallenge a Commissioner’s dec ision would plac e too great a strain on their already meagre earnings (made even more so by the fac t of their injuries). The polic y interests behind the Ac t would be better served, therefore, if questions of natural justic e and errors of law c ould be addressed in a single appeal to the High Court. 

10     Despite the strong polic y reasons set out above, however, I find that I am limited by the authorities and the legislative approac h taken by Parliament when it passed the Ac t. Unless an equivalent provision to s 48(1)(a)(vii) of the Arbitration Ac t (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) – whic h allows an award to be set aside by the Court where “a breac h of the rules of natural justic e oc c urred in c onnec tion with the making of the award by whic h the rights of any party have been prejudic ed” – is introduc ed into workmen’s c ompensation legislation, it is my view that any worker who alleges that his c laim for c ompensation was rejec ted bec ause of bias or breac h of his right to a fair hearing will have to take out judic ial review proc eedings separately in order to address his allegations. It may be that the polic y imperatives outlined above may be addressed somewhat if c ounsel were to take out both the Originating Summons for appeal and applic ation for leave to proc eed with judic ial review at the same time. In this way, both matters c ould be heard simultaneously by the same judge and dealt with expediently, with minimal c osts. This solution is not perfec t, however, and it is c lear that Parliament may wish to turn its attention to the question if the polic y c onsiderations above are to be addressed fully. In any event, however, the Appellant in this c ase no longer has the option of taking out his 


applic ation for appeal and for leave to proc eed with judic ial review at the same time. The prac tic al solution is no longer available to him and he must (if he so c hooses) inc ur the additional expense of bringing separate judic ial proc eedings. The appellant may be best advised c onsider the option c arefully, however, bec ause the Commissioner was rightly entitled to the workman’s statement and was thus entitled to use it as he thinks fit, although many of the allegations of bias in this c ase c ould have been avoided had the Commissioner made the Respondent witnesses’ statements available at the Appellant’s request at the outset. 

11     Having dismissed the third limb of the Appellant’s c ase, I now address the sec ond limb: whether the Commissioner was c orrec t to impeac h the Appellant’s c redit using his previous statement. The Appellant argued that the disc repanc ies between his statement and testimony in c ourt were not suffic iently material as to affec t his c redit. He pointed out that the disc repanc ies were no greater than those found between the testimonies and statements of the Respondent’s own witnesses and that if his c redibility was impeac hed, theirs should have been too. 

12     The Commissioner’s assessment of the Appellant’s and the Respondents’ witnesses’ c redibility is a finding of fac t and should not be overturned unless it was c learly wrong on the fac e of the evidenc e. The Appellant sought to c hallenge the Commissioner’s approac h in applying the law on impeac hment. He relied on the following paragraph from the c riminal c ase of _Muthusamy v Public Prosecutor_ [1948] MLJ 57 in support of his submissions: 

 If the statement gives an outline of substantially the same story there being no apparently irrec onc ilable c onflic t between the two on any point material to the issue, the magistrate should say at onc e “The differenc e is not suc h as to affec t his c redit” and hand the statement bac k. 

However, to say that the differing ac c ounts in his statement and his testimony amount to “substantially the same story” would be to ac c ept the two as c onsistent bec ause they both allege that the injury was sustained while he was working. That would effec tively negate the requirement for the Appellant to prove that his injury was suffered in the c ourse of his employment. I am of the view that the differenc es were material and the Commissioner was entitled to c onsider the Appellant’s c redit as impeac hed by operation of s 157(c ) of the Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). It is also important to note that the Commissioner did not rely solely on the inc onsistenc ies between the Appellant’s statement and testimony in order to determine the weight to ac c ord his ac c ount of the ac c ident. The Commissioner also c onsidered other fac tors, inc luding how the Appellant’s ac c ount of the ac c ident lac ked c orroboration from his own witness and the medic al reports and the failure to direc tly c hallenge the Respondents’ witnesses’ ac c ounts on c ross-examination. As a result, it c annot be said that the Commissioner erred in law when he found the Appellant’s c redibility to have been impeac hed. 

13     The final limb to be addressed is the Appellant’s c ontention that the Commissioner failed to c orrec tly apply the presumption c ontained in s 3(6) of the Ac t, whic h provides that: 

 For the purposes of this Ac t, an ac c ident arising in the c ourse of a workman’s employment shall be deemed, in the absenc e of evidenc e to the c ontrary, to have arisen out of that employment. 

The Commissioner should, the Appellant argued, have reversed the burden of proof to require the Respondent to rebut the presumption that the ac c ident, whic h arose in the c ourse of the Appellant’s employment, arose _out of_ that employment. This point may be addressed shortly. It is c lear from the Commissioner’s dec ision that the reason he denied the Appellant’s c laim was that he did not find the injury to have been sustained in the c ourse of the Appellant’s employment at all. Indeed, in his written grounds he made partic ular referenc e to the medic al report of Dr Ramdass – whic h stated that 


the Appellant had been c omplaining of a pain in his bac k for some time before the alleged ac c ident took plac e. As no finding is here made as to the Commissioner ac ting in breac h of natural justic e and sinc e I have not found the impeac hment of the Appellant’s c redibility to be wrong, the presumption in s 3(6) simply does not arise. As Kan J pointed out in _Karuppiah_ at [24]: 

 The presumption in s 3(6) does not arise whenever a worker is injured in an ac c ident. It applies to ac c idents arising in the course of his employment. When the Commissioner found that the ac c ident did not arise in the c ourse of the applic ant’s employment, the presumption in s 3(6) did not apply. 

Thus, the Commissioner did not err in law in failing to apply the presumption. As the Appellant’s c ase failed on all its three grounds, this appeal must be dismissed. I will hear parties on the question of c osts at a later date.
