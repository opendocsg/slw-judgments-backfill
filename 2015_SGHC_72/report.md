**Introduction** 

1       The plaintiff, the wife in the marriage (“the Wife”), and defendant, the husband (“the Husband”), c ame before me on the issue of the division of the matrimonial property, as well as maintenanc e for the Wife and the three c hildren of the marriage. Muc h of the arguments in this c ase, as well as the affidavits, c entred on the inc lusion and valuation of assets for whic h there was insuffic ient evidenc e provided by the party best able to do so: the Husband. This affec ted the determination of what was just and equitable in the c irc umstanc es. In the end, a rough and ready alloc ation is ordered, with an adverse inferenc e drawn against the Husband. 

**Background** 

2       The parties were married in 1992, and divorc e proc eedings were c ommenc ed at the end of 

2011\. Interim judgment was given on 17 January 2012. There are three c hildren to the marriage: a 21-year-old daughter, one 19-year-old son, and a 16-year-old son. The parties have joint c ustody, with c are and c ontrol given to the Wife. 

3       The potential pool of assets c onsists primarily of real property, interests in businesses and trusts. There are also some insuranc e polic ies and money in bank ac c ounts. The diffic ulty in this c ase is that the value of a signific ant number of assets is unc ertain. The Husband maintained that a number of these, espec ially the businesses and trusts have low, negligible or no value. The Wife for her part c ontended that there had not been proper disc losure of the value of these assets. 

4       The Husband and Wife disputed their respec tive amounts of c ontributions. The Husband appears to have primarily been an entrepreneur with many different business interests, but who now apparently has no fixed employment. The Wife earns most of her inc ome providing training in the People’s Republic of China. There is also rental from one of the apartments owned in Singapore ([A] Apartment (“the Matrimonial Home”)), though part of that is c laimed by the Husband. She also disc losed a small sum rec eived as royalties. She sought $1,000 per month as maintenanc e, but 


fac tored on an eight year basis. 

5       In respec t of the maintenanc e of the c hildren, one son is in a polytec hnic , finishing in 2015, while the other son would have just sat for the SingaporeCambridge General Certific ate of Educ ation (Ordinary Level) Examination (“OLevel”). The oldest c hild, the daughter, has an ac c ounting diploma, but is now attending a legal studies c ourse, with a view to possibly pursuing a degree in law. 

**The Wife’s case** 

6       The Wife c ontended that she should be awarded two Singapore apartments, namely, the Matrimonial Home, [B] Apartment (“the Sec ond Apartment”); one apartment in the People’s Republic of China (“the Chongqing Apartment”); a c ompany, [F] Company; and other misc ellaneous assets. The Wife’s estimate of the value of these assets was $2,456,178.13 out of a total value of about $5.8m for all the assets in the hands of the Husband and Wife. 

7       Her position was that as the Husband had not given full and frank disc losure, it was diffic ult for a proper asc ertainment of division to be made. She pointed to lac k of information about the various c ompanies and trusts, and also the diffic ulties in getting the Husband to c larify his stand on suc h disc losure whic h he has given. She thus asked that a presumption be drawn against the Husband, and ac c ordingly that she should be given the assets she has asked for, whic h by her c alc ulation amounted to only about 42% of the matrimonial assets. As for maintenanc e, the Wife sought maintenanc e for the educ ation of the oldest c hild, beyond 21. She also sought maintenanc e for the remaining two c hildren’s tertiary educ ation leading to their first degree. In addition, she sought $2,350 for eac h of the three c hildren, giving a total of $7,050 per month. She also sought $1,000 per month for eight years as maintenanc e for herself. 

**The Husband’s case** 

8       The Husband did not file submissions, supposedly bec ause he wanted to save c osts in these proc eedings. He relied on his Dec laration of Matrimonial Assets and his Fac t and Position Sheet. The Husband spec ified various assets, whic h he indic ated as being more than $1.5m in total. These inc luded properties in Singapore being the Matrimonial Home and the Sec ond Apartment, properties in New Zealand, the Chongqing Apartment, insuranc e polic ies, bank ac c ounts, Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) ac c ounts, various personal items, c lub membership, and monies given. Liabilities identified by him were the mortgage loans for the Singapore and New Zealand properties, an overdraft ac c ount, a debt owed by the Wife to her mother, the Husband’s loan from his mother of $1.2m, awards made against him in New Zealand and various other debts of small or unknown amounts. 

9       His position as to division, essentially, as it c ame out during oral arguments was to hold the First and Sec ond Apartment until a possible en-bloc sale took plac e, for equal division thereafter; that other properties in New Zealand were to be sold with sharing of profits or shortfall; and similarly in respec t of the property in China. He also proposed to transfer rights and interests in various c ompanies to the Wife. At least one of these transfers would leave the wife with an interest in a New Zealand property. Other assets were to be left in the names of the respec tive parties. Of other property, inc luding interests in c ompanies, as well as insuranc e polic ies, the Husband proposed primarily to retain all personal items, ac c ount balanc es, and insuranc e polic ies. He also c ited a number of liabilities that were to be ac c ounted for. These were a $1.2m dollar loan from his mother; $100, lent to the Wife by his father and about $70,000 that was taken from an overdraft ac c ount by his Wife. 

10     At various points during oral arguments, the Husband tendered various doc uments. 


Subsequently, c ounsel for the Wife, Ms Loh Wai Mooi (“Ms Loh”), indic ated that she would have to take issue with most of these. As it was, the Husband c hose to withdraw these doc uments, and they were not therefore available to the c ourt in its determination. 

**The Decision** 

11     I have dec ided that an adverse inferenc e should be drawn in favour of the Wife. Had there been proper disc losure, the asc ertainment of the direc t c ontributions made by the two parties to the various matrimonial asserts c ould have been more straightforward. As it was, however, the Husband’s failure to give full and frank disc losure of his assets meant that any proper ac c ounting of the direc t financ ial c ontributions was not possible. A broad-brush approac h had to be used, though whenever possible I have taken into ac c ount the parties’ direc t financ ial c ontributions. 

12     After c onsidering the evidenc e and arguments, I have dec ided to order the division of assets giving the Wife what she had sought, namely, the c ouple’s interests in the Matrimonial Home and the Sec ond Apartment, as well as the Chongqing Apartment, and the interest in [F] Company. This gives her above 40 odd per c ent of the whole pool, so far as c an be asc ertained with any c onfidenc e in this c ase. I however dec line to award her the maintenanc e she has sought. I do not think that an award of $1,000 per month is made out based on the relative positions of both parties. I do award the maintenanc e of the c hildren as she has sought. 

13     In c oming to my dec ision, I bore in mind that the Husband was a litigant-in-person. I have been c areful to c onsider the evidenc e and submissions. At the same time, I have been mindful that I should not give suc h lenienc y and toleranc e to the Husband to the extent that I would be ac ting unfairly to the Wife or her c ounsel, Ms Loh. 

**The Division of the Matrimonial Property** 

14     The primary approac h in division of property under s 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Women’s Charter”) is a broad-brush one, taking into ac c ount both direc t and indirec t c ontributions: _BCB v BCC_ <span class="citation">[2013] 2 SLR 324</span> _(“BCB_ ”) and _NK v NL_ <span class="citation">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 743</span> (“ _NK v NL_ ”). Though _BCB_ was not c ited in argument, that c ase reiterated princ iples laid down in other c ases. As noted in _BCB_ (at [10]): 

 The broad-brush approac h is partic ularly apposite bec ause, in the nature of things, an approac h that is rooted in the forensic searc h for the ac tual financ ial c ontributions of the parties towards the ac quisition of the assets will inevitably fail to adequately value the indirec t c ontributions made towards the other expenses that are inc urred in the c ourse of raising a family and will also be a heavily fac t-c entric exerc ise. ... 

The Court of Appeal went on to note that c ontemporaneous rec ords often would not be available to assist in the resolution of the c laims. The Court of Appeal then underlined the general approac h (at [10]): 

 ... [S]uc h a broad yet princ ipled approac h enables us to strike a balanc e between the searc h for a just and princ ipled outc ome in eac h c ase and the need to remain sensitive to the nuanc es of eac h fac t situation we are c onfronted with. ... [T]his c ourt has held that there is no starting point, presumption or norm of an equal division of matrimonial assets, a holding that is wholly c onsistent with the legislative bac kground whic h resulted in s 112 and its c onc omitant broadbrush approac h. ... 


15     One general approac h to the division of matrimonial property has been what was desc ribed in _NK v NL_ as the first methodology. This requires identific ation of all the matrimonial assets, the assessment of the net value of that pool, the determination of a just and equitable division, and how the division should be satisfied. The other approac h noted in _NK v NL_ is for distribution by c lassific ation. Either approac h fulfils the requirements of the law. In the present c ase, the Wife has adopted the first approac h. I agree with that, as the sec ond approac h, while theoretic ally permitted, is not feasible in the present c ase. 

16     The c omplic ation in the present proc eedings is that there is inc omplete information about the pool of matrimonial assets. Most of the unc ertainty c onc erned the value of c ompanies and interests in trusts; however the unc ertainty also touc hed on some other properties. With that unc ertainty, c lassific ation of the assets would not ac hieve muc h purpose. The step-by-step methodology allows at least for a best effort to be made with what information is ac tually available before the c ourt. 

17     There was a lac k of information bec ause the Husband had not fully disc losed everything that c onstitutes the pool of matrimonial assets. He justified this at various points on the basis that he did not wish to prolong proc eedings; at other points he c ontended that the Wife should know what the position with respec t to the assets was and what their value should be. While the Husband is a litigant-in-person, and some latitude c ould be given to suc h litigants, the indulgenc e shown by the c ourt c ould not extend to exc using him from the c onsequenc es of his failure to give full and frank disc losure. His failure to do so has in fac t prolonged the proc eedings, and made the determination of the c ase more diffic ult. As will be disc ussed below, I have ultimately determined that an adverse inferenc e should be drawn against the Husband. 

18     I had c onsidered adjourning the matter further to allow more evidenc e to c ome in but did not c onsider that muc h would be gained by an adjournment given that multiple affidavits have been filed by eac h side. The Husband has had ample opportunity to give his evidenc e fully. 

**_The matrimonial assets_** 

19     What c onstituted the matrimonial property was in some doubt. The Wife c ontended that the Husband had not given full disc losure, and should therefore be presumed against in the division of the assets that were known. The Husband for his part denied withholding anything, alleging that he had only not inc luded assets that were not worthwhile or whic h the Wife would have known about. What c ame from the Husband c ame out in dribs and drabs at the hearing. It may be that some of these assets are truly not worth substantial sums, or maybe entangled in c laims or ownership by other part ies. Whatever the ac tual reason, it was evident that there had not been full and systematic disc losure. 

20     The assets for whic h there was c lear information will be examined first, ahead of the assets for whic h what was available was insuffic ient. 

_Clear matrimonial assets_ 

21     The assets as to whic h there was c lear evidenc e were the Matrimonial Home, the Sec ond Apartment and the Chongqing Apartment. The valuations for these properties c ame primarily from the Wife. The Husband did not provide figures that differed signific antly from those from the Wife, but in any event, I prefer her evidenc e as she had generally been more open. The estimated values of the various properties are as follows: 

 (a) The estimated value of the Matrimonial Home is about $1.7m. It is c urrently tenanted with 


 rental at $4,000 per month. It is in the joint names of the parties. There was some dispute between the parties about their respec tive financ ial c ontributions. 

 (b) The Sec ond Apartment is owned by the Wife and her mother as tenants in c ommon of half-share eac h. The value of the Wife’s half-share is approximately $789,516.63. The c irc umstanc es of the Wife’s mother’s half-share was in dispute. 

 (c ) The Chongqing Apartment is a property in China. The value of the property is estimated to be $300,000. It has been fully paid-up. There was a dispute between the parties as to the distribution of this property. 

 The evidenc e in respec t of the assets c ame largely from the Wife; the Husband disputed a number of matters in respec t of these assets, but there was at least some material before the Court to allow determination of the c ontributions of the parties, and the value of these assets. 

_Questionable assets_ 

22     The Wife c ontended that these assets belonged to the Husband, and properly speaking should be part of the pool of matrimonial assets subjec t to division. However, the value, if any, and whether the Husband c ontrolled the whole of eac h asset was not entirely c lear from the evidenc e before the c ourt. This unc ertainty led the Wife to propose that the award to her inc lude those assets whic h had c lear values only. The Husband for his part c ontended that some of these assets were not really his to dispose of, or that their values were minimal. 

23     The disputed assets inc lude property, various trust holdings as well as interests in a number of c ompanies and trust c ompanies as follows: 

 (a) properties in New Zealand; 

 (b) interests in the following c ompanies: [G] Company, [H] Company, [I] Company, [J] Company, [K] Company, [L] Company, [M] Company, [N] Company, [O] Company, [P] Company, [Q] Company, [R] Company, [S] Company and [T] Company (c ollec tively, “the Companies”); and 

 (c ) interests in the following trusts and/or trust c ompanies: [U] Trust, [V] Trust, [W] Trust, and [X] Trust (“c ollec tively, “the Trusts”).The Wife pointed out that the evidenc e in respec t of these interests was lac king. 

 (d) inc ome; 

 (e) various trust interests highlighted above; 

 (f) shares, espec ially in [Y] Company; 

 (g) c lub memberships; 

 (h) a yac ht; 

 (i) rac e horses; 

 (j) interests in c ompanies and New Zealand properties; and 

 (k) bank ac c ounts. 


 It was also c ontended that the Husband must have more bank ac c ounts than those that were disc losed, espec ially given the time whic h he has spent overseas. This would inc lude the likelihood of him having bank ac c ounts in New Zealand. 

24     Some of these assets should be exc luded in the determination of the pool of matrimonial assets. In respec t of [I] Company, the Wife c ontended that there was no information provided on the details of the sale of the Husband’s shares and when this was done, the Husband only disc losed that he obtained $300,000 for these shares. There was little information provided about the yac ht, or rac e horses previously owned by the family. The Wife mentioned them, but again highlighted that the Husband had not made any disc losure about these assets or what has bec ome of them. Given the lapse of time sinc e their ownership, in the c irc umstanc es, the c onc lusion must be that they were disposed of and any proc eeds not extant. As for the c lub memberships, it does seem that the Husband eventually disc losed his memberships; the c omplaint then is really of late disc losure. 

(1) Inc ome 

25     Though this would be relevant to the issue of maintenanc e rather than the asc ertainment of the asset pool, it is more c onvenient to deal with it at this point together with the questionable assets. The question of his inc ome is a live one, and has a signific ant impac t on the outc ome of the proc eedings. The Husband c laimed that he had no inc ome, exc ept for a half-interest in the rental c oming in for the Matrimonial Home. The Wife as noted above c ontended that this c ould not be true, given his dealings over the years. While the Wife might have her suspic ions, I c ould not find that the evidenc e before me was suc h that an adverse inferenc e c ould be derived from the absenc e of inc ome. There is a suspic ion that he may have other means, through his other assets, but that does not nec essarily mean that he has other sourc es of inc ome besides the rental: he c ould be living off his c apital. 

(2) Trust interests 

26     In oral argument, the Husband maintained that the trusts had no value, and offered these to the Wife. This offer I c ould not take as a _bona fide_ one in the c irc umstanc es; the value of these assets is unc ertain, and it is not c lear what ac tivities or property interests these trusts have been engaged in. Against the vac uum of information, any offer to transfer these trusts as suc h would be empty. As noted by the Wife in her submissions, it is unc lear why there is a web of trust interests, trust c ompanies and other c ompanies. 

27     Taking two trusts and trust c ompanies addressed by the Wife in submissions, the [U] Trust, and the [W] Trust, it was evident that the Husband failed to make adequate disc losure in terms of both trusts. In respec t of the [U] Trust, the Husband refused to provide information and c ontended that the Wife should be aware of this information, being an equal trustee. Eventually, the Husband disc losed that this Trust was c ontrolled by another c ompany, [T] Company. The Wife is named as a direc tor of [T] Company, but she is c learly not in c ontrol of the management and direc tion of that c ompany. Similarly, insuffic ient disc losure was given in respec t of the [W] Trust. All that the Husband offered, as noted by the Wife, was to transfer these trusts and other interests to the Wife. It was also not always entirely c lear whether the trusts were trusts properly speaking or trust c ompanies. 

28     In the absenc e of any explanation of the interests making up this web, I c onc lude that the Husband has given insuffic ient disc losure. 

(3) Share interest 


29     The Wife c ontended there was a value of about $105,000 for the shares, whic h are in a c ompany known as [Y] Company. The Husband in his affidavit admitted ownership, but c ontended that they were of questionable value. There was nothing about these shares in his Dec laration of Value of Matrimonial Assets, and his Fac t and Position Sheet. The Wife’s valuation was based on a statement of ac c ount dated 31 January 2012. In the c irc umstanc es, I ac c ept the Wife’s valuation, but that does not mean that the Husband should esc ape the c onsequenc es of the lac k of full disc losure. He should have disc losed this fully, and his attempt to disc ount the value without more c alls into question his overall c redibility. 

(4) Companies 

30     The Husband’s c laimed that the interest in the Companies were of little or no value, and that the Trusts were generally not worth muc h either. The Wife was unable to give a value for these c ompanies or trust interests. The Husband has given little by way of doc umentary support for his assertion that the Trusts and the Companies were of little or no value. There were for instanc e, few tax returns, c ompanies’ ac c ounts or trust ac c ounts exhibited by him. He exhibited the report for a c ompany c alled [Z] Company, but that is not one of the c ompanies relevant to this dispute. He referred on oc c asion to a desire to save c osts, but it still behoved him to adduc e evidenc e as the possible value of these interests. In the c irc umstanc es therefore, I c an only find that his failure to adduc e the supporting evidenc e of the value of these assets goes to show that these assets are worth something and are not valueless. Unfortunately, nothing further c an be usefully said by the c ourt given the pauc ity of evidenc e: the Wife was unable to assist in asc ribing a value to these assets. 

31     The Husband failed to give proper disc losure of his interests in, the value of or pertinent details about, the Companies and the Trusts. Some of these interests are apparently being held by various persons in Singapore and New Zealand. However, there were strong indic ations that the Husband still has a benefic ial interest in these c ompanies. For instanc e, in relation to [Q] Company and [R] Company, the owner, [AA], appears to hold property on trust for the Husband. As for [S] Company, this is, ac c ording to evidenc e from the Wife, owned by [T] Company, whic h in turn is owned by the Husband only. The Husband did not deny this. 

32     Given this, the Husband should have given further information on his holdings, c harting them c learly, disc losing his ultimate interest and ownership, and given c lear evidenc e of the financ ial position, assets owned, and worth of the various c ompanies. Furthermore, while the Husband c ontended that some of these c ompanies, for instanc e, [Q] Company, are not worth anything, this is not suffic ient. Again, he should have provided some information about the details of these c ompanies so that a proper assessment c ould be made. Given his failure to do so, the finding must be that there is thus probably some value in at least some of these c ompanies and trust interests. 

(5) Properties 

33     As for the properties, partic ularly the New Zealand properties, the Husband gave inc omplete evidenc e of their value and ownership. He maintained that the properties are owned by others, or jointly owned with others, without giving muc h evidenc e of these interests beyond his assertions and without quantifying through doc umentary evidenc e the value of the shares or interests that he did admit owning. 

34     Two of the New Zealand properties have had their values asc ribed by the Husband: [C] Property, Auc kland (“the Auc kland Property”) at $435,840 and [D] Property, Queenstown (“the Queenstown Property”) at $321,600. Both of these are supposed to be owned by [S] Company. As 


noted above, the Husband had not given suffic ient disc losure about the ownership of [S] Company, and that would have an impac t ultimately on the interests in these two properties. 

35     The Wife alleged insuffic ient disc losure of details surrounding the property at [E] Property, Auc kland (“the Sec ond Auc kland Property”) whic h she estimated to be worth about NZ$1,941,288. In his affidavit, the Husband c laimed that there was no value to this property, as he c laimed that it had been pledged by others. He also c laimed that c aveats were lodged that indic ated c laims by others. I find that the c laims by the Husband that the property has been pledged to third parties, and that others have lodged c aveats, c annot be ac c epted without a full pic ture being given of the relationship between those involved. I ac c ept the evidenc e of the Wife that there are suspic ious c irc umstanc es surrounding the pledge and c aveats. 

36     The Husband denied owning any interest in the other property in China, being [AB] Apartment (“the Sec ond Chongqing Apartment”), as alleged by the Wife. There was a dispute about the use of funds to pay for that property, and whether the Husband has an interest in it. The Wife c ontended that he had bought an interest in it. I do not find in this c ase that there is suffic ient _prima facie_ evidenc e before the c ourt for a determination that this property is owned by the Husband, and should be part of the pool of assets. 

_Liabilities_ 

37     There were three main c ontentions by the Husband on liabilities in respec t of the assets. The first was a supposed loan of $1.2m owing from him to his mother. The Husband’s submissions on whom the loan was made to and whom the money was from c hanged in the c ourse of the proc eedings. There was also another supposed loan of $100,000 from the Husband’s father to the Wife. Finally, there was an amount of $70,000, relating to the purc hase of the Chongqing Apartment. 

38     For all of these, my main c onc ern was to determine whether these liabilities c ould be ac c epted as true. The purpose and use of these supposed loans were not c lear and were not established on the fac ts. 

39     There were a number of other liabilities c laimed by either side: these were either of a smaller amount, or I am not persuaded that they should be fac tored in determining the net asset value, as they may have been inc urred for general expenses. An exc eption would be the Wife’s liability of $250,000 in the form of an overdraft as this would reduc e the balanc e in her bank ac c ount ac c ordingly. 

(1) The $70, 

40     The $70,000 amount was supposedly taken from an overdraft ac c ount by the Husband help pay for the Sec ond Chongqing Apartment. There was some issue about what this was used for. The Wife pointed to what she c ontended was evidenc e of the use of the $70,000; the Husband responded that these were instanc es of double-c ounting by the Wife. I c annot find based on the evidenc e before me that there was any purc hase of the Sec ond Chongqing Apartment. In the c irc umstanc es, the use of the $70,000 c annot be asc ertained as well, and I c annot find that this is a liability that exists and should be taken into ac c ount in the determination of the net matrimonial assets. 

(2) The $1.2m loan 

41     The Husband c ontended that the $1.2m loan to him from his mother to him should be taken into ac c ount. However, as noted by the Wife, the evidenc e about this loan is suspec t. In his first 


affidavit, the Husband relied on an ac knowledgement of debt signed by him, dated 6 April 2009. There was little detail given in this ac knowledgement of debt, and the fac t that it was signed by him alone means it c annot be taken at fac e value. Then, the Husband c ontended that the loan was instead from his father. Finally, he reverted to the version that this was owed by him to his mother. There were also signific ant differenc es as to whether the loan was to him alone or to the c ouple. Given these inc onsistenc ies, I ac c ept the Wife’s c ontention that there was a signific ant amount of inc onsistenc y regarding this supposed loan of $1.2m. I therefore exc lude this amount from c onsideration. 

(3) The $100,000 loan 

42     There was also a supposed loan of $100,000 given by the Husband’s father to the Wife. The Wife denied this. Though the father has provided an affidavit in support, as noted by the Wife, there was nothing given as to repayment. The Wife maintained that this was a gift. In the c irc umstanc es, given the absenc e of any indic ation of repayment terms, I ac c ept the Wife’s c ontention that this is to be c onstrued as a gift and not a loan. This sum was apparently used to provide for the maintenanc e of the Wife and c hildren, and was not used in ac quiring any asset. 

_Conclusion as to the pool of assets_ 

43     From the above, the matrimonial assets c omprise the following: 

 (a) the matrimonial property at $1.7m (with about $288,958.73 in mortgage payments due); 

 (b) a half-share of the Sec ond Apartment (valued at about $789,516.63) 

 (c ) the Chongqing Apartment (valued at $300,000); 

 (d) the Wife’s CPF of about $70,339.16; 

 (e) the Husband’s CPF of about $72,465.58; 

 (f) the Wife’s insuranc e polic ies of a total of about $120,850.61; 

 (g) the Husband’s insuranc e polic ies of (leaving aside surrendered amounts, and educ ational insuranc e polic ies) approximately $35,294.55; 

 (h) the Wife’s bank ac c ounts (with a $250,000 overdraft in one ac c ount); 

 (i) the Husband’s bank ac c ounts (with a value of $16,931.06, although this is inc omplete as ac c ounts are not known (see above at [24]); 

 (j) the Husband’s CPF investments (valued at $44,000); 

 (k) the Husband’ shares in [Y] Company (valued at $105,270) (here, the shares in [I] Company are exc luded. It is also not known whether the Husband has shares in other c ompanies); 

 (l) various c ompany, trust c ompany holdings or trust holdings (values of whic h are unknown); 

 (m) the Auc kland Property (valued at about $435,840); 

 (n) the Queenstown Property (valued at about $321,600); and 


 (o) the Sec ond Auc kland Property (valued at about $1,863,636.48, though ownership of this property is unc ertain). 

 Of the c lear assets with known values, namely (a), (b), (c ), (d), (e), (f ), (g) and (j), there is a total value of $2,970,248. If the other assets (inc luding (o)) are fac tored in with asc ribable values, there is a total value of $5,696,595 or more. I note that the Wife had submitted that there was a total of about $4,436,681.53 worth of matrimonial assets, whic h was a result of the Wife leaving out some values. The range of figures from $2.9m to $5.6m or more indic ates the diffic ulties of this c ase. 

**_Contributions by the parties_** 

44     The next stage of the analysis is the determination of the parties’ c ontributions. This will be c onsidered in three parts: direc t c ontributions to spec ific assets, indirec t financ ial c ontributions, and indirec t c ontributions of other kinds. In weighing the c ontributions, I am mindful of the guidanc e of the Court of Appeal in _BCB_ , that there should not be a sterile foc us on financ ial c ontributions, neglec ting the overall approac h envisaged under the Women’s Charter. 

_Contributions to specific assets_ 

45     Direc t c ontributions c an only be asc ertained with respec t to c ertain assets, namely, the Matrimonial Home, the Sec ond Apartment and the property in Chongqing. 

(1) The Matrimonial Home 

46     In respec t of the Matrimonial Home, there is a question of how the proc eeds from the previous matrimonial home should be alloc ated. The parties had used the sale proc eeds of two units at Normanton Park (“the Normanton Properties”) to fund the purc hase of the Matrimonial Home. The Wife c ontended that the net sales proc eed from the previous units should be asc ribed to both of them equally, as the Normanton Properties were purc hased by gifts made by the Husband's family to both the parties. On this basis, the Wife c laimed, taking into ac c ount her slightly larger CPF c ontributions, a proportion of 50.7% to her and 49.3% to the Husband. 

47     The Husband in oral arguments argued that the Normanton Properties c ould not have been in joint names as the Normanton Properties belonged to the Singapore Armed Forc es (“SAF”). The Husband further c laimed that the purc hase of the Matrimonial Home was possible bec ause of an earlier gift made by his parents, whic h allowed the purc hase of an apartment at Normanton Park, whic h c ould only have been transferred to his name then, as he was in military servic e then. There was no evidenc e before the c ourt on the restric tions that might have been applic able to the Normanton Properties when the c ouple first purc hased a property then. As it is however, even if there was a gift by the parents of the Husband, and even if the Normanton Properties were only in the name of the Husband, in the absenc e of any evidenc e to the c ontrary, I find that the gift was to the c ouple, and that any proc eeds from the sale of the Normanton Properties used in the purc hase of other property c annot then be simply be attributed to the Husband alone. In any event, the division will be c onduc ted on a broad-brush approac h, taking into ac c ount non-financ ial c ontributions as well. In the c irc umstanc es therefore, I am of the view that I should proc eed on an equal alloc ation between the parties, and that the quantific ation for the Wife is broadly ac c urate. 

(2) The Sec ond Apartment 


 (a) 

 (b) 

 (c ) 

 (d) 

 (e) 

48     In respec t of The Sec ond Apartment, the Husband c laimed he had to c ontribute $300,000 to bail out his in-laws, the Wife’s parents. The Wife in turn said her Husband forc ed the $300, overdraft on her parents, at an undervalue. I am of the view that the proposition that the $300, was a bailout of the in-laws was against the inherent probabilities of the situation. If indeed suc h a bailout was nec essary, it is odd that there was no indic ation of any negotiation about the value of the property and how muc h would be sec ured against the value of the interest in the Sec ond Apartment. Nor was there any evidenc e, as submitted by the Wife, of any payment by the Husband into the overdraft. The property was transferred only to the Wife and not to the both the Wife and the Husband. In the c irc umstanc es, I find no direc t c ontribution by the Husband to this property. 

_The Chongqing property_ 

49     In respec t of the Chongqing Apartment, the evidenc e was c lear that the c ontribution has c ome primarily from the Wife. 

_Various indirect financial contributions_ 

50     The Husband c laimed a number of indirec t financ ial c ontributions, aside from those c onsidered above: 

 a $100,000 wedding gift from the Husband’s grandfather; 

 a gift of $20,000 for eac h of the c hildren from the Husband’s grandfather; 

 a $100,000 gift from the Husband’s grandfather in 1995; 

 a $200,000 gift from the Husband's father; and 

 a NZ$457,000 gift from the Husband’s father to him. 

51     I ac c ept the arguments of the Wife that there was little evidenc e of these, and that in any event, even if proven, the presumption would be that any gift is to the Husband would be a gift to the parties equally: _ANZ v AOA_ <span class="citation">[2014] SGHC 243</span> at [14]. As for the gift to the c hildren, this would not be matrimonial property, even if I ac c epted that the gift was made. 

_Non-financial contributions_ 

52     The non-financ ial c ontributions were made over a period of 19 years or so, from the marriage in 1992 until these proc eedings were c ommenc ed in 2011. The Husband c ontended that the Wife did not really provide for the family. He c ontended that he was a full-time father, while the Wife was at work. The Wife for her part c ontended that she worked at the various enterprises at the behest of the Husband. Some of these, espec ially those in the MiddleEast, required her to sac rific e time with the family. Her evidenc e was that she had been in various businesses over the years, starting with pharmac eutic als, then in educ ation, aluminium parts for c onstruc tion, solar energy, and a spa 


business. There was little quantific ation of the amount that she c ontributed through her efforts in this regard. But in any event, the foc us here is not on the financ ial c ontributions that she might have gleaned from these efforts, but that these were c ontributions to the life of the family. The Wife c ontended that even when she was working overseas, she would travel bac k to Singapore, c ommunic ate with the c hildren, and spend time with the c hildren on important oc c asions. She c laimed to have guided them in various ac tivities and in sc hool. 

53     The Husband appeared to have had more time with the c hildren of the marriage during the years when the Wife was away working overseas. However, I do not find that this was ultimately that substantial when weighed against the fac t that her time abroad was primarily for work for the benefit of the family, and as she has deposed, at the behest of the Husband. 

54     While it may be that she did make an effort to spend time with the c hildren, I c ould not find that this meant that she had the more dominant role in looking after the c hildren throughout the marriage. There were times when her c ontac t with the c hildren would have been muc h less. That said though, given that it was her work that took her away from more time with the c hildren, I find that her c ontributions to the family life were signific ant and outweighed that of the Husband. 

55     I am satisfied that overall, the Wife gave more over the 19 years of the marriage than the Husband did. She looked after the c hildren direc tly exc ept for the years when she was abroad. Even at suc h times, she was involved in pursuing work for the benefit of the family, even if there might have been little lasting direc t c ontribution to the financ ial assets of the family. In c omparison, while the Husband c laimed that he looked after the c hildren at various times, his c ontribution was as a whole to my mind less signific ant than that of the Wife’s, espec ially when her c ontributions abroad are c onsidered. As for the c ontributions of the parents of the parties, I am of the view that these were not material in the c ontext of weighing the c ontributions of the parties themselves. 

**_Adverse inference for failure to disclose assets and value of assets_** 

56     As noted above, the Wife pointed to non-disc losure by the Husband as to his inc ome, the trusts, the shares in [Y] Company, c lub memberships, a yac ht, rac e horses, interests in the Companies and the Trusts. The Husband’s primary c ontention was that these assets are of little or no value, or where there is value, that he does not own the whole of the interest. The Husband argued that the Wife was fully aware of a number of matters. The Wife however denied this. For instanc e she denied signing doc uments relating to the trusts. The Husband further c ontended that he does not have fully ownership of these assets – his assertion was that these are in the hands of others. 

57     As seen in the disc ussion, the Husband’s position makes it diffic ult to assign a value to the matrimonial property in his hands. It may be that some of these assets are of little or no value, but it is diffic ult to reac h this c onc lusion on the sc ant evidenc e before the c ourt. The lac k of evidenc e about valuation also makes it diffic ult to determine the distribution of assets between the Husband and Wife, as the pool, the value of the assets, and financ ial c ontributions of the parties are largely unknown. Fac ed with this absenc e of evidenc e, I c an only proc eed on the basis of what was put before me. 

58     It would have been ideal if further information was gleaned about these assets, however that would likely have taken muc h more time and expense. The effort would c ertainly have prolonged these proc eedings. On what was before me I was doubtful that muc h would be gained from further inquiry. Additionally, the Wife was also c ontent to press her c laim primarily in respec t of the known assets. 

59     I ac c ept the submissions of the Wife that the division of assets should proc eed on the basis of 


a presumption against the Husband of both the sc ope of the matrimonial pool and its value. In _Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah_ <span class="citation">[2007] SGCA 21</span>, the Court of Appeal noted (at [27]) that for an adverse inferenc e to be drawn, there should be: 

 (a) a substratum of evidenc e that establishes a prima facie c ase against the other party; and 

 (b) that person must have had some partic ular ac c ess to the information he is said to be hiding. 

In the present c ase, I am satisfied that the Wife has raised a _prima facie_ c ase by pointing out areas in whic h the Husband has not given full evidenc e. The various interests in the Companies and the Trusts, and other properties, as pointed out by the Wife, c alled for an explanation from the Husband as to the nature, extent and value of his interests in these assets so that it c an be assessed whether they should be part of the pool available for division, and how these assets should be divided. Contrary to the arguments of the Husband that they are just as known to the Wife, I find, from what has been adduc ed by the Wife, that information about these assets is in the hands of the Husband, as is evident by the bits of information he has released at various points. His exc use that he did not want to prolong proc eedings is not a justific ation or a reason for not providing the information sought. Even the information that he gave was often vague, as c an be seen in his explanation with respec t to the c irc umstanc es of the sale of the [I] Company shares (see [24] above). Furthermore, on a number of oc c asions, when pressed, the Husband was able to give more extensive evidenc e about the questionable assets – for instanc e, he exhibited a valuation of the Auc kland Property, though as noted above, there remained the issue of what his ownership rights are through the c ompany that is listed as owning it. 

60     The effec t of all these is that an adverse inferenc e may be drawn against the Husband that: 

 (a) the questionable assets are of some value. 

 (b) where he disc laimed or downplayed his ownership rights, these are likely to be more extensive that what he owned up to; and 

 (c ) there may be other assets that have not been disc losed. 

61     In prac tic al terms, the c onsequenc e that follows is that the c ourt may give a higher proportion of known assets where full disc losure has not been given. A broad-brush approac h giving an additional uplift to represent the undisc losed assets is permissible: _Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2011] 2 SLR 1157</span> at [66]. That c ase however also rec ognised that a higher proportion of the known assets may be given to c ompensate for the failure to disc lose. This was done in _NK v NL_. 

62     In the present c ase, given the unc ertainties, I am of the view that the more appropriate solution would be to provide the Wife a higher proportion of the known assets. As will be seen subsequently, this results in the Wife having the whole of the asc ertained assets, whic h are primarily the assets in her hands. Though depending on the unknown true value of some of the asset this may ultimately award her more than 42% stric tly speaking, I am satisfied that the approac h adopted is sound given the state of the evidenc e before me. 

63     In passing, I should note that the Wife had not given a value for a business c laimed by her, [F] Company. I do not find that there has been any failure on her part to provide information as to this as this asset is not c urrently owned by her. In any event, the Husband did not c ontest this asset. 


**_Conclusion as to the division of matrimonial assets_** 

_Assets that were claimed by the wife_ 

64     As noted above, the Wife made a c laim on the following assets, asking that they be transferred to her: 

 (a) the whole of the Matrimonial Home (valued at $1,411,041.27); 

 (b) the half-share in the Sec ond Apartment (the other half share belonging to the Plaintiff’s mother) (valued at $789,516.63); 

 (c ) the Chongqing Apartment (valued at $300,000); 

 (d) the insuranc e polic ies and other assets totalling $44,379.77; and 

 (e) [F] Company (for whic h no value was attac hed). 

65     Had I before me all relevant evidenc e about the assets, and if I c ould have c onc luded with c onfidenc e about both the extent of the pool of matrimonial assets as well as the c ontributions given, I would probably have leaned towards a split of the assets, 60% in favour of the Wife and 40% in favour of the Husband, taking into ac c ount the indirec t financ ial and non-monetary c ontributions of the parties. In the present c ase however, while I have no doubt that the Husband was a busy entrepreneur at various points in the marriage, I ac c ept the evidenc e of the Wife that she spent a c onsiderable amount of effort in all the joint business enterprises, and that this did not signific antly detrac t from her non-financ ial c ontributions to the family. I find on the evidenc e before me that the Wife c ontributed more to the life of the family than the Husband did, though perhaps not overwhelmingly so. 

66     As it was however, in light of the lac k of information about the assets, an order giving 60% or so would not be prac tic al. The Wife was also c ontent to press her c ase only in respec t of the asc ertained assets, whic h by her c alc ulations and estimation of the value of the pool, would give her about 42%. I therefore ac c ordingly award her the assets she sought. 

67     On the basis of the c alc ulation of assets I derived above, inc luding those with inc omplete information (see [44] above), she would then have about 44% of the assets. I am satisfied that this represents a just and equitable division and alloc ation in the c irc umstanc es of this c ase. 

68     I should mention that if I only took into ac c ount the asc ertainable assets, her share would be a very high 85%. However, that would not be an ac c urate reflec tion of her ac tual share; suc h a c alc ulation of the total matrimonial assets would have left out questionable assets for whic h the Husband bore responsibility to disc lose. Furthermore, most of the asc ertainable assets were those disc losed by the Wife, made up largely of the real property in her hands. 

_Allocation to the Husband_ 

69     This approac h does mean that the Husband is left with primarily with the unknown assets, namely the Companies, the Trusts and the properties in New Zealand. This is not unfair to the Husband as these assets are not worthless – there is some value, but it is not possible for the c ourt to determine c onc lusively what their value is. 


**Maintenance of the Wife** 

70     The Wife c laimed maintenanc e of $1,000 per month, for eight years, giving a total of $96,000. The basis of this was a disc ount on the usual formula applied in c ases suc h as _Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee and another appeal and another matter_ <span class="citation">[2012] 4 SLR 405</span>. It was c ontended that the Husband has the means to support the Wife, whose inc ome is relatively low, with proc eeds of about $3,000 from the rental of the matrimonial home, and about $7,500 per month from her work in China. She also has a very small amount c oming in as royalties. Though there was no direc t evidenc e of the Husband’s means, the Wife argued that the c ourt should infer that he has a substantial inc ome, given his interests in the United States, New Zealand, and his various business ac tivities. 

71     The Husband c ontended that no maintenanc e should be given to the Wife. He also stated that she should be satisfied with his offer that she keeps [F] Company. 

72     I find that the means of the Husband are unc lear. As noted above, there was little disc losed. However, nothing would be gained from awarding the Wife maintenanc e through a further interest in the matrimonial assets. As noted above, the distribution of property, effec tively giving the Wife all the assets whose value is c ertain, has already attributed to her more than 40% on a best estimate of the overall value of the matrimonial assets, and a signific antly higher proportion of the asc ertainable assets. There is no room there to give her any meaningful figure to reflec t lump sum maintenanc e. 

73     While there was little evidenc e from the Husband, and an adverse inferenc e should be drawn against him, I am also mindful of the need to ensure that any maintenanc e order is not disproportionate to his means, unc ertain and unknown as they are. In the c irc umstanc es, given the sorry state of evidenc e before me, and in light of the other orders I make, inc luding the asset distribution and the maintenanc e for the c hildren, I do not think it is appropriate for me to order at this time more than a nominal figure of $100 per month. 

**Maintenance of the three children** 

74     There are three c hildren to the marriage: the daughter, and two sons. Of the sons, one is c urrently studying in a polytec hnic and the other would have just finished sec ondary sc hool. The Wife sought a total maintenanc e of $7,050 for the three of them, representing about half of the $14,133.14 whic h she estimated as being their total expenses. She would bear the other half. 

75     The Husband on the other hand, proposed that he would maintain the daughter, while the Wife would maintain the sons. The tertiary educ ation of the c hildren would be borne on an equal basis after using a supposed $100,000 given to the Wife by the Husband's father. The $100,000 has been dealt with above (see [42]). In brief, I do not ac c ept that this gift was made in the c irc umstanc es desc ribed by the Husband. Furthermore, the Husband’s proposal is not c onsonant with the obligations of parents. 

76     The fac tors whic h a c ourt should take into ac c ount when ordering maintenanc e are defined in s 69(4) of the Women’s Charter. That provision stipulates that maintenanc e ordered for a c hild should take into ac c ount, _inter alia_ , the financ ial needs of the c hild, any inc ome or financ ial resourc es of the c hild, the age of the parties and the duration of the marriage, the standard of living enjoyed by the c hild before any maintenanc e was neglec ted, the manner in whic h the c hild is expec ted to be educ ated, and the c onduc t of the parties to the marriage. As noted by Professor Leong Wai Kum, in _Elements of Family Law_ (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013), while the Women’s Charter does not spec ify the objec tives of maintenanc e, it is likely that the most signific ant fac tors are the financ ial needs of the c hild and the ability of the parent in question to meet those needs. In the present c ase, therefore, 


the objec tive of this part of the dec ision is to asc ertain the maintenanc e needs of eac h c hild, c onsider the respec tive abilities of eac h parent to provide for the c hildren, and make orders effec ting the appropriate level of maintenanc e in a way that is fair and just between the parties. In doing so, the c ourt should generally, in my view, lean towards eac h parent providing at least part maintenanc e for eac h c hild of the marriage; that is, the c ourt should not normally order against a parent maintenanc e for only one out of several c hildren, splitting as it were the maintenanc e obligations between the parents by referenc e to the needs of spec ific c hildren. 

77     The daughter was 21 years old at the time of the hearing, and will turn 22 this year. Maintenanc e of c hildren generally ends at 21, save where s 69(5) of the Women’s Charter is applic able. Under s 69(5)( _c_ ) of the Women’s Charter, an order may be made in favour of a c hild beyond 21 years if the maintenanc e is nec essary bec ause the c hild will be rec eiving instruc tion at an educ ational establishment or undergoing training for a profession. In the daughter’s c ase, she is pursuing a legal studies c ourse, with a view to possibly reading law later. Suc h studies qualifies as “instruc tion” under s 69(5)( _c_ ). 

78     The Wife has adduc ed evidenc e of the living needs of the c hildren, whic h works out to $5,326.38 for the daughter, $4,273.88 for the middle c hild, and $4,532,88 for the youngest c hild. The total is c alc ulated to be about $14,133.14 per month, of whic h the Wife asked that the Husband should bear about half, or $7,050 or so. The Wife further sought that the Husband should pay for the tertiary educ ation of the younger c hildren. 

79     In c oming to my dec ision, I note that there is no evidenc e other than that of the Wife before me as to the c hildren’s expenses. As for the relative means, there is little direc t evidenc e of the Husband’s means at present. However, for the reasons I have stated above, I am satisfied that he has assets whic h should be worth a suffic ient sum, and that the resourc es are greater than those of the Wife. At $7,050 per month, his yearly exposure from maintenanc e of his c hildren will not be more than $84,600. I am satisfied that this sum c an be met by him, from the evidenc e before me. Similarly as for the educ ation of the c hildren, I note that based on that division of property, he again probably has the better means overall to pay for their educ ation, and ac c ordingly so order him to bear the c osts of their tertiary studies, inc luding spec ific ally the daughter’s further tertiary educ ation, if she pursues her degree. 

**Other orders** 

1       A c onsequential order that needs to be made is the removal of the c aveat in respec t of the Matrimonial Home, whic h I have ordered alloc ated to the Wife. I should note in passing that an issue between the parties c onc erning the Singapore Swimming Club membership has been resolved. 

2       As to c osts, the Wife has asked for c osts for both the divorc e and the anc illaries. I make no order for c osts for the divorc e. I will hear parties on the c osts to be awarded for the anc illaries.
