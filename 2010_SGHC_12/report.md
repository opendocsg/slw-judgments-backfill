**Philip Pillai JC:** 

**Background** 

1       This is a summons filed by the Plaintiffs, having obtained leave of the Honourable Justic e Judith Prakash on 17 November 2009, for a c ommittal of the first and sec ond Defendants, Ho Chin Nguang and Ng Sow Moi, for their c ontempt of the orders of this Honourable Court dated 7 April 2009 and 31 July 2009 (the “Order”), by failing to inform the Plaintiffs’ solic itors in writing, within the requisite time limit or at all of: 

 (a) the value and details of all their assets whether in or outside Singapore by way of an affidavit, whic h was to have been served on the Plaintiffs’ solic itors within seven (7) days after the respec tive Orders had been served on the First and Sec ond Defendants; and 

 (b) the sourc e of the money used before spending the same in the amount spec ific ally limited by this Honourable Court for their expenditure on ordinary living and legal expenses. 

2       The interim Mareva injunc tion was granted on 7 April 2009 against all three Defendants. It was replac ed by a final Mareva injunc tion granted on 31 July 2009 against only the first and sec ond Defendants.

 THIRD PARTIES

**The law on Mareva injunctions and committal proceedings** 


4       The relevant c onsiderations in relation to this applic ation for c ommittal are the first princ iples of Mareva injunc tions and the sc ope and purpose of the exc eptions c ontained in suc h injunc tions. In _Polly Peck International plc v Nadir_ ( _No 2_ ) [1992] 4 All ER 769 (“ _Polly Peck_ ( _No 2_ )”), Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR stated (at 785): 

 So far as it lies in their power, the c ourts will not permit the c ourse of justic e to be frustrated by a defendant taking ac tion, the purpose of whic h is to render nugatory or less effec tive any judgment or order whic h the plaintiff may thereafter obtain. ... It is not the purpose of a Mareva injunc tion to prevent a defendant ac ting as he would have ac ted in the absenc e of a c laim against him. Whilst a defendant who is a natural person c an and should be enjoined from indulging in a spending spree undertaken with the intention of dissipating or reduc ing his assets before the day of judgment, he c annot be required to reduc e his ordinary standard of living with a view to putting by sums to satisfy a judgment whic h may or may not be given in the future. Equally no defendant, whether a natural or juridic al person, c an be enjoined in terms whic h will prevent him from c arrying on his business in the ordinary way or from meeting his debts or other obligations as they c ome due prior to judgment being given in the ac tion. 

5       The relevant c onsiderations relating to c ommittal proc eedings bear restatement. J Pinsler, _Singapore Court Practice 2009_ (LexisNexis, 2009) states at para 52/1/2 and para 52/2/1: 

 As a general princ iple, the judgment c reditor is expec ted to use alternative enforc ement methods before c ontemplating c ommittal. Even if those methods have been engaged without suc c ess, the c ourt will not c ommit the judgment debtor unless there is c redible evidenc e that the debtor’s non-c omplianc e was wilful in the sense that he refused or neglec ted to pay in spite of his ability to do so ( Khoo Wai Leong, Ronnie v Andrew J Hanam [2003] SGMC 41, para 35;) ... 

 The other purpose of the order is to punish the offender for his c ontempt ( Re Barrell Enterprises [1973] 1 WLR 19). ... 

 Committal to prison is normally a measure of last resort. Other options are available to the c ourt, and often the exerc ise of its disc retion will be based on the attitude of the offender. If he is apologetic and promises to c omply with the c ourt order (or if he has already c omplied with it sinc e the servic e on him of the notion of motion for c ommittal), the c ourt may merely reprimand him in strong terms. If he has yet to c omply with the order, the c ourt may warn him that unless he does so he will be imprisoned. 

 In Syarikat M Mohamed v Mahindapal Singh [1991] 2 MLJ 112 at 114, K C Vohrah J stated that: ‘... sinc e c ommittal proc eedings are quasi-c riminal proc eedings and the liberty of the subjec t is involved, the proc edural rules applic able must be stric tly enforc ed.’ The point is that the person against whom the c ommittal proc eedings are brought, ‘needs to know with partic ularity what c harge or c harges they are fac ed with, c harges whic h c an land them in prison.’ The learned judge ruled that as it is the spec ific purpose of the statement to inc lude these grounds, any omission to do so c annot be made good by setting them out in the affidavit, the purpose of whic h is to merely verify the statement. ... (See Cartier International BV v Lee Hock Lee <span class="citation">[1993] 1 SLR 616</span>.) 

6       In _P J Holdings Inc v Ariel Singapore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2009] 3 SLR 582</span> at [7], Choo Han Tec k J stated: 

 Order 45 r 5 (1)(a) applies only when “a person required by a judgment or order to do an ac t within a time spec ified in the judgment or order refuses or neglects to do it.” ... In Re Quintin Dick [1926] Ch 992, Romer J held that the term “refuse or neglec t” was not equivalent to “fail or 


 omit”, and that the former implied a c onsc ious ac t of volition whereas the latter did not. In Ng Tai Tuan v Chng Gim Huat Pte Ltd [1990] SLR 903, Chao Hic k Tin JC (as he then was) expressed the view that the word “neglec t” nec essarily implies some element of fault. He c ited the c ase of Re London & Paris Banking Corp (1874) 19 Eq 444 where Jessel MR said, at p 446: 

 ... the word ‘neglec ted’ is not nec essarily equivalent to the word ‘omitted’. Negligenc e is a term whic h is well known in law. Negligenc e in paying a debt on demand, as I understand, is omitting to pay without reasonable exc use. Mere omission by itself does not amount to negligenc e. 

 The word “refuse” has also been similarly defined. In DP Vijandran v Majlis Peguam [1995] 2 MLJ 391, the c ourt noted that “[t]he ordinary meaning of the word refuse is to dec line to give”, and that “failure is not synonymous with refusal.” Similar sentiments were also expressed by the tribunal in Lowson v Percy Main & District Social Club [1979] ICR 568. I agree with the foregoing c ases. ... 

**First alleged breach of this Mareva Injunction** 

7       The Plaintiffs c laim in their applic ation that: 

1\. The lst and 2 nd Defendants ... by failing to inform the Plaintiffs' solic itors in writing, within the requisite time limit or at all: 

 (1) of the value and details of all their assets whether in or outside Singapore by way of an affidavit whic h was to have been served on the Plaintiffs' solic itors within seven (7) days after the respec tive Orders had been served on the lst and 2 nd Defendants; ... 

The substanc e of the failure c omplained of relates to the expenditure from undec lared sourc e(s) of funds. The undec lared sourc e(s) of fund, it is c laimed is evidenc ed by a number of events inc luding the minimal withdrawals from their disc losed bank ac c ounts from 4 May to 9 September 2009, their solic itor’s requesting an inc rease in c ombined limit of S$6,000 for ordinary living expenses and the subsequent deposit of S$67,097 into their disc losed POSB bank ac c ount. 

8       The first Defendant admits in his affidavit that between June and November 2009 he spent about S$16,115.27 to S$19,615.27 a month. However, he also explained in his affidavit that he had subsequently rec eived IDR 134,819,900 by way of a monthly c ash allowanc e from PT Mega Fortune for his role as an advisor and Vic e Chairman. 

9       As the Defendants’ disc losed assets are insuffic ient to c over the Plaintiffs’ c laim, the Plaintiffs c ounter-argued that the Order extends to assets to be ac quired in the future. 

10     Clause 2 of this Mareva injunc tion by its own terms requires a one-off disc losure by an affidavit a list of assets and this has been done. By its express terms it does not stand as a primary or a c ontinuing order to regularly update after ac quired assets. In any event, the subsequent rec eipt of monthly allowanc e in c ash after the due submission of the affidavit of assets as required by the Mareva injunc tion, does not by its very nature c onstitute an undisc losed asset that was required to be disc losed by the terms of this Mareva injunc tion, in partic ular Clause 2. 

11     I am of the view that Clause 1(4) of this Mareva injunc tion by its terms operates only to restric t the disposal or dealing of disc losed assets. It c ontemplates a diminution of the disc losed assets. Even if a liberal c onstruc tion of this Mareva injunc tion were warranted, suc h that there is 


c onstrued to be a c ontinuing obligation to update and disc lose after ac quired assets, this monthly c ash allowanc e does not by its nature c onstitute an asset. I therefore find that there was no breac h arising from suc h rec eipt of a monthly allowanc e. 

**Second alleged breach of this Mareva Injunction** 

12     The Plaintiffs further c laim that the first and sec ond Defendants had failed to provide the Plaintiffs’ solic itors with the value and details of the assets c omprising of their disc losed shareholdings in a number of private c ompanies. 

13     It was c onc eded that the Defendants had provided the latest available financ ial statements relating to the Singapore, BVI, Indonesian and Chinese private and unlisted c ompanies in whic h they have an interest and whic h were already disc losed in the affidavit of assets. The Plaintiffs submit that this was not suffic ient c omplianc e as the Defendants are, additionally, obliged to provide either their own estimate of the value or an independent valuation of the same. 

14     Bearing in mind that the shares are of private c ompanies in multiple jurisdic tions, no additional c ommerc ial purpose c an be served by requiring the Defendants to provide their estimate of the value when the Plaintiffs have been given the relevant financ ial statements and were able to arrive at their own c onc lusion as to the valuation of those assets. To require the Defendants to take the further step of proc uring independent valuations of unlisted c ompanies would be unduly onerous c onsidering the interloc utory nature and the purpose of granting a Mareva injunc tion. I ac c ordingly find no breac h as c laimed by the Plaintiffs. 

**Third alleged breach of this Mareva Injunction** 

15     The Plaintiffs’ applic ation further c laims that the Defendants have failed to inform the Plaintiffs’ solic itors in writing, within the requisite time limit or at all of the sourc e of the money used before spending the same in the amount spec ific ally limited by this Honourable Court for their expenditure on ordinary living and legal expenses _to wit_ that they have breac hed the spending limits by reason of their admitted monthly expenditure of S$16,115.27 to S$19,615.27. 

16     As the first Defendant had already explained in his affidavit, these amounts were monthly c ash allowanc es rec eived subsequently to the filing of his affidavit of assets due to his role as advisor and Vic e Chairman of P Y Mega Fortune. Given that his interest in P Y Mega Fortune has been duly disc losed in his affidavit of assets, and also he has not drawn on or dissipated the bank ac c ounts and assets disc losed in his affidavit of assets, it would be a stretc h to c onc lude that he is to be subjec t t o c ommittal proc eedings by virtue of rec eiving subsequent advanc es or gifts whic h, I have already determined, do not c onstitute assets for the purposes of this Mareva injunc tion. 

17     As I do not find there to have been a c ontumelious breac h of the Orders in the c irc umstanc es, the applic ation is denied. 

18     No order as to c osts.
