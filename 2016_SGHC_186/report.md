**Introduction** 

1       Suit 141 of 2012 (“S 141/2012”) arose out of a family dispute between siblings in relation to their late father’s assets in Singapore and India. The Defendant and the sec ond Plaintiff were the siblings based in Singapore, while the first, third and fourth Plaintiffs were based overseas in India and Canada. The Plaintiffs c ommenc ed a c laim for a total sum of S$1.05m owed by the Defendant to the Plaintiffs pursuant to a c ompromise agreement made in Dec ember 2010. The Plaintiffs also c laimed that the Defendant was ac ting as trustee de son tort, and in the alternative, as a c onstruc tive trustee for their late father’s estate in Singapore, and had breac hed fiduc iary duties. They thus sought an ac c ount of the profits obtained or rec eived by the Defendant as a result of his breac hes. The Defendant c ounterc laimed for his share as a benefic iary of both his late father and mother’s estates from the Plaintiffs, who he alleged were ac ting as c onstruc tive trustees of the estates, as 

well as for properties in the Plaintiffs’ names in India. [note: 1] S 141/2012 had to be seen as part of a greater dispute involving the estates of the parties’ parents, who both died intestate. 

2       I allowed the Plaintiffs’ c laim and the Defendant’s c ounterc laim in part and issued an oral judgment on 26 May 2016. Dissatisfied with my dec ision, the Defendant has sinc e filed a notic e of appeal (in Civil Appeal No 80 of 2016) against my dec ision, and I thus set out my fuller grounds of dec ision. 

**Factual background** 

3       The late KR Lakshmanan Pillai (“KRLP”), the father of the Plaintiffs and the Defendant, allegedly owned a one-ninth share of the property at 58A Upper Weld Road, Singapore (“the Property”) and 

wholly owned a moneylending business that he had inherited from his late father in the 1980s [note: 2] 


(“the Moneylending Business”) that had operated from the Property. These two interests were the key items in dispute. It was c ommon ground that the Moneylending Business was owned by KRLP, but the Defendant disputed that KRLP owned the one-ninth share of the Property. 

4       M Shanmugam, KRLP’s brother-in-law, managed the Moneylending Business from the 1980s till 1993; during this time the profits from the business were split 35-65 in KRLP’s favour. KRLP’s share of profits would mostly be ploughed bac k into the business, with some remitted bac k to India for 

purc hase of properties. [note: 3] Thereafter the Defendant, being based in Singapore, took over the management of the Moneylending Business from M Shanmugam, with the same profit-sharing margin of 35-65 in KRLP’s favour, until 2000 when it inc reased to a 40% share for the Defendant. The Defendant would report to KRLP regarding the monthly ac c ounts, just as M Shanmugam had done, and 

he was also paid an additional $1200 annually. KRLP died intestate on 7 February 2000 in India. [note: 4] The Defendant then c ontinued reporting to his mother, L Vallimayil (“Valli”), regarding the 

Moneylending Business, until she died intestate on 17 January 2003. [note: 5] 

5       It was undisputed that Letters of Administration had not been extrac ted whether in Singapore or in India for either of KRLP’s or Valli’s estates. It was c ommon ground that on 28 and 29 Dec ember 2010, the parties all met in their anc estral home in Southern India to agree on the valuation and distribution of their parents’ assets, in the presenc e of a relative, Muthuvadivu (“Muthu”), who took on the role of a mediator-type figure. The parties entered into a c ompromise agreement on 29 

Dec ember 2010 [note: 6] (“the Compromise Agreement”), the validity of whic h was disputed by the Defendant, where it was stated, _inter alia_ , that: 

 (a) the Defendant would bec ome the sole benefic ial owner in the Moneylending Business in exc hange for paying S$1.05m in total to the Plaintiffs, ie , $262,500 to eac h of the four Plaintiffs, in instalments c ommenc ing on 1 January 2011, to be c ompleted latest by Dec ember 2011; [note: 7] 

 (b) the Property would be sold and the one-ninth share of proc eeds less c osts of sale would be divided equally among the parties. [note: 8] 

6       It was the Plaintiffs’ position that the Compromise Agreement was a c omprehensive division of 

KRLP’s assets in both India and Singapore. [note: 9] There was a division of assets inc luding the land, 

jewellery and utensils, and the Defendant had taken possession of his share. [note: 10] The Defendant admitted that he had gotten his share of the jewellery and utensils, but denied that an agreement was reac hed as to the other assets suc h as land, and thus c ounterc laimed for his remaining share of 

his parents’ respec tive estates derived from the other assets. [note: 11] The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant failed to make the payment of S$1.05m to them, and also failed to give them their share of the one-ninth of sale proc eeds of the Property after selling it. This was the basis upon whic h they had c ommenc ed S 141/2012. 

7       The Defendant attempted to argue belatedly in his c losing submissions that the c ourt should dec line to exerc ise jurisdic tion over S 141/2012. The basis for doing so was three-fold. First, Indian intestac y laws (spec ific ally, Hindu suc c ession laws) should apply to the entire dispute as the Compromise Agreement also involved the settlement of properties in India and matters of distribution of intestate assets. Sec ond, based on the rule in _British South Africa Company v Companhia de Moçambique_ [1893] AC 602 (“the Moç ambique rule”), the Singapore c ourt had no jurisdic tion over 

issues of title to the foreign immovable properties. [note: 12] Third, the Defendant also appeared to 


argue that the fac t that there were on-going proc eedings between the same parties in India regarding KRLP and Valli’s estates indic ated that Singapore was not the more appropriate forum for ventilating the dispute and so the c ourt should dec line to exerc ise jurisdic tion. 

8       I was unc onvinc ed by these arguments. The Plaintiffs’ c laim in S 141/2012 did not relate to Indian properties, but rather, was spec ific to the late KRLP’s interests in Singapore. It was the Defendant’s c ounterc laim that brought in the issue of the distribution of both KRLP and Valli’s properties in India. If the Defendant c hose to bring the Indian properties into the c onsideration of S 141/2012 from the beginning, then it did not lie in his mouth to argue at the end of the hearing that the c ourt should dec line to exerc ise jurisdic tion over the matter simply bec ause it involved the Indian properties. The Defendant mentioned the nationality and domic ile of the late KRLP and Valli in the c losing submissions as support for his argument that Indian intestac y laws should apply to S 141/2012, but I was not persuaded as to how they were relevant c onnec ting fac tors to dec ide what relevant law was applic able. Even if it were true that Indian intestac y laws applied to the entire dispute, it would not be an immediate bar to this c ourt exerc ising jurisdic tion over the dispute, as this c ourt c ould apply Indian law in the resolution of S 141/2012. On a proper c harac terisation of the issues in S 141/2012, it appeared that the main issues in S 141/2012 were c ontrac tual in nature (relating to the validity, formation and interpretation of the Compromise Agreement), so the applic able test in determining the governing law for the dispute would be the three-stage test set out in _Overseas Union Insurance Ltd v Turegum Insurance Co_ <span class="citation">[2001] 2 SLR(R) 285</span> at [82], and affirmed by the Court of Appeal in _Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and Another Appeal_ <span class="citation">[2008] 2 SLR 491</span> at [36]. However, the analysis as to the right c hoic e of law for dealing with the Compromise Agreement as well as S 141/2012 was rendered moot as the Defendant had failed to plead that Indian law applied to S 141/2012, and had also failed to prove the c ontent of Indian law in that respec t. Absent suc h proof, the law of the forum, _ie_ , Singapore law, should be applied by default unless to do so would be unjust and inc onvenient (see _D’Oz International Pte Ltd v PSB Corp Pte Ltd and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2010] 3 SLR 267</span> at [25] and _EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">[2014] 1 SLR 860</span> at [58]). In the present c ase, given that the Defendant only raised the applic ability of Indian law belatedly in his c losing submissions, I was of the view that Singapore law should apply to S 141/2012. 

9       On the point regarding the Moç ambique rule, I ac c epted that a Singapore c ourt generally c annot make a judgment _in rem_ against the Indian properties, _ie_ , determining the rightful title to the Indian properties as against the whole world (see _Pattni v Ali_ [2007] 2 AC 85 at [21] as c ited in _Murakami Takako (executrix of the estate of Takashi Murakami Suroso, deceased) v Wiryadi Louise Maria and others_ <span class="citation">[2007] 4 SLR(R) 565</span> at [32]). However, this did not prec lude the c ourt from making judgment _in personam_ , in dec laring the relative interests of the parties to the properties under the Compromise Agreement. On the point regarding the appropriate forum for ventilating the dispute, the burden was on the Defendant not just to show that Singapore is not the natural or appropriate forum but to establish that there is another available forum whic h is c learly or distinc tly more appropriate than the Singapore forum, _ie_ , India in this c ase. I was not satisfied that the Defendant had disc harged this burden, given that he is himself resident in Singapore and suffers no hardship in litigating the dispute here. 

**Issues in dispute** 

10     The main purpose of S 141/2012 was not to deal with KRLP’s estate. The main issues before me in the trial were narrow fac tual ones relating to KRLP’s assets in Singapore: 

 (a) Whether the Compromise Agreement was valid and enforc eable, and if so, whether there was a breac h of the said agreement; 


 (b) Whether the Property was part of KRLP’s estate and was rightly inc luded in the Compromise Agreement; 

 (c ) Whether the Defendant was ac ting as trustee de son tort or a c onstruc tive trustee of KRLP’s estate in Singapore; and 

 (d) Whether the Defendant’s c ounterc laims relating to the Compromise Agreement and the Plaintiff’s personal assets in India should be allowed. 

**Was the compromise agreement valid and enforceable?** 

11     Disputes over the Singapore portion of KRLP’s estate began around February 2010, when the sec ond Plaintiff, c onc erned about his livelihood, asked the Defendant to allow him to jointly manage the Moneylending Business. A family meeting was set up between the first, sec ond, fourth Plaintiffs and the Defendant around the same time, where the Defendant apparently agreed to allow the sec ond Plaintiff to manage the business should he lose his job. The Plaintiffs c laimed that the 

Defendant c hanged his mind and during one visit to India reneged on his promise. [note: 13] After this, he stopped reporting the monthly financ ial situation of the Moneylending Business to the Plaintiffs, [note: 14] whic h the Plaintiffs alleged were in breac h of his fiduc iary duties arising out of his position as 

a trustee de son tort or a c onstruc tive trustee. The Plaintiffs c laimed that the parties had dec ided to hold a family meeting in late Dec ember 2010 to divide all the assets in India and Singapore belonging to their parents’ estate. It was also agreed that an asset list and valuation of the assets would be produc ed for the purpose of asset division. I noted the Defendant’s admission during c rossexamination that he had disc arded all the OCBC bank doc uments belonging to the Moneylending 

Business. [note: 15] 

12     It was undisputed that the Compromise Agreement was indeed signed by the parties on 29 Dec ember 2010 as a c onc lusion to the family meeting. I was satisfied that the requirements of a c ompromise agreement were satisfied in the present c ase, applying the fac tors identified in _Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332</span> by the Court of Appeal (at [45]–[72]): 

 (a) There was an ac tual dispute regarding the operation of the Moneylending Business, among others, and potential disputes over the general distribution of KRLP’s and Valli’s assets in India and Singapore; 

 (b) There was an identifiable agreement produc ed that was c omplete and c ertain – the Compromise Agreement, the subjec t of the dispute, was signed by all the parties on every page; 

 (c ) There was c onsideration given – both exec uted, in the form of the jewellery and utensils that the parties all divided equally, and exec utory, in the form of the Defendant’s promise to pay S$1.05m to the Plaintiffs in instalments and to divide one-ninth of the sale proc eeds of the Property among the parties equally, in exc hange for the Defendant ac quiring sole interest in the Moneylending Business; and 

 (d) There was intent to c reate legal relations, despite the domestic nature of the issues. The sec ond Plaintiff and Defendant flew in from Singapore to India while the third Plaintiff flew in from Canada spec ific ally for the purpose of this family meeting. The Defendant also stated in his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief (“AEIC”) that he had gone to the family meeting believing that there would be an amic able settlement. [note: 16] He also c laimed that he had c onveyed his desire 


 for both his parents’ estates to be distributed in early 2010. [note: 17] In that respec t, I had no doubt that parties had intended to enter into a binding agreement regarding the distribution of their parents’ estates, inc luding the assets in Singapore that were at the heart of S 141/2012. 

13     The very purpose and effec t of a c ompromise agreement is to extinguish all prior disputes, func tioning as a c omplete settlement of differenc es between parties; a party reneging on the mutual c ompromise would be in breac h of c ontrac t. The issues between parties, having been resolved by a c ompromise agreement, c annot be litigated so as to ensure c ommerc ial c ertainty and effic ac y of the administration of justic e (see _Real Estate Consortium Pte Ltd v East Coast Properties Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">[2011] 2 SLR 758</span> (“ _Real Estate Consortium_ ”) at [58]–[59]). A c ompromise agreement does not, however, func tion as a c omplete bar to reopening disputes, but it c an only be impugned on limited grounds by whic h normal c ontrac ts are usually c hallenged, suc h as illegality, fraud, duress, and undue influenc e, etc. (see _Real Estate Consortium_ at [61] and _Ling Yew Kong v Teo Vin Li Richard_ <span class="citation">[2014] 2 SLR 123</span> at [89]). Given that the Defendant had defended himself based on two of suc h grounds, namely duress and illegality, I move on to c onsider his defenc es in turn. 

**_Defence of duress_** 

14     The Defendant denied that he was indebted to the Plaintiffs for the sum of S$1.05m, [note: 18] or that he was in breac h of the Compromise Agreement, as he had been forc ed to sign it under duress. He c laimed that Muthu was unilaterally appointed by the Plaintiffs as a mediator, without his 

c onsent, and he was surprised to see Muthu present at the meeting. [note: 19] The Defendant c laimed that his wife, who ac c ompanied him to the meeting, was not allowed to attend the c losed-door meeting on the upper floor of the anc estral home and was seated on the ground floor. At the meeting, Muthu dic tated the information relating to the Moneylending Business to the Defendant and 

made him write it down, and Muthu drew up the Compromise Agreement in Tamil. [note: 20] The Defendant c laimed that the Plaintiffs and Muthu had ganged up on him and did not allow him to leave 

the meeting, threatening to beat him up unless he signed the Compromise Agreement. [note: 21] The Defendant also c laimed in his AEIC that after he had signed the Compromise Agreement and stood up, the fourth Plaintiff grabbed him from behind and held him tight, while the sec ond Plaintiff slapped the 

Defendant on his fac e. [note: 22] The Defendant shouted loudly for his wife who banged on the door, and the fourth Plaintiff released him. The Defendant c laimed that he rushed out of the room with his 

wife, c ollec ted some jewellery and utensils and left the anc estral home. [note: 23] The Defendant thus pleaded that the Compromise Agreement was unenforc eable as he signed it out of fear for his wife’s and his safety. The Defendant c laimed that he suffered a relapse of anxiety and had to see his 

psyc hiatrist on 10 January 2011, for whic h he produc ed a medic al report dated 28 July 2011. [note: 24] I noted that the Defendant’s AEIC gave the impression that the family meeting oc c urred only on one day, though during c ross-examination he took the position that his desc ription of the events of duress 

took plac e over two days. [note: 25] 

15     The Plaintiffs disputed the allegation of duress, [note: 26] and the sec ond and fourth Plaintiffs 

denied the spec ific allegations against them. [note: 27] In this respec t, I found Muthu’s testimony helpful, as it was undisputed that he was present at the family meeting in Dec ember 2010. Muthu testified during the sec ond and third tranc hes of the trial. The Defendant attempted to paint Muthu as a biased witness, bec ause Muthu was related to the sec ond Plaintiff. However, on c rossexamination, the Defendant admitted that Muthu was a c ommon relative to the parties. Muthu was 

related by marriage to the Defendant as their wives were c ousins. [note: 28] Muthu testified that he 

had known the parties sinc e birth. [note: 29] Despite the Defendant’s attempts to show otherwise, I 


was of the view that Muthu was a c redible independent witness. He was logic al and rational, and did not embellish his evidenc e. Muthu’s evidenc e was that the parties had attempted to distribute KRLP’s assets on 27 Dec ember 2010 but did not suc c eed, and he was informed of this situation by the 

Defendant’s mother-in-law. [note: 30] The Defendant then personally c alled Muthu on 27 Dec ember 

2010 to seek his assistanc e to preside over the asset division meeting on the following day. [note: 31] Muthu’s evidenc e was that his position as mediator to the family disc ussion was agreed by all parties. [note: 32] This c onc urrenc e was c orroborated by the Plaintiffs. [note: 33] Muthu’s evidenc e was that 

the valuation of the Moneylending Business was based on the ac c ounts produc ed by the Defendant. [note: 34] Muthu was also able to provide a detailed ac c ount of how the distribution took plac e 

peac efully over two days, and testified that the Defendant and his wife were jubilant and even 

thanked him at the end of the family meeting. [note: 35] There was no basis to c onc lude that Muthu was biased in the Plaintiffs’ favour, sinc e he did not stand to gain anything from the distribution of the family’s assets. 

16     On the evidenc e before me, I did not ac c ept that the defenc e of duress was made out. The Defendant admitted in c ross-examination that he had gone to the anc estral home onc e on 27 Dec ember 2010, and then for the family meeting that took plac e over 28 and 29 Dec ember 2010. If indeed there was c oerc ive behaviour on the part of the Plaintiffs, I found it diffic ult to believe that the Defendant and his wife would c ontinue to return to the anc estral home for disc ussions. His c laim in his AEIC that he was restrained and slapped by the sec ond and fourth Plaintiffs _after_ he signed the Compromise Agreement c ontradic ted his Defenc e, where it was stated that these ac tions oc c urred 

_before_ his signing of the Compromise Agreement. [note: 36] When he was c onfronted with this 

inc onsistenc y, the Defendant affirmed the ac c ount of events in his AEIC. [note: 37] I found this explanation rather unbelievable bec ause it made no sense for the Plaintiffs to abuse the Defendant when he had already signed the Compromise Agreement. The Defendant’s relianc e on these ac ts as ac ts of duress made no sense at all if this purported duress had oc c urred after the signing of the Compromise Agreement, the very ac t he c laimed he was c oerc ed into. Further, I found it diffic ult to believe that Muthu would have made up the numbers regarding the Moneylending Business. He had no knowledge of the Moneylending Business to begin with and was merely an outsider brought in to divide the assets based on information provided by the parties. The information in the Compromise Agreement regarding the Moneylending Business was unlikely to have been inc luded without the Defendant’s input, and I found it diffic ult to believe that he was forc ed by Muthu to c onc oc t those ac c ounts. In fac t, he admitted on c ross-examination that he would send the ac c ounting books of the Moneylending Business bac k to India regularly, though he had the books for 2010, and eventually brought them to the family meeting on 28 Dec ember 2010 where he handed them to the Plaintiffs. [note: 38] As for the medic al report by the psyc hiatrist, I noted that it was not proffered to prove a 

c ausative relationship between the Defendant’s anxiety and the duress. I was of the view that the period of around ten days between the family meeting and the appointment with the psyc hiatrist was suffic ient for the Defendant to have c hanged his mind regarding the Compromise Agreement, resulting in a different ac c ount of events to the psyc hiatrist. 

**_Defence of illegality_** 

17     With regard to the allegations of illegal moneylending, I found myself bound to report a potential offenc e of illegal moneylending as evidenc e was being led on that point, so the first tranc he of the trial in 2013 was stood down pending the Attorney General’s Chambers’ investigations into the Moneylending Business. No ac tion was taken against the sec ond Plaintiff, while the Defendant was 

issued a warning from the polic e. [note: 39] It was important to bear this outc ome in mind when analysing the Defendant’s defenc e of illegality. 


18     The Defendant in his Defenc e and Counterc laim (Amendment No 1) took the position that the Compromise Agreement was unenforc eable as it c onc erned the disposal of an interest in an unlic ensed Moneylending Business that was in c ontravention of the Moneylenders’ Ac t (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed). In his c losing submissions, his position appeared to c hange to arguing that the Compromise Agreement was unenforc eable having regard to the objec t it was devised to ac hieve, _ie_ to c irc umvent prevailing 

laws. [note: 40] It was not quite apparent whether he was arguing that the Compromise Agreement should be voided for statutory illegality or c ommon law illegality. 

19     In any c ase, the preliminary issue that had to be resolved in relation to the defenc e was whether the Defendant really had a lic ensed moneylending business separate from KRLP’s unlic ensed Moneylending Business. The fac t that the Defendant had a lic ense for moneylending was not in dispute. The Defendant’s c ase was that he had started a separate moneylending business of his own [note: 41] at 25A Norris Road c alled “Shanmugan Moneylender”, though the registered address was in 

Sim Lim Square, in July 2003. He was running KRLP’s Moneylending Business at the Property c onc urrently. Shanmugan Moneylender had a lic ense while the Moneylending Business, whic h was the subjec t of S 141/2012, did not. The Defendant’s evidenc e was that the polic e had disc overed that the Moneylending Business was unlic ensed, so he informed the Plaintiffs that he was going to obtain a lic enc e for the Moneylending Business, but the Plaintiffs refused. He c laimed that he had started to 

run a business in his own name for his own safety, [note: 42] whic h was made possible as the two businesses were loc ated near eac h other. He testified that the books for the two businesses were kept separate. He admitted that his separate business was subsequently moved to the Property due 

to threats from the Plaintiffs in 2006. [note: 43] 

20     The Plaintiffs’ position was that they had always assumed that the Defendant’s lic ense was the one for KRLP’s Moneylending Business. The Plaintiffs c laimed that they would not have gone to the Registrar of Moneylenders to enquire whether the lic ense c ould be transferred from the Defendant’s to the sec ond Plaintiff’s name, if they knew that the Moneylending Business was illegal. It would have been illogic al and in fac t dangerous for them to go to the authorities for enquiries if they knew that the Moneylending Business was illegal. The Defendant admitted that he had gone to the Registrar of Moneylenders with the first, sec ond and fourth Plaintiffs regarding the transfer of the lic ense, and c ould proffer no plausible explanation as to why the Plaintiffs would have gone to the Registrar of Moneylenders to enquire about a transfer of lic ense from the Defendant’s purported separate business 

to KRLP’s Moneylending business. [note: 44] 

21     In my view, the Defendant’s c laim that he ran a separate lic ensed moneylending business was a c onvenient one that held no water. The Defendant’s story was c ontradic ted by the ac c ounts of the Moneylending Business; he c ould proffer no c redible explanation for why items suc h as business registration and inc ome tax filing expenses, notebooks for lic ense ac c ount, as well as rental for 25A Norris Road were listed on the ac c ounts of the Moneylending Business, when suc h expenses would 

likely be inc urred _via_ his purported separate lic ensed business. [note: 45] This also c ontradic ted his testimony that the books for the two businesses were kept separately. Even the Defendant’s wife admitted on c ross-examination that she was always under the impression that the Defendant was 

only managing the Moneylending Business belonging to KRLP. [note: 46] It made no sense either for KRLP’s Moneylending Business to bear the expenses of the Defendant’s separate moneylending business as some form of inc entive to the Defendant when the Defendant was running a business that was in direc t c ompetition with the family’s. I also found it unc onvinc ing that the Defendant c ould manage two separate sets of c lients with different interest rates for loans when he eventually operated out of the same loc ation. He c laimed that he had c harged the lower interest of 18% under 


the lic ensed business and the higher and illegal interest rate of 36% under KRLP’s Moneylending Business, and these were entirely separate sets of c lients who did not know the existenc e of the 

other c onc urrent business. [note: 47] Given the business model that he operated on, _ie_ one that had relied on word of mouth and introduc tions by his father, I found it unlikely that he had his own separate set of c ustomers, and also unlikely that suc h c ustomers would not know of his legal business with a lower interest rate, if there really was one. 

22     The only plausible inferenc e I c ould draw from the evidenc e was that at very least from July 2003 onwards, the Moneylending Business was a lic ensed and thus legal one. The Defendant had no separate moneylending business of his own – his purported business and the Moneylending Business were one and the same. Thus, the Compromise Agreement did not relate to the transfer of an illegal interest, as the Defendant sought to argue. The Defendant’s defenc e of illegality failed as there was no illegality disc losed. Given that the threshold of illegality was not met, there was no further need to c onsider arguments regarding statutory illegality or c ommon law illegality. 

23     Having found that both of the Defendant’s arguments regarding duress and illegality were unsuc c essful, the Compromise Agreement was thus valid and enforc eable. 

**One-ninth share of the Property** 

24     Next, I noted that there was a dispute regarding the benefic ial ownership of the Property. The Plaintiffs’ position in its c losing submissions was that the Moneylending Business benefic ially owned a 

one-ninth share of the Property, [note: 48] though it was legally held in the name of one KR 

Ramalingam Pillai (“KRRP”), the late KRLP’s brother, as c onc eded by the sec ond Plaintiff. [note: 49] The 

one-ninth share of the Property was reflec ted as worth $7071 [note: 50] based on the ac c ounts for the Moneylending Business prepared by the Defendant. The Plaintiffs thus argued that the ac c ounts c learly showed that the Property belonged to the Moneylending Business, whic h was in turn owned by KRLP, and thus formed part of KRLP’s assets to be distributed. The Defendant’s position was that KRRP was the legal and benefic ial owner of the one-ninth share of the property and had willed it to 

the Defendant in his will dated 17 June 1996; he passed away in 2011. [note: 51] The Defendant was 

the lawful exec utor who had obtained the grant of probate in respec t of KRRP’s estate, [note: 52] and had sold the Property with the c onsent of the other owners of the Property. The Defendant denied that KRLP had any benefic ial interest in the Property, and so the Property should not be inc luded in the Compromise Agreement. 

25     I noted that the transfer form dated 13 November 1973 [note: 53] and the statutory dec laration 

dated 17 June 1996 made by KRRP [note: 54] was _prima facie_ evidenc e that while KRRP was the legal owner of one-ninth share of the Property, KRLP had benefic ial ownership of that share sinc e 1980. Sinc e the statutory dec laration indic ated KRRP’s intent to transfer the legal ownership of the oneninth share to the Defendant pursuant to KRLP’s instruc tions, it appears to be _prima facie_ evidenc e that the Defendant had benefic ial ownership of the one-ninth share sinc e 17 June 1996. 

26     However, the dispute over benefic ial ownership of the Property was moot given my finding above that the Compromise Agreement was valid and enforc eable. As mentioned above, the Compromise Agreement settled all pre-existing disputes between parties. Given that the Compromise Agreement dealt with this issue, _ie_ , the Defendant would divide the sale proc eeds from the Property between the parties equally, it superseded any dispute over whether it formed part of KRLP’s estate. Muthu also c orroborated that the parties had agreed that the Property would be sold off with the 

proc eeds to be divided equally, after some monies were set aside for their c hildren. [note: 55] This 


dispute over benefic ial ownership of the Property was a substantive dispute that fell outside of the limited grounds on whic h a Compromise Agreement c ould be impinged. 

27     Having dealt with the issues above, and given that it was undisputed that the Defendant had made no payments towards the Plaintiffs to date, there was undoubtedly a breac h of the Compromise Agreement by the Defendant when he failed to make both the payment of S$1.05m to the Plaintiffs and the payment for the Plaintiffs’ share of sale proc eeds of one-ninth of the Property. The Defendant was liable to repay the aforementioned sums to the Plaintiffs. 

**Breach of duty as trustee de son tort or constructive trustee of the estate of the late KRLP** 

28     As for the Plaintiffs’ allegations of the Defendant’s breac h of duty in his ac tions as trustee de son tort of KRLP’s estate, and in the alternative, as a c onstruc tive trustee of the same, I found that they were again, moot, given my finding above regarding the validity of the Compromise Agreement. The breac hes of duties alleged by the Plaintiffs related to the Defendant’s failure to provide the Moneylending Business’s ac c ounts shortly after Marc h 2010. The Plaintiffs also alleged that he failed 

to distribute KRLP’s assets inc luding the share of the Property and the Moneylending Business [note: 56] and misappropriated the profits due to KRLP’s estate. [note: 57] These were issues that had arisen 

before the family meeting of Dec ember 2010, and were dealt with by virtue of the Compromise Agreement, where the Defendant essentially had to pay the Plaintiffs S$1.05m in total in exc hange for sole ownership of the Moneylending Business. In the c ourse of the proc eedings, the Plaintiffs did not take issue with the ac c urac y of the ac c ounts that the Defendant was keeping for the Moneylending Business. Their attitude had always been to take the Defendant’s ac c ounts as true and ac c urate, [note: 58] and they also ac knowledged the Defendant’s diligenc e. [note: 59] In fac t, the sec ond Plaintiff 

admitted c andidly during c ross-examination that the Plaintiffs did not have any c omplaints about how the Defendant had run the Moneylending Business after KRLP’s death, and ac c epted the Defendant’s ac c ounts wholeheartedly; their only issue was that the Defendant did not give them the monies 

promised under the Compromise Agreement. [note: 60] The Plaintiffs’ position indic ated to me that the Compromise Agreement resolved these allegations of breac h of trust by the Defendant as well. There was thus no need to make a finding on these issues, nor would it be right given the existenc e of the Compromise Agreement, whic h I found to be valid and enforc eable. The Plaintiffs’ c laims in this respec t should thus be dismissed. 

**Counterclaim** 

29     The Defendant c ounterc laimed for his share of his parents’ estates due to him under the Compromise Agreement, less the jewellery and utensils whic h he had already taken. The Plaintiffs did not dispute that the Defendant had a right to the other assets suc h as property in India, as divided 

under the Compromise Agreement. [note: 61] It was admitted by the fourth Plaintiff that he had sold a property in Vilankuruc hi, Coimbatore Distric t, Tamil Nadu that was alloc ated to the Defendant under 

the Compromise Agreement. [note: 62] The Plaintiffs ac knowledged their liability to the Defendant in respec t of the entire sale proc eeds of that property and undertook to hold it on trust for the 

Defendant until S 141/2012 was over. [note: 63] Flowing from the Plaintiffs’ admission, the Defendant’s c ounterc laim for his share of assets under the Compromise Agreement suc c eeded. I was c onsc ious that this c ourt had no jurisdic tion to make _in rem_ orders against immovable property in India. My order was thus _in personam_ against the Plaintiffs to transfer to the Defendant the outstanding assets owing to the Defendant pursuant to the Compromise Agreement. 

30     As for the Defendant’s separate c ounterc laim for properties in the Plaintiffs’ names or their 


nominees in India, I saw no legal basis for doing so, given the granting of the c ounterc laim relating to the Defendant’s share of assets under the Compromise Agreement. 

**Conclusion** 

31     I allowed the Plaintiffs’ c laim and the Defendant’s c ounterc laim in part. I made the following orders: 

 (a) The Defendant was to pay to eac h of the individual Plaintiffs a sum of $262,500 plus interest; 

 (b) The Defendant was to produc e all doc uments relating to the sale of the Property, inc luding the transfer doc umentation, within fourteen days of this order; 

 (c ) Less the c osts inc urred for selling the Property, the Defendant was to pay the Plaintiffs 80% of the remainder of one-ninth of the sale proc eeds of the Property; 

 (d) The fourth Plaintiff was to produc e all doc uments relating to the sale of the Vilankuruc hi, Coimbatore Distric t, Tamil Nadu, inc luding the title deed and transfer doc umentation, within fourteen days of this order; and 

 (e) The Plaintiffs were to transfer to the Defendant the outstanding assets owing to the Defendant pursuant to the Compromise Agreement, as well as the entire sale proc eeds of the property in Coimbatore Distric t, Tamil Nadu. 

32     Sinc e the Plaintiffs had essentially suc c eeded on their c ase, the Defendant was to pay c osts to the Plaintiffs, to be taxed if not agreed.
