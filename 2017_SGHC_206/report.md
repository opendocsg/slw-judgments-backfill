**Introduction** 

1       On 12 August 2016, the plaintiff, Zero Geraldo Mario Nalpon (“Mr Nalpon”) wrote to the Law Soc iety of Singapore (“the Law Soc iety”) to c omplain about the c onduc t of Thio Shen Yi, SC (“Mr Thio”) who had given a message in the February 2016 issue of the Singapore Law Gazette (a public ation of the Law Soc iety). Mr Thio was president of the Law Soc iety then. His message was about polic e c onduc t in the investigation of a report about an alleged molestation of a girl by a 14year old sc hool boy (“the Student”). After the Student had been interviewed at the princ ipal’s offic e and then at a polic e division, he was released on bail to his mother’s c ustody. However, tragic ally, he was found dead at the foot of the bloc k of flats where he and his parents lived, a short while later on the same day as his release. 

2       The Law Soc iety appointed a Review Committee (“the RC”) on 4 Oc tober 2016. On 31 Oc tober 2016, the RC issued its report and direc ted the Counc il to dismiss the c omplaint. 

3       On 15 February 2017, Mr Nalpon filed the present Originating Summons (“the OS”) for various reliefs: 

1\. That Leave be granted to extend the time for filing this applic ation from 10th February 2017; 

2\. That Leave be granted to the Plaintiff to apply for a Quashing Order against the dec ision of the Review Committee No. 69 of 2016, c onstituted under Sec tion 85(6) of the Legal Profession     Ac t whic h dismissed the Plaintiff’s Complaints made against Mr Thio Shen Yi by way of the Plaintiff’s letter of Complaint to the Law Soc iety of Singapore dated 12th August 2016; 

3\. That an Order be made that the Plaintiff’s Complaint against Mr Thio Shen Yi dated 12th 


 August 2016 be reheard by a freshly c onstituted Review Committee; and 

4\. Suc h further or other relief as this Honourable Court deems fit. 

4       I heard the OS. Eventually, I dismissed it on 22 May 2017. Mr Nalpon has filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal against my dec ision to dismiss the OS. 

**Chronology** 

5       I will now set out in some detail the c hronology leading to the filing of the OS. 

6       On 25 January 2016, the Student allegedly molested a girl. 

7       On 26 January 2016, polic e offic ers went in plainc lothes to the Student’s sc hool. The Student was then brought to the princ ipal’s offic e and was spoken to in the presenc e of the polic e. I will elaborate later as to the number of polic e offic ers involved as that was one of the main c omplaints of Mr Nalpon about alleged falsehoods in Mr Thio’s message. Before the Student was brought bac k to Ang Mo Kio (“AMK”) polic e division, the Student c ontac ted his mother to inform her of the polic e investigation. The polic e also spoke to his mother. 

8       While at AMK polic e division, the Student was interviewed by the polic e. He was then released on bail and went home with his mother that afternoon. Later that afternoon, he was found dead at the foot of their bloc k of flats. 

9       On 1 February 2016, the polic e released a statement. That statement stated that: 

 ... Polic e offic ers went to c onduc t enquiries at a sc hool. To keep investigations disc reet, the offic ers went in plainc lothes and in unmarked c ars. ... [the Student] was brought to the Princ ipal’s offic e by a sc hool offic ial and was spoken with in the presenc e of a Polic e offic er. Before he was brought bac k to Ang Mo Kio Division, he c ontac ted his mother to inform her of the Polic e’s investigations. The Polic e offic er also spoke to the mother. 

 While at Ang Mo Kio Division, he was interviewed by one Investigation Offic er at his workstation. ... He was fully c o-operative during the interview. He was then released on bail and went bac k with his mother. 

 ... 

 Polic e investigations have not been c ompleted. A Coroner’s Inquiry will be held upon the c onc lusion of investigations ... 

10     At around that time, the February 2016 issue of the Singapore Law Gazette was published. The President’s Message from Mr Thio referred to this inc ident. I set out below two parts of the message whic h Mr Nalpon referred to in his c omplaint: 

 On 26th January 2016, five plain-c lothes polic emen visited his sc hool and spoke to him at the princ ipal’s offic e. 

 ... 

 The polic e c ould have c onsidered a less intimidating way of approac hing the investigation. 


11     In the 18 February 2016 issue of Today, whic h is an English-language daily newspaper, there was an artic le on the inc ident written by a journalist c alled Valerie Koh. I set out below two parts of that artic le whic h Mr Nalpon referred to in his c omplaint: 

 The President of the Law Soc iety of Singapore (LawSoc ) has weighed in on the debate sparked by the death of a 14-year-old boy after he had been taken in for questioning, saying the polic e should have taken a “less intimidating way” of approac hing the investigation. 

 ... 

 The teenager, a Sec ondary Three student, was pic ked up by five plainc lothes offic ers from his sc hool on Jan 26. After about two hours at Ang Mo Kio Polic e Division, he was brought home by his mother. Within two hours, he was found dead at the foot of his Yishun bloc k. 

12     Subsequently, Today c arried another artic le written by another journalist, Siau Ming En, in its issue of 2 Marc h 2016. I set out below two parts of that artic le c onc erning the Minister for Law, M K Shanmugam (“the Law Minister”), and Mr Thio whic h Mr Nalpon referred to in his c omplaint: 

 [The Minister for Law] also c hided Senior Counsel Thio Shen Yi, president of the Law Soc iety of Singapore (LawSoc ), for prac tic ally implying, in a c ommentary published last month in LawSoc ’s monthly newsletter, that [the Student] killed himself bec ause of polic e intimidation. Adding that it was “surprising” that even a lawyer suc h as Mr Thio made “some c omments whic h should never have been made”, Mr Shanmugam said: “Mr Thio has a duty to be fair to the polic e offic ers.” 

 ... 

 Turning his attention to Mr Thio, Mr Shanmugam noted that the lawyer’s c ommentary c laimed that five polic e offic ers spoke to [the Student] and the polic e should have behaved in a less intimidating way. These are false, Mr Shanmugam said. He added that Mr Thio “seemed to make the assertion of intimidation, based on his other statements, whic h are themselves false”. ... 

13     Mr Nalpon also said that Mr Thio was reported in that artic le to have said, “There was no intention to imply that [the Student’s] tragic death was c aused by polic e intimidation”. 

14     On 12 August 2016, Mr Nalpon made a written c omplaint to the Law Soc iety. His letter set out five c omplaints in relation to Mr Thio: 

 (a) ac ting in a manner unbefitting of an Advoc ate and Solic itor as an offic er of the Supreme Court and President of the Law Soc iety of Singapore by making false statements in the February 2016 Law Gazette on a c ase whic h was being investigated by the polic e, in breac h of s 67 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduc t) Rules (R 1, Cap 161, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the 1st Complaint”); 

 (b) ac ting in a manner unbefitting of an Advoc ate and Solic itor as an offic er of the Supreme Court and President of the Law Soc iety of Singapore by making false statements to the press or media on a c ase whic h was being investigated by the polic e, in breac h of s 67 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduc t) Rules (“the 2nd Complaint”); 

 (c ) ac ting in a manner unbefitting of an Advoc ate and Solic itor as an offic er of the Supreme Court and President of the Law Soc iety of Singapore by making c omments in the February 2016 Law Gazette that may prejudic e matters sub judice in breac h of paragraph 61 of the 2013 Law Soc iety Prac tic e Direc tions and Rulings Guide (“the 3rd Complaint”); 


 (d) ac ting in a manner unbefitting of an Advoc ate and Solic itor as an offic er of the Supreme Court and President of the Law Soc iety of Singapore by making c omments to the press or media that may prejudic e matters sub judice in breac h of the PDR 2013, paragraph 61 (“the 4th Complaint”); and 

 (e) ac ting in a manner unbefitting of an Advoc ate and Solic itor as an offic er of the Supreme Court and President of the Law Soc iety of Singapore by questioning the intelligenc e of the Law Minister and his c ommand of the English Language by denying the c lear meaning of his baseless c omments (“the 5th Complaint”). 

15     Although there were five c omplaints, they c entred around three public ations: 

 (a) Mr Thio’s message in the February 2016 issue of the Singapore Law Gazette; 

 (b) The Today issue of 18 February 2016; and 

 (c ) The Today issue of 2 Marc h 2016. 

I have already c ited the relevant parts of eac h of these public ations whic h Mr Nalpon was raising. 

16     Mr Thio’s message was the subjec t of the 1st and 3rd Complaints. 

17     The Today issue of 18 February 2016 was the subjec t of the 2nd and 4th Complaints. 

18     The differenc e was that in respec t of the Today artic le of 18 February 2016, Mr Thio was alleged to have made the statements to the press or media. 

19     The Today issue of 2 Marc h 2016 was the subjec t of the 5th Complaint. In summary, Mr Nalpon was c omplaining that when Mr Thio responded to the Law Minister’s c omments and denied that he had any intention to imply that the Student’s death was c aused by polic e intimidation, Mr Thio was questioning the Law Minister’s intelligenc e and understanding of the English Language as the Law Minister had been reported to have c ommented that Mr Thio was implying that the Student had killed himself bec ause of polic e intimidation. 

20     As mentioned above, an RC was c onstituted on 4 Oc tober 2016. The RC eventually issued a report dated 31 Oc tober 2016 to direc t the Counc il to dismiss all his c omplaints (“the RC Report”). 

21     The Law Soc iety rec eived the report on 7 November 2016 and sent a c opy to Mr Nalpon with a c over letter dated 8 November 2016. 

22     Mr Nalpon eventually filed the OS on 15 February 2017 for various reliefs. It was c ommon ground that he was out of time as he had three months to do so under O 53 r 1(6) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322 R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”) from the date of the report. Even if the time began to run from the date he rec eived the report, he was still out of time. 

23     The OS sought the reliefs in [3] above. 

24     On 21 February 2017, WongPartnership, ac ting for the Law Soc iety, filed a Notic e of Appointment of Solic itor. Presumably, this notic e was served on Mr Nalpon shortly thereafter. 

25     At a pre-trial c onferenc e before Assistant Registrar James Lee (“the AR”) on 6 Marc h 2017, Mr 


Nalpon orally applied to the AR to direc t WongPartnership to withdraw that notic e. Mr Nalpon submitted that the Law Soc iety was not entitled to be present or to be heard as the OS was an _ex parte_ applic ation. This oral applic ation was resisted by WongPartnership. 

26     Eventually the AR dec lined to make the direc tion sought by Mr Nalpon as the AR was of the view that the matter should be dec ided by the judge hearing the OS. 

27     Consequently, Mr Nalpon filed Registrar’s Appeal No 75 of 2017 against the AR’s “dec ision” not to make that direc tion. 

28     Both the appeal and the OS c ame to be heard before me on 5 May 2017. I informed the parties that as the AR had not rendered a judic ial dec ision, there was no need for Mr Nalpon to have filed an appeal. Nevertheless, I c ontinued to hear Mr Nalpon’s objec tion to the Notic e of Appointment of Solic itor filed by WongPartnership. 

29     Although the Law Soc iety was not entitled to be heard on an _ex parte_ applic ation, I was of the view that it c ould be heard on an opposed _ex parte_ basis. After hearing arguments, I allowed WongPartnership to attend at the hearing of the OS. Mr Nalpon then sought an adjournment as he had just rec eived a written submission from WongPartnership. I granted an adjournment and the OS was eventually fixed for hearing again on 22 May 2017. After hearing arguments, I dismissed the OS. 

**The court’s reasons** 

**_Extension of time_** 

30     The primary relief sought in the OS was for leave to apply for a Quashing Order against the dec ision of the RC. Under O 53 r 1(6) of the ROC, an applic ation for leave to apply for a Quashing Order is to be made within three months after the date of the proc eeding. The RC’s report was dated 31 Oc tober 2016. Therefore, the OS should have been filed on or before **31 January 2017**. 

31     If I were to use the date of Mr Nalpon’s rec eipt of a c opy of the RC Report on 10 November 2016 as the relevant date from whic h time begins to run, the OS for leave should have been filed on or before **10 February 2017**. 

32     It was filed on 15 February 2016 whic h was out of time. Henc e, the OS also had a prayer for extension of time to file the applic ation. 

33     Order 53 r 1(6) also states that leave “shall not be granted” unless the delay beyond the three months period is “ac c ounted for to the satisfac tion of the Judge to whom the applic ation for leave is made”. 

34     The Law Soc iety submitted that in view of the express requirement that the delay is to be ac c ounted to the satisfac tion of the judge hearing the applic ation for leave, suc h a requirement is even stric ter than an applic ation to apply for leave to file an appeal out of time. 

35     I was of the view that even if the said requirement was not stric ter, it was still for Mr Nalpon to ac c ount for the delay to my satisfac tion. In paragraphs three to five of his first supporting affidavit for the OS, he said that after he had rec eived a c opy of the RC Report, he then sent a letter dated 23 November 2016 to the Law Minister who had c hided Mr Thio for making false statements and unfounded allegations against the polic e. He rec eived a reply from the Ministry of Law on 12 Dec ember 2016. In the light of suc h c irc umstanc es, Mr Nalpon said that he failed to note that the 


three months’ timeline in O 53 r 1(6) “had started to run from the date [he] rec eived the said Report”. 

36     I elaborate that Mr Nalpon’s letter to the Minister was to inform the Minister of the c omplaint he had made to the Law Soc iety and of the dec ision of the RC. He said in the letter that he wanted to give the Minister “the opportunity to address this grave error by the Review Committee who refused to find any c ause for the Complaint to be further investigated”. The Ministry’s reply was that it did not have jurisdic tion over appeals on dec isions by the RC. 

37     However, as the Law Soc iety submitted, Mr Nalpon c ould not show how his letter to the Minister and the Ministry’s reply had c aused him to fail to note the three months’ timeline in O 53 r 1(6). 

38     I also noted that Mr Nalpon is a prac tising solic itor. Furthermore, this was not his first applic ation for judic ial review. In the affidavit he filed to support his appeal against AR James Lee’s “dec ision” not to direc t the Law Soc iety’s solic itor to withdraw the Notic e of Appointment of Solic itor, Mr Nalpon mentioned, at paragraph 14, that he had applied for leave to apply for judic ial review in OS 308 of 2015 under O 53 r 1, whic h was “exac tly the same provision”, to use his own words. 

39     In the c irc umstanc es, Mr Nalpon failed to ac c ount for the delay to my satisfac tion. For that reason alone, I would not have granted him an extension of time to make his applic ation. 

**_Merits of the application_** 

40     As for the substantive merits of Mr Nalpon’s applic ation for leave to apply for judic ial review, the Law Soc iety submitted initially that he was not c ritic ising the RC’s dec ision for illegality, irrationality or proc edural impropriety whic h are the established grounds for judic ial review. His grievanc e was that the RC’s dec ision was erroneous on the merits. 

41     After rec eiving a c opy of the Law Soc iety’s written skeletal submissions, Mr Nalpon then exec uted another affidavit on 22 May 2017 to say that he was c hallenging the RC’s dec ision on the grounds that it was: (a) unlawful, (b) biased and (c ) irrational. 

42     As I said in _Deepak Sharma v Law Society of Singapore_ <span class="citation">[2016] 4 SLR 192</span> at [21]: 

 The test for granting leave to bring judic ial review proc eedings is well settled. The c ourt must be satisfied that (see Jeyaretnam Kenneth Andrew v AG <span class="citation">[2014] 1 SLR 345</span> at [5]): 

 (a) The matter c omplained of is susc eptible to judic ial review. 

 (b) The plaintiff has a suffic ient interest or standing in the matter. 

 (c ) The material before the c ourt disc loses an arguable c ase or prima facie c ase of reasonable suspic ion in favour of granting the public law remedies sought by the plaintiff. 

43     The third limb of the test was the relevant one here. 

44     Before I address the substantive c omplaints, I would mention that the RC Report noted that Mr Nalpon had c ited s 67 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduc t) Rules (R1, Cap 161, 2010 Rev Ed) and paragraph 61 of the PDR 2013 in his letter of c omplaint, but these provisions no longer applied at the time of Mr Thio’s message and c onduc t. With effec t from 18 November 2015, the Legal Profession (Professional Conduc t) Rules 2015 (S 706/2015) (“the 2015 Rules”) were applic able. In the RC’s view, princ iple ( _a_ ) under r 8(1) of the 2015 rules was likely to be applic able. In Mr Nalpon’s first 


supporting affidavit for his applic ation, he said he was unaware that the provisions he relied on had c eased to apply. However, he also suggested that princ iple ( _b_ ) under rule 8(1) of the 2015 Rules was applic able. I now reproduc e r 8(1) and princ iples ( _a_ ) and ( _b_ ) under that provision: 

 Conduct in relation to other persons 

 8.—(1) The following princ iples guide the interpretation of this rule. 

 Principles 

 ( a ) A legal prac titioner who deals with any person must, regardless of whether that person is involved in any matter with whic h the legal prac titioner is c onc erned, be honest and c ourteous, and behave in a manner befitting the legal prac titioner’s professional standing. 

 ( b ) A legal prac titioner must behave in a manner c onsistent with the public interest. 

45     It may be that, stric tly speaking, princ iple ( _a_ ) does not apply as it refers to a situation where a legal prac titioner deals with another person. However, it was not disputed that generally a legal prac titioner should ac t honestly and in a manner befitting his professional standing. 

46     I will deal first with the 5th Complaint, _ie_ , that Mr Thio had questioned the intelligenc e of the Law Minister and his c ommand of the English language when Mr Thio disagreed with the c omments of the Minister. The RC c onsidered this c omplaint to be “somewhat fatuous” and had no hesitation in dismissing it. In my view, this c omplaint was quite c learly a non-starter. Mr Thio was entitled to say that he had no intention to imply that the Student’s death was c aused by polic e intimidation even if the Minister took a different view that that was Mr Thio’s implic ation. It was absurd to suggest that Mr Thio was guilty of improper c onduc t just bec ause he expressed a different view. There was no basis to c hallenge the RC’s dec ision to rejec t this c omplaint. 

47     I next address the 2nd and 4th Complaints in whic h Mr Thio is alleged to have made false statements to the press or media (see [14]). These items of c omplaint arose from the artic le mentioned in the Today newspaper as mentioned above. The RC Report noted at paragraph 8 that there was no evidenc e that Mr Thio had made the statements to the relevant reporter. It appeared that the reporter had merely pic ked up on and quoted the statements found in the Law Gazette. Mr Nalpon had c onc eded to the RC during their meeting with him on 24 Oc tober 2016 that he had no evidenc e that Mr Thio made the statements to the reporter in question. Indeed, in Mr Nalpon’s supporting affidavits for his OS, he still did not offer any evidenc e that Mr Thio had made the statements to the reporter. Therefore, the RC did not err in any way in rejec ting these two c omplaints. 

48     I c ome bac k to the 1st and 3rd Complaints (see [14] above). They relate to the statements from Mr Thio’s message in the Law Gazette. 

49     The c rux of Mr Nalpon’s c omplaint was that Mr Thio’s statements were wrong and therefore false. I have set out above the statements of Mr Thio whic h Mr Nalpon had referred to. However, Mr Nalpon did not spec ify c learly whic h part of the statements was wrong. 

50     The first of the statements in question had two parts. The first part was that five plain-c lothes polic emen visited the Student’s sc hool. The sec ond part was that these five plain-c lothes polic emen spoke to the Student. 


51     There was no evidenc e that the first part was wrong. There was some evidenc e that the sec ond part was wrong. This was bec ause the polic e had issued a statement to say that the Student was brought to the princ ipal’s offic e by a sc hool offic ial and was spoken with in the presenc e of “a” polic e offic er, _ie_ , not five offic ers. 

52     Furthermore, it was reported in the Today issue of 2 Marc h 2016 that the Law Minister had said that Mr Thio’s c laim that five polic e offic ers had spoken to the Student was false. 

53     The RC Report said at para 7 that Mr Nalpon did not give the RC evidenc e that this statement was false, apart from quoting what the Law Minister had said as reported in the Today newspaper. 

54     It seemed to me that the RC did err on this point. However, this was not an error of law. The RC knew that there must be some evidenc e of misc onduc t. However, the RC erred on the fac ts in appearing to require more evidenc e from Mr Nalpon than what the Minister had said. The Minister’s statement that it was false for Mr Thio to say that five polic e offic ers spoke to the Student was itself evidenc e that Mr Thio had gotten his fac ts wrong, _ie_ , that it was not five polic e offic ers who were present in the princ ipal’s offic e when the Student was interviewed. Furthermore, the polic e statement was also evidenc e that only one polic e offic er was present then. Whether the Minister’s statement and the polic e statement were suffic ient to establish that Mr Thio’s statement was wrong, if the matter were to go up to an Inquiry Committee or to a Disc iplinary Tribunal, was a different matter. 

55     Mr Nalpon suggested that the RC was biased in disregarding the Minister’s statement. While the RC had erred in not giving more weight to that statement, I am of the view that this error alone does not suggest any bias whatsoever. 

56     In so far as Mr Nalpon said at paragraph 36 of his sec ond affidavit that the RC had c ompletely dismissed the offic ial position of the Minister as “lac king in substanc e” and his relianc e on it as being “misc onc eived and vexatious”, I am of the view that Mr Nalpon had quoted from the RC Report out of c ontext. The RC Report stated at paragraph 11 that the RC found his c omplaints to lac k substanc e and suc h c omplaints were misc onc eived and vexatious. This was the last paragraph of the report and was a summary of its general c onc lusion on all his c omplaints. It was not addressed to the Minister’s statement spec ific ally. As mentioned above, the RC appeared not to have given enough weight to the Minister’s statement. However, that is quite different from saying that the RC was of the view that the Minister’s statement was “lac king in substanc e” or “was misc onc eived and vexatious” as suggested by Mr Nalpon. 

57     I also note that the RC did go on to c onsider the c irc umstanc es leading to Mr Thio’s error, if indeed he had made an error. The RC noted (at paragraph 7 of the RC Report) that there was no evidenc e to show that Mr Thio had intended to make a false statement or had known he was making a false statement or had no reasonable grounds to believe that his statement was true. 

58     Mr Nalpon said at paragraph 19 of his first supporting affidavit for the OS that the onus was not on him as a c omplainant to produc e evidenc e of Mr Thio’s intention and knowledge and inferenc es would be drawn. 

59     However, the point is that it is not suffic ient to allege that a solic itor said something wrong. I add that the use of the word “false” does not add muc h in substanc e although the word “false” sounds more serious than “wrong” and may give the inc orrec t impression that “false” nec essarily implies an intention to c ommunic ate falsehood or a lac k of c are about whether one is telling the truth. Solic itors make mistakes and it c annot be that eac h time a solic itor makes a wrong or false statement that the c omplaint must be referred to an Inquiry Committee. Also, the mistake does not bec ome 


more serious just bec ause a Minister says that the statement was “false”. There must be something more. Mr Thio’s intention and knowledge, and the question whether he had reasonable grounds to believe that his statement was true, were all relevant fac tors for the RC to take into ac c ount. 

60     If a c omplainant is not able to say what was exac tly in the mind of a solic itor when that solic itor made a false statement, he should point to c irc umstanc es whic h may lead one to c onc lude that the solic itor intended to make a false statement or that the solic itor knew he was making a false statement or had no reasonable ground to make it. However, Mr Nalpon’s c omplaint did not even allege that Mr Thio had deliberately intended to make a false statement or knew he was making a false statement or that Mr Thio had no reasonable ground to believe that his statement was true. In the c irc umstanc es, all Mr Nalpon was saying in substanc e was that Mr Thio had made a wrong statement although Mr Nalpon preferred to use the stronger sounding adjec tive “false”. Ac c ordingly, there was no error of law by the RC. Nor was there any bias or irrationality. 

61     The sec ond statement of Mr Thio whic h Mr Nalpon c omplained of was that, “The polic e c ould have c onsidered a less intimidating way of approac hing the investigation”. Again, Mr Nalpon appeared to rely on the Minister’s statement, as reported, that Mr Thio’s assertion of intimidation was false as it was based on other false statements of Mr Thio. Other than that, Mr Nalpon did not explain why this sec ond statement was false. 

62     The RC Report did not address this sec ond statement spec ific ally beyond mentioning it as part of the statements Mr Nalpon was c omplaining about. 

63     Looking at Mr Thio’s message in its entirety, it was c lear to me that in c ommenting that a less intimidating approac h should have been taken, he was not relying solely on the assumption that five polic e offic ers were present at the interview. He mentioned other fac tors like the fac t that the Student had been taken bac k to AMK polic e division during sc hool hours. Furthermore, Mr Thio was merely expressing his opinion. While one c ould argue that Mr Thio should have been more c areful in stating his opinion, that is not the point. 

64     There was no suggestion even by Mr Nalpon that Mr Thio was deliberately or rec klessly making a c omment without basis. In the c irc umstanc es, there was no reasonable suspic ion in favour of granting Mr Nalpon’s remedy of quashing the RC’s dec ision. 

65     As for the 3rd Complaint, _ie_ , that Mr Thio’s statements may prejudic e matters _sub judice_ , Mr Nalpon’s point was that the c ause of the Student’s death was the subjec t of a pending Coroner’s Inquiry. 

66     The RC Report said at paragraph 9 that Mr Thio’s message was not meant to disc uss the c ause of death but was a review of polic e investigation proc edures when dealing with vulnerable suspec ts. Indeed Mr Thio did say in his message, “Why did he jump? Could his death have been prevented? We c an never know for c ertain”. 

67     I agreed with the RC that Mr Thio’s statement about a less intimidating way of approac hing an investigation was not an attempt to say what had c aused the Student to jump. It was an attempt to address a wider issue, _ie_ , polic e investigations involving vulnerable suspec ts. As a solic itor and as President of the Law Soc iety, Mr Thio’s message was not gratuitous. It may be that others may think that Mr Thio was implying that the Student’s death was c aused by polic e intimidation but that was not the foc us of the message. He was quite c learly not trying to suggest the c ause of death. 

68     In so far as the RC Report also stated at paragraph 9 that neither a Review Committee nor an 


Inquiry Committee is the proper forum to determine whether the statements c omplained of may prejudic e c ourt proc eedings, I am of the view that that is too wide a statement and might therefore have c onstituted an error of law so as to amount to illegality. However it was only one of the reasons mentioned by the RC for its dec ision. As mentioned above, the RC did c onc lude that Mr Thio’s message was not meant to disc uss the c ause of death. 

69     In the c irc umstanc es, I was of the view that Mr Nalpon had not established his c ase for his applic ation in respec t of the 3rd Complaint. 

70     Ac c ordingly, I dismissed the OS.
