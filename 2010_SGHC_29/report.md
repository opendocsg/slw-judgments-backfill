**Kan Ting Chiu J:** 

1       This is ac tion arises out of a c ontrac tual relationship between the parties. The plaintiffs City Ken Pte Ltd are motor vehic le repairers. The defendants Comfortdelgro Engineering Pte Ltd, who are also engaged in motor vehic le repairs, had a c ontrac t to repair the taxis of CityCab Pte Ltd (“CityCab”), but instead of undertaking the repairs themselves, they sub-c ontrac ted the repairs out to the plaintiffs. 

2       The dispute between the parties arose out of an arrangement they termed a profit-sharing arrangement. The arrangement, as desc ribed by the plaintiffs, was that: 

 (i) The Plaintiffs will invoic e the Defendants 80% of the c osts of the ac c ident damage repairs to the CityCab Taxis; 

 (ii) The Defendants will pay the amount invoic ed to the Plaintiffs within 30 days of the Plaintiffs’ invoic es; 

 (iii) In the event the driver (or his/her insurers) of the other vehic le involved in the ac c ident offers the Defendants a settlement of the c laim for repair c osts at a sum below the amount so c laimed, the Defendants will be able to rec over from the Plaintiffs any over-payment under the revenue sharing sc heme agreed, desc ribed in the aforesaid minutes as the “over-payment of profit sharing for the differenc e between the c laim amount and the settlement rec eived” (“Over Payment Return”). [note: 1] 

The overall sc heme was that the defendants were to pay the plaintiffs 80% of the repair amounts, and issue invoic es to CityCab for the full sums, but CityCab did not pay the invoic es, and the defendants would make c laims in CityCab’s name against the third parties and retain the amounts rec eived from them. 

3       In c ases where the defendants were not able to rec over the full c laim from a third party, they 


were entitled to a refund or c lawbac k from the plaintiffs, initially through c redit notes issued by the plaintiffs and subsequently through debit notes issued by the defendants. It was rec orded in the 

minutes of a meeting between the parties that: [note: 2] 

 Basis of Profit Sharing 

1\. 20% for [the Defendants] and 80% for [the Plaintiffs] based on all repair bills for labour and spare parts sales but not applic able to exc ess c ases. 

2\. The term of payment for works order reflec ting the 80% share for [the Plaintiffs] shall be 30 days. 

3\. In the event that [the Defendants] be offered to settle the c laim in partial and/or inc urred legal c osts, [the Defendants] would be able to rec over from [the Plaintiff ] for the over-payment of profit sharing for the differenc e between c laim amount and settlement rec eived. 

4       The parties maintained the working relationship between 1997 and 2003. During this period, the c orporate identity of the defendants went through several transformations and the c ontrac t went through several revisions, but nothing turned on that. 

5       It was apparent that the parties were more familiar and c onc erned with vehic ular repairs than paperwork. They did not engage lawyers to draft formal agreements. They were not c areful to monitor the rec ords and the ac c ounts between themselves when the c ontrac tual relationship was ongoing. When the relationship was terminated in September 2003, both were unc lear about the state of the rec ords and the ac c ounts. The plaintiffs started by demanding $15,370,697.51 from the defendants. After the ac tion was filed, the amount was reduc ed to $2,208,716.63, made up of two c omponents, $740,602.33 for unpaid invoic es, and $1,468,114.30 deduc ted by the defendants through their disputed debit notes they had issued, and the amount for the unpaid invoic es was reduc ed to $11,053.24 and the amount for the disputed debit notes rose to $1,785,786.72. 

6       The defendants also took c hanging positions. They initially c ontended that there was no sum due to the plaintiffs at the termination of relationship. Subsequently, they paid $123,652.57 to the plaintiffs. After the plaintiffs c ommenc ed the ac tion, they made a further payment of $90,816.60, and in the c ourse of the hearing, they made further payments on two oc c asions amounting to $1,935. and $2,158.28. 

7       These diffic ulties arose bec ause the parties disagreed over the effec t and the implementation of the arrangement, in partic ular with referenc e to the defendants’ handling of the c laims, the issuanc e of their debit notes, and the payment of the plaintiffs’ invoic es. 

**The plaintiffs’ claim in the action** 

8       The plaintiffs c laimed against the defendants: 

 (a) $1,785,786.72 being the sum of the plaintiffs’ invoic es with no set offs for debit notes issued after January 2002; or 

 (b) (i) $11,053.24 being the unpaid balanc e of the plaintiffs’ invoic es after setting off the defendants’ debit notes, and 

 (ii) damages; or 


 (c ) an ac c ount of all sums due from the defendants to the plaintiffs. 

9       The defendants did not admit any part of the plaintiffs’ c laims. They maintained that their debit notes were valid, that they had dealt with the c laims and settlements properly, and that there were no further payments due to the plaintiffs. 

10     The plaintiffs pleaded in their statement of c laim that: 

 3(c ) It is a term of the Taxi Agreement that: 

 (i) The Plaintiffs will invoic e the Defendants 80% of the c osts of the ac c ident damage repairs to the CityCab Taxis; 

 (ii) The Defendants will pay the amount invoic ed to the Plaintiffs within 30 days of the Plaintiffs’ invoic es; 

 (iii) In the event the driver (or his/her insurers) of the other vehic le involved in the ac c ident offers the Defendants a settlement of the c laim for repair c osts at a sum below the amount so c laimed, the Defendants will be able to rec over from the Plaintiffs any overpayment under the revenue sharing sc heme agreed, desc ribed in the aforesaid minutes as the “over-payment of profit sharing for the differenc e between the c laim amount and the settlement rec eived” (“Over Payment Return”). 

 3(d) [I]t was an implied term of the Taxi Agreement that the Defendants would use all reasonable efforts to pursue the c laims for repair c osts and other c laims, would use due diligenc e in pursuing suc h c laims, would keep the Plaintiffs informed of suc h efforts and would consult the Plaintiffs and would obtain the Plaintiffs’ approval with respec t to any settlement proposed. [note: 3] 

 [emphasis added] 

**The handling of the claims** 

11     The plaintiffs alleged that between 1997 and 1998 the defendants c onsulted and sought their approvals on the settlement of the c laims, and in c ases where settlement fell below 80% of invoic ed amounts, the plaintiffs would issue c redit notes to the defendants whic h the latter would use to set off against any sums due to the defendants. In 1999, the proc edure was c hanged whereby the defendants issued debit notes to the plaintiffs instead of the plaintiffs issuing c redit notes to the defendants. The plaintiffs did not state whether the c hange from the use of debit notes in plac e of c redit notes was made with their agreement. Nevertheless, the defendants c ontinued to provide 

information to and seek the approval of the plaintiffs on settlements up to 2002. [note: 4] 

12     The proc edure c hanged further in January 2002. The defendants did not inform or c onsult the plaintiffs on the c laims or to seek their approval. When c laims were settled below the 80% level, the defendants issued debit notes to the plaintiffs on the shortfalls and set off the amounts from payments due to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs alleged that the debit notes the defendants issued did not c ontain suffic ient partic ulars to matc h them to the plaintiffs’ invoic es, and did not c ontain any 

information on the settlements. [note: 5] 

13     The defendants admitted in their pleaded defenc e that they had c onsulted and sought the 


plaintiffs’ approval on settlements up to January 2002 but they denied that they were obliged to do 

that. [note: 6] Subsequently they tried to c hange their position without amending their defenc e, and 

denied that they had c onsulted the plaintiffs or sought their c onsent before 2002. [note: 7]. The defendants also denied that their debit notes were lac king in c ontent. 

**The debit notes** 

14     The plaintiffs had two primary c omplaints over the debit notes, that 

 (a) the debit notes issued from January 2002 and the c onsequential c lawbac ks set off against the plaintiffs’ invoic es were invalid bec ause the defendants did not c onsult and seek the plaintiffs’ approval for the settlement of c laims; and 

 (b) the defendants had not dealt with the c laims reasonably and diligently. 

**Whether the terms pleaded in para 3(d) of the Statement of Claim can be implied** 

15     There was little evidenc e on the c irc umstanc es in whic h the agreement between the parties was arrived at. Tee Swee Kiong, the founder and former direc tor of the plaintiffs filed an affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief in whic h he asserted that the parties agreed that it was agreed that the plaintiffs would be involved in any dec ision on the settlement or dropping of any c laim (whic h meant that this was an express term of the agreement rather than an implied term as the plaintiffs pleaded). However, he did not give evidenc e during the trial on medic al grounds that he had pulmonary fibrosis, bronc hiec tasis, c hronic bronc hitis and emphysema, although he was rec orded on video in apparent good health meeting with other persons for a meal at a c offee shop and doing shopping at a supermarket. I was prepared to allow for medic al fac ilities to be made ready and available when he gave his evidenc e, but he dec ided that he would not attend c ourt to testify. In the c irc umstanc es, his affidavit was not admitted in evidenc e as there was no reason for it to be admitted under O 38 r 2(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”) if he c ould not be c rossexamined on the disputed c ontention. 

16     The plaintiffs’ assertion that the defendants c onsulted them and sought their approval from the time the agreement c ame into forc e in 1997 till January 2002 was ac c epted by the defendants with the qualific ation that they were not obliged to do that under the terms of the agreement. 

17     There was, however, no c ontemporaneous evidenc e on the origin for that prac tic e. There was nothing to show if the c onsultations and approvals were done on a c ontrac tual or voluntary basis. 

18     The plaintiffs had an interest in the settlement of the repair c laims with third parties. As the defendants c an set off the over-payment returns from payments due to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs were affec ted by the settlements. The arrangement was that the defendants were in c harge of the c laims, inc luding the c osts and expenses that may be involved. It would appear onerous that while the defendants had the burden of dealing with and funding the c laims, they needed the approval of the plaintiffs for all settlements. 

19     In the absenc e of c ontemporaneous rec ords, the c onduc t of the parties had to be referred to to asc ertain whether they c onduc ted their affairs on the basis that there was an agreement that the plaintiffs had to be c onsulted and their approvals obtained for any settlement. 

20     Two letters of the plaintiffs were of assistanc e for this purpose. First, there is a letter from the 

plaintiffs, signed by Tee Swee Kiong to the defendants dated 17 April 2003 [note: 8] whic h stated: 


 With referenc e to our meeting on April 17, we have mentioned that the number of outstanding ac c ident c laim c ases was about on thousand c ases. 

 We have the understanding that the c orporate legal department is handling the outstanding c ases whic h is in our opinion the c laims proc ess is rather lengthy. We have spent muc h time going through the above mentioned c ases and realized that a number of the c laim c ases are not settled within the required time. 

 In order to fac ilitate the proc ess we would sinc erely request the authority c onc ern to grant the right to assist [the Defendants] in resolving the outstanding c ases. We would like to propose that CityKen Pte Ltd takeover the rest of the outstanding c ases. Furthermore we will set up a c laim department at no c ost to [the Defendants]. 

 In order to justified the basis of the settlement. We would like to assure that all the rec overy amount will be duly c hanneled to [the Defendants] supported with proper doc umentation proof. 

 We are c onfident that the above arrangement will be benefic ial to all parties involved. 

and a subsequent letter from the plaintiffs signed by its exec utive direc tor Alan Tee Wee Loong (“Alan 

Tee”) to the defendants dated 31 May 2005 [note: 9] whic h dealt with a spec ific c laim, but c ontained the following important passage: 

 Contrary to what was previously agreed at the beginning of our working relationship, we note that it has been a long while sinc e we are c onsulted c onc erning the progress of any files. This has left us in the dark as to what has happened to the many repair c laims. 

The earlier letter was written while the working relationship between the parties was ongoing, while the sec ond letter was written after that was terminated. 

21     The first letter was written in April 2003, more than a year after the defendants c eased to c onsult the plaintiffs and seek their approvals for settlements but while the c ontrac tual relationship was c ontinuing. An agreement on the c onsultation and approval would be a signific ant aspec t on the working relationship between the parties and it would be reasonable to expec t the plaintiffs to bring it up in their letter. Even if the plaintiffs were c onc erned about straining the working relationship with allegations of breac h of duty, a polite reminder of the agreed arrangement c ould have been made, but there was no referenc e to it in the letter. 

22     After the working relationship was terminated on 30 September 2003, Alan Tee c omplained to the defendants in the sec ond letter of 31 May 2005 that the plaintiffs had not been c onsulted, but there was no c omplaint that their approvals were not sought. There was no reason for further restraint at this time. 

**The legal principles applicable on the finding of implied terms** 

23     The plaintiffs submitted that: 

 In relation to implied terms, a term will be implied in a c ontrac t if it is nec essary in the business sense to give effic ac y to the c ontrac t i.e. if it is so obvious that it goes without saying. [note: 10] 

and c ited two c ases, _Reigate v Union Manufacturing Co (Ramsbottom)_ [1918] 1 KB 592 and _Forefront_ 


_Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 927</span> in support. 

24     The former c ase is authority for the business effic ac y test as explained by Sc rutton LJ at p 605: 

 A term c an only be implied if it is nec essary in the business sense to give effic ac y to the c ontrac t; that is, if it is suc h a term that it c an c onfidently be said that if at the time the c ontrac t was being negotiated some one had said to the parties, "What will happen in suc h a c ase," they would both have replied, "Of c ourse, so and so will happen; we did not trouble to say that; it is too c lear." Unless the Court c omes to some suc h c onc lusion as that, it ought not to imply a term whic h the parties themselves have not expressed. 

and in the latter c ase, Andrew Phang Boon Leong J disc ussed the rationale for the business effic ac y test and the offic ious bystander test set out by Mac Kinnon LJ in _Shirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926) Limited_ [1939] 2 KB 206 at 227: 

 Prima fac ie that whic h in any c ontrac t is left to be implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes without saying; so that, if, while the parties were making their bargain, an offic ious bystander were to suggest some express provision for it in their agreement, they would testily suppress him with a c ommon ‘Oh, of c ourse!’ 

and c onc luded that the two tests are c omplementary test. Both tests would apply to a business c ontrac t but the first test would not apply to non-business c ontrac ts where the issue of business effic ac y does not arise and only the offic ious bystander test will apply. 

25     The agreement between the parties was a business agreement. Applying the tests to the fac ts, it is quite c lear that the plaintiffs’ approval of settlements was not nec essary to give effic ac y to the agreement between the parties. To the c ontrary, suc h a requirement c an be abused by the plaintiffs to withhold their approval for settlements to avoid making c lawbac k payments to the defendants. An offic ious bystander will not say that the plaintiffs must have a veto power over the settlement of c laims. 

26     The argument that the defendants should c onsult the plaintiffs on settlements was not without basis. In a situation where the defendants were obliged to use proper efforts and diligenc e in dealing with c laims, and where there was no nec essity for them to seek the plaintiffs’ approval on settlements, the plaintiffs would not be unreasonable to want to be c onsulted. However, when the plaintiffs did not insist on an express term for this, they had to satisfy the business effic ac y test and the offic ious bystander test, and they have failed to do that, partic ularly when there was an implied term that the defendants were to use reasonable c are and due diligenc e in settling the c laims. 

27     The plaintiffs alleged that it was implied that the defendants would use reasonable efforts and due diligenc e in settling the c laims. The balanc e tilted in favour of suc h an implied term as the defendants were entitled to rec over shortfalls in settlements from the plaintiffs. It was essential to the plaintiffs that the c laims were pursued properly and be settled on reasonable terms. As the handling of the c laims was left to the defendants, they should, by the business effic ac y and offic ious bystander tests, be obliged to exerc ise reasonable c are and diligenc e in settling the c laims. It is quite unthinkable that the defendants were entitled to deal with the c laims as they saw fit, and be allowed to rec laim the shortfalls from the plaintiffs. Indeed, while the defendants denied this implied term in their pleaded defenc e, their c ase at the trial was that they had dealt with the c laims and settlements properly. 

**Complaints over the handling of the claims** 


**Complaints over the handling of the claims** 

28     The plaintiffs alleged that: 

 (i) The Defendants had failed to c onsult them on settlements from 2002 onwards; 

 (ii) The Defendants’ debit notes lac ked suffic ient partic ulars to enable the Plaintiffs to identify in respec t of whic h vehic le/repair job they related to; 

 (iii) The Defendants did not provide suffic ient information relating to the settlement of c laims from 2002 onwards. [note: 11] 

29     Complaint (i) is disposed of by my finding that there was no implied term that the defendants were to c onsult the plaintiffs on the settlements. 

30     Complaints (ii) and (iii) related more to the manner in whic h the defendants made the c lawbac ks than to the manner in whic h they settled the c laims, but nevertheless it was relevant to the issue whether the defendants were entitled to make the c lawbac ks. 

31     The plaintiffs c omplained that the debit notes did not c ontain their invoic e numbers, the defendants’ work order numbers, the dates of the ac c ident and the dates of the repairs, whic h were needed for the plaintiffs to matc h the debit notes to the invoic es. The plaintiffs disputed the debit 

notes’ validity bec ause they did not c ontain these partic ulars. [note: 12] 

32     This was a serious c omplaint. The amounts set off through the debit notes were substantial. As this was an ongoing proc ess, it would have been reasonable for the plaintiffs to raise the issue with the defendants as the amounts were set off. There were no rec ords of any request from the plaintiffs to the defendants for information on their debit notes. 

33     The defendants’ c ase was that the plaintiffs had the information. In an interesting development, the defendants c alled a former employee of the plaintiffs, Yeow Mey Hwa (“Yeow”) as their witness. 

34     Yeow’s evidenc e was that when she was employed by the plaintiffs as a Senior Ac c ounts Assistant, she worked out the figures in the debit notes the defendants issued. She rec eived the c laim file from the defendants’ c laims offic ers after a c laim was settled, and she worked out the figure 

to be c lawed bac k and a debit note for the figure would be raised by the defendants. [note: 13] She also desc ribed how the defendants’ payments were made: 

 The Defendants’ c heque payments on the invoic es raised by the Plaintiffs would normally be attac hed to their Payment Vouc her whic h set out a list of the invoic es being settled and a list of the Debit notes whic h the Defendants were using to set off the total sum of those invoic es. The time taken by the Defendants to issue their Payment vouc her utilizing the newly raised Debit notes to set off the Plaintiffs’ invoic es would be about two to three months. The reason for this is bec ause the Defendants were usually prompt in making their payments. For example, if the Defendants issued their Payment Vouc her in Marc h for invoic es raised by the Plaintiffs in February, the Defendants would utilize the Debit notes raised in January to set off the February invoic es. [note: 14] 

35     She added that: 


 [T]o the best of my knowledge and belief, the Plaintiffs did not during my tenure as their Senior Ac c ounts Assistant raise any questions, or objec tions to the following, or any of them, namely: 

 (a) my rec overy sum, Debit and Credit note c alc ulations; 

 (b) the Debit notes issued by the Defendants whic h were based on my c alc ulations; and/or 

 (c ) the Defendants utilizing all relevant Debit notes to set off against the Plaintiffs invoic es. [note: 15] 

36     Yeow’s evidenc e was c orroborated by Chong Lye Peng Jenny, the defendants’ former Ac c ounts Offic er who deposed in her affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief that the defendants’ payment system was c onverted from a manual system to an elec tronic system in February 2002. After the c hange, the defendants’ payment was made by a payment advic e with brief details on the amount to be paid, the invoic e number and invoic e date, as well as the defendants’ c heque, whic h c an be torn off from the payment advic e slip, and the payment advic e slip would normally have an attac hed listing of the plaintiffs’ invoic es and the defendants’ debit notes. 

37     The plaintiffs, on the other hand, relied on the evidenc e of their former employee Lee Cheng Hai (“Lee”) whose evidenc e was that the defendants’ c heques were issued with no ac c ompanying doc uments. Lee’s dealings with the doc uments were limited. He was not engaged in the financ e or ac c ounting workings of the plaintiffs. His role was to c ollec t doc uments from the defendants and he did not c hec k or make a rec ord of the doc uments he rec eived from the defendants and handed to the other employees of the plaintiffs. Consequently, the relianc e that should be plac ed on his evidenc e must be c orrespondingly limited. 

38     There was more reliable evidenc e from other witnesses of the plaintiffs on the doc uments. The first of these witnesses was Bob Yap Cheng Ghee of KPMG Forensic whic h was engaged by the plaintiffs to establish the amount of the unpaid invoic es of the plaintiffs. In the c ourse of his work, he had gone through the plaintiffs’ rec ords, and he c onfirmed that he had seen the defendants’ payment 

vouc hers with attac hments. [note: 16] 

39     The sec ond witness, Caroline Tan Shirui (“Caroline Tan”), manager of the plaintiffs, agreed that some of the defendants’ debit notes c ame with attac hments whic h showed the invoic es that were set 

off, [note: 17] although she maintained some other debit notes were without attac hments. 

40     In addition to these witnesses’ evidenc e, there was doc umentary evidenc e. There were monthly statements of ac c ounts whic h the defendants brought into the proc eedings. They c laimed to have rec eived the statements, whic h listed the plaintiffs’ unpaid invoic es, from the plaintiffs, and Yeow c onfirmed that she had generated suc h statements when she was in the plaintiffs’ employ. 

41     The plaintiffs denied that the statements were their statements, and c laimed that they had not authorised the statements to be sent to the defendants. That was a very late denial. The plaintiffs were informed by the defendants of these statements of ac c ounts when the defendants made disc overy of them in their first List of Doc uments and third Supplementary List of Doc uments whic h were filed before the c ommenc ement of the trial. The plaintiffs did not raise any objec tions to them on either oc c asion, and were deemed to have admitted the authentic ity of the statements under O 27 r 4 of the Rules of Court. In their c losing submissions, the plaintiffs argued that: 

 [T]he [Statements of Ac c ounts] were only produc ed during the c ourse of the proc eedings. This is 


 despite the fac t that a disc overy order was made against the Defendants. [note: 18] 

without explaining why they did not objec t to them when they rec eived them within the time allowed by the rule. 

42     There was evidenc e that the plaintiffs knew that the statements were issued. First, there was an exc hange of emails between Don Tay Boon Kim (“Don Tay”) and Shirley Yeo Poh Choo (“Shirley Yeo”). The former was a former ac c ounts assistant of Auto Ventures Pte Ltd, an assoc iate c ompany of the plaintiffs, while the latter was a senior ac c ounts offic er of the defendants. Shirley Yeo filed an affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief where she exhibited an exc hange of emails between her and Don Tay. [note: 19] In one message Don Tay sent to Shirley Yeo a statement of ac c ount, and in her email to 

Don Tay, Shirley Yeo requested Don Tay to make a c orrec tion to the statement. The requested c orrec tion was noted on one of the statements the defendants disc losed in the c ourse of disc overy. [note: 20] While Don Tay maintained that he did not deal with the ac c ounts of the plaintiffs, he 

c onc eded that he c ould have assisted the ac c ounting staff of the plaintiffs to send the statements of ac c ounts to the defendants. 

43     The defendants also produc ed an exc hange of emails [note: 21] between Pang Yee Li (“Pang”) who was a Financ e Exec utive of Auto Ventures (Asia) Pte Ltd and Shirley Yeo whic h referred to a statement of ac c ount whic h Shirley Yeo deposed was that it was a statement of ac c ount of the plaintiffs. Pang disputed that and c laimed she had never dealt with the plaintiffs’ ac c ounts, but she was c ontradic ted by the evidenc e of Alan Tee and Caroline Tan that she was involved with the plaintiffs’ ac c ounts. 

44     On the evidenc e, while the debit notes themselves did not c ontain partic ulars for the plaintiffs to identify the vehic les and repairs they related to, the plaintiffs had that information bec ause the defendants had forwarded the c laim files to Yeow, the information was supplied together with the defendants’ payment c heques, and the plaintiffs’ statement of ac c ounts showed that they knew whic h of their invoic es had remained unpaid. 

**The defendants’ handling of the claims** 

45     The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had not exerc ised diligenc e in handling the c laims. As it has been established that there was a c ontrac tual term to use reasonable efforts and diligenc e, the defendants were indeed obliged to do that. 

46     The plaintiffs’ allegation of negligenc e was made in September 2007 when the statement of c laim was amended for the first time. The evidenc e of negligenc e that the plaintiffs relied on at the trial was not in existenc e then. The evidenc e c ame later in the form of a report by David Poon Soon Cheong (“Poon”), a Senior Exec utive of the plaintiffs with experienc e in motor ac c ident c laims. He was instruc ted in early 2008 to inspec t thousands of the defendants’ c laim files. His brief was, in his words, “to highlight any instanc es of negligenc e”. He deposed in his first affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief 

that he “personally went through eac h of the files and looked through eac h of them” [note: 22] and submitted and undated report of his findings whic h did not indic ate how the c laims should have been settled in his view. 

47     Poon deposed a supplementary affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief in whic h he revised the level of his personal involvement in examining the files. He c larified that “a team of assistants supervised by me reviewed and rec orded the c ontents of eac h of the said files” and “I then reviewed eac h c laim file 

together with the c laim form to c onfirm that the c ontents were c orrec tly rec orded”. [note: 23] 


### Q A Q A Q A 

 Court: 

 Witness: 

48     A few observations and c omments in the review proc ess are apposite. First, it appears that the plaintiffs had alleged negligenc e against the defendants even before the files were reviewed and the report was c ompiled. Sec ond, it would be preferable that the review and report be done or verified by independent persons rather than the plaintiffs’ employees. Third, the review proc ess did not inc lude seeking c larific ations, where possible, from the defendants’ c laim offic ers, witnesses and the parties and the lawyers the defendants engaged. There are numerous fac tors that c an affec t the settlement of a motor ac c ident c laim inc luding the availability and quality of evidenc e, the size of the c laim, the time and legal c osts that may have to be inc urred, and the advic e of lawyers. It is not suffic ient for someone to look through a file and make a finding without seeking any c larific ation or explanation. 

49     When Poon was examined by c ounsel for the defendants, he c larified that about 2000 c laim files were reviewed, out of whic h 924 files were pic ked out in his report. It was unc lear who had selec ted the 924 files. He admitted during c ross-examination that he did not go through every one of the files 

himself, [note: 24] then he c hanged position and said that he selec ted the files. [note: 25] 

50     The basis for the selec tion of the files was also unsatisfac tory. When c ounsel took him through one of the files that were pic ked up, whic h Poon had made a note that the settlement was “OK in 

view that liability was not c lear-c ut”. [note: 26] His reason for listing this was a negligent settlement 

was that “[t]hey c ould have settled on a higher perc entage”. [note: 27] 

51     Other disc losures followed after c ounsel went through more files with him: 

 ... So now we are --and this is your report on negligent handling of c ases, c orrec t? Then we have seen that ac tually, it refers to c ases whic h you now say are not negligent. 

 Yes. 

 So why you go and put non-negligent, okay c ases under a negligent --under a list of negligent c ases? 

 As I’ve said, at the time of signing the affidavit, I must admit I did not go through everyone of it under the exhibition, the annex 2. 

 It’s not the affidavit anymore, you know. It’s the report, the report itself. 

 Yah, c orrec t, I did not go through everyone of it. [note: 28] 

and: 

 [H]ow did inc orrec t c ases get to be inside your report ac tually? You know, how did the okay c ases get to be inc luded in your report? 

 I suppose the person who selec t this one. [note: 29] 

whic h diminished the c redibility of the whole review proc ess and his report. 

52     The defendants’ reply to Poon’s report was in the form of a report by Foo See Tiong (“Foo”), a divisional Vic e President of the defendants on 50 of the files pic ked up by Poon. 


53     He was not qualified to undertake that task. By his own admission, he was not an expert on c laims as he had no experienc e in dealing with them. After hearing his evidenc e, I find that he was no better a witness than Poon and his evidenc e was not helpful to the defendants’ c ase. 

54     Ultimately, was the allegation of negligenc e made out? The burden of proof was on the plaintiffs. They alleged negligenc e even before they inspec ted the c laim files, then they assigned Poon, their employee to undertake the task. Although he presented a report, it was an unsatisfac tory report for the reasons I have mentioned. My c onc lusion is that the allegation was not proved. 

**The plaintiffs’ claim of late payment of their invoices** 

55     The plaintiffs had pleaded that the agreement spec ific ally provided that the plaintiffs’ invoic es were to be paid in 30 days. 

56     Moving on, the plaintiffs referred to an internal memorandum from Foo to the defendants’ CEO 

dated 21 May 2003 [note: 30] that: 

 1.2 Based on the ac c ident c laims rec overy status report in April 03 ... the rec overy rate of the outstanding c ases was slow. There was little or no progress made to those c ases from the years 1997 to 1999. 

 ... 

 2.1 [The Defendants] undertook all the taxi ac c ident repairs and insuranc e c laims from CityCab from Sep 97 to Aug 01 and sub-c ontrac ted the projec t to [the Plaintiffs]. The arrangement of the billing was suc h that [the Plaintiffs] and [the Defendants] would rec eive 80% and 20% of the repair bill respec tively. [the Defendants] paid [the Plaintiffs] 80% of the repair bills onc e the repair jobs were c ompleted. In other words, [the Defendants] is the c reditor of $2.86 million. In an event of disc repanc y between the c laims and final settlement bill, the differenc e would be shared in a similar proportion by [the Plaintiffs] and [the Defendants] respec tively, i.e. 80% and 20%. 

 ... 

 5.1 [The Defendants] is the c reditor of the outstanding c laims i.e. about $2.73 million as at 1 April 2003. If the c laims are not rec overed or fully rec overed, [the Defendants] has to seek refunds, to make up for the differenc e from the c ontrac tor, [the Plaintiffs]. As the outstanding c laims have been long overdue and unable to be unsettled with the third-party insuranc e c ompanies, the quantum of rec overy would not be high. On an average, it may be as low as 40%. Based on this assumption [the Plaintiffs] will have to refund [the Defendants] a sum of $1. million. Therefore, I suggest [the Defendants] continues to withhold the $1.7 million payments due to [the Plaintiffs]. 

 [emphasis added] 

57     Foo admitted during c ross-examination that the payments were held bac k. [note: 31] He tried to justify that on the basis that the defendants “followed ... c ommerc ial prac tic e, we are in business”, [note: 32] but ac c epted upon further questioning that “c ommerc ial prac tic e” does not override 

c ontrac tual obligations. [note: 33] 


58     There was _prima facie_ evidenc e the defendants had held bac k and were c ontinuing to hold bac k payment of the plaintiffs’ invoic es beyond the 30-day period, but the defendants objec ted that there was no c laim for this. The defendants also c ontended that even if there was a proper c laim for late payment of the invoic es, the c laim was not made out, the memorandum and Foo’s admission notwithstanding. 

59     The plaintiffs’ response was that their c ase “at the beginning of these proc eedings was that the Defendants were in breac h of c ontrac t in that they had wrongfully withheld payments due to the 

Plaintiffs.” [note: 34] 

60     A reading of the statement of c laim whic h was amended twic e shows that it was pleaded that it was an express term of the agreement that the defendants were to pay to the plaintiffs’ invoic es within 30 days. However, while that was stated as a term of the c ontrac t (together with the alleged implied terms), there was no assertion that this term was breac hed by the defendants, whereas breac hes of the alleged implied terms were spelt out. This omission was not c onfined to the statement of c laim, but has also c arried over to the plaintiffs’ opening statement. It c annot be said in the c irc umstanc es that this c laim was a part of the plaintiffs’ c ase at the beginning of the proc eedings. The plaintiffs’ pleaded c ase and the reliefs they sought related to the alleged implied terms only. I therefore rule that this c laim falls outside the plaintiffs’ c ase. 

**The plaintiffs’ claim for $11,053.24 for unpaid invoices** 

61     The plaintiffs initially c laimed payment for 31 invoic es. The defendants denied liability on the invoic es. The defendants’ Assistant Vic e President of Corporate Financ e, Lim Ai Choo (“Lim”) went through the c laims for the 31 invoic es and filed an affidavit in whic h she set her findings on the 

invoic es. [note: 35] 

62     During the trial, the plaintiffs’ witness, Caroline Tan was c ross-examined at length on them and 

this was referred to in the defendants’ c losing submissions. [note: 36] At the c lose of the c ase, the 

plaintiffs reduc ed this c laim to 15 invoic es totalling $11,053.24 [note: 37] and they responded to Lim’s 

findings on those 15 invoic es in their c losing submissions. [note: 38] 

63     The objec tions taken by the defendants to the invoic es were that they were, _inter alia_ , 

 (a) already paid; 

 (b) not payable following the re-c lassific ation of the c laim; 

 (c ) issued twic e for the same repairs; 

 (d) raised for work c ontrac ted to another c ompany, City Auto Testing Centre; 

 (e) not related to repair works and were not c overed under the agreement between the parties (eg, towing c harges, refuse disposal c harges, photoc opying c harges); 

 (f) issued to another c ompany, SBS Bus Servic es; and 

 (g) time-barred. 

64     I rejec t the plaintiffs’ c laim on the 15 invoic es. I will not repeat the arguments and c ounter


arguments made in the submissions. On the fac tual aspec ts of the disputed matters, I agree with the positions of the defendants. I will add that on the c laims for towing, refuse disposal and photoc opying c harges, there was no assertion that there was any express or implied term that the defendants were to pay for them. These appear to be expenses inc urred in the repairing proc ess and the making of c laims, whic h were matters within the plaintiffs’ responsibility, and should be borne by them. 

65     On the issue of time-bar, the plaintiffs had c ontended that: 

 [T]here was a running ac c ount between the parties and it was understood that the balanc e would be settled within 3 months of the termination of the c ontrac tual arrangement between the parties. The allegation of time-bar is therefore not a good defenc e. [note: 39] 

Nothing more was stated of the running ac c ount. Lord Pearson had made c lear in the dec ision of the Privy Counc il in _Bajaj Textiles Ltd v Gian Singh & Co Ltd_ [1971] 2 MLJ 133 at 135 that: 

 [A] c laim on a running ac c ount would be insuffic ient as a matter of pleading unless partic ulars were given either of an ac c ount stated (the parties having agreed the amount outstanding) or of the mutual transac tions from whic h the outstanding balanc e arose. 

The plaintiffs had not provided any partic ulars of the running ac c ounts that they were referring to, and there was no assertion or evidenc e that the invoic es in question formed part of the ac c ounts and were ac c epted by the defendants. The plaintiffs’ relianc e on the running ac c ount was unfounded. 

**Conclusion** 

66     The plaintiffs’ c laims against the defendants are dismissed, and I will hear the parties on the question of c osts.
