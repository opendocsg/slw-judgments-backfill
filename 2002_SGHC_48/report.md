## Judgment 

### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

**The Charge** 

1\. The Ac c used was originally c harged with murder. Before the trial c ommenc ed, the Prosec ution tendered an amended c harge whic h reads as follows : 

 "That you, SIVARAMAN REDDY SIVAKUMAR 

 on or about the 29th day of September 2001, between 12.00 p.m. and 1.45 p.m., at Blk 12 Pine Close #12-87, Singapore, did c ommit c ulpable homic ide not amounting to murder by c ausing the death of one Charulatha d/o Kuppusamy Raman, to wit, by stabbing her in the abdomen with a knife, whic h ac t was done with the intention of c ausing suc h bodily injury as is likely to c ause death, and you have thereby c ommitted an offenc e punishable under sec tion 304(a) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. 

The Ac c used pleaded guilty to the above c harge. Sec tion 304 (a) Penal Code provides for imprisonment for life or for up to 10 years. The Ac c used may also be subjec t to a fine or to c aning. 

**The Statement of Facts** 

2\. The Ac c used admitted all the fac ts set out below : 

 " Background 

 1 The informant is Corporal Riduan Bin Raja Maric an of Tan Toc k Seng Hospital Polic e Post (TTSH). 

 2 The dec eased is Charulatha D/O Kuppusamy Raman, female, 30 years old, NRIC No: S-7120039F. Before her death, she was a c ustomer servic e offic er with Qantas Airways. 

 3 The ac c used is Sivaraman Reddy Sivakumar, male, 26 years old, Indian National, Passport number: A-8911944. Ac c used is in Singapore on a soc ial visit pass. The Dec eased and ac c used were married. They have a 1 year old baby 


boy. 

4       On 29 Sep 01 at about 3.40 pm, Corporal Riduan who was then on duty at the Tan Toc k Seng Hospital (TTSH) Polic e Post, was informed by staff nurse Bavani that the dec eased, had died from stab wounds. Dec eased was pronounc ed dead at 2.37 pm. 

_Investigations_ 

5       Sergeant Azam from Tanglin Polic e Division was at TTSH c onduc ting investigations into another c ase when he rec eived the information on the death of dec eased. He c onduc ted preliminary investigations. 

6       Sergeant Azam interviewed the ac c used person at the waiting area of the hospital. The ac c used stated that the dec eased was his wife and they stayed at Blk 12, #12-87, Pine Close. On 29 Sep 2001, at about 12.00 – 1.45 pm, he had a dispute with the dec eased over her desire to meet her mother and staying at her grandmother’s house at No: 10B Jubilee Road for the night. 

7       The ac c used c laimed that the dec eased had stabbed herself onc e on the stomac h when the ac c used refused to allow her to leave the house. After the de c e ase d c ollapsed, the ac c used pulled the knife out of the dec eased’s abdomen. He broke the knife and washed his hands and the knife over the kitc hen sink. Ac c used then threw the knife into a rubbish bag loc ated in the kitc hen. The ac c used then sent the dec eased to Tan Toc k Seng Hospital. 

8       SIO Patric k Lim, from Bedok Polic e Division, took over investigations from Sergeant Azam. He went to the residenc e of dec eased and ac c used and entered the unit #12-87, Pine Close. He found a few droplets of blood on the floor near the entranc e leading into the kitc hen. 2 handbags and 1 plastic bag c ontaining c ostume jewelry belonging to the dec eased were found on the floor in the living room. Some c ast-off droplets of blood were found on the wall of the living room adjac ent to the handbags. A kitc hen knife with a broken blade used in the stabbing was found in a rubbish bag inside the kitc hen. 

9       There was no evidenc e to suggest that a violent struggle had taken plac e. The immediate neighbours were questioned and they did not hear any c ommotion c oming from the unit at about the time of inc ident. 

_Autopsy Report, Annex A_ 

10     On 30 Sep 2001 at about 9.00 am, the forensic pathologist, Dr Wee Keng Poh, c onduc ted a post-mortem on the dec eased. He found that the dec eased had suffered two stab wounds, one at the lower abdomen with a 2.5 c m c ut and had a penetrating-depth of 13 c m. The other stab wound was near the rib-c age with a 2 c m c ut and a penetrating-depth of 9 c m. Besides the 2 stab wounds, the dec eased had a ‘defenc e injury’ in the form of a bruise on her left had. 

11     Dr Wee was of the opinion that 2 injuries were suffic ient to have c aused the death of the dec eased in the ordinary c ourse of nature as the 2 stab-wound were inflic ted on a vital area of the body – the abdomen. He c ertified the c ause 


of death was hemorrhage due to stab wounds of the abdomen. Dr Wee opined that eac h of the stab wounds was fatal. 

12     Dr Wee opined that that 2 stab wounds c ould not have been self-inflic ted. There were no "hesitation-c uts" found on the skin whic h are c harac teristic of a self-inflic ted stab wound. He found that the stab wounds were made deliberately by someone intent to c ause harm to the dec eased. In addition, the c lothing that the dec eased was wearing at the time of the inc ident usually would not have any stab tears if these wounds were self inflic ted. He was of the opinion that a person intent on c ommitting suic ide by self-stabbing would bare that area of his body that he intends to inflic t the injury. 

13     Dr Wee also opined that it is not likely that two fatal abdominal stab wounds with a single defensive injury (bruise) over the left arm were c aused in the c ourse of a struggle. Considering the totality of the c irc umstanc es, Dr Wee is of t he opinion that it may be possible for one stab wound to be c aused in the c ourse of a struggle, but not two stab wounds. One stab wound would have inc apac itated the dec eased bec ause of the pain and blood loss that there will not be any further need for the assailant to c ontinue to struggle to "take c ontrol of the knife" and further inflic t the sec ond stab wound. 

14     The ac c used had maintained that the dec eased had stabbed herself not onc e but twic e with the kitc hen knife with a blade measuring 20.2 c m. When told of the autopsy findings, the ac c used admitted that he had stabbed his wife twic e. 

_Circumstances Leading To Death_ 

15     On 29 Sep 2001, both the ac c used and dec eased woke up at about 11. am. A while later, dec eased rec eived a phone c all from her mother. They were to meet up at Serangoon Road at about 1-1.30 pm for the dec eased to buy a gold ‘thali’ (worn on the nec k) representing that the dec eased is married. 

16     After the phone c onversation, dec eased dressed up in her uniform as she was working on the afternoon shift that day. Dec eased told ac c used that she was going to Serangoon Road to meet her mother before she goes to work. Upon hearing that, ac c used told her that he would c ome along with her to meet her mother. The request was refused by the dec eased. Ac c used insisted on c oming along sinc e he was alone in the house and he needed to pass time. 

17     An argument ensued and the ac c used refused to allow the dec eased to leave the house without him. Ac c used stood at the main door preventing the Dec eased from going out of the house. 

18     Ac c ording to the Ac c used, dec eased went to the kitc hen and reac hed for 2 knives from the knife-stand. She plac ed one of the knives near her throat. The Ac c used c laimed that the dec eased threatened to c ommit suic ide if the ac c used did not let her go. Ac c used c laimed that he relented to her demands. 

19     The dec eased went into the baby’s room and took a set of her c lothing from the baby’s play-pen and walked out of the room. She then plac ed the c lothes into her blue c oloured bag, whic h was on the floor in the living room. After 


 plac ing the c lothes in the bag, she c arried it together with her handbags and plastic bag. The ac c used asked the dec eased where she was going with the extra c lothes. She replied that she was going to Jubilee Road. The argument c ontinued. 

 20 The ac c used got hold of dec eased’s left hand whic h was holding the knife, with his right hand, to grab the knife away from her by pulling it towards him. While snatc hing the knife away, the ac c used stabbed the dec eased on her stomac h. He then withdrew the blade from the dec eased’s stomac h and stabbed her a sec ond time. The dec eased c ollapsed. The ac c used had deliberately inflic ted both stab wounds on the abdomen and whic h ac t was done with the intention of c ausing suc h bodily injury as is likely to c ause the death of his wife. 

 21 The ac c used pulled the knife out from the dec eased’s stomac h with his hands. He broke the knife. When he notic ed that his hands were stained with blood, he ran to the sink and washed his hands together with the broken knife. Thereafter, he dropped the broken knife into the rubbish bag. 

 History Between Deceased and Accused 

 22 The ac c used and dec eased were married sometime in 2000. They registered their marriage in Mar 2000 at the Registry of Marriages, in Singapore. Sinc e then, the ac c used stayed at No. 10B Julibee Road. Ac c used was not able to get an employment pass to work in Singapore. The ac c used has been renewing his soc ial visit status sinc e his arrival in Singapore until the inc ident. The dec eased supported him financ ially. 

 23 Soon after marriage, they had frequent quarrels over domestic problems. Disagreements with their parents and parents in law and family members staying in the house at Jubilee Road, strained their relationship further. There was one prior inc ident of assault of the dec eased by ac c used when dec eased was found with a swollen c heek. 

 24 On 2 Dec 2000, dec eased gave birth to their son. The birth of their son, elevated the mood of the dec eased and she was extremely happy. However, the relationship with ac c used deteriorated. 

 25 To save their marriage and for the sake of their son, the dec eased bought a 3-room resale flat at Blk 12 Pine Close #12-87 for them to stay together. They had just moved into Pine Close a week before the dec eased met her death. 

**Antecedents** 

3\. The Ac c used had a c lean rec ord before this c ase. 

**The Mitigation Plea** 

4\. The Ac c used is 26 years old and was born and brought up in India. His father abandoned the family of 3 c hildren when the Ac c used was 5 years old and they were brought up by the mother, a woman 


steeped in tradition. His mother had regular prayer meetings in Singapore and the dec eased got to know her through her aunt. 

5\. The dec eased was very depressed by a failed relationship and her thyroid disorder at that time and turned to the Ac c used’s mother for advic e and spiritual guidanc e. She was advised to seek medic al treatment in India. 

6\. On one suc h visit, the dec eased got to know the Ac c used and their relationship developed to the extent that they dec ided to get married. His mother disapproved of the proposed marriage as the dec eased was several years older than the Ac c used and bec ause she felt that the dec eased might not fit into their c ulture and tradition. Despite this, the c ouple registered their marriage in Singapore on 9 Mar 2000. 

7\. Subsequently, they informed the Ac c used’s mother that they wished to hold their c ustomary wedding in May 2000. When the mother found out that the dec eased was pregnant, she advised them against going through the c ustomary rites during their wedding. However, the Ac c used went along with the wishes of the dec eased to c arry out the c ustomary rites. As a result, the Ac c used’s mother refused to attend the wedding on 15 May 2000. 

8\. After the wedding, the c ouple moved into the house of the dec eased’s unc le and her grandmother at 10B Jubilee Road as they had no home of their own. The dec eased’s unc les and their families were already living there. 

9\. The Ac c used remained unemployed as he was unable to obtain an Employment Pass to work here. He had been working in the State Bank of India and was in c harge of sales, being the top performer for 1999, before he resigned in Dec ember that year to join the dec eased in their new life in Singapore. He was undergoing a c ourse of study leading to a Bac helor of Business Administration degree but did not c omplete it. He arrived here in Feb 2000 and has remained here on a soc ial visit pass sinc e then, save for a period of about one month when he returned to India. 

10\. The members of the dec eased’s extended family in 10B Jubilee Road did not treat the Ac c used too kindly. They were unhappy that they had to vac ate one room for the c ouple to live in. They ridic uled, taunted, humiliated and embarrassed him, reminding him c onstantly of his inability to find work. His oc c asional verbal retaliation to their remarks c reated problems in the relationship between him and his wife. 

11\. The Ac c used loved his wife dearly, preparing meals for her, ac c ompanying her to the bus stop when she left for work and waiting for her return to have their meals together. He made sure she took her presc ribed medic ation. During her pregnanc y, he also ensured that she had a c up of milk daily as advised by the doc tor. On one oc c asion when she refused to take the milk and threw it away, the Ac c used bec ame angry and slapped her onc e. That was the only time he had laid hands on her. 

12\. When their son was born on 2 Dec 2000, the Ac c used and his wife were overjoyed. However, the members of his wife’s family took c ontrol of the c hild and gave the Ac c used hardly any time to be alone with his son. When his wife told him she would be sending their son to join her parents, who have emigrated to Australia, he was not happy with the arrangement but relented for the sake of the son. 

13\. In April 2001, the Ac c used was assaulted by his wife’s father at a bus stop. He had to seek medic al attention as a result of that inc ident. He produc ed a medic al report in support of this allegation. 


14\. Things got so bad that the Ac c used dec ided to leave 10B Jubilee Road in May or June 2001. He went to stay with his friends, returning c onstantly to visit his young son. When he tried to explain his diffic ult position to the members of the dec eased’s family by way of a letter, they were deeply offended by it and an aunt rubbed the letter on his fac e, tore it into piec es and threw them at his fac e. 

15\. All these eventually led to the purc hase of the flat at Pine Close. A housewarming c eremony was held on 12 Sep 2001 and the c ouple moved into their new home about a week later. 

16\. On 29 Sep 2001, the Ac c used wanted to ac c ompany the dec eased to meet her mother at Serangoon Road so that he c ould explain to her their marital problems. He hoped that her mother would then advise her to go for c ounselling and to take her medic ation regularly. A bitter quarrel took plac e when she vehemently refused to allow him to ac c ompany her. She also wanted to stay at 10B Jubilee Road that night and the Ac c used was c onc erned that would give the wrong impression to her family members that they were having marital problems. The quarrel bec ame physic al when she sc ratc hed and hit him. He was then c lad in a towel only and allowed her to sc ratc h him without resisting. She took the knife and threatened to get him into trouble by hurting herself. She abused him physic ally and verbally and his pent up frustrations began to work on him when the dec eased raised the old family issues again. 

17\. The Ac c used’s main c onc ern was to take the knife away from the dec eased who was behaving erratic ally. However, this resulted in a struggle and he stabbed her twic e. 

18\. Immediately after the stabbing, the Ac c used c ame to his senses and c ried out in despair in Tamil, " Latha, this thing has happened to us ". He then sought frantic ally to bring her to a doc tor. Forgetting to even put on his footwear or c losing the door to the flat, he c arried his badly hurt wife into the lift and brought her downstairs. He asked someone to c all for an ambulanc e but when he saw a c ar passing by, he pleaded with the driver to send him and his wife to the nearest doc tor. The driver kindly agreed to do so. 

19\. During the journey in the c ar, he held on to his weakening wife, kept talking to her and praying for her. His wife asked him to hold her tightly. He also performed mouth-to-mouth resusc itation and pounded her c hest when she lost c onsc iousness. 

20\. Counsel for the Ac c used also tendered a report by Dr Lim Yun Chin, a psyc hiatrist in private prac tic e who is also a Visiting Consultant in the Singapore General Hospital and the Institute of Mental Health. After interviewing the Ac c used on 7 Mar 2002, during whic h essentially the same matters mentioned in the mitigation plea were rec ounted, Dr Lim opined that " _there was a rapid building up of intense anxiety and fear when he saw his wife brandishing the knife. He was acutely aware of his wife’s propensity to harm herself, given her unpredictable outburst and his paramount concern was to snatch the knife away from her. However, when he felt the searing pain from the cut inflicted by her actions and she showed no remorse, he began to feel the surge of anger and rage towards her"._ 

21\. Dr Lim went on to explain that when a person was hurt or injured physic ally or emotionally, it was a very primal emotional response to feel angry and that this c ould lead to a sudden surge of aggression, even for a mild-mannered person. He was also of the opinion that the Ac c used’s behaviour after the stabbing suggested intense remorse following the abatement of the anger, fear and anxiety. 

22\. The psyc hiatrist also perused the medic al reports on the dec eased made in Feb 1996, Aug 1998 and Jun 1999 and stated that the thyroid disorder diagnosed in 1998 and the other auto-immune 


diseases that the dec eased c ould have been suffering from were often assoc iated with mental instability inc luding depression and irritability. Her own doc tor reported in 1998 that she was "feeling unstable". Dr Lim added an opinion that the dec eased was prone to mental instability due to her thyroid illness but, upon objec tion by the Prosec ution, Defenc e Counsel agreed that that opinion should be deleted. 

23\. Finally, the Ac c used pleaded for lenienc y and c ompassion to be shown by the Court. It was submitted, on the authority of _PP v Tan Kei Loon Allan <span class="citation">[1999] 2 SLR 288</span>_ that life imprisonment was not an appropriate sentenc e in this c ase. 

**The Prosecution’s Response** 

24\. The Prosec ution objec ted to the admissibility of the psyc hiatric report insofar as it related to the dec eased as Dr Lim was attempting to do a psyc hologic al autopsy on her state of mind. Two authorities were c ited to support the objec tion against admissibility – _R v Gilfoyle [2001] 2 Cr App Rep 57_ and _Teh Thiam Huat v PP <span class="citation">[1996] 3 SLR 621</span>._ In any event, the Prosec ution argued, the autopsy report dated 30 Sep 2001 on the dec eased indic ated that her thyroid appeared normal. 

**The Sentence** 

25\. I will first deal with the legal issue raised by the Prosec ution that, on the authority of the c ases c ited, the psyc hiatrist’s report here is inadmissible. I do not think _R v Gilfoyle_ went so far as to hold that a medic al expert who has not interviewed a subjec t c annot give an expert opinion on his c ondition. That c ase was c onc erned with the admission of further evidenc e after trial and the psyc hologist’s reports were held to have failed to identify any c riteria by whic h the Court there c ould test the quality of his opinions. The applic ation to admit further evidenc e was dismissed in any event as the Court of Appeal did not think that the jury would have returned a different verdic t even if the further evidenc e had been admitted. 

26\. As in _Teh Thiam Huat v PP,_ Dr Y C Lim’s report in our present c ase is admissible but it is at best a hypothesis based on past medic al reports c onc erning the dec eased and is therefore of not muc h assistanc e to the Court. In any event, as will bec ome apparent from the rest of my judgment, the question whether the dec eased had suic idal tendenc ies or not is quite immaterial to the fac ts of this c ase. 

27\. The only witness of the events leading to the fatal stabbing on 29 Sep 2001 is the Ac c used. Exc ept where admitted by the Prosec ution, the Court is not bound to ac c ept everything said in mitigation as the truth. The Court is entitled to test his ac c ount against the admitted fac ts and the objec tive evidenc e and to dec ide whether his version is inherently inc redible or self-c ontradic tory. 

28\. The matters pleaded by Defenc e Counsel show at best that the Ac c used was subjec t to oc c asional taunts and unc omplimentary remarks from the Dec eased’s family members. However, the Ac c used was not a poor, pitiful vic tim of c irc umstanc es. It appears that he was quite c apable of standing up for himself whenever the c irc umstanc es required him to do so. He was c apable of giving his wife a swollen c heek when he was angry. He is not an uneduc ated man. He is no stranger in this c ountry and neither is his mother. He also has friends here. 

29\. Even if all the things he alleges about the treatment he rec eived from the dec eased and her family are true, do they justify or mitigate his c onduc t on 29 Sep 2001 in the new matrimonial home? 


By then, he had already left 10B Jubilee Road sometime ago. He and his wife had a plac e of their own to c all home. The fac t that his wife wanted to go alone to Serangoon Road to meet her mother was of no great import and would c ertainly not c ause a man to fly into an implac able rage unless he is an extremely unreasonable and suspic ious sort of person and it is quite apparent from the events of that day that the Ac c used is indeed suc h a person. 

30\. Even if it were true that his wife had taken the knives from the kitc hen, she was not threatening to harm him with the knives in any way. The Statement of Fac ts and even the Ac c used’s statement to the psyc hiatrist (at paragraph 19 of the report) show that all the wife wanted to do was to get her c lothes and leave the flat. She was c learly not about to stab or slash him or herself. There was no reason at all for any fierc e struggle to take plac e unless the Ac c used was the aggressor. 

31\. How c ould a man who, a few moments earlier, stood submissively c lad in a towel while his wife c lawed feroc iously at his unprotec ted flesh suddenly bec ome so overc ome by anger and rage over a c ut inflic ted unintentionally in the c ourse of a struggle prec ipitated by himself that he would wrest the knife away and plunge it twic e into his wife’s abdomen? Why would a man determined to thwart any attempt at suic ide stab his wife not onc e but twic e in suc h a violent manner? The c hain of events points undoubtedly to the Ac c used being the aggressor on 29 Sep 2001. 

32\. I am also not c onvinc ed that he experienc ed ‘intense remorse’ after the stabbing. He was more fearful and anxious about the c onsequenc es of his ac tions than he was remorseful. This is shown by the fac t that he maintained that his wife had stabbed herself until c onfronted with the forensic report the next day. 

33\. The following are the mitigating fac tors in his favour : 

 (1) he pleaded guilty upon being offered the amended c harge ; (2) he had no c riminal rec ord ; and (3) he did try quite frantic ally to save his wife after the stabbing. 

34\. In the c irc umstanc es, I do not think life imprisonment is appropriate here. I sentenc e the Ac c used to 10 years’ imprisonment with effec t from 29 Sep 2001 and to rec eive 15 strokes of the c ane.
