## GROUNDS OF DECISION 

1       The tw o Originating Motions before me concern applications by tw o Queen’s Counsel for ad hoc admission to practise as advocates and solicitors in the High Court. The applicant in O.M. 600028/2002 is Mr. Martin Lee Chu Ming, Q.C. and in O.M. 600029/2002, Mr. W illiam Henric Nicholas, Q.C. They apply to be admitted to represent the defendant, Dr. Chee Soon Juan, in tw o actions in the High Court, viz. Suit No 1459/2001 in w hich the plaintiff is Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and Suit No 1460/2001 in w hich the plaintiff is Mr. Goh Chok Tong. Dr. Chee appeared before me to make the applications on behalf of Mr. Martin Lee and Mr. W illiam Nicholas. 

2       The applications are made under s 21 of the Legal Profession Act ("the Act") w hich provides as follow s: 

 (1) Notw ithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, the court may, for the purpose of any one case w here the court is satisfied that it is of sufficient difficulty and complexity and having regard to the circumstances of the case, admit to practise as an advocate and solicitor any person w ho 

 (a) holds Her Majestys Patent as Queens Counsel; 

 (b) does not ordinarily reside in Singapore or Malaysia but w ho has come or intends to come to Singapore for the purpose of appearing in the case; and 

 (c) has special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case. 

3       The law relating to admission under this provision is settled. The Court of Appeal held in _Price Arthur Leolin v A-G_ [1992] 2 SLR 972 that there is a three-stage test. This w as elaborated in _Re Caplan Jonathan Michael (No 2)_ [1998] 1 SLR 440, w here the Court said at 11: 

11\. The requirements of [s 21(1)] w ere considered at length by the Court of Appeal in _Price Arthur Leolin v A-G & Ors_ 


 [1992] 2 SLR 972. In its judgment, the court articulated a three-stage test for admission under s 21(1). At the first stage, the applicant must demonstrate that the case in w hich he seeks to appear contains issues of law and/or fact of sufficient difficulty and complexity to require elucidation and/or argument by a Queens Counsel. Such difficulty or complexity is not of itself a guarantee of admission, for the decision to admit is still a matter for the courts discretion. At the second stage, therefore, the applicant must persuade the court that the circumstances of the particular case w arrant the court exercising its discretion in favour of his admission. Finally, he has to satisfy the court of his suitability for admission. 

These stages can be summarised as: (i) w hether the case is of sufficient difficulty and complexity; (ii) w hether the circumstances of the case w arrant admission; and (iii) w hether the applicant is a suitable person for admission. 

4       The present applications are the second by both applicants for admission in the tw o suits. They first applied in O.M. 600021/2002 and O.M. 600023/2002. Their applications w ere dismissed by Tay Yong Kw ang J.C. on 18 April 2002 on tw o grounds: 

 (i) the suits in question w ere not of sufficient difficulty and complexity to w arrant admission of Queen’s Counsel; and 

 (ii) there w as no evidence of anything in the circumstances of the case that w arranted the court to exercise its discretion in favour of admission of Queen’s Counsel. 

5       In respect of the first ground, that of difficulty and complexity, Tay Yong Kw ang J.C. said as follow s at 39 to 41: 

39\. The affidavits in support of the tw o applications merely assert that these cases are extremely complex defamation ma tte rs w ithout explaining how they are so. The issues listed are general in nature and case law and legal w riting on such issues must abound both here and in other common law jurisdictions. It seems to me that the cases here only require the application of established principles to the facts. As Chan Sek Keong J said in _Re Oliver David Keightley Rideal Q.C._ (at page 402G – H): 

 "W ith reference to the first requirement, it is the judge, and not the parties, or their counsel, or other interested parties, w ho has to be satisfied that a case is of sufficient difficulty and complexity. The considered view s of instructing solicitors on the issues raised are relevant and should be given their proper w eight, but mere assertions that cases or issues are difficult and complex are of no assistance 


 to the court in discharging its duty. It is therefore incumbent on counsel to identify the issues to the judge hearing the application and his view s on the applicable law. A case may be difficult and complex in relation to the facts as w ell as the law ." 

40\. The fact that there is a Counterclaim in one of the actions here and that there are Third Party proceedings in both cases is certainly not novel. These are essentially procedural matters and even if they add to the number of parties and causes of action, they do not necessarily increase the complexity of the case. It has not been show n to me how the Counterclaim and the Third Party proceedings have raised the issues to such level of difficulty and complexity that the admission of one Q.C. is w arranted, let alone tw o Q.C. 

41\. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the tw o cases are of sufficient difficulty and complexity to w arrant the admission of Q.C. 

6       In respect of the second ground, Tay Yong Kw ang J.C. said at 42 to 43 of his Grounds of Decision: 

42\. The other factor mentioned in the affidavits is "the identity and positions of the Plaintiffs are further pow erful reasons w hy it is proper and necessary for me to engage the services of leading Counsel from outside of Singapore". By this, Dr Chee appears to be implying that no local law yer is able and w illing to act for him. There are presently more than 3000 pra ctising advocates and solicitors and more than 20 of these are Senior Counsel. W hile I need not be convinced of the absolute absence of any local counsel capable of taking on or w illing to take on the cases here (see _Re Caplan Jonathan Michael Q.C. (No 2)_ [1998] 1 SLR 440), no evidence has been proffered on this point to assist me in the balancing exercise. 

43\. The applications for admission therefore also fail at the "second stage". 

7       The tw o motions before me are made by the same applicants for admission under the same provision in the Act to represent the same defendant in the same suits as the tw o motions before Tay Yong Kw ang J.C. The only difference is that Dr. Chee had filed different affidavits in the present applications. In the new affidavits, he set out in more detail his reasons for saying that the suits w ere of sufficient difficulty and complexity. Additionally he had also deposed that he had approached a few law yers but they w ere unable to represent him because they did not have the experience or resources or they could not afford to act for him for free. 

8       The applicants have not appealed against the dismissal by Tay Yong Kw ang J.C. of their previous applications. In the premises, they are bound by the findings of the judge that the suits in question are not of sufficient difficulty and complexity and that there w as no evidence that the circumstances of the case 


w arranted admission of Queen’s Counsel. They are therefore estopped from contending otherw ise in this application. The doctrine of issue estoppel is summarised in the follow ing manner in _Halsbury’s Laws of England (4 Ed. Reissue) Vol. 16_ at 977: 

 A party is precluded from contending the contrary of any precise point w hich having once been distinctly put in issue, has been solemnly and w ith certainty determined against him. Even if the objects of the first and second actions are different, the finding on a matter w hich came directly (not collaterally or incide nta lly) in issue in the first action, provided it is embodied in a judicial decision that is final, is conclusive in a second action betw een the same parties and their privies. This principle applies w hether the point involved in the earlier decision, and as to w hich the parties are estopped, is one of fact or one of law , or one of mixed fact and law. The conditions for the application of the doctrine have been stated as being that: 

 (1) the same question w as decided in both proceedings; 

 (2) the judicial decision said to create the estoppel w as final; and 

 (3) the parties to the judicial decision or their privies w ere the same persons as the parties to the proceedings in w hich the estoppel is raised or their privies. 

9       In the present applications the parties are the same, the issues to be decided by the court are the same as those in the previous applications. The decision is clearly set out by Tay Yong Kw ang J.C. in his w ritten grounds of decision and it is final, save that the applicants have a right to appeal against it to the Court of Appeal. If the applicants are not satisfied w ith the decisions of Tay Yong Kw ang J.C., the proper course of action w ould have been to file an appeal. If they have fresh evidence, the correct procedure w ould be to apply to the Court of Appeal for leave to adduce such evidence. For me to entertain this second set of applications w ould tantamount hearing an appeal against the judge’s decision in respect of the first set of hearings. I have no jurisdiction to do that. It w ould also mean that an applicant w ho is not satisfied w ith the dismissal by a judge of his application can make a new one to another judge and keep doing so until he obtains an outcome that he is satisfied w ith. Clearly this cannot be the case. 

10     In view of the foregoing, I dismissed the applications.
