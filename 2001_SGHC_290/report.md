**_Background_** 

The plaintiff Hendrawan Setiadi is an Indonesian businessman. He was a c lient of the first defendant OCBC Sec urities Pte Ltd (`OCBC Sec urities`), a stoc kbroking c ompany inc orporated in Singapore. 

At all material times, the sec ond defendant Ng Haw Hua was a dealer`s representative and an assoc iate direc tor employed by OCBC Sec urities. 

At all material times, the third defendant Tang Boon Hai was also a dealer`s representative employed by OCBC Sec urities. 

The additional bac kground information below is based on Mr Setiadi`s allegations. 

Sometime in July 1995, Mr Setiadi opened an ac c ount with OCBC Sec urities and traded in sec urities through Mr Ng and Mr Tang. For the purpose of that ac c ount, Mr Setiadi deposited the sum of $5m. In respec t of the trading under this ac c ount, about $4.13m was returned by OCBC Sec urities leaving a balanc e of about $587,000 (`Singapore transac tions`). 

Sometime in May 1996, at the request/advic e of Mr Ng, Mr Setiadi deposited US$10m with OCBC Sec urities for investment in the shares of Megaworld Properties and Holdings Inc , a c ompany in the Philippines (`Megaworld shares`). 

Mr Setiadi`s c ase is that Mr Ng had represented to him that in return for his investment of US$10m, there would be a guaranteed gross return of 20% of that investment by OCBC Sec urities. In c onsideration of a guarantee being given to him by OCBC Sec urities, he agreed to invest about US$10m in Megaworld shares. The guarantee (`the guarantee`) was faxed over by Mr Ng to Mr Setiadi at his offic es in Jakarta. Upon rec eipt of the guarantee, Mr Setiadi remitted the sum of US$10m whic h was then used to purc hase Megaworld shares. The value of Megaworld shares subsequently plummeted and he suffered a loss. 

To mitigate his loss, Mr Setiadi sold off the Megaworld shares. He then c ommenc ed an earlier ac tion in Suit 559/98 (`the first ac tion`) against OCBC Sec urities and Mr Ng to rec over the losses suffered under the Singapore transac tions and in respec t of the Megaworld shares. 


Under the Singapore transac tions, Mr Setiadi c laimed that the losses were suffered as a result of various unauthorised transac tions effec ted by Mr Ng. Consequently, OCBC Sec urities was also vic ariously liable to him for the losses. 

In respec t of the Megaworld shares, Mr Setiadi`s c laim against OCBC Sec urities was based on the guarantee. Alternatively, his c laim was that the terms in the guarantee were representations made by Mr Ng as a servant/agent of OCBC Sec urities to induc e him to purc hase the Megaworld shares whic h he did. As the representations were made fraudulently, he was entitled to resc ind the c ontrac t or to c laim damages for the loss suffered. As an alternative, he also c laimed that his loss and damage was oc c asioned by the negligenc e of Mr Ng as servant/agent of OCBC Sec urities. 

The writ in the first ac tion was filed on 15 April 1998 and fixed for trial in November 1998 before Justic e Rajendran. 

On 12 November 1998 (`Day 1`), on the applic ation of c ounsel for OCBC Sec urities and for Mr Setiadi, the hearing was adjourned to Monday, 16 November 1998 on the ground that parties needed some time to prepare the various trial bundles. 

On 16 November 1998 (`Day 2`), the then c ounsel for Mr Setiadi in his opening statement informed the c ourt that Mr Ng had still not been served with the writ. Mr Setiadi`s solic itors were still trying to serve Mr Ng with the writ and believed he was away in the Philippines. 

On Day 2 of the hearing, c ounsel for OCBC Sec urities also applied for sec urity for c osts, further disc overy, etc against Mr Setiadi. 

On Day 4 of the trial, Mr Setiadi`s c ounsel applied to amend his statement of c laim in respec t of some of the Singapore transac tions. The trial was then adjourned to 5 April 1999. 

At the adjourned hearing on 5 April 1999, OCBC Sec urities` c ounsel applied for leave to amend the defenc e to inc lude the point that the guarantee was fabric ated. OCBC Sec urities c laimed that based on its doc ument expert`s report, the guarantee was a `c ut and paste` job. 

For that reason, the trial was then adjourned again and was fixed for hearing from 13 July 1999 to 26 July 1999. 

In the c ourse of the adjournment, Mr Setiadi engaged a doc ument expert from Australia to deal with the issue as to whether the guarantee was a `c ut and paste` job. 

On 13 July 1999, Mr Setiadi was re-c alled to the stand for c ontinued c ross-examination. By then, he was represented by a new c ounsel, ie Ms Molly Lim SC, who also appeared before me. 

On 16 July 1999, Ms Lim applied under O 21 r 3 for leave to disc ontinue the ac tion. At that stage, the c ross-examination of Mr Setiadi had not yet been c ompleted. 

It was alleged for Mr Setiadi that during the resumed trial of the first ac tion on 13 July 1999, it had bec ome c lear that the evidenc e of Mr Ng was c ruc ial. Before the amended defenc e of OCBC Sec urities, its pleaded c ase was a denial of any liability on the guarantee and they alleged that Mr Ng had no authority to issue the guarantee. Mr Setiadi`s then solic itors` inability to serve the writ on Mr Ng was therefore thought not to be c ruc ial and his c ase c ould be proc eeded with against OCBC Sec urities in the absenc e of Mr Ng. 


After the defenc e was amended to inc lude the point that the guarantee was fabric ated and during the c ontinuation of the trial from 13 July 1999, Mr Setiadi learnt from his own doc ument expert that there were at least two different versions of the guarantee. The c opy in the possession of OCBC Sec urities was different from that in the possession of Mr Setiadi. 

Mr Setiadi alleged that it then bec ame c lear that the partic ipation and evidenc e of Mr Ng was c ruc ial. 

It is important to bear in mind what transpired then before Rajendran J on 16 July 1999 in respec t of the applic ation on behalf of Mr Setiadi to disc ontinue the ac tion. I set out below the notes as rec orded by the judge: 

 16.7.99 (FRIDAY) (DAY 10) 

 In Chambers. 

 2.45pm 

 Miss Lim: 

 My instructions are to discontinue the action with costs to be taxed. I so apply. 

 Shanmugam: 

 I would ask for action to be discussed ( sic ) [dismissed] rather than leave to discontinue be given. 

 Order 21, rule 3, is for leave. Under that rule court has discretion. My reasons for application are: 

 (1) Most horrendous allegations made against OCBC. OCBC is a major institution in Singapore and prides itself on its reputation. In this context, it is important for world to know that allegations are frivolous. The best way to achieve this is to have action struck out. 

 (2) Court has seen the plaintiff on stand. It does not fit within parameters of what we may see as acceptable behaviour in Singapore. If leave is granted, nothing to stop him from starting fresh action in Singapore or in Indonesia on some issues. 

 If Court dismisses the action, then there would be serious difficulties in him commencing fresh proceedings in Singapore. He may not find difficulties in Indonesia but he will find any judgment entered difficult to enforce outside of Indonesia. 

 (3) There is no prejudice to the plaintiff. What the plaintiffs solicitor is saying is: "I cant go on". That being so, ask that the court dismisses the claim. 


_Miss Lim:_ 

_I ask for leave to discontinue. I spoke and obtained instructions from my client on that basis._ 

_If court is inclined to dismiss the claim and not grant leave to discontinue, I would have to take further instructions as to whether I wish to pursue with this application for leave to discontinue._ 

_On the rules, it is court`s discretion and I am asking court to exercise discretion in favour of my client._ 

_Shanmugam:_ 

_What they really are saying is that the client may not be happy if court orders claim to be struck off._ 

_Miss Lim:_ 

_I have a choice of withdrawing my application._ 

_Shanmugam:_ 

_If she is withdrawing the application, then she should say so._ 

_Court:_ 

_This is a case which I may well, in the exercise of my discretion, order that the claims be dismissed._ 

_Miss Lim:_ 

_I have to take instructions._ 

_Court:_ 

_Adjourned 10 minutes for Miss Lim to take instructions._ 

_Intld: SR_ 

_Court resumes_ 

_4 pm_ 


 Miss Lim: 

 We are proceeding with our application for leave to discontinue against the 1st defendants. Leave it to court. Discontinuance is only against the 1st defendants and not 2nd defendant. 

 Shanmugam: 

 That makes it all the more imperative that the action against the 1st defendants be struck out. 

 Court: 

 (1) Leave to discontinue denied. 

 (2) Order that the plaintiffs claim against the 1st defendants be struck out. 

 (3) Costs to be taxed and paid to the 1st defendants. 

Mr Setiadi alleged that after the order of 16 July 1999 (`the order`), he tried to loc ate Mr Ng. When Mr Ng was loc ated, Mr Setiadi c ommenc ed the present ac tion in Oc tober 2000 (`the sec ond ac tion`). He also added Mr Tang as a party to the sec ond ac tion. 

Mr Ng entered an appearanc e to the writ on 29 Marc h 2001 and the writ was served on OCBC Sec urities on 16 April 2001. If Mr Ng c ould not be loc ated, the sec ond ac tion would not have been proc eeded with sinc e nothing had c hanged from the date of the order. 

OCBC Sec urities then applied for Mr Setiadi`s c laim in the sec ond ac tion to be struc k out. 

On 18 July 2001, the deputy registrar struc k out the sec ond ac tion. 

Mr Setiadi appealed and on 22 August 2001, I dismissed his appeal. 

Mr Setiadi has appealed against my dec ision. 

**_Arguments_** 

Mr Muthu Arusu for OCBC Sec urities based his submission on res judic ata, in its original and extended form as enunc iated in **Henderson v Henderson** [1843-60] All ER Rep 378 and abuse of the proc ess of the c ourt. 

Ms Lim ac c epted that Mr Setiadi`s c laim against OCBC Sec urities in the sec ond ac tion is the same as the c laim in the first ac tion, save for an additional c laim for negligenc e against OCBC Sec urities direc tly rather than vic ariously as in the first ac tion. 

Ms Lim stressed that the judge had not dismissed the c laim in the first ac tion but had instead ordered 


that it be struc k out. 

She sought to rely on a passage in the judgment of Kirby P in **Linprint v Hexham Textiles** [1991] 23 NSWLR 508 at 520. However, that passage was based on a c lear distinc tion in the Vic torian County Court Rules between orders of `dismissal` and `striking out`. Furthermore, Ms Lim did not suggest that there was suc h a c lear distinc tion under the Singapore Rules of Court. 

Ms Lim submitted that the judge c ould have imposed an express term to the effec t that Mr Setiadi was prec luded from c ommenc ing a fresh ac tion but the judge did not. Ac c ordingly, Mr Setiadi was not so prec luded. 

While it was true that the judge did not impose suc h a term expressly, the question was whether that was the meaning of the order in any event. Having regard to Ms Lim`s attempt to disc ontinue the first ac tion and the insistenc e by Mr Shanmugam SC, who appeared for OCBC Sec urities, that the ac tion or c laim be dismissed/struc k out, and the submissions before the judge, there was no doubt in my mind that the order made was to prec lude any fresh ac tion by Mr Setiadi against OCBC Sec urities. 

Ms Lim also submitted that if the intention was to shut out Mr Setiadi from c ommenc ing a fresh ac tion, then he would have withdrawn his applic ation to disc ontinue the ac tion. 

However, the judge`s notes show c learly that Ms Lim did not have any doubt then that that was what Mr Shanmugam was insisting on. Indeed, she herself said she had the c hoic e of withdrawing the applic ation if suc h an order was to be made. After the judge intimated that he might well make suc h an order, she then said that she would take instruc tions. The matter was then adjourned. 

Subsequently, Ms Lim returned and said she was proc eeding with the applic ation to disc ontinue. She also pointed out that the disc ontinuanc e was only as regards the c laim against OCBC Sec urities and not against Mr Ng whereupon Mr Shanmugam said that this made it all the more imperative that the first ac tion be struc k out. 

In those c irc umstanc es, the judge denied leave to disc ontinue the ac tion and ordered that the c laim against OCBC Sec urities be struc k out. 

It really was not open to Ms Lim to argue that Mr Setiadi would have withdrawn his applic ation to disc ontinue if he might be prec luded from c ommenc ing a fresh ac tion against OCBC Sec urities. 

Ms Lim also submitted that bec ause Mr Shanmugam had submitted that there would be no prejudic e to Mr Setiadi, Mr Setiadi was led to believe that he would not be prec luded from c ommenc ing a fresh ac tion against OCBC Sec urities. 

I was of the view that Ms Lim`s relianc e on the argument of no prejudic e was an attempt to take the argument out of c ontext. Seen in the c ontext of what had transpired, there was no doubt in her mind and Mr Setiadi`s mind that if the c laim was dismissed or struc k out, as opposed to being disc ontinued, he would be prec luded from c ommenc ing a fresh ac tion against OCBC Sec urities. 

Ms Lim`s next argument was that no irreparable harm was c aused to OCBC Sec urities if Mr Setiadi was allowed to proc eed with his present c laim as OCBC Sec urities c ould even apply for c osts on a full indemnity basis if Mr Setiadi fails in the present c laim. 

I was of the view that this was a disingenuous argument. The point is that OCBC Sec urities would have to defend a c laim whic h it was not obliged to defend as Mr Setiadi was prec luded from making 


the c laim against it. 

Ms Lim then argued that the judge would prohibit Mr Setiadi from c ommenc ing a fresh ac tion only if it was `just to do so`, relying on `as it thinks just` in O 21 r 3, and it was not just to do so. 

Again, this was not the point. Whether it was just to do so or not was for the judge to dec ide. He had made the order. If Mr Setiadi was not satisfied, he should have appealed against the order. He did not. 

I also did not agree with Ms Lim that to ac c ept the c ontentions for OCBC Sec urities would be tantamount to interfering with the judge`s order as I have c onc luded that the order means what OCBC Sec urities c ontends and not what Mr Setiadi c ontends. 

In **_Linprint v Hexham Textiles_** (supra), Linprint Pty Ltd (`Linprint`) had sued Hexham Textiles Pty Ltd (`Hexham`) in the Supreme Court of Vic toria. In its defenc e, Hexham inc luded a c ounterc laim. Subsequently, the ac tion was ordered to be tried in the County Court of Vic toria. 

On 22 July 1982, the c ase c ame on for trial before Murdoc h CCJ. Hexham applied for an adjournment and the c ase was adjourned to 26 July 1982. 

On 26 July 1982, another applic ation for an adjournment was made on behalf of Hexham. The applic ation was refused and the c ase was adjourned to the next day to be heard after the c onc lusion of a part-heard c ase. Counsel for Hexham then announc ed that he was withdrawing from the c ase. 

On the next day, 27 July 1982, the c ase was heard. There was no appearanc e for Hexham. Linprint proc eeded to present its c laim, after whic h judgment for a sum was entered for it. The c ounterc laim was dismissed. 

More than six months later, Hexham brought an ac tion against Linprint in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The statement of c laim was equivalent to the c ounterc laim previously filed by Hexham. 

Linprint pleaded, inter alia, issue estoppel and res judic ata. 

Linprint applied for these issues to be dealt with as a separate question pursuant to the Supreme Court Rules 1970 Pt 31. The question c ame before Loveday J who answered it adversely to Linprint. 

Linprint then appealed to the Court of Appeal of New South Wales. 

The argument before the Court of Appeal took an entirely different c ourse from that adopted by Hexham before Loveday J. Before the judge, Hexham had based its arguments upon a c onstruc tion of the County Court Rules in Vic toria but c onc eded before the Court of Appeal that the argument based on suc h Rules c ould not be relied upon. Instead Hexham, as the respondent, argued that it had never had a hearing on the merits of its c ounterc laim. 

The Court of Appeal dec ided that Hexham was prec luded from making a fresh c laim, Kirby P dec iding on both the grounds of res judic ata and issue estoppel. 

At p 519, he said: 

 In England, however, in litigation between private litigants the courts have not been in doubt. At least so far as the doctrine of issue estoppel is concerned, it 


 has been held in the English Court of Appeal that a party which has put forward a positive case to a court and then at trial declines to proceed, will not be permitted later to pursue the same case and this, even though there has been no determination on the matter "on the merits ". In Khan v Golechha International Ltd [1980] 1 WLR 1482[1980] 2 All ER 259, the Court of Appeal held that a party was estopped from asserting the contrary of what had been raised in earlier proceedings and there conceded by counsel then appearing for that party ... [Emphasis is added.] 

At p 520, he said: 

 The English Court of Appeal applied the decision in Khan in SCF Finance Co Ltd v Masri (No 3) [1987] QB 1028 at 1048. Whilst the decisions are not binding on this Court, the reasoning in them is persuasive. Whilst that reasoning is confined to the application of the law of issue estoppel (where a matter has not been specifically judicially determined) it applies with even greater force where the issue has been so determined and is thus res judicata. It should be remembered that res judicata has lately been described as "cause of action estoppel": see, eg, Thoday v Thoday [1964] P 181 at 197 per Diplock LJ; and see also Lord Wilberforce in Carl Zeiss (No 2) (at 966). The genus dealt with by these two branches of law is the same. The public policy upon which each rests is that of the finality of judicial determinations in respect of which a litigant should not be vexed for a second time. If the reasoning in Khan and SCF Finance are applied to the present case, there can likewise be but one answer to the rhetorical question. 

 "Would it not be a case of the [appellant] company being vexed a second time in relation to an issue which it was open to the plaintiff to have determined in the previous proceedings?" 

 That answer is that it would. If, as it is contended, the respondent did not have a trial "on the merits" this was solely by virtue of its own conduct. It instructed its counsel to withdraw. Once the adjournment was refused, no endeavour was made (for example by subpoena of witnesses, the evidence of experts or otherwise) to prove the respondents case. It was simply abandoned. The respondent walked away from it ... 

At p 521, he c ontinued: 

 Issue estoppel: a wider principle: 

 If, contrary to the foregoing conclusions, a proper interpretation of the proceedings in the County Court of Victoria is that there was no judicial adjudication of the matters involved in the counter-claim by virtue of the withdrawal of the respondent, and therefore that res judicata does not apply, the same result nonetheless follows from the application of the law of issue estoppel. The issues which the respondent now wishes to litigate in the Supreme Court of this State were either (a) necessarily inherent in the issues raised by the counter-claim and defence in the County Court of Victoria or (b) so intimately connected with those issues that the Court would require that the party to the litigation should have pleaded them in such a way as to have them resolved in the Victorian proceedings. It would have been unreasonable not to have pleaded them in those proceedings and, to the extent that they were not 


 pleaded, they should not now be allowed to be pleaded again. 

Another member of the Court of Appeal Clarke JA said, at p 525: 

 The second question which then arises is whether that order founds a plea of res judicata. According to counsel for the respondent it does not for there had been no hearing of the counter-claim and in these circumstances, the dismissal should be regarded as having the same effect as a discontinuance. I cannot accept this proposition for the rules prescribe procedures which must be followed in order to enable a party to discontinue. Unless a party complies with those procedures it cannot be said to have discontinued nor is it entitled to the benefits, if any, which flow from such discontinuance. The case must, therefore, be judged solely upon the basis that the counter-claim was dismissed for want of appearance of the counter-claimant at the trial. 

At p 526, Clarke JA said: 

 I take it that these authorities establish that if a plaintiff withdraws from the trial and an order is made in its absence dismissing its claim then that order will, unless set aside or successfully appealed from, ground a later plea of res judicata in the event that a later attempt is made to litigate the same case. The position is no different than that which arises under a default judgment. 

On the fac ts before me, the order was made in the presenc e of c ounsel for Mr Setiadi after some argument on the nature of the order to be made and after she had taken instruc tions from him with full knowledge of the possible c onsequenc e of his applic ation. 

In my view, the princ iple of res judic ata and issue estoppel would apply a fortiori. 

The judgment in **_Linprint_** (supra) and the two English c ases c ited therein also dispose of Ms Lim`s other argument that there c an be no issue estoppel unless there is a dec ision on the merits of the c ase. 

As for the argument that Mr Setiadi`s fresh c laim was an abuse of the proc ess of the c ourt, Ms Lim submitted that this was not so bec ause mere re-litigation, in c irc umstanc es falling short of c ause of ac tion estoppel or issue estoppel, did not nec essarily give rise to suc h an abuse. 

The short answer to that was that the c irc umstanc es before me did give rise to res judic ata and issue estoppel. 

The two c ases whic h Ms Lim c ited to support her argument were **Bradford & Bingley Building Society v Seddon (Hancock & Ors, t/a Hancocks (a firm), third parties)** [1999] 4 All ER 217 and **Ching Mun Fong (executrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee, decd) v Liu Cho Chit** [2000] 1 SLR 517. 

However, the fac ts in those two c ases and in the c ase before me were different. In those two c ases, the party who was relying on res judic ata or issue estoppel was not a party in the earlier proc eedings. 


Ac c ordingly, if Mr Tang, as the third defendant in the sec ond ac tion, was raising the issue of res judic ata or issue estoppel against Mr Setiadi, Mr Tang would probably not suc c eed bec ause he was not even a party in the first ac tion. 

Likewise, Mr Ng would probably also not suc c eed on suc h an argument for a different reason, ie the c laim against him was not struc k out. 

Ms Lim also submitted that an order made pursuant to an applic ation under O 21 r 3 is similar to one made under O 13 r 9 and is not c apable of giving rise to res judic ata. She c ited **Mullen v Conoco** [1998] QB 382. 

However, again, the fac ts in **_Mullen_** were different from those before me. 

In that c ase, Conoc o Ltd sued Mr Mullen in the High Court for the pric e of petrol delivered to him and obtained judgment in default of defenc e. Mr Mullen applied to set aside the judgment under O 13 r 9 RSC on the grounds that the petrol supply agreement between Conoc o Ltd and him was so one-sided, unfair and unreasonable as to be unenforc eable against him. His applic ation was dismissed by the deputy master. 

Two months later, he issued a c ounty c ourt summons against Conoc o Ltd for trading losses arising out of the enforc ement of an improper and unreasonable supply agreement. 

Conoc o Ltd then applied to strike out the c laim. One of their grounds was c ause of ac tion or issue estoppel. 

The applic ation was heard by a distric t judge who struc k out the c laim for damages but allowed an implic it c laim for resc ission of the agreement to stand. 

On appeal to Judge Urquhart, the c laim in both respec ts was struc k out. 

Mr Mullen then appealed to the Court of Appeal whic h c onc luded that an applic ation under O 13 r 9 to set aside a default judgment involved a disc retionary jurisdic tion. If the c ourt`s power was exerc ised on a disc retionary basis, eg for delay, then it was diffic ult to say that any issue had been dec ided by the c ourt. 

Evans LJ said, at p 391E, that the question was whether the earlier ruling in Conoc o`s High Court ac tion, whic h he c onsidered to be an interloc utory one, was so c lear and so spec ific as regards a partic ular defenc e of Mr Mullen and were there no spec ial fac tors so that an estoppel may arise. 

On those fac ts and bearing in mind that Mr Mullen was not represented prior to the default judgment obtained in the High Court, Evans LJ allowed Mr Mullen`s appeal in respec t of Conoc o`s applic ation to strike out. 

However, the Court of Appeal did not say that a dec ision based on O 13 r 9 c ould never c onstitute an estoppel. Indeed this possibility was ac c epted by Evans LJ at p 391D. 

Moreover, the Court of Appeal also did not say that a dec ision based on the exerc ise of a disc retion under any of the rules of c ourt would never amount to res judic ata or issue estoppel. Obviously eac h c ase must depend on its fac ts. 

**_Additional claim by Mr Setiadi_** 


As for the additional c laim by Mr Setiadi against OCBC Sec urities on the ground that OCBC Sec urities was direc tly, as opposed to vic ariously, liable for negligenc e, Mr Setiadi appeared to be prec luded from maintaining the c laim under the extended doc trine of res judic ata as propounded in the oft-c ited judgment of Wigram VC in **_Henderson v Henderson_** (supra at pp 381-382): 

 ... where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter ( sic ) which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which probably belonged to the subject of litigation and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time. [Emphasis is added.] 

However, Ms Lim submitted that the rule in **_Henderson_** has been explained by Goulding J in **Jelson (Estates) v Harvey** [1984] 1 All ER 12 at 16 where he said: 

 That seems to me a misconception of the doctrine put forward in such cases as Henderson v Henderson [1843] 3 Hare 100[1843-60] All ER Rep 378 and Yat Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng Bank Ltd [1975] AC 581. Where there is litigation of a certain question or issue before the court resulting in a final or substantial order which decides it, then it is well established that it is too late (save in exceptional cases) for a party to adduce in subsequent litigation against the same opponent, or one privy to him, a fact that might well have been brought forward on the previous occasion. That doctrine, however, does not apply where there is a mere procedural defect and the court has never gone into the merits, though both parties were before it. 

I noted that the fac ts in **_Jelson_** were quite different from those before me. 

In that c ase, a plaintiff had obtained interloc utory injunc tions restraining the defendant from doing c ertain ac ts on the plaintiff`s land. The plaintiff then applied by a notic e of motion seeking the defendant`s c ommittal for alleged disobedienc e of the order. The notic e of motion did not set out on its fac e the grounds of the plaintiff`s applic ation as required by the English Rules of the Supreme Court and ac c ordingly the motion was dismissed for irregularity without the hearing of evidenc e or the c onsideration of merits. 

The plaintiff then filed a fresh motion. The defendant c ontended, by analogy with c riminal proc eedings, that he was entitled to the defenc e of autrefois ac quit. 

Henc e, the proc edural defec t that Goulding J was referring to was the defec t in the notic e of motion. 

Mr Setiadi`s applic ation to disc ontinue the first ac tion against OCBC Sec urities c ould not be said to be a mere proc edural defec t. 


In so far as Goulding J had suggested that the c ourt must have gone into the merits before res judic ata c an apply, that is not the law as I have elaborated above. 

The additional c laim against OCBC Sec urities was so intimately c onnec ted with the c laim against it in the first ac tion that it should have been pleaded then. 

As for the alleged reason for disc ontinuing the first ac tion, I did not ac c ept the reason. 

In April 1999, Mr Setiadi and his then c ounsel knew that OCBC Sec urities were relying on the argument that the guarantee had been fabric ated. They must have realised by then that Mr Ng`s evidenc e was c ruc ial. 

It was not nec essary to wait until Mr Setiadi`s expert had advised that there were different versions of the guarantee to realise that Mr Ng`s evidenc e was c ruc ial. Besides, on 16 July 1999, Ms Lim did not even apply for an adjournment to try and loc ate Mr Ng before applying for leave to disc ontinue. 

The fac t that Mr Setiadi would pay c osts if he lost in the sec ond ac tion or that Mr Setiadi would otherwise be shut out was also not a spec ial c irc umstanc e. Otherwise, the extended doc trine of res judic ata would be rendered nugatory. 

In summary, there was no spec ial c irc umstanc e to allow Mr Setiadi to re-litigate against OCBC Sec urities even in respec t of his additional c laim. 

## Outcome: 

Appeal dismissed.
