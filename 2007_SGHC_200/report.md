**Introduction** 

This ac tion is a c laim by c ertain members of the family of the late Ng Teow Yhee (“Mr Ng”) against one of his sons Ng Hoc k Guan also known as Sebastian (“Sebastian”) who is sued in his c apac ity as exec utor and trustee of the estate of Mr Ng and in Sebastian’s personal c apac ity. The reliefs sought are in respec t of spec ific gifts whic h Mr Ng is alleged to have made and whic h I shall elaborate on later. 

**Background** 

2       Mr Ng was the patriarc h of the Ng family. He built up his fortune in the shipping and stevedoring business and founded two family c ompanies in Singapore. They are Ng Teow Yhee & Sons Holding Pte Ltd (“the holding c ompany”) and Ng Teow Yhee & Sons (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“the subsidiary). The subsidiary is the operating arm of the family business. 

3       I set out below some partic ulars of Mr Ng’s immediate family members: 

 Name Date of Birth Relationship 

 (a) Low Ah Cheow (“Mdm Low”) In or about 1924 

 Wife 

 (b) Ng Khim Guan (“Ric ky”) 11 Sept 1948 Son 


 (c ) Ng Cheng Chuan (“Sunny”) 03 Dec 1951 Son 

 (d) Ng Pec k Eng (“Calista”) 04 Aug 1954 Daughter 

 (e) Ng Bee Eng (“Angeline”) 22 Mar 1956 Daughter 

 (f) Sebastian 01 Apr 1957 Son 

 (g) Ng Gui Eng (“Jenny”) 09 Jul 1959 Daughter 

 (h) Ng Ah Luan (“Edwina”) 07 Jul 1962 Daughter 

 (i) Ng Puay Guan (“Raymond”) 05 Dec 1966 Son 

4       Mr Ng exec uted a Will on 27 November 2000. He passed away on 12 April 2001 at the age of 

80\. This ac tion was filed almost five years later on 20 February 2006. Sebastian was appointed under the Will as the sole exec utor and trustee of the Will. The alternate exec utor and trustee appointed was his wife, Ho Soh Peng also known as Irene. I set out below c lause 2 of the Will: 

 I GIVE DEVISE AND BEQUEATH all my property of whatsoever nature and wheresoever situate (inc luding any property over whic h I may have a power of appointment or disposition by will) to my Trustee:

 (i) to sell c all in and c onvert into money all suc h parts of the same as shall not c onsist of money but so that my Trustee shall have full power to postpone the sale c alling in and c onversion for so long as he or she shall in his or her absolute disc retion think fit without being liable for loss oc c asioned thereby; 

 (ii) out of the net moneys arising from suc h c alling in and c onversion and any ready money belonging to me at my death to make payment of my debts funeral and testamentary expenses inc luding all estate duty and other taxes or duties payable on or by reason of my death in respec t of my estate; and 

 (iii) to hold the net proc eeds of suc h sale c alling in and c onversion and any ready money belonging to me at my death and any property c omprised in my estate for the time being remaining unc onverted and after any payment thereout mentioned in Clause 2(ii) above (hereinafter c alled my “Residuary Estate”) ON TRUST to be distributed to NG HOCK GUAN (Singapore NRIC No. S1260305/C). 

5       The plaintiffs based their c laims on the doc trine of sec ret trusts. Their spec ific c laims are as follows: 

 (a) Mdm Low is the first plaintiff c laiming the property known as 1A Wiltshire Road (“1A Wiltshire”) and 186,740 shares of Mr Ng in the holding c ompany. 

 (b) Raymond is the sec ond plaintiff c laiming $200,000 for himself. 


 (c ) Raymond is also c laiming for his two sons, Ng Zhi Kai and Ng Zhi Hao $100,000 eac h. Ng Zhi Kai’s name appears in the heading of some of the c ause papers as the fifth plaintiff whereas Ng Zhi Hao’s name does not appear in the heading as a plaintiff. This is probably due to inadvertenc e by the plaintiffs’ solic itors when they amended the Writ of Summons to inc lude more plaintiffs. The substanc e of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 4) (‘the statement of c laim”) disc loses the c laim for Ng Zhi Hao as well and it is not disputed that in substanc e, he is also a plaintiff. 

 (d) Angeline is the third plaintiff c laiming $90,000 and 33,320 of Mr Ng’s shares in the holding c ompany. She c laimed that part of the $90,000 was a sum of $40,000 being a refund of money she had given Mr Ng over the years. 

 (e) Sunny’s son, Ng Jian Wen, is the fourth plaintiff c laiming $300,000 through his parents, Sunny and Mdm Chou Li Lan. 

6       The requirements for the existenc e of a sec ret or half-sec ret trust are stated in _Kamla Lal Hiranand v Harilela Padma Hari_ <span class="citation">[2000] 3 SLR 709</span> at [31] as follows: 

 31 The essentials of the existenc e of a sec ret or half-sec ret trust c reated by the operation of equitable princ iples are these: 

 (a) an intention of the dec eased to benefit a sec ret benefic iary; 

 (b) c ommunic ation of the trust to the benefic iary/trustees; 

 (c ) express or tac it ac c eptanc e of the trust by the benefic iary/trustee, thereby induc ing the testator not to exec ute a will or leave a will already exec uted unrevoked or not to draw up a will. 

 See Snell’s Equity (29th Ed, 1990) at p 109; Pettit, Equity and the Law of Trusts (7th Ed, 1993) at p 125, Blackwell v Blackwell [1929] AC 318 at pp 334 and 341, Ottaway v Norman [1972] Ch 698 at 711A-C ... 

7       There was disagreement between the parties as to whether the induc ement of the testator is a separate and fourth requirement or will be implied onc e his intention is c ommunic ated to and ac c epted by the benefic iary/trustee. That argument was immaterial for present purposes and I need say no more about it. 

8       I would add that for the plaintiffs to suc c eed, the evidenc e must also show that Mr Ng intended to impose a binding and not merely a moral obligation on Sebastian, see _The Encyclopaedia of Forms and Precedents_ Fifth Edition 2003 Reissue Volume 42(1) at [25], a point whic h was illustrated in _Re Snowden (deceased)_ [1979] 2 All ER 172. On the fac ts in that c ase, the c ourt found that the testatrix did not intend the sanc tion to be the authority of a c ourt of justic e but the c onsc ienc e of her brother who was the sole benefic iary. 

9       I should also say something about the distinc tion between fully sec ret trusts and half-sec ret trusts as there was a c laim based on the doc trine of half-sec ret trusts as well. _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ Volume 9(2) Equity and Trusts 2003 Edition states at [110.565]: 

 ... A fully sec ret trust arises where a testator gives property to a person apparently benefic ially, but has c ommunic ated to that person during his lifetime c ertain trusts on whic h the property is to be held. A half sec ret trust whic h will be enforc ed by the c ourt arises where the fac t that the property is given to the legatee upon trust is mentioned in the will but the trusts are not defined 


 by the will. 

10     As c an be seen, c lause 2(iii) of the Will stated that the residuary estate was to be held on trust to be distributed to Sebastian. That provision did not say explic itly that the residuary estate was to be distributed to Sebastian “benefic ially” but it is c lear to me that that is the c orrec t interpretation. Furthermore, while paragraphs 6 and 8 of the statement of c laim relied on half-sec ret trusts, paragraphs 6 and 118 of the plaintiffs’ c losing submissions (“PCS”) stated that the plaintiffs were relying on sec ret trusts and not half-sec ret trusts. Even then, paragraph 278 of PCS appeared to retain the spec tre of half-sec ret trusts by stating: 

278\. The Plaintiffs submit as follows:- 

 a) The Will spec ific ally refers to the Defendant as a “ Trustee ”; 

 b) The Will spec ific ally refers to the Estate being given to the Defendant “ ON TRUST ”; 

 c ) The Will does not refer to the Defendant as being a benefic iary of the Estate or being benefic ially entitled 

 to any part of the Estate. 

11     It seems to me that the author of PCS had forgotten that he had abandoned the half-sec ret trusts argument. In any event, I reiterate that I find that Sebastian was given the entire residuary estate benefic ially under the Will. 

12     I should also mention that Sebastian did not seek to prec lude the admission of evidenc e about sec ret trusts under s 94 of the Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97). Presumably, this was bec ause of s 102 of the Evidenc e Ac t whic h states that, “Nothing in sec tions 93 to 101 shall affec t the c onstruc tion of wills”. 

13     Paragraph 7 of the statement of c laim c ontained the primary allegation about the trusts. The opening paragraph stated: 

 The Plaintiffs c ontend that the Dec eased c ommunic ated his intention to c reate the trusts and the terms of the trusts with the Defendant prior to the exec ution of the Will on 27 November 

2000\. The Plaintiffs further c ontend that the Defendant had either expressly and/or impliedly by his words and/or c onduc t ac c epted and/or assented to ac t as the trustee and/or agreed to c arry out the Dec eased’s aforementioned intentions upon his death. 

 [emphasis added] 

14     As c an be seen, this allegation c learly stated that Mr Ng had c ommunic ated his intention to c reate the trusts prior to the exec ution of the Will on 27 November 2000. Therefore, although in law, the c ommunic ation of sec ret trusts to the trustee c an be before or after a testator has exec uted his Will, the plaintiffs are bound by their pleadings. It is not open to them to assert in submissions, as they tried to do, that they c an also establish that Mr Ng’s c ommunic ation to Sebastian was done after the exec ution of the Will. 

15     As c an also be seen, the opening paragraph of the said paragraph 7 did not c learly assert when Sebastian had ac c epted or asserted or agreed to c arry out the trusts. Suc h was the state of the pleadings. Read in c ontext, in the absenc e of words to the c ontrary, I am of the view that the c orrec t interpretation of the allegation is that Sebastian’s ac c eptanc e, assent or agreement was also 


prior to the exec ution of the Will and not after. The c _ontra proferentem_ rule would reinforc e this view. Even if it was open to the plaintiffs to assert that Sebastian’s ac c eptanc e, assent or agreement was signified after the exec ution of the Will, this will not assist the plaintiffs muc h as I will elaborate below when I deal with the evidenc e. 

16     The said paragraph 7 also c ontained numerous partic ulars in 33 sub-paragraphs of the primary allegation. Many of the partic ulars c onstituted bac kground information or evidenc e or were irrelevant. I need not set all of them out here as I will deal with the material allegations later when I c ome to the evidenc e. 

17     At the trial, the plaintiffs c alled the following witnesses: 

 PW1 Lee Kok Leong (general manager of the subsidiary) 

 PW2 Chou Li Lan (Sunny’s wife) 

 PW3 Angeline 

 PW4 Edwina 

 PW5 Wong Man Kuen (Mdm Low’s grandson from an earlier marriage before she married Mr Ng) 

 PW6 Sunny 

 PW7 Raymond 

 PW8 Mdm Low 

 PW9 Low Ah Huat (Mdm Low’s brother) 

The witnesses for Sebastian were: 

 DW1 Sebastian 

 DW2 Huang Fu Chuan (Mr Ng’s c ousin’s son) 

 DW3 Tai Yun Shan (Mr Ng’s friend) 

 DW4 Alan Lee Soo Yuen (a solic itor) 

 DW5 Ng Koon Ting (Mr Ng’s friend) 

18     I should mention that as regards Mdm Low’s evidenc e, Sebastian and the plaintiffs reac hed an agreement that her affidavits of evidenc e-in-c hief would be admitted but she would not be c rossexamined. However, her evidenc e was still subjec t to c hallenge by Sebastian by other means and no 


adverse inferenc e would be drawn against Sebastian for the omission to c ross-examine Mdm Low. 

19     Mdm Low was about 83 years of age at the time she took the witness stand. I did wonder about the state of Mdm Low’s mind from her frail c ondition and her oral evidenc e-in-c hief, limited though it was. Her c ondition and oral evidenc e-in-c hief c aused me to c onsider whether she should have been inc luded as a witness by the plaintiffs in the first plac e. However, in the light of the agreement between the parties, I did not pursue the matter. 

20     Any referenc e below to the notes of evidenc e will begin with “NE” followed by the relevant date and page number. “AEIC” will mean affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief. I will also refer to Mdm Low, Sunny, Raymond, Angeline and Edwina as the plaintiffs’ main witnesses. 

**The relationship between Mr Ng and family members** 

21     It is unusual for a man to give his entire estate benefic ially to only one c hild out of many c hildren. It was Sebastian’s position that Mr Ng did so bec ause he was fed-up with the rest of his c hildren as well as with his wife. However, the burden of proof is not on Sebastian to justify why Mr Ng gave him everything under the Will. Instead, the burden of proof is on the plaintiffs to establish that although on paper everything was given to Sebastian, that gift was in turn subjec t to spec ific oral gifts in favour of the plaintiffs meant to be legally enforc ed against Sebastian if need be. 

22     In order to disc harge their burden, the plaintiffs sought to show that Mr Ng had a c lose relationship with other immediate family members up to the time of his demise, so that it would be more likely than not that he would have made spec ific gifts to them. Put in another way, they sought to show that it was unlikely that Mr Ng would leave them with nothing. However, I should say that Mr Ng might not have thought that he was leaving them with nothing if he trusted Sebastian to take c are of the others. Therefore, even if the other family members enjoyed a c lose relationship with Mr Ng up to the time of his demise, that in itself would not negate the possibility that, as the favourite, Sebastian was trusted to take c are of the rest. However, if Mr Ng was not c lose to the others, that would lend weight to the argument that there were no spec ific gifts to them. In that situation, it would be more likely that he had given everything to Sebastian and left it to him to dec ide what to do for eac h of the other family members. I c ome now to the evidenc e on Mr Ng’s relationship with immediate members of his family. 

23     At the time of the exec ution of the Will and Mr Ng’s demise, Sebastian had bec ome Mr Ng’s favourite c hild. This is obvious from the terms of the Will appointing Sebastian as sole exec utor and nominating him as sole benefic iary. Sunny and Raymond also ac c epted, although with some reluc tanc e, that Sebastian was in fac t the favourite c hild when they were c ross-examined (NE 4/4/ pg 16 to 18 and 5/4/07 pg 41). Sebastian explained that he had initially been employed by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Ric ky and Sunny were the first two c hildren direc tly involved in the family business. Sebastian joined the family business in or about 1981 at the request of Mr Ng. Sebastian asserted that Ric ky and Sunny had gambled in horse rac ing and lost money heavily and had also squandered money. Raymond also squandered money and had to look to Mr Ng for financ ial assistanc e to help raise his two c hildren. The mother, Mdm Low, was spoiling her c hildren and was often asking Mr Ng to bail them out. Consequently, there was a strain in the relationship between Mr Ng and his wife and other c hildren up to the time of his demise. 

24     There was evidenc e whic h supported Sebastian’s allegations to some extent. 

25     Firstly, the fac t that he was the sole exec utor and sole benefic iary lent some weight to his allegations. 


26     Sec ondly, the plaintiffs themselves tendered extrac ts from a book entitled _Stepping Out The Making of Chinese Entrepreneurs_ by Chan Kwok Bun and Claire Chiang See Ngoh. They did so to establish that Mr Ng gave priority to educ ation whic h in turn was meant to help them establish the c laims for various spec ific sums of money for Raymond’s two sons and Sunny’s son. Chapter three was about Mr Ng. There was a referenc e in footnote 1 at pg 47 to an oral history interview transc ript in 1981 for a quotation attributed to Mr Ng. The interviewers were not c alled to give evidenc e nor was the tape or ac tual transc ript produc ed. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs and Sebastian ac c epted that the c hapter ac c urately quoted what Mr Ng had said where it purported to quote him. It was not c lear to me whether the date of 1981 in footnote 1 of pg 47 applied to all the quotations attributed to Mr Ng in the c hapter but, again, the plaintiffs and Sebastian proc eeded on the basis that all the quotations c ame from an interview in 1981. While it is true that part of the c hapter suggested Mr Ng’s priority for educ ation, another part suggested a strained relationship at least with one or some, if not all, his c hildren. These two aspec ts are found in pg 62 and 63 of the book. I quote: 

 From Sojourner to Settler 

 The years after the Japanese Oc c upation saw Ng busy settling into married life and raising a family while organizing his business with the help of his sons ... In order to meet the new business c hallenges after the war, Ng c hose to educ ate his c hildren in English. Of his eight c hildren – four sons and four daughters – only one attended a Chinese sc hool. The rest went to English sc hools to learn a language their father was handic apped in and c onsidered important for business development. Yet, he was c onsc iously aware of what that c hoic e c ould entail – an erosion of traditional values, in partic ular, the loss of filial piety towards parents. 

 As for his business today, Ng appears a little bewildered by the fast pac e of business and is c onc erned about the future. He realizes that c ontinuity is a major problem and is worried about the lac k of patienc e, integrity and resoluteness of the next generation: 

 In my view, businessmen in the old days planned for their business to last twenty, fifty or one hundred years. Nowadays, businessmen only look at the immediate gains... 

 With my children, there are c onflic ts. Young people are more ambitious and greedy. They are impetuous, we c annot do business this way... 

 [emphasis added] 

27     Although the last sentenc e quoted above did not say that Mr Ng c onsidered his c hildren to be squanderers, it suggested that he was already unhappy at least with some of his c hildren. The plaintiffs sought to suggest that the last sentenc e was applic able to Sebastian but I do not agree. Sebastian had joined the family c ompanies in or about 1981 only (when he was 24) although he did drop by at the offic e from time to time before that. It seems to more likely than not that the last sentenc e above referred to Ric ky and/or Sunny. Even without this text, I will c ome to other evidenc e whic h illustrates the point Sebastian was making about squanderers in the family. 

28     The third piec e of evidenc e ac tually c ame from plaintiffs’ c ounsel himself when he posed a question to Sebastian at NE 9/5/07 at pg 108 as follows: 

Q: My instruc tions are that yes, Mdm Low Ah Cheow often did ask your father for monies for Ric ky and for Sunny, that there were some quarrels with your father, but your father often gave in and paid monies. 


A: But if they keep on like that, Mr Arul, would it be happy for him? 

29     This question suggested that the plaintiffs were ac c epting that Mdm Low often had to prevail on Mr Ng to render financ ial assistanc e to Ric ky and Sunny and he often gave in but not without quarrels bec ause he had perc eived them to be squandering money. 

30     The fourth piec e of evidenc e c ame from Alan Lee. He was the solic itor who had rec eived instruc tions from Mr Ng to draft his Will. Alan had known Mr Ng sinc e 1990. He had seen Mr Ng for a Chinese New Year lunc h eac h year and had visited Mr Ng at his offic e from time to time. Alan said that Mr Ng had mentioned that his wife was c loser to one side of the siblings and that a c ouple of the c hildren were spendthrifts and gamblers. Although no names were mentioned, it was c lear to Alan that Mr Ng did not mean Sebastian as Mr Ng trusted Sebastian to run the family business and Alan had met Sebastian with Mr Ng but had not met any of the other c hildren (NE 21/5/07 pg 53 to 67). 

31     The fifth piec e of evidenc e c ame from the fac t that Mdm Low had been pawning her jewellery although she was rec eiving a total of $10,000 per month from the family c ompanies. There was a suggestion that she did so in the past to help Mr Ng in the earlier years. However, in or about as late as 1997 or 1998, she was still pawning jewellery when the family business was not in financ ial need then. That jewellery was redeemed by Mdm Low’s friend, Mdm Lim Ya Ho. When Mr Ng learned about the pawning and the redemption, he in turn redeemed the jewellery from Mdm Lim Ya Ho. Mdm Low c omplained that the jewellery was then handed to Sebastian who said that he was going to c lean the same but Sebastian did not hand the jewellery bac k to her. Sebastian said that he was instruc ted by Mr Ng to keep the jewellery and not hand it bac k to Mdm Low who would pawn it again. The jewellery is not the subjec t of any c laim in this ac tion but to me, the inc ident showed that Mdm Low was pawning jewellery without Mr Ng’s knowledge in or about 1997 or 1998 at a time when she herself should not have been in need of money. She was known to be frugal with herself and had been rec eiving inc ome of $10,000 a month. The inferenc e I draw is that she pawned her jewellery bec ause one or some of the other c hildren had been squandering money and were in need of financ ial assistanc e. I will now c ome to Sebastian’s evidenc e about Mr Ng’s relationship with spec ific individuals in the family. 

32     As regards Mdm Low, Sebastian appeared to ac c ept that Mr Ng still loved her notwithstanding their quarrels over her repeated requests for financ ial assistanc e for various c hildren but Sebastian said Mr Ng was disappointed with her. 

33     As regards Ric ky, Sebastian said that Mr Ng and Ric ky had bec ome sarc astic with eac h other and Mr Ng had given up on Ric ky. 

34     As regards Sunny, Sebastian elaborated that he had heard from other people initially that Sunny had been the favourite son before. One reason why Mr Ng had bec ome unhappy with Sunny was that Mr Ng had found out that Sunny had sold two houses at Geylang without Mr Ng’s knowledge. Mr Ng had bought them for Sunny. Furthermore, Sunny had stopped talking to Mr Ng in the later years and did not visit Mr Ng when Mr Ng was first admitted to hospital in Oc tober 2000. Mr Ng had given up hope on Sunny. 

35     As regards Raymond, the youngest c hild, Sebastian said that Raymond was often asking Mr Ng direc tly or through Mdm Low for financ ial assistanc e. This was c orroborated to some extent by plaintiff’s c ounsel who said (at NE 14/5/07 pg 13) that his instruc tions were that Raymond had some c ash flow problems in the late 1990s as a result of a financ ial c risis. Sebastian also said that Raymond was also hardly involved in the family business and on one or two oc c asions, Mr Ng suspec ted that Raymond had stolen some money from him. Raymond was divorc ed and was perc eived by Mr Ng as not 


being able to take financ ial c are of his two c hildren. 

36     As regards Calista, Sebastian said that she was c lose to Mdm Low but not to Mr Ng. She hardly spoke to Mr Ng and was afraid of him. Mr Ng was fed up with her for not having a mind of her own as she would simply do what Mdm Low told her to do inc luding lending money to Sunny and Raymond on several oc c asions. 

37     As for Angeline, Sebastian said that Mr Ng c onsidered her to be disrespec tful towards him and his friends and that she too had squandered away her money. Sebastian also said that Mr Ng had heard that Angeline was lending money illegally and had also c heated someone in his hometown of Quanzhou. 

38     As for Jenny, she was mentally c hallenged and had had a rec ord of shoplifting. 

39     As regards Edwina, she had gone overseas to study in Canada and/or in the United States of Americ a. She obtained a Masters in Business Administration. Mr Ng was initially proud of her as she was the first person in the family to obtain suc h a degree. However, ac c ording to Sebastian, Mr Ng eventually did not trust Edwina as she was often c overing up for Ric ky’s use of the fac ilities of the family business for his own c ompany Handling Systems Pte Ltd. 

40     In any event, Mr Ng had provided for family members from time to time by providing homes and/or vehic les. They were also drawing salaries, mainly from the subsidiary, at the time of his demise as follows: 

 (a) Ric ky, Sunny and Sebastian who were exec utive direc tors were eac h paid a basic salary of $10,000 per month; 

 (b) Mdm Low was also paid a total of $10,000 per month as the total of her basic salaries from both c ompanies; 

 (c ) Raymond was paid a basic salary of $3,000 per month. He was appointed a non-exec utive direc tor of the subsidiary in 1989; 

 (d) Calista and Angeline were eac h paid a basic salary of $2,650 per month. They had been appointed sec retaries of the subsidiary; 

 (e) Jenny had been appointed a c lerk and was paid $1,500 per month; 

 (f ) Edwina had been appointed to administer a branc h offic e at Jurong Container Warehouse. She was paid $4,000 per month. 

41     The plaintiffs disagreed with Sebastian’s portrayal of their relationship with Mr Ng. The plaintiffs also sought to portray Sebastian as a gambler and someone who was hiding important matters from them. 

42     I will deal first with the plaintiffs’ assertion that Sebastian was quite heavily involved in gambling on horse rac es. Sebastian denied this saying he plac ed only small bets. Although the plaintiffs spent some time during the trial on this issue, the plaintiffs did not show how it was material even if what they asserted was true. What if Sebastian had been betting quite heavily in horse rac es? Did that mean that he too was a squanderer or did he gamble within his own manageable limits? The plaintiffs did not assert the former explic itly. If the former was the implic ation, that 


implic ation did not gel with the undisputed fac t that Sebastian was Mr Ng’s favourite c hild. It seems to me that if Sebastian was a squanderer, Sebastian would not have been Mr Ng’s favourite even though Sebastian was apparently a c apable person. 

43     The suggestion that Sebastian was hiding important matters from other family members was in respec t of the time when Mr Ng was ill on two oc c asions, _ie_ , when he was ill in China in 1999 and when he was ill and hospitalised in Singapore on various oc c asions between 18 Oc tober 2000 and 11 April 2001, his demise being on 12 April 2001. Before I go further, I note that the AEICs of the main witnesses for the plaintiffs alluded only to the period when Mr Ng had to be hospitalised in Singapore. It was only during the trial that they elaborated as to how Sebastian had allegedly kept the rest of the family in the dark when Mr Ng was ill in China in 1999. Sebastian denied this saying he had kept the rest of the family informed through Mdm Low. Given the late elaboration by the plaintiffs’ main witnesses and that the burden of proof was on them to establish their assertion, I c onc lude that they have not established this allegation in c onnec tion with Mr Ng’s illness while he was in China. I am reinforc ed in this c onc lusion also by my assessment of the plaintiffs’ evidenc e about how Sebastian also kept the rest of the family in the dark when Mr Ng was ill in Singapore. As I have said, he was in hospital on various oc c asions then. The undisputed periods when he was warded in Mount Elizabeth Hospital were as follows: 

 No. Date of admission Date of discharge 

 1 18 Oc tober 2000 09 November 

 2 27 November 2000 08 Dec ember 2000 

 3 26 January 2001 27 January 2001 

 4 31 January 2001 15 February 2001 

 5 24 February 2001 06 Marc h 2001 

 6 19 Marc h 2001 11 April 2001 

44     The plaintiffs said that Sebastian had taken c harge of the health c are for Mr Ng and had liaised with the doc tors. He did not dispute this. It was c ommon ground that Mr Ng was diagnosed with malignant lymphoma in or about Oc tober 2000 but Sebastian disputed that he had kept the rest of the family in the dark about it. He said he had briefed his mother on various oc c asions during whic h time some other family members were present. He said that medic al bills were sent to one of the family c ompanies for payment and Sunny would have c ounter-signed the c heques. Sunny would also have seen that some of the bills were from an onc ologist. Sec ondly, Mr Ng had visitors from time to time who would have been aware of his illness too. Thirdly, any of the other family members c ould have asked the doc tors or nurses about Mr Ng’s illness. 

45     Exc ept for Angeline, the plaintiffs’ main witnesses gave the same reasons for not inquiring about Mr Ng’s health. First, they had trusted Sebastian who was their son or brother, respec tively, after all. Sebastian had allegedly misled them by saying that the illness was nothing serious or that it was a lung infec tion. Sec ondly, they had not dared to ask Mr Ng himself bec ause he was traditional in his thinking and did not like to talk about his health as he felt it was bad luc k to do so. He also did not like others to know that he was in ill health. The plaintiffs’ main witnesses respec ted Mr Ng’s privac y 


and did not want to make his c ondition any worse by talking about suc h things. 

46     It is c lear to me that the relationship between Sebastian and Mdm Low and the plaintiffs’ main witnesses, exc luding Angeline, had been strained for some time even before Mr Ng was first admitted to hospital in Oc tober 2000. Even Raymond let slip that in the past someone had already warned him about Sebastian (NE 9/4/07 at pg 34). So muc h for his allegation that he had trusted Sebastian even in 2000 and 2001. As for Angeline, she was apparently quite c lose to Sebastian until rec ently before the ac tion was filed. 

47     The plaintiffs asserted that Mr Ng c ontinued to love Mdm Low the most although they did not share the same bedroom and their bedrooms were at different levels at 1A Wiltshire. They submitted that he was also c lose to Raymond and Edwina who had been with him everyday while he was in hospital. Raymond was also staying at the family home at 1A Wiltshire and was helping to take c are of Mr Ng as well as ferrying him to and fro when he had to c onsult doc tors from time to time. Edwina c ame to stay at 1A Wiltshire frequently to help c are for Mr Ng when he was ill. In my view, if Mr Ng still loved Mdm Low the most, he would have disc ussed his illness with her in their quiet moments together, that is, if they still had suc h moments. It appears to me that although Mr Ng still loved Mdm Low, he no longer loved her the most and they were no longer c lose for some time before his demise. Although Raymond said that Mr Ng did not know what illness he was suffering from (NE 9/4/07, pg 5), the plaintiffs appear to have ac c epted in submission that Mr Ng in fac t knew (see, for example, PCS at pg 139 at (i)). Sebastian’s evidenc e was that Mr Ng knew (NE 15/5/07, pg 71). Indeed, it was not the evidenc e of the plaintiffs’ main witnesses (exc luding Angeline) that they did not inquire of Mr Ng about his illness bec ause he himself did not know. I find that Mr Ng knew the nature of his illness. As for Raymond and Edwina, if they were as c lose to Mr Ng as the plaintiffs wanted me to believe, Mr Ng would have disc ussed his illness with them during the time they had spent with him. Raymond was in fac t helping Mr Ng with his medic ation till apparently he made a mistake with the medic ation and was relieved of this responsibility. 

48     Furthermore, it would have been a simple matter for any family member who was still unaware of the nature of Mr Ng’s illness to ask the doc tors or nurses who attended to him. Indeed, Mdm Low c laimed she learned about it from a doc tor who was surprised that Sebastian did not tell her. On the other hand, witnesses like Edwina, for example, said she did not ask the doc tors or nurses. Yet, there was no suggestion that Sebastian had forbade all of them to speak to doc tors or nurses. He must have been aware that any of them c ould have done so and it would have been foolish of him to deliberately hide Mr Ng’s illness from all of them. 

49     There was also no logic al answer to Sebastian’s point that Sunny would have known about Mr Ng’s illness from some of the medic al bills. 

50     As for Angeline, she said she was told of Mr Ng’s illness by Sebastian bec ause she was then c lose to Sebastian but he told her not to tell the rest of the family. Yet, there was no evidenc e of protest from her. She did not tell Sebastian that Mdm Low and the rest had a right to know. When she was asked whether other family members had disc ussed Mr Ng’s health with her, she said there were too many visitors at the hospital and she had been busy partly with the Chinese New Year in 

2001\. I find suc h explanations flimsy at best and do not ac c ept that Sebastian had told her not to tell the others. 

51     However, Mr Lee Kok Leong, a general manager with the family business, also said that Sebastian had told him about Mr Ng’s illness but had told him not to tell the rest of the family about it. I find Mr Lee, generally, to be an honest witness but, on this point, I am of the view that he may have misunderstood whatever Sebastian had told him. While it is true that Sebastian, even on his own 


evidenc e, did not take the trouble to speak to every other family member about Mr Ng’s illness and developments regarding his treatment, it is another matter to say that he deliberately kept them all in the dark. 

52     Indeed, even Sunny’s wife, Mdm Chou Li Lan said that Sebastian had informed her about the nature of Mr Ng’s illness although she said she was told in or about February 2001 only. Her point was that she was unaware until then but if it was Sebastian’s intention to deliberately keep them all in the dark, he would not have disc losed the illness to her even by that time. Moreover, if that was the first time she learned of the nature of the illness and Sunny was still unaware of the same, she would have immediately informed Sunny. Yet, she was initially unc ertain whether she had done so and was unable to say what Sunny’s response was when she informed him. 

53     It is not nec essary for me to deal with other allegations suc h as the time when Mdm Low said she learned about the nature of Mr Ng’s illness. The evidenc e from the plaintiffs on the point about how Sebastian had kept them in the dark was generally unreliable. I find that the plaintiffs’ main witnesses knew about the nature of Mr Ng’s illness but they did not disc uss it with Mr Ng bec ause they were not c lose to him. Neither did they disc uss it with Sebastian as they were also not c lose to him. 

54     In any event, the plaintiffs again failed to show any direc t c onnec tion between their allegations and the issues before me. What if Sebastian had kept the rest of the family in the dark about the nature of Mr Ng’s illness when Mr Ng was in Singapore or even while he was in China? What did that show? At most, it was an issue of Sebastian’s general c redibility. On the other hand, the plaintiffs’ allegation unwittingly revealed that their relationship with Mr Ng was not as c lose as they were suggesting. 

55     However, the plaintiffs relied on other evidenc e to establish that Mr Ng was c lose to some of the other immediate family members. 

56     For example, Sunny was one of two authorised signatories in Group A regarding a mandate from the subsidiary to operate an ac c ount with Overseas Union Bank Limited. Ric ky and Edwina were two out of four authorised signatories in Group B, the other two being Mr Ng and Sebastian. The mandate allowed any one from Group A and any two from Group B to operate that ac c ount (see Plaintiffs’ Bundle of Doc uments (“PBD”) 210). 

57     Sec ondly, Sunny was appointed a managing direc tor of the subsidiary on 21 January 1988. However, Sebastian said that Sunny was ac tually appointed as a joint managing direc tor together with Sebastian on the same date (see PBD 142 and 143) bec ause Sunny had been unhappy with the intended appointment of Sebastian only, as managing direc tor. This seems to me to be a logic al explanation for Sunny’s appointment together with Sebastian and I ac c ept it. 

58     Thirdly, Mr Ng had nominated Angeline, not Sebastian, as the benefic iary to rec eive money and assets in Mr Ng’s Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) ac c ount. The money amounted to $24,359.73 and $342.13 and there were also 1,540 Singtel shares. The nomination was made on 13 Marc h 1997 (see Agreed Bundle 191). Ac c ording to Sebastian, Mr Ng did so bec ause Angeline had given Mr Ng some c ash stating that it was for him to use first and he c ould in return give her his CPF money. Angeline’s evidenc e in her AEIC was that she had given Mr Ng spending money eac h time he had gone to China. The amount eventually totalled about $40,000. She also said that in or about July 2000, Mr Ng gave her $10,000. He was quite sic k by then. Mr Ng had also told her he would return the money she had given him in addition to a c ash gift of $50,000 whic h was her inheritanc e. The total of these two sums makes up the $90,000 whic h Angeline was c laiming. Angeline disputed that she was nominated 


as the benefic iary of Mr Ng’s CPF ac c ount bec ause she had told Mr Ng that he c ould nominate her in exc hange for the c ash she had given to him. Ac c ording to a letter from CPF dated 9 Oc tober 2006, the c ash sums in Mr Ng’s CPF ac c ount were paid to Angeline on 5 May 2001 and 7 September 2001. Therefore, she must have been aware that she was the nominated benefic iary even before she exec uted her AEIC in 2006. Yet, she herself did not suggest in her AEIC that the nomination disc losed a partic ularly c lose relationship between Mr Ng and her, as plaintiffs’ c ounsel was suggesting when he c ross-examined Sebastian. While I am not persuaded that Angeline had spec ific ally asked Mr Ng to give her the money in his CPF ac c ount in exc hange for the c ash she had given him from time to time, I am of the view that it is likely that he nominated her bec ause of the c ash she had given him and not bec ause she was partic ularly c lose to him. As mentioned, Sebastian was the favourite and Angeline was not appointed as an exec utor or named as a benefic iary. I will elaborate later on Angeline’s allegation about the oral c ash gift of $90,000 to her, of whic h $40,000 was supposed to be a refund of money she had given Mr Ng. 

59     Fourthly, the plaintiffs’ witness, Wong Man Kuen, a grandson of Mdm Low who was residing in China, gave evidenc e in his AEIC that based on what he knew, Mr Ng’s relationship with Mdm Low was good and Mr Ng would often praise his c hildren, partic ularly Ric ky and Sunny for being suc c essful in their business. Mr Ng would also say good things about Sebastian whom he was also fond of. It seems to me that Mr Wong did not know as muc h about the relationship between Mr Ng and the various family members as he wanted me to believe. The thrust of his evidenc e suggested that Mr Ng was just as c lose to Ric ky and Sunny as he was to Sebastian, if not even c loser. Yet, the plaintiffs ac c epted that Sebastian was Mr Ng’s favourite. 

60     Fifthly, the plaintiffs relied on photographs of weddings or birthday c elebrations whic h Mr Ng attended with various family members. I am of the view that suc h evidenc e does not advanc e their c ontention muc h. 

61     All things c onsidered, I am of the view that Mr Ng’s relationship with Mdm Low and the other three sons was strained bec ause he c onsidered these three sons as squanderers and Mdm Low was spoiling them. 

62     As for Calista, I ac c ept Sebastian’s evidenc e that Calista was not c lose to Mr Ng for the reasons he stated. 

63     As for Angeline, it seems to me, after having heard her evidenc e and observed her demeanour, that she was the most independent-minded of the daughters. She may have been too independentminded for Mr Ng’s liking but I am not able to c onc lude from the limited evidenc e that Angeline had c heated someone from Mr Ng’s hometown. It may be that she was not appointed as an exec utor simply bec ause Mr Ng wanted Sebastian to be solely and c ompletely in c harge of his estate. 

64     As for Jenny, I ac c ept that Mr Ng was frustrated with her bec ause of her rec ord of shoplifting. I also ac c ept that as regards Edwina, Mr Ng was not pleased with her as she had been making exc uses for Ric ky. 

65     Notwithstanding Mr Ng’s frustrations with Mdm Low, I ac c ept that he felt responsible to c are for her. As for the other sons, he was, in my view, c ertainly not c lose to them. While he was not as frustrated with the daughters to the same extent as he was with the other sons, I find that he was also not c lose or no longer c lose to the daughters as well. 

66     Also, Mdm Low, the other sons and the daughters were in turn not c lose to Mr Ng even though some of them remained dutiful in varying degrees to him. While I ac c ept that Mr Ng felt a sense of 


responsibility for the welfare of various immediate family members, and grandc hildren as well, suc h a finding is not suffic ient for the plaintiffs’ c ase as Mr Ng c ould well have left his estate to Sebastian without any spec ific direc tives. If Mr Ng had simply expec ted Sebastian to do what was right by the other family members, this would not assist the plaintiffs. 

67     I will deal now with the spec ific gifts c laimed by the plaintiffs and divide them into three c ategories: Mr Ng’s shares in the holding c ompany, 1A Wiltshire and the c ash gifts. 

**Mr Ng’s shares** 

68     At all material times, the shareholding in the holding c ompany was as follows: 

 Mr Ng 253,380 shares (36.20%) 

 Ric ky 253,340 shares (36.1%) 

 Sunny 93,320 shares (13.33%) 

 Sebastian 66,640 shares (9.52%) 

 Mdm Low 33,320 shares (4.76%) 

 700,000 shares (100.00%) 

Mdm Low’s shares were transferred to Raymond by the time of the trial. 

69     The plaintiffs’ pleaded c ase for the shares is found in paragraph 7.32 of the statement of c laim whic h asserted that on several oc c asions in August 2001, Sebastian had told Angeline that he wanted to distribute Mr Ng’s estate to other family members in ac c ordanc e with Mr Ng’s wishes and that Mr Ng wanted his shares to be held on trust by Sebastian to be distributed as follows: 

 (a) Calista was to rec eive 33,320 shares. 

 (b) Angeline was to rec eive 33,320 shares. 

 (c ) Mdm Low was to rec eive the balanc e c omprising 186,740 shares for her to deal with as she deemed fit. 

70     Calista is not a plaintiff and henc e in [5] above, I set out only the c laims by Angeline and Mdm Low in respec t of Mr Ng’s shares in the holding c ompany. I would add that the holding c ompany or the subsidiary holds real property in Neil Road although I was not informed of the details of suc h property. Even so, Mr Ng’s shares were apparently the jewel in the c rown of his estate. 

71     As c an be seen, there was no assertion that Mr Ng himself had told Angeline or Mdm Low about the gift of shares. The only assertion in the statement of c laim was that Sebastian had told Angeline of Mr Ng’s wishes in respec t of the shares. 

72     In c ross-examination, Angeline said that Sebastian had also wanted to return to her the number of shares whic h, apparently, she had transferred to Sebastian in the past. 


73     I do not ac c ept Angeline’s allegation or evidenc e about the c onversation between Sebastian and her for various reasons. 

74     First, I find it generally unsafe to ac c ept Angeline’s evidenc e on disputed points. I have already mentioned how she c laimed to have been told by Sebastian not to tell other family members about the nature of Mr Ng’s malignant lymphoma and yet she was evasive when asked whether other family members had disc ussed Mr Ng’s health with her. There were other instanc es when she did not tell the truth whic h I will c ome to later. 

75     Sec ondly, it did not make sense for Mr Ng to give the bulk of his shares to Mdm Low. She was not involved in the operations or dec isions of the family business. Sunny and Raymond ac c epted that she did not know anything about the family c ompanies (NE 9/4/07 pg 48 and 49). Even the shares whic h she held in the holding c ompany were held for Raymond. Mr Ng must have known that if the bulk of his shares were given to her, she would be likely to give them eventually to Ric ky, Sunny and/or Raymond as she had often prevailed on him to provide financ ial assistanc e to these three persons. 

76     Thirdly and signific antly, this c laim was inc onsistent with yet another allegation of the plaintiffs whic h I now c ome to. 

77     The plaintiffs had alleged that in or about Dec ember 2000 or January 2001, Mr Ng was in his room on the third level of 1A Wiltshire having a disc ussion with Sebastian and a friend Teo Boon Tieng (“Mr Teo”), an ac c ountant with Goh Ngiap Suan & Co. Mdm Low, whose room was at a different level, was asked to join the group. There, Sebastian had informed her that Mr Ng wanted her to transfer the 33,320 shares whic h was then still held in her name to Mr Ng. Thereafter, Mdm Low left Mr Ng’s room for her room. On the way down to her room, Sebastian told her that a lawyer would be c oming the next morning to arrange for the transfer. Sebastian c ame down and told various persons, namely, Mdm Low, Raymond, Calista and Edwina that Mr Ng had informed him about the spec ific c ash gifts whic h are the subjec t of the present c laim. 

78     Ac c ording to Mdm Low’s AEIC, she had been troubled when she heard that she was supposed to transfer the shares she held to Sebastian as the original intention when the shares were first plac ed in her name, was to hold them for Raymond. At night, when Raymond wanted to get a drink, he saw Mdm Low awake in her room looking dazed and troubled and spoke to her. She told him about the intended transfer. He said he told Mdm Low that the shares were his. He also explained to her that with those shares, Sebastian would (together with Mr Ng’s shares) effec tively c ontrol the majority of the shares in the holding c ompany. When Sebastian c ame to 1A Wiltshire the next morning, Mdm Low said she told him that she would not c arry out the transfer whereupon Sebastian went to Mr Ng’s room and c omplained to him. Raymond said he went up too and overheard Mr Ng telling Sebastian to leave the matter as it was. Sebastian subsequently c ame down from Mr Ng’s room and said that the c ash gifts he had mentioned the day before were c anc elled. In Raymond’s oral evidenc e, he added that he later spoke to Mr Ng about what Sebastian was saying about the c anc ellation and Mr Ng said there was no suc h thing, meaning no c anc ellation, and he was not to listen to Sebastian’s nonsense. 

79     Sebastian’s version was that when Mdm Low went to Mr Ng’s room, Mr Ng had told her about another family c ompany in the lighterage business whic h had failed bec ause the founder’s wife had spoilt her son. Mr Ng had asked Mdm Low not to allow history to repeat itself and asked her to give Sebastian her full support to c ontinue their family business. Mr Ng was c rying then and so was Mdm Low who then asked Mr Ng for $100,000 to pay her brother in relation to a transac tion c onc erning a flat. It was Mr Ng who then informed Mdm Low that if she wanted the $100,000, she 


has to transfer the shares she was holding to Sebastian. Sebastian did not agree that he had gone down and mentioned the c ash gifts to various persons. Sebastian said he subsequently learned from Mr Ng that Mdm Low had c hanged her mind about the transfer and Mr Ng was very unhappy about the whole inc ident. 

80     I am of the view that Mdm Low’s version as to how she c ame to be asked to transfer her shares is to be preferred. First, Sebastian did not c all Mr Teo who was in Mr Ng’s room at the relevant time, to give evidenc e. No reason was given by Sebastian for not c alling Mr Teo even though Mr Teo was his ac c ountant in another c ompany at the time of the trial (NE 18/5/07 at pg 15). I draw an adverse inferenc e against him for this. Sec ondly, it was not Mdm Low who had asked to see Mr Ng. She was asked to see him. 

81     I am of the view that Mr Ng and Sebastian had been disc ussing about the future of the family business (with Mr Teo) and both had agreed that she should be asked to transfer her shares to Mr Ng. It was not disputed that with her 33,320 and Mr Ng’s 253,380 shares, Sebastian, who had 66,640 shares, would c ontrol 353,340 out of 700,000 shares, _ie_ , 50.48%. 

82     Although it was c ommon ground that Mdm Low was asked to transfer her shares, whatever the bac kground reason was, this inc ident militated against the plaintiffs’ c laim that Mr Ng had told Sebastian that his shares were to be distributed three ways among Calista, Angeline and Mdm Low, with the bulk going to Mdm Low. The fac t that Mdm Low was asked to transfer her shares demonstrated that Mr Ng had intended that all his own shares be given benefic ially to Sebastian, otherwise Sebastian would still not have majority c ontrol even with the shares held by Mdm Low. The plaintiffs did not seem to realise that the inc ident militated against the c laims in respec t of Mr Ng’s shares. 

83     The plaintiffs also relied on another oc c asion when Sebastian allegedly sought to gain the shares held by Mdm Low. On or about 1 May 2001, Sebastian and other family members had gone to Chua Chu Kang c emetery where Mr Ng had been buried to offer their prayers and to disc uss the c onstruc tion of Mr Ng’s tomb. Thereafter, some of them, inc luding Sebastian, went for lunc h together. It was alleged that during the lunc h, Mdm Low had asked Sebastian about Mr Ng’s Will whereupon he said words to the effec t that it was not ready yet. He then bec ame angry and gave Mdm Low three months to “c onsider and to respond” or words to that effec t (presumably in Hokkien). The plaintiffs believed that this was a referenc e to Mdm Low’s refusal to agree to transfer her shares and that Sebastian was still trying to gain majority c ontrol. Sebastian disputed their allegations about the inc ident. I do not think that Sebastian would have tried to get the shares held by Mdm Low at this stage when he knew that she had already refused to part with them even though Mr Ng had asked her to do so. 

84     At this stage, I digress slightly to revert to the point about Mr Ng’s relationship with his c hildren, other than Sebastian. It was submitted for the plaintiffs that if Mr Ng was as displeased with the other sons as Sebastian was suggesting, he would have kic ked them out of the family c ompanies. I do not think the situation was so simple. As mentioned, he c ould not even get Mdm Low to transfer the shares she held to Sebastian. 

85     Coming bac k to the plaintiffs’ allegations about the lunc h inc ident on or about 1 May 2001, I am of the view that even if the allegations are true, it does not help them with the c laims for Mr Ng’s shares. Again, it may reflec t on Sebastian’s general c redibility if I do not ac c ept his evidenc e on this point but how would it show that Mr Ng had intended to give his shares to the three persons alleged? 

86     In addition, there was no evidenc e that either Mdm Low, Calista or Angeline had asked 


Sebastian, prior to the filing of the ac tion, to transfer her entitlement to her. Suc h an omission also militated against the c laims in respec t of Mr Ng’s shares. I find that the plaintiffs have not disc harged their burden of proof in respec t of the gifts of Mr Ng’s shares to Angeline and to Mdm Low. I will elaborate later on my finding as to whether Sebastian mentioned the c ash gifts to some family members and then said they were c anc elled and whether Raymond spoke to Mr Ng about Sebastian’s c onduc t in respec t of the inc ident in or about Dec ember 2000 or January 2001. 

87     I would also say that in c ross-examination, Raymond mentioned that Mr Ng had told Mdm Low, in his presenc e and in Sebastian’s presenc e, on various oc c asions at the hospital and the previous family home at 36 Poole Road that he was giving 1A Wiltshire and his shares to Mdm Low (NE 9/4/ pg 14 and 16). Yet, this was not pleaded in the statement of c laim. Neither was this mentioned in Raymond’s AEIC or Mdm Low’s. In the c irc umstanc es, suc h evidenc e is not admissible in view of the pleadings and even if it was admissible, I plac e no weight on it as I did not believe Raymond who was c oming up with suc h allegations belatedly. 

**1A Wiltshire** 

88     Mr Ng had lived at 36 Poole Road before he moved to 1A Wiltshire. In early 2000, 36 Poole Road was sold and 1A Wiltshire was ac quired in Mr Ng’s sole name. As in the c laim in respec t of Mr Ng’s shares, the partic ulars in respec t of the c laim for 1A Wiltshire were found in only one part of the statement of c laim. Paragraph 7.12(ii) thereof asserted that some time in Dec ember 2000, Mr Ng told Angeline at Mount Elizabeth Hospital: 

 (a) that Mr Ng had entrusted his estate to Sebastian bec ause, firstly, Mdm Low was too old to manage his estate and sec ondly, so that Sebastian would be able to pay his medic al and funeral expenses. Apparently, Sebastian had said to Mr Ng that he was unsure how muc h the medic al and funeral expenses would c ome to; 

 (b) that 1A Wiltshire was to be left to Mdm Low who c ould deal with it as she deemed fit; 

 (c ) about the various c ash gifts. 

89     This also fell short of an explic it assertion by the plaintiffs that Mr Ng had told Sebastian to let Mdm Low have 1A Wiltshire and that Sebastian had agreed to c arry out suc h a wish. Instead, the plaintiffs were relying on the implic ation that if Mr Ng had told Angeline what was alleged it would follow that he must have also told Sebastian the same and Sebastian would have agreed to the same, otherwise Mr Ng would not have left everything to Sebastian under the Will. 

90     In my view, Mr Ng would not have c onsidered appointing Mdm Low to be his exec utor even if she was not too old. His view of her was that she had been spoiling three sons. The last thing he would have done was to c onsider appointing her as his exec utor. 

91     I am also of the view that Mr Ng would not have been c onc erned about payment of his medic al and funeral expenses. He would have assumed that the family business would have taken c are of suc h expenses as the family business was not in a dire financ ial situation and the subsidiary was already paying for his medic al expenses before his demise. Although his Will stated that his estate was to pay for his funeral expenses, I am of the view that he did not spend muc h thought on it. Indeed, apparently, there was no spec ific disc ussion between him and Alan Lee about his funeral expenses and the provision on funeral expenses may have been inserted as a standard provision by his solic itors. 


92     The pleaded position suggested that Mr Ng had told Angeline onc e in Dec ember 2000 about his wish to let Mdm Low have 1A Wiltshire, as well as his other gifts. However, in paragraph 21 of her AEIC, Angeline said this was told to her on “several” oc c asions when she visited Mr Ng at the hospital in or around Dec ember 2000. In c ross-examination, she said it was on one or two oc c asions and then said it was on the first oc c asion that 1A Wiltshire was mentioned (NE 3/11/06 pg 58). Her evidenc e on this was vac illating. 

93     More importantly, Angeline said that there was an oc c asion after Mr Ng’s demise when Sebastian mentioned to her that 1A Wiltshire would be divided into nine shares. She mentioned that there should be eight shares instead as there were eight c hildren but he said the ninth share was for Mdm Low. I find it signific ant that Angeline’s evidenc e was that she mentioned eight shares, thus exc luding the mother, when, on the other hand, she was c laiming that Mr Ng had told her that 1A Wiltshire was to be left to Mdm Low. She also c onfirmed that she did not mention to Sebastian that Mr Ng had told her that 1A Wiltshire was to be given to Mdm Low (NE 14/11/06 pg 41 to 42). Neither did she seek any c larific ation from Sebastian in the light of what Mr Ng had purportedly told her. 

94     Angeline also said that she c ould not remember whether she had told Mdm Low what Mr Ng had told her about leaving 1A Wiltshire to Mdm Low (NE 14/11/06 pg 51). I do not ac c ept suc h evidenc e. It was not disputed that Sebastian had arranged for solic itors to show and read Mr Ng’s Will to various family members. This was done at the offic e of Helen Yeo & Partners on 8 June 2001. Mdm Low and Angeline were among the family members present. After the Will was read, Mdm Low remarked that she would get nothing and this was c onfirmed by the solic itors. If Mr Ng had really told Angeline that 1A Wiltshire was to be left to Mdm Low, Angeline would have remembered what Mr Ng had allegedly told her. Thereafter, she would have disc losed this c onversation to Mdm Low or sought c larific ation from Sebastian. She did neither. 

95     I find Angeline’s evidenc e about Mr Ng’s wishes for 1A Wiltshire to be unreliable for the above reasons as well as the fac t that I find muc h of her evidenc e on other disputed points unreliable. I should add that in c ross-examination, Sebastian ac c epted that Mr Ng did tell him to let Mdm Low stay at 1A Wiltshire. While this may suggest that not all Mr Ng’s wishes are found in his Will, it is still not suffic ient for the plaintiffs on whom the burden is to prove eac h c laim. I find that in respec t of 1A Wiltshire, Mdm Low has not proved her c laim. 

96     I would also add that although the allegation about the gift of 1A Wiltshire to Mdm Low was c onfined in paragraph 7.12 (ii) of the statement of c laim to a disc ussion between Mr Ng and Angeline, paragraph 252 of PCS submitted that on several oc c asions while Mr Ng was warded in hospital, he had told Mdm Low in the presenc e of Raymond and Sebastian that 1A Wiltshire was to be given to Mdm Low (as well as his shares in the holding c ompany). This submission was based on Raymond’s oral evidenc e whic h I have already mentioned in [87] above. In view of the state of the pleadings, it is not open to the plaintiffs to make this submission. In any event, I do not ac c ept Raymond’s evidenc e thereon. 

**The cash gifts** 

97     The statement of c laim gave partic ulars of various instanc es when the c ash gifts were mentioned by Mr Ng or Sebastian or admitted to by Sebastian: 

 (a) Paragraph 7.3 of the statement of c laim asserted that in late 2000 before the exec ution of the Will, Mr Ng had told Edwina, who was c aring for him at 1A Wiltshire, that he had made provision for family members after he passed away and that he had instruc ted Sebastian ac c ordingly. In partic ular, Mr Ng had told Edwina about various c ash gifts to Angeline and Edwina 


herself, as c laimed, as well as c ash gifts to Calista and Jenny whic h are not the subjec t of the present c laims. The original referenc e to a c ash gift to Mdm Low was deleted by an amendment. 

(b) Paragraph 7.6 of the statement of c laim asserted that Sunny’s wife, Mdm Chou Li Lan had visited Mr Ng regularly at Mount Elizabeth Hospital around mid 2000 to early 2001. It also asserted that during the visits, Mr Ng informed Mdm Chou that he was aware that her son’s future educ ational expenses were estimated to be around $300,000. Mr Ng had assured Mdm Chou that he had provided for her and her son’s educ ational expenses. 

(c ) Paragraph 7.9 of the statement of c laim asserted that on several oc c asions in Dec ember 2000, Mr Ng had told Mdm Low, in the presenc e of Raymond and Angeline, both at home and at the hospital about the various c ash gifts, _ie_ , the c ash gifts whic h are the subjec t of the c laims, as well as c ash gifts to Calista and Jenny whic h are not the subjec t of the c laims. 

(d) Paragraph 7.12 of the statement of c laim asserted that sometime in Dec ember 2000, Mr Ng told Angeline at the hospital of the same c ash gifts mentioned in (c ) above. As mentioned in [88] above, paragraph 7.12 of the statement of c laim also dealt with the same c onversation in the c ontext of Mr Ng telling Angeline that 1A Wiltshire was to be left to Mdm Low. 

(e) Paragraphs 7.13 to 7.15 of the statement of c laim mentioned the time when Mdm Low was asked to transfer the shares she held and when Sebastian mentioned the c ash gifts in Mdm Low’s room. These paragraphs also alleged that Mdm Low dec lined to transfer the shares and the announc ement by Sebastian that the distribution of the c ash gifts mentioned the day before was c anc elled. Signific antly, they do not allege that Raymond then went up to inform Mr Ng about the c anc ellation and Mr Ng responded that there was no suc h c anc ellation and not to listen to Sebastian’s nonsense. This c onversation between Raymond and Mr Ng was also not mentioned in Raymond’s AEIC. It was mentioned by Raymond only when he was being c ross-examined (see NE 9/4/07, pg 38, 40 to 42). 

(f ) Paragraph 7.16 of the statement of c laim asserted that on or about 31 January 2001, Mr Ng had mentioned to Mdm Chou at the hospital that he had provided for her family. 

(g) Paragraph 7.17 of the statement of c laim asserted that in or about February 2001, Mr Ng had told Mdm Chou at 1A Wiltshire, in the presenc e of her son, that he had provided for their family. 

(h) Paragraph 7.19 of the statement of c laim asserted that in the months that followed, Sebastian told Angeline on several oc c asions that Mr Ng had willed all his assets to Sebastian as a trustee to be held on trust for the other family members. Sebastian asked Angeline whether he should distribute to the other family members “their respec tive entitlements” or hold onto the same. Angeline told him to distribute in ac c ordanc e with Mr Ng’s wishes and instruc tions but Sebastian kept quiet, then outrightly refused. 

(i) Paragraph 7.22 of the statement of c laim asserted that on or about the night of 29 May 2001 at around 11pm, Sebastian had brought Angeline to his home at Eden Spring. He insisted on showing her some doc uments whic h he c laimed were Mr Ng’s bank ac c ounts and told her “ _not so much money, how to distribute_ ” or words to that effec t. 

(j) Paragraph 7.27 asserted that on several oc c asions before and even after 8 June 2001 (the date when the Will was shown to other family members at the offic e of Helen Yeo & Partners), Sebastian was asked when he was going to distribute to the other family members “their 


 respec tive entitlements” but he kept on putting them off by saying that he would do so after grant of probate had been issued. It was also asserted in paragraph 7.28 of the statement of c laim that unknown to the other family members, Sebastian had filed a petition for grant of probate on or about 11 June 2001. 

98     As c an be seen, most of these partic ulars also did not explic itly assert the fac t of, the date when and the plac e where Mr Ng had told Sebastian about the c ash gifts. Most also did not explic itly assert the fac t of, the date when and the plac e where Sebastian had agreed to Mr Ng’s wishes. These were onc e again left to implic ation and the implic ation was also not pleaded. 

99     The allegation in paragraph 7.3 of the statement of c laim was based on what Mr Ng told Edwina. Furthermore, paragraph 17 of Edwina’s AEIC introduc ed a new and not insignific ant allegation, _ie_ , that Mr Ng had also c onfided to Edwina that he had drawn up a list of benefic iaries and their respec tive entitlements. However, he was c onc erned that the benefic iaries would squander all of what was given to them and so he dec ided to hold onto the list at the time. 

100    In c ross-examination, Edwina said that there was one oc c asion when Mr Ng mentioned spec ific c ash gifts to her and another separate oc c asion when the question of holding bac k the gifts was mentioned. Signific antly, for the separate oc c asion, her oral evidenc e was different from paragraph 17 of her AEIC. In c ross-examination, she mentioned that Sebastian was also present on the separate oc c asion at 1A Wiltshire and it was Sebastian, not Mr Ng, who suggested to Mr Ng that he should not distribute his money otherwise the benefic iaries would squander the money (see NE 6/11/06, pg 44 to 54 and pg 59 and 60). When asked whether she had told her father that Sebastian’s allegation of squandering was untrue, Edwina said Mr Ng trusted Sebastian and hinted that she feared Sebastian who was the dominant sibling in the family. Then, she suggested that even Mr Ng was a bit afraid of Sebastian and had been influenc ed by Sebastian. However, she added that she believed that her father would know what he was doing (NE 6/11/06, pg 56 to 62). 

101    Edwina also c ould not make up her mind whether she eventually told Mr Ng that the squandering allegation was untrue. At one point, she said she did, then she did not and then she said she did (c ompare NE 16/11/06 pg 57 line 24 to pg 58 line 7; pg 61 line 11; pg 62 line 12 to 14). I find that she did not. I would mention that paragraph 17 of Angeline’s AEIC also alleged that on a number of oc c asions, Sebastian had been telling Mr Ng about how the other sons were “useless, spendthrift, c heated by wife and/or c hildren”. Yet, Angeline admitted that she did not c orrec t Sebastian in the presenc e of Mr Ng (NE 3/11/06 pg 32 and 33). There was also no elaboration by Edwina during c rossexamination about the list of benefic iaries whic h Mr Ng was said to have mentioned to Edwina. 

102    Sebastian did not admit that he had c omplained to Mr Ng about the squandering habits of his male siblings. It seems to me more likely than not that he did do so. However, it also seems to me that he did so bec ause there was a basis for his c omplaints. It would have been foolish of him to c omplain about their squandering if in fac t they were not squanderers. That is why even Angeline had not attempted to c orrec t him when he was c omplaining about them. Edwina’s allegation that Mr Ng was a little bit afraid of Sebastian c ame as a surprise to me espec ially sinc e the Will was not c hallenged on the ground of undue pressure or undue influenc e or on any other ground. It was a distrac tion sinc e she ac c epted that Mr Ng would know what he was doing. 

103    As for Edwina’s referenc e (in her AEIC) to a list of benefic iaries, I find this to be a bare allegation. Furthermore, the allegation that Mr Ng told Edwina about spec ific c ash gifts was in c ontrast to Edwina’s suggestion that notwithstanding the time she spent with Mr Ng when he was ill, he did not mention the nature of his illness to her. I find Edwina’s evidenc e that Mr Ng told her about the c ash gifts to be unreliable. 


104    I c ome now to the allegation in paragraph 7.6 of the statement of c laim as to Mr Ng having told Mdm Chou that he was aware that her son’s future educ ational expenses were estimated to be around $300,000 and that he had provided for her family and the son’s educ ational expenses. This was supposed to have oc c urred around mid 2000 to early 2001. 

105    In paragraph 10 of Mdm Chou’s AEIC, she said that Mr Ng had told her on a number of oc c asions that he knew that her son would be going to university soon and his university fees would be about $200,000 to $300,000. Mr Ng also said he had provided for her family. 

106    Paragraph 11 of her AEIC said that on or about 31 January 2001, Mr Ng had told her at the hospital to tell her husband, Sunny to manage the family business well with the other siblings. He also told her that everything ought to be alright as he had provided for them. 

107    Paragraph 12 of her AEIC said that after Mr Ng had returned home from hospital, in or about February 2001, he had told Mdm Chou, who was visiting him, not to worry as he had provided for them. This was said apparently in the presenc e of her son. 

108    Then, in her oral evidenc e-in-c hief, Mdm Chou said that on one oc c asion in hospital when Mr Ng was telling her to inform Sunny to work together with the others and how he had made provision for her son’s educ ation and her family needs, Sebastian was present sitting near a window and heard the c onversation (NE 31/10/06 pg 103). In c ross-examination, Mdm Chou c onfirmed thric e that Mr Ng had told her in one of their c onversations that he had given instruc tion to Sebastian about providing $200,000 to $300,000 for her son’s educ ational expenses. 

109    The allegation that Mr Ng had told Mdm Chou on a number of oc c asions that her family would be provided for was too vague to sustain a c laim for a spec ific gift of $300,000 for her son’s educ ation. In any event, I also do not ac c ept that Mr Ng gave her suc h an assuranc e or any assuranc e about the spec ific c ash gift. I have found that Mr Ng c onsidered Sunny to be a squanderer. Given my finding of Mr Ng’s opinion of Sunny, he would not have assured Mdm Chou of any financ ial provision. He must have known that if he were to do so, she would in turn have informed Sunny. That would only have sent the wrong signal to Sunny that he need not be more thrifty. 

110    Sec ondly, it was only during her oral evidenc e that Mdm Chou mentioned that Sebastian was present on one oc c asion when Mr Ng was telling her about the provision for her son’s educ ational expenses. It was also only during her oral evidenc e that Mdm Chou c onfirmed that Mr Ng had told her that he had given instruc tions to Sebastian about this provision. Giving the requirements to establish a sec ret trust, these two allegations were signific ant. Yet, neither was mentioned earlier in the pleadings or Mdm Chou’s AEIC. Her late attempt to add suc h allegations reflec ted poorly on her c redibility. 

111    Thirdly, Mdm Chou also said that towards the end of 2001 or early 2002, when Sebastian was not responding to Mdm Low’s request for the distribution of Mr Ng’s assets among family members, she had c alled Sebastian to ask him why her family was not given anything under the Will. She reminded him that he was present during a c onversation she had with Mr Ng but this was a c onversation when the spec ific sum for her son’s educ ational expenses was not mentioned by Mr Ng. It was the general c onversation about Mr Ng having said he had provided for her son’s educ ation and her family needs. Moreover, she did not ask Sebastian in the telephone c onversation whether Mr Ng had given instruc tions to him about a $300,000 provision for her son’s educ ation. If Mr Ng had told her about that spec ific sum, I am of the view that she would have asked Sebastian about it. 

112    I also reiterate Mdm Chou’s unsatisfac tory testimony regarding how she had first learned about 


the nature of Mr Ng’s illness from Sebastian but was unc ertain whether she then told Sunny about the revelation and his reac tion. 

113    I find Mdm Chou’s allegation in paragraph 7.6 of the statement of c laim to be unreliable. 

114    I c ome now to paragraph 7.9 of the statement of c laim where it was alleged that in Dec ember 2000, Mr Ng told Mdm Low, Raymond and Angeline on several oc c asions about the various gifts. Angeline’s presenc e was not mentioned originally but was inc luded by amendment in or about Oc tober 

2001\. Although paragraph 7.9 gave the impression that the various oc c asions all oc c urred in Dec ember 2000, Raymond said in c ross-examination that two of five oc c asions oc c urred over three months between Oc tober to Dec ember 2000. He c ould not remember when the other oc c asions had oc c urred. Furthermore, different gifts were mentioned on eac h of the five oc c asions. In c ross- examination, he elaborated as follows: 

 (a) The first oc c asion was in Oc tober 2000 at the hospital. Mr Ng said he would give Raymond $200,000 and also $100,000 for eac h of his two c hildren. Sebastian was also present (NE 9/4/07, pg 1 to 2, pg 6). 

 (b) The sec ond oc c asion was between Oc tober and Dec ember 2000 at the hospital. Mr Ng said that Angeline was entitled to $90,000, Edwina to $50,000 and Calista to $50,000. Sebastian was present. Mr Ng also said that he had given the appropriate instruc tions to Sebastian (NE 9/4/07, pg 10, 13 and 16). 

 (c ) The third oc c asion was also at the hospital but Raymond c ould not remember the month when it oc c urred. Mr Ng said that he would give $90,000 to Angeline, $50,000 to Calista, $50,000 to Edwina and $200,000 to Jenny and $300,000 to Sunny’s son. Sebastian was present. Mr Ng also said that he had given the appropriate instruc tions to Sebastian (NE 9/4/07 pg 11 to 13). 

 (d) The fourth oc c asion was at the hospital on a date whic h Raymond c ould not remember. On this oc c asion, Mr Ng mentioned not only c ash gifts but that he would give Mdm Low 1A Wiltshire and his 36% shares in the holding c ompany and Mdm Low was to return to Calista and Angeline whatever shares in the holding c ompany whic h they had given up in the past. Sebastian was present. Mr Ng also said he had given the appropriate instruc tions to Sebastian (NE 9/4/07 pg 10, 13 to 16). 

 (e) The fifth oc c asion was the earliest oc c asion based on Raymond’s evidenc e. This was in 1999 and Mr Ng told Mdm Low at their previous residenc e at 36 Poole Road that he would give her his 36% shares in the holding c ompany and she was to return to Calista and Angeline the shares whic h they had previously given up to Mr Ng (NE 9/4/07 pg 16, 21 to 22). Mdm Low was to keep the remainder bec ause if she were to distribute them, she might c ause a fight. 

115    As already disc ussed in [87] and [96] above, there was no referenc e in the pleadings or in the AEIC of Raymond about the fourth and fifth oc c asions when Mr Ng purportedly mentioned to Mdm Low the gift of 1A Wiltshire and Mr Ng’s shares to her. The pleadings as regards these two c ategories of gifts were limited as set out above. It is c lear to me that Raymond’s belated allegations on these two c ategories of gifts were an attempt to bolster Mdm Low’s c laim for them. I find these belated allegations to be untrue and they in turn reflec ted poorly on Raymond’s c redibility. 

116    There was also no mention in the pleadings or in Raymond’s AEIC about Sebastian’s presenc e or that Mr Ng had said he had given the appropriate instruc tions to Sebastian on some of these five oc c asions whic h evidenc e c ame out only during c ross-examination of Raymond. If these allegations 


were true and Raymond c ould remember them, they would have been stated in the pleadings and his AEIC. Also, Angeline’s evidenc e did not mention that Sebastian was present during some of these oc c asions. Given the importanc e of suc h an allegation in the c ontext of sec ret trusts, this omission was signific ant. Furthermore, I find it remarkable that after so many years, Raymond was able to remember, without the aid of any doc umentary evidenc e or other pointers, what had purportedly transpired on eac h of these five oc c asions down to the details as to whic h c ash gifts were mentioned on eac h oc c asion. Raymond’s oral evidenc e was also different from the AEICs of Mdm Low, Angeline and Raymond himself whic h suggested that all the c ash gifts were mentioned on eac h of the several oc c asions. In my view, Raymond was making up his oral evidenc e as he went along. 

117    Again, Mdm Low herself suggested that Mr Ng did not disc uss the nature of his illness with her at all. Yet, the plaintiffs were alleging that Mr Ng had mentioned to her from time to time various spec ific gifts and this was done in the presenc e of Raymond with whom Mr Ng also did not disc uss the nature of his illness. 

118    Raymond also said that he did not c hec k with Sebastian, after Mr Ng’s demise, about the c ash gifts for various family members inc luding himself and his c hildren. Neither did Angeline c hec k with Sebastian about the various c ash gifts. There is also no evidenc e that Mdm Low had asked Sebastian spec ific ally about the c ash gifts she had been told about. Although there was evidenc e that Sebastian was asked to distribute Mr Ng’s assets, this is different from Sebastian being asked about the spec ific c ash gifts. In my view, if Mr Ng had mentioned suc h c ash gifts, Mdm Low or Raymond or Angeline would have asked Sebastian about the same espec ially after the Will was read and every other family member would have learned that Sebastian was the sole benefic iary. That neither of these three persons questioned Sebastian about the c ash gifts suggested that the allegations about the c ash gifts were untrue. 

119    I find the evidenc e of Mdm Low, Raymond and Angeline on the c ash gifts to be unreliable. 

120    I c ome now to paragraph 7.12 of the statement of c laim whic h alleged that Mr Ng told Angeline at the hospital sometime in Dec ember 2000 about the c ash gifts as well as the gift of 1A Wiltshire to Mdm Low. I have already dealt with the alleged gift of 1A Wiltshire and said I found Angeline’s evidenc e thereon unreliable. As for Angeline’s evidenc e about Mr Ng telling her about the c ash gifts, I do not find Angeline’s evidenc e any more reliable than her evidenc e on 1A Wiltshire or on the alleged c onversations thereon between Mr Ng and Mdm Low in her presenc e. 

121    I c ome now to paragraph 7.13 to 7.15 of the statement of c laim. Paragraph 7.13 alleged that in or about January 2001, Mdm Low was asked to transfer her shares to Sebastian. Paragraph 7.14 alleged that Sebastian told Mdm Low, Raymond, Calista and Edwina about the c ash gifts in Mdm Low’s room. Paragraph 7.15 alleged that after Mdm Low told Sebastian he was not transferring her shares to Sebastian, Sebastian then announc ed that the c ash gifts were c anc elled or words to that effec t. As these paragraphs stood, Sebastian mentioned the c ash gifts and he also mentioned subsequently that they were c anc elled. If he was representing Mr Ng’s wishes when he purportedly announc ed the c ash gifts, he might also have been representing Mr Ng’s wishes when he purportedly announc ed the c anc ellation of the c ash gifts. The plaintiffs did not seem to realise this when these paragraphs were pleaded. As I have mentioned in [78] above, it was only in the c ourse of Raymond’s oral evidenc e that he alleged that after Sebastian announc ed the c anc ellation, he (Raymond) had spoken to Mr Ng and Mr Ng said what Sebastian had said about the c anc ellation was nonsense and not to listen to Sebastian. 

122    Aside from the fac t that Raymond’s allegation was not pleaded, I do not believe that he spoke to Mr Ng or Mr Ng spoke to him as alleged. This was a person who c laimed he did not know about the 


nature of Mr Ng’s illness even though he was in attendanc e every day when Mr Ng was in hospital and he c ared daily for Mr Ng at 1A Wiltshire after Mr Ng was disc harged from hospital. As mentioned, Raymond was staying at 1A Wiltshire. Raymond was also assisting to fetc h Mr Ng from time to time to c linic s. It is c lear to me that his task was to run errands for Mr Ng and help c are for Mr Ng while Mr Ng was at home or in the hospital. He was not involved in the dec isions of the family business although he was a non-exec utive direc tor of the subsidiary. He would not have disc ussed financ ial matters suc h as the c ash gifts with Mr Ng or Mr Ng with him. Furthermore, if Mr Ng had learned and said what Raymond was alleging, Mr Ng would have realised that Sebastian was not to be trusted and would have amended his Will to spec ific ally set out the c ash gifts. He did not do so. 

123    In addition, I do not ac c ept the plaintiffs’ evidenc e, whic h Sebastian disputed, that Sebastian had announc ed the c ash gifts and the c anc ellation thereof. I have found Mdm Low and Raymond’s evidenc e on other allegations about the c ash gifts to be unreliable. I see no reason to c onc lude differently for their evidenc e on their allegations about the c ash gifts as stated in paragraphs 7.14 to 7.15. Calista did not give evidenc e about the allegations in these paragraphs. As for Edwina, her evidenc e on disputed matters was also generally unreliable. 

124    Paragraph 7.16 of the statement of c laim alleged that in or about 31 January 2001, Mr Ng told Mdm Chou at the hospital that he had provided for her family. Paragraph 7.17 alleged that in or about February 2001, Mr Ng told Mdm Chou, in the presenc e of her son, that he had provided for their family. These allegations are vague and I need say no more about them. 

125    Paragraph 7.19 of the statement of c laim alleged that in the months that followed Mr Ng’s demise, Sebastian told Angeline that Mr Ng had willed his assets to Sebastian as a trustee to be held on trust for other family members. Sebastian asked Angeline whether he should distribute to the others “their respec tive entitlements” or hold onto the same. Angeline replied he should distribute in ac c ordanc e with Mr Ng’s wishes but Sebastian first kept quiet, then refused outright. Sebastian disputed this allegation. 

126    The pleading itself was vague. What was meant by “their respec tive entitlements”? Did this refer to the c ash gifts only or all the gifts whic h are the subjec t of the c laims or entitlements in ac c ordanc e with the number of c hildren or entitlements as though Mr Ng died intestate or entitlements as determined by Sebastian? 

127    In any event, I do not ac c ept Angeline’s evidenc e about this allegation. First, she is not a reliable witness. Sec ondly, if, as the plaintiffs were suggesting, Sebastian had been deliberately delaying any distribution by falsely telling them that probate had not yet been extrac ted, there was no reason for him to seek Angeline’s views. He would have already made up his mind to keep the assets for himself. Thirdly, Sebastian struc k me as a c onfident and self-assured person. If Mr Ng had given him instruc tions about spec ific gifts, he would either have c omplied or disobeyed. He would not have c onsulted Angeline only to disobey when he did not like her advic e. 

128    Paragraph 7.22 of the statement of c laim alleged that on or about the night of 29 May 2001, Sebastian had brought Angeline to his home, showed her some doc uments whic h he c laimed were Mr Ng’s bank ac c ounts and said “not so muc h, how to distribute” or words to that effec t. Sebastian denied he said this. Angeline’s allegation suggested that other family members or she herself had told Sebastian about the c ash gifts before 29 May 2001 and Sebastian was responding to say that Mr Ng did not have enough assets to effec t the c ash gifts. However, there was no evidenc e that anyone had spoken to Sebastian about the c ash gifts before 29 May 2001. Indeed, it was his point that before the c ommenc ement of the ac tion, no one had made any c laim of him for any of the alleged gifts, whether c ash or otherwise. 


129    I do not ac c ept Angeline’s evidenc e on the allegation in paragraph 7.22 of the statement of c laim. 

130    Paragraph 7.27 alleged that on several oc c asions before and even after the reading of the Will at the offic e of Helen Yeo & Partners, Mdm Low and other family members had asked Sebastian when he was going to distribute to them “their respec tive entitlements” and he kept putting them off by saying that probate proc eedings had not been c onc luded and onc e they were c onc luded, he would distribute ac c ordingly. Paragraph 7.28 alleged that, unknown to the plaintiffs, Sebastian had filed a petition for grant of probate on or about 11 June 2001 and probate was granted on 15 June 2001. The allegation in paragraph 7.28 about “their respec tive entitlements” was vague as I have already mentioned in [126] above. 

131    As for the allegation that the plaintiffs were unaware that Sebastian had petitioned for grant of probate, paragraph 62 of Mdm Low’s AEIC and paragraph 43 of Edwina’s AEIC suggested that had other family members been aware of the same, they would have c ontested the probate proc eedings. I should therefore elaborate on some c orrespondenc e between the parties about Mr Ng’s Will and probate and the evidenc e of the plaintiffs thereon. 

132    Seven family members had signed a letter dated 16 May 2001 to Sebastian. The seven were Mdm Low, Sunny, Ric ky, Raymond, Calista, Jenny and Edwina. 

The letter stated: 

 OPENING OF OUR LATE FATHER’S WILL AND OTHER MATTERS 

 Further to the several disc ussions between ourselves, you informed us that you are one of the Exec utors of our Late Father’s Will. 

 We would be grateful if you would kindly:

 (1) provide us with the name of the solic itors (with proper referenc e to the solic itor) that prepared the Will and 

 (2) advise us on a suitable date whereby we c an attend at the solic itors’ offic e or suc h other plac e that may be c onvenient to witness the opening of the Will. 

 We would be very grateful if you would kindly revert in writing to us on the above matters by 4.00 p.m. Monday, the 22nd May 2001. 

 We thank you for your kind assistanc e and we look forward to hearing from you soon. 

133    The evidenc e for the plaintiffs was that the other family members only knew about the existenc e of a formal Will at the time when the Will was read to various family members and the referenc e to the Will in the letter dated 16 May 2001 was merely a referenc e to Mr Ng’s wishes. It transpired that the letter was drafted by a friend of Sunny. Nevertheless, in my view, that friend would only draft what he had been instruc ted and the c ontents of the letter made it c lear that Sebastian had already informed the signatories thereof about the existenc e of a formal Will. 

134    I find the evidenc e for the plaintiffs that the letter was referring only to Mr Ng’s wishes and not his formal Will to be unbelievable. 


135    Furthermore, the plaintiffs alleged that the letter was to ask Sebastian “to c larify the status of the Dec eased’s Estate and when would the family members be getting their respec tive entitlements under the trusts the Dec eased provided for”, see, for example, paragraph 55 of Mdm Low’s AEIC, paragraph 53 of Raymond’s AEIC, paragraph 17 of Sunny’s AEIC and paragraph 36 of Edwina’s AEIC. These allegations were absurd. The letter was not asking for c larific ation of the status of Mr Ng’s estate or when other family members would be getting their respec tive entitlements. It was simply asking for the names of the solic itors who prepared the Will and for a date when the Will would be read. 

136    I c ome now to Sebastian’s response to the letter dated 16 May 2001. He replied by letter dated 21 May 2001 to eac h of the signatories of the letter dated 16 May 2001. Although his letter was sent to the address of the subsidiary at 136 Neil Road, it was not disputed that those family members had rec eived his reply before the Will was read. His reply stated: 

 I refer to your letter dated 16 May 2001 whic h I only rec eived on 19 May 2001. 

 As I have told you all previously, our late father appointed me as the sole exec utor and benefic iary of his estate. As suc h, I have sinc e instruc ted my solic itors, M/s Helen Yeo & Partners, to prepare and thereafter file into c ourt the Petition for Probate on my behalf. 

137    It is c lear from his reply that he had said that he had given instruc tions to Helen Yeo & Partners to apply for grant of probate. Yet, the plaintiffs’ statement of c laim and c ertain AEICs, as set out above, were suggesting that the other family members were unaware that he was applying for grant of probate until after the event. This reflec ted another absurd position of the plaintiffs and demonstrated onc e again how they were prepared to adopt positions whic h were c ontrary to doc umentary evidenc e. Suc h instanc es reflec ted poorly on their overall c redibility. 

**A note made on 28 June 2001** 

138    Paragraph 7.30 of the statement of c laim referred to a memorandum written by Sunny on 28 June 2001. As this was one of the partic ulars provided under paragraph 7 of the statement of c laim, the purpose of referring to this note was apparently to suggest that Sebastian was ac knowledging his duty not to keep everything for himself and to distribute Mr Ng’s assets among other family members. The note stated: 

 (1) House (9) share 

 (2) For c hina girl $700 per month up to Primary six. 

 (3) Mother $160,000 

 (For Ah Huat $100,000 

 Gold $60,000) 

 (4) China 1,000 – 2,000 per month 

 (5) Balanc e of money up to famil dsc e. 

139    Part of the handwriting for item 5 was illegible. Paragraph 33 of Sunny’s AEIC said item 5 was to mean that the balanc e of Mr Ng’s money was up to the mother to dec ide. However, at trial, Sunny 


interpreted it to read as the balanc e of Mr Ng’s money being for the family to dec ide. 

140    There was a notation written by Lee Kok Leong at the bottom of the note stating, “I c onfirm the above with Sunny and Sebastian on 28/6/01”. 

141    Paragraph 166 of Sebastian’s supplementary AEIC said he did not rec all seeing the memorandum. He surmised that the memorandum was ac tually a proposal from Sunny as Sunny and his other siblings had made many proposals to him at that time. Sebastian also said there was no need for him to involve Lee Kok Leong in a family matter. In his oral evidenc e, Sebastian refuted having made the proposal in the memorandum. On this point, I am not inc lined to believe Sebastian. If he was right, it would mean that Lee Kok Leong had fabric ated his notation and I do not think Lee Kok Leong, who has no direc t interest in the matter, would have done so. 

142    Nevertheless, even though I find against Sebastian on this point, the memorandum itself was not c onsistent with the plaintiffs’ c laims. That is why they relied on it only to suggest that Sebastian was admitting to some sort of liability. To me, that is too vague espec ially sinc e it was not c lear what the referenc e to the balanc e of Mr Ng’s money meant. Indeed, it was Sebastian’s position, whic h I shall elaborate on later, that in any event, Mr Ng did not have enough to make the alleged c ash gifts. Given that Sebastian was being pressed to make some sort of distribution, I find the memorandum to be of little probative value. He c ould have made the proposal in an attempt to deflec t the pressure being mounted on him. In any event, the proposal was not ac c epted. 

143    I would also add that I note that paragraph 17 of Lee Kok Leong’s AEIC asserted that Sebastian reneged on the agreement c ontained in this memorandum. This suggested that there was a c onc luded agreement between the parties. It seems to me that Lee Kok Leong was mistaken. Even Sunny’s AEIC did not allege that the memorandum c onstituted or evidenc ed an agreement between the parties. Neither was the plaintiffs’ pleaded c laim or submission on the basis that the memorandum c onstituted or evidenc ed an agreement between the parties. 

**The size of Mr Ng’s estate** 

144    One of Sebastian’s arguments was that Mr Ng c ould not have made the c ash gifts bec ause he did not have enough assets to do so. If his shares and 1A Wiltshire were to be given to Mdm Low, as c laimed, the balanc e of his estate was insuffic ient to make the c ash gifts and this was all the more so c onsidering that he was a debtor of the subsidiary. As Mr Ng would be aware of his assets and liabilities, he would not have made the c ash gifts. 

145    This argument was on the premise that Mr Ng’s assets were limited to those disc losed by Sebastian for estate duty purposes. The plaintiffs disputed that Mr Ng’s assets were so limited. 

146    There was one asset disc losed as US$45,097.35 being c ash in the house when in fac t, the money was in a bank ac c ount. This suggested that there might have been both c ash in the house as well as money in that bank ac c ount. Sebastian’s attempt to explain why that sum was disc losed as c ash in the house was c onvoluted. I need not go into that explanation exc ept to say that it was not persuasive. 

147    It was also disputed whether the net sale proc eeds of the previous family home at 36 Poole Road belonged in part to Mr Ng and in part to Sebastian or was entirely Mr Ng’s or entirely Sebastian’s. As Sebastian c laimed that at least half was his (sinc e he was a c o-owner of the property at 36 Poole Road), that half was not inc luded as part of Mr Ng’s assets. The other half of the sale proc eeds had, ac c ording to Sebastian, been used to help pay for 1A Wiltshire or some other purpose. 


148    The evidenc e suggested to me that Mr Ng had treated monies held in a joint ac c ount with Sebastian, whic h inc luded the unutilised balanc e of the sale proc eeds from 36 Poole Road, as available for his (Mr Ng’s) use. Likewise, as regards the money of the subsidiary. If Mr Ng had wanted to make the c ash gifts in question, he would have told Sebastian so and assumed that Sebastian would see to it that his wishes were c arried out. 

149    In any event, as I have found that the plaintiffs have not made out any of their c laims for the c ash or other gifts, it is not nec essary for me to make any finding on the size of Mr Ng’s estate after taking into ac c ount his liabilities. Whatever is left belongs to Sebastian. 

**The preparation and execution of the Will** 

150    The validity of Mr Ng’s Will was not c hallenged in the pleadings. Nevertheless, as the plaintiffs’ submissions made serious allegations in respec t of the preparation and exec ution of the Will, I will deal with the more serious allegations of the plaintiffs. 

151    It was Alan Lee’s evidenc e that in early November 2000, Mr Ng had c alled him to say that he wanted a will drawn up leaving everything to Sebastian. They spoke in Hokkien. Mr Ng had asked whether it was nec essary to list out all his assets but Alan Lee advised him this was not nec essary. Mr Ng had instruc ted that Sebastian was to be the sole exec utor. When Alan Lee advised him that it was better to have another exec utor in c ase anything should happen to Sebastian, Mr Ng nominated Sebastian’s wife to be the alternate exec utor. Alan Lee then instruc ted a junior solic itor to prepare the Will. Mr Ng subsequently c ontac ted Alan Lee to find out if the Will was ready and he said it was. Mr Ng mentioned that he was going to hospital on 27 November 2000 and wanted to exec ute the Will then. As he was going to the hospital, Alan Lee suggested that Mr Ng should have a doc tor present when he exec uted the Will. As Mr Ng mentioned that his hand was a little bit unsteady, Alan Lee said he c ould exec ute the Will by using his right thumb print. Subsequently, Alan Lee attended to Mr Ng in his hospital room in the afternoon of 27 November 2000. He interpreted the Will to Mr Ng although he did not go through it line by line with Mr Ng. The other witness there also c onfirmed with Mr Ng that he was giving everything to Sebastian. Sebastian was in the room until the time of exec ution when he left the room. Mr Ng exec uted two Wills. Alan Lee gave one to Sebastian and kept the other. Alan Lee rec eived a c ertific ate dated 27 November 2000 signed by two doc tors c ertifying that Mr Ng was of sound mind when he signed the Will. The doc tors had been present when Alan Lee was disc ussing the Will with Mr Ng in his hospital room. 

152    The evidenc e for the plaintiffs suggested that something was amiss bec ause Mr Ng had exec uted the Will using his thumbprint. For example, paragraph 24 of Sunny’s AEIC alleged that Mr Ng never exec uted any doc ument using his thumbprint. Paragraph 25 of his AEIC also alleged that after the date the Will was signed, Mr Ng c ontinued to exec ute doc uments by signing his full name in Chinese. Paragraph 43 of Angeline’s AEIC was similar to paragraph 24 of Sunny’s AEIC. However, Angeline went further. Paragraph 44 of her AEIC alleged that Mr Ng onc e told her before he passed away that he had exec uted a Will using just his thumbprint and not the usual signature of his name using Chinese c harac ters. The reason was so that the Will c ould be c hallenged in c ase Sebastian did not keep his word to distribute to the other family members. Paragraph 44 of her AEIC was vague. What did Sebastian agree to distribute and in what amounts or proportions? More importantly, Angeline’s paragraph 44 was a serious allegation about the exec ution of the Will. Yet, the Will was not being c hallenged and Angeline c onfirmed that she was aware of the non-c hallenge in the c laim (NE 13/11/2006 at pg 84). Neither was this material c onversation with Mr Ng alluded to in the pleaded partic ulars of the sec ret trusts. Thirdly, if Angeline’s evidenc e was true, it would mean that Mr Ng had reservations about Sebastian’s integrity. On the other hand, the plaintiffs were also asserting that he enjoyed Mr Ng’s absolute trust. I find the allegations about Mr Ng’s use of his thumb to exec ute the 


Will and the c onversation he was supposed to have had with Angeline to be illustrative again of the inc onsistenc y and desperation of the plaintiffs. 

153    To make matters worse for the plaintiffs, their c losing submission suggested that sinc e Alan Lee had mentioned that Mr Ng signed two Wills and only one Will had been disc losed, the other Will might have c ontained terms or an annexure c ontaining terms different from that found in the Will disc losed. I found this suggestion startling. It was c lear to me that when Alan Lee was talking about two Wills, he meant two Wills c ontaining the same terms. There was nothing to give rise to this belated and audac ious suggestion. This suggestion was not explored with Alan Lee while he was being c rossexamined. Furthermore, if the suggestion had any semblanc e of truth, it would mean that Alan Lee had dec eived Mr Ng into signing Wills with different c ontents. Yet, no suc h ac c usation was levelled at Alan Lee while he was c ross-examined. 

154    The plaintiffs also sought to suggest in their submission that bec ause Alan Lee had mentioned the existenc e of a draft of the Will whic h initially required Mr Ng to exec ute by signature and no suc h draft had been disc losed, Sebastian had suppressed c ruc ial evidenc e. It was submitted that there c ould have been a draft or drafts showing the true intention of Mr Ng to benefit other members of the family. This submission was linked with another point, that is, the list of benefic iaries whic h Edwina had mentioned in her AEIC. It was submitted that the list c ould have been the undisc losed draft or a c omponent of the same. It seems to me that Sebastian might not have known about the existenc e of the initial draft. In any event, he would have been guided by Helen Yeo & Partners on disc losure of doc uments in the files of Helen Yeo & Partners (now Rodyk & Davidson). Not all solic itors keep every draft. Furthermore, it was again not suggested to Alan Lee during c ross-examination that the initial draft was in any way materially different from the engrossed Will. The only point whic h c ame out from his evidenc e about the initial draft was that it was to be exec uted by signature and not thumbprint and the initial draft was amended to one to be exec uted by thumbprint. 

155    The plaintiffs also submitted that Alan Lee was c learly biased in favour of Sebastian bec ause he had c onc ealed in his AEICs the fac t that he had ac ted for Sebastian and his wife for many years. It was said that this information had to be prised out of Alan Lee during c ross-examination (see paragraphs 95 and 96 of PCS). 

156    I am of the view that the submission that the information had to be prised out of Alan Lee is an exaggeration. He had no hesitation disc losing suc h information when asked. It is understandable that he did not disc lose that information in his AEIC bec ause he was giving his AEIC as the solic itor for Mr Ng in the preparation and exec ution of Mr Ng’s Will and not as solic itor for Sebastian. 

157    True, Alan Lee c annot be said to be a c ompletely independent witness in the trial but the Will remained unc hallenged. I would add that it was also not suggested to him at trial that he was biased. 

158    The plaintiffs also submitted that Mr Ng was almost blind in the left eye from c atarac t and glauc oma and did not have his reading glasses on the day he signed the Will. However, it was not Alan Lee’s evidenc e that Mr Ng was able to read the c ontents of the Will but that he had interpreted the c ontents of the Will to Mr Ng. The fac t that he did not do so line by line was irrelevant sinc e the Will remained unc hallenged. In the c irc umstanc es, it was also not open to the plaintiffs to suggest that Mr Ng was not in a position to c onfirm whether his wishes were c orrec tly set out in the Will. 

159    I find the plaintiffs’ various allegations about the Will to be desperate and irresponsible. They c annot justify suc h allegations by the exc use that the evidenc e on the preparation and exec ution of the Will c ame out only at the trial. 


160    First, for example, Alan Lee’s first AEIC sworn on 11 September 2006 had already mentioned that Mr Ng had exec uted two c opies of the Will. The plaintiffs knew only one was exhibited. The plaintiffs had plenty of time to c onsider whether they wanted to make an issue of it. 

161    Sec ondly, while it is true that some of Alan Lee’s evidenc e c ame out only at trial, the plaintiffs, who were represented by c ounsel, c ould and should have dec ided what suggestions they wanted to make to him at trial and, if nec essary, apply to amend their pleadings. No applic ation to amend was made although I had reminded their c ounsel about the state of their pleadings. No suggestion of the sort found in PCS was made to Alan Lee. The plaintiffs c annot c hoose to go beyond the perimeters they have set for themselves just bec ause they now feel like doing so. 

**The submission that the Will does not record the full intention of Mr Ng** 

162    The plaintiffs submitted that the Will did not rec ord all of Mr Ng’s intention. They relied on the fac t that Sebastian had admitted that Mr Ng had told him to let Mdm Low stay in 1A Wiltshire. Also, Sebastian had admitted that Mr Ng had instruc ted him to pay for a tombstone for Mr Ng in China. These two instruc tions were not stipulated in the Will. 

163    In my view, these two instruc tions do not advanc e the plaintiffs’ c laims. It is not unc ommon for a testator to give instruc tions of the sort disc losed whic h are not stipulated in a Will. Furthermore, suc h instruc tions may not be intended to be legally binding. It is still for the plaintiffs to establish the spec ific c laims, a burden whic h they ac knowledge. 

**“Wei tok”** 

164    The plaintiffs also submitted that witnesses of Sebastian, other than Alan Lee, had said that Mr Ng had told them he was leaving everything to Sebastian but their evidenc e was that Mr Ng had used the Hokkien words “wei tok” whic h means “entrusted” whereas “wei c hok” means “Will”. For reasons whic h I shall elaborate on later, I find the evidenc e of these other witnesses generally unreliable and I doubt if Mr Ng even mentioned to them his intentions about his Will. I would add that Alan Lee was c lear that Mr Ng did not use the words “wei tok”. 

165    However, I note that Sebastian’s evidenc e was that Mr Ng did say “wei tok” to him although Sebastian then said it c ould be “wei tok” or “wei c hok”. I believe that Mr Ng had said “wei tok” to Sebastian but what would the c onsequenc e be? As I have mentioned, there must be more than a moral obligation. The words “wei tok” are c onsistent with an intention to entrust everything to Sebastian with a moral obligation to take c are of family members as Sebastian thought fit. The words in themselves would not translate into a legal obligation to make spec ific gifts. 

**Sebastian’s other witnesses** 

166    Aside from Alan Lee, Sebastian had three other witnesses as mentioned in [17] above. 

167    Huang Fu Chuan (“Huang”) said he was Mr Ng’s nephew in that he was the son of a c ousin of Mr Ng. He was a retired c onstruc tion worker residing in rented ac c ommodation in Hong Kong S.A.R. (“HK SAR”). He lived on his savings and financ ial support from his c hildren. Paragraph 8 of his AEIC stated that during the last months of Mr Ng’s life, Mr Ng had told him on many oc c asions in China and in HK SAR that he was leaving his entire estate to Sebastian. The last time Mr Ng told him this was in or around Marc h 2001 when Huang was preparing to return to HK SAR from Singapore. 

168    Paragraphs 9 to 12 of Huang’s AEIC stated his observations of Mr Ng’s relationship with his 


immediate family members and an inc ident in February 2001 when Mdm Low allegedly asked Mr Ng for $500,000 whic h evoked a furious response from Mr Ng. 

169    In oral evidenc e, he initially said that when he c ame to Singapore in August 2006, it was to prepare his AEIC for the present c ase. However, he then c hanged his evidenc e and said it was to try and rec onc ile Mr Ng’s family members. When he was told by Sebastian that the c ase had already gone to c ourt and the hearing would c ommenc e shortly, he dec ided not to meet up with the other family members. Yet, the ac tion had already been filed in February 2006. Huang would have known that before taking the trouble to c ome down to Singapore in August 2006. Furthermore, he admitted that he did not know the other family members well. Therefore, he was not in a position to influenc e them or advise them to rec onc ile. It was also illogic al that he should embark on a mission to bring rec onc iliation whic h entailed his flying to Singapore and then abandon the mission without even talking to any of the other family members just bec ause Sebastian told him the c ase had already started and the hearing would c ommenc e shortly. His exc use was that he was not familiar with Singapore law but he already knew about this lac k of familiarity before he c ame to Singapore in August 2006. I am of the view that Huang had lied when he c hanged his evidenc e on the purpose of his visit to Singapore in August 2006. He was entitled to c ome to Singapore in August 2006 to prepare his AEIC for Sebastian but obviously he thought that this might demonstrate partiality on his part and so he c ame up with a different reason. 

170    Huang also said he had been to Singapore in Oc tober 2006 and subsequently in Marc h 2007. The trip in Oc tober 2006 was to find out the progress of the present c ase. The trip in Marc h 2007 was in antic ipation of his having to give oral evidenc e whic h was in fac t given from 23 to 25 April 2007. Notwithstanding his financ ial situation and the purpose of his trips to Singapore, Huang said Sebastian did not pay and did not offer to pay for any of his expenses. His airfare and ac c ommodation and other expenses were paid by himself or his daughter or a c ousin or a brother. I find this unbelievable. 

171    It is c lear to me that Huang was prepared to say anything to avoid any suggestion of partiality on his part. In so doing, he demonstrated his unreliability as a witness. 

172    In yet another demonstration of his unreliability this time on a point of spec ific relevanc e, Huang said during c ross-examination, that Mr Ng had mentioned twic e that he was giving everything to Sebastian, onc e in HK SAR and the sec ond time in China. He c onfirmed during c ross-examination that there was no third oc c asion in either of these two plac es or anywhere else (see NE 25/4/07, pg 9 to 15) when Mr Ng mentioned this again to him. Yet, when paragraph 8 of his AEIC (see [167] above) was pointed out to him in re-examination, he c onfirmed that the last time Mr Ng mentioned this to him was in or around Marc h 2001 when Huang was preparing to return to HK SAR from Singapore. When he was asked why he did not mention that last oc c asion in c ross-examination, his lame exc use was that he was not asked whether Mr Ng had said this in Singapore (NE 25/4/07, pg 26 and 27). 

173    Tai Yun Shan (“Tai”) said in his AEIC that he was a c lose personal friend of Mr Ng and was retired. He had been working in United Malayan Bank Corporation Berhad (“UMBC”) and was handling the ac c ount of the subsidiary. 

174    Paragraphs 8 and 9 of Tai’s AEIC stated that it was obvious to him that Mr Ng did not have a good relationship with his c hildren, save for Sebastian. On the many oc c asions that he saw Mr Ng, he rarely saw any of the other sons, apart from Sebastian and he never saw any of Mr Ng’s other c hildren speak to him. Paragraph 10 mentioned an oc c asion when Mr Ng told him that Ric ky had lost a lot of money in gambling. Paragraph 11 stated that on another oc c asion, Mr Ng told him that Sunny had sold houses whic h Mr Ng had bought for Sunny and Mr Ng looked unhappy then. Paragraph 12 stated that Tai c ould see from his interac tion with Mr Ng that he was not happy with Raymond. 


Paragraph 19 stated that on one oc c asion in 2000 or 2001, when Tai visited Mr Ng in hospital, Mr Ng told him that he would give everything to Sebastian. Tai c larified in oral evidenc e that this was said in the presenc e of a group of friends. 

175    Tai elaborated that he was 89 years old when he was giving oral evidenc e. He had retired about 24 years ago. He had had c offee with Mr Ng from time to time when he was at UMBC and after he retired. However, Tai was inc onsistent as to whether this ac tivity c ontinued up to the time when Mr Ng was first hospitalised in 2000. First, he said it stopped after Raymond’s wedding in November 1991, then he suggested it c ontinued and then he appeared to ac c ept that it stopped. 

176    Also, although he took the trouble to make an observation about Mr Ng’s relationship with Raymond in his AEIC, he then asked whether that relationship was important or related to the c ase when he was c ross-examined about his own evidenc e on it (see NE 7/5/07, pg 60). 

177    As for his evidenc e about what Mr Ng said to him in the presenc e of a group of friends, he said they were definitely Mr Ng’s friends but made the strange remark, “Whether or not they were my friends, it depends” (NE 8/5/07, pg 4). He ac c epted that he had no rec ollec tion of the identity of the group of friends. 

178    As for what Mr Ng told him about giving everything to Sebastian, he said Mr Ng had used the Hokkien words “c hu li” whic h means “handle” or “deal with” (NE 7/5/07, pg 48) and “kao” meaning “hand over” or “deliver” (NE 7/5/07, pg 50). However, when he c ontinued to give evidenc e the next day, his evidenc e shifted. He said Mr Ng had used the Hokkien word “hor” meaning “give to”, that is, Mr Ng was giving to Sebastian his assets. When asked, he denied he had disc ussed his evidenc e with anyone sinc e the break in the evening of the day before (NE 8/5/07, pg 6 and 7). It seems to me that he was tailoring his evidenc e the next day to suit Sebastian’s position. 

179    After c onsidering Tai’s evidenc e in its entirety, I find him to be an unreliable witness. 

180    I c ome now to the third witness (of the three witnesses), Mr Ng Koon Ting (“Koon Ting”). In his AEIC, he stated that he was a c lose friend of Mr Ng. He had worked for Mr Ng as his personal driver and general offic e assistant and stopped in the 1980, due to health reasons. 

181    Paragraphs 10 and 11 of his AEIC stated that Mr Ng told him that he often quarrelled with Mdm Low about his c hildren’s demands for money and that he had witnessed some of the quarrels. Mr Ng also told him that as a result of the quarrels, they hardly spoke to eac h other. Paragraph 12 stated that he observed Mdm Low to be a thrifty person but she would not hesitate to use her money to pay off her c hildren’s debts. Paragraph 14 stated that despite the strained relationship between Mr Ng and Mdm Low, he c ontinued to pay for her expenses. 

182    Paragraphs 15 to 22 c ontained Koon Ting’s evidenc e on Mr Ng’s relationship with various c hildren. In paragraph 24, he stated that on one oc c asion in 2001, when Mr Ng’s health worsened, Mr Ng told him he was giving 1A Wiltshire to Sebastian. 

183    However, I find Koon Ting to be generally an unreliable witness. I need mention only one aspec t of his oral evidenc e to illustrate why I say this. Raymond had telephoned Koon Ting on 29 May 2006 to c hec k whether he had heard Mr Ng saying that he would give everything to Sebastian. Unknown to Koon Ting then, the c onversation was rec orded by Raymond. The transc ript thereof apparently showed that Koon Ting was saying that he did not hear Mr Ng saying he would give everything to Sebastian. 


184    However, Koon Ting gave a different version of that c onversation even though the rec ording was played for him to hear and he had had the benefit of the transc ript and the assistanc e of an interpreter. He suggested that an initial unimportant part of the c onversation when Raymond inquired how he was and his response was exc luded from the rec ording. More importantly, he said Raymond had asked him whether he was present when Mr Ng made his Will and he replied he was not. That was not what was rec orded. Also, Koon Ting was saying that some parts of the rec ording were not his words and the voic e said to be his voic e was not his. Yet he was not suggesting that the rec ording had been fabric ated even though I gave him the opportunity to say so. Furthermore, the rec ording and the transc ript had been made available to Sebastian’s solic itors earlier and they in turn had spoken to Koon Ting about it before. When Raymond was giving evidenc e, it was not suggested to him that the rec ording was in any way inac c urate. Yet, here Koon Ting was giving a version of the c onversation with Raymond different from what was rec orded (NE 22/5/07, pg 21 to 36). 

185    Ac c ordingly, as I have mentioned, I did not give any weight to the evidenc e of any of these three witnesses on c ontentious issues. 

**Whether Sebastian was willing to disregard Mr Ng’s instructions** 

186    The plaintiffs submitted that in another instanc e, Sebastian had demonstrated that he was willing to disregard Mr Ng’s instruc tions in his Will. Clause 2(ii) of the Will provided that the exec utor was to use Mr Ng’s estate to pay his debts, funeral and testamentary expenses. In Suit No. 464 of 2005, Sebastian had refused to pay the funeral and testamentary expenses and wanted the subsidiary to pay the same. It was submitted that he maintained this position all the way up to the trial and finally c hanged his mind after being c ross-examined. This showed that he had no intention of obeying Mr Ng’s written wishes muc h less Mr Ng’s oral wishes c ommunic ated to him (PCS paragraph 65). 

187    On the other hand, Sebastian submitted that the c laim for him to pay suc h expenses was not initially based on the terms of the Will. When it was drawn to his attention that the terms of the Will provided for the exec utor to pay suc h expenses from the estate, he willingly agreed. 

188    Looking at some notes of evidenc e in that c ase and the remarks of the trial judge there, I am of the view that Sebastian’s version portrayed the situation more ac c urately. 

189    Therefore, even if the evidenc e of Sebastian’s c onduc t in that ac tion was admissible in the ac tion before me, suc h evidenc e c arried little probative value in the light of Sebastian’s c larific ation. Signific antly, the burden was still on the plaintiffs to prove the oral gifts made by Mr Ng before it c ould be said that Sebastian was willing to disregard them. For reasons I have stated, the plaintiffs have failed to do so. 

**Whether the other family members knew about the Will before Mr Ng’s demise** 

190    Sebastian asserted that the other family members knew before Mr Ng’s demise that Mr Ng had made a Will. He also suggested that they knew about the terms of the Will and it was open to them to ask Mr Ng to c hange his Will as Ric ky allegedly did. The plaintiffs main witnesses denied that they had known about the Will and its terms before Mr Ng’s demise. 

191    I need not elaborate on the evidenc e on this issue whic h I find to be inadequate to persuade me that the plaintiffs knew about the existenc e and the terms of the Will before Mr Ng’s demise. Even if they had known, suc h knowledge does not in itself rule out the existenc e of sec ret trusts. 


**Conclusion** 

192    Interestingly, it appears that the only formal demand that was made of Sebastian before the present ac tion was filed, was a demand dated 26 September 2005 by Arul Chew & Partners for the return of Mdm Low’s jewellery whic h, as I have mentioned, is not even the subjec t of the present ac tion. 

193    Although Sebastian has not been entirely truthful, neither have the plaintiffs on whom the burden of proof lies. The plaintiffs’ evidenc e is fraught with inc onsistenc ies and is unreliable. 

194    I am of the view that Mr Ng gave his entire estate to Sebastian in the expec tation that Sebastian would do right by the other family members. He left it entirely to Sebastian, whom he trusted, to dec ide what to do with his estate. Sebastian will have to be dic tated by his c onsc ienc e but there is no legal obligation on him. The plaintiffs have failed to prove their c ase and I dismiss their c laims. 

195    I will hear the parties on c osts.
