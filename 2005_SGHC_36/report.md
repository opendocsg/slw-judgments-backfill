Yong Pung How CJ: 

1       This was an appeal against the dec ision of a distric t judge, in whic h Jagir Singh Touwana (“the appellant”) was c onvic ted of parking at unbroken double yellow lines under r 22(b) of the Road Traffic Rules (Cap 276, R 20, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Road Traffic Rules”), and sentenc ed to a fine of $700, and in default thereof, seven days’ imprisonment, under s 131(1A) of the Road Traffic Ac t (Cap 276, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the RTA”). The most rec ent version of the RTA is the 2004 revised edition, where s 131(1A) has been renumbered s 131(2). At the time the appellant was c harged, however, only the 1997 revised edition of the RTA was in forc e. Ac c ordingly, all mention of the RTA in this Grounds of Dec ision is made with referenc e to the 1997 revised edition. 

2       The appellant appealed against both c onvic tion and sentenc e. I dismissed the appeals, and now set out my reasons. 

**The facts** 

3       The appellant was c harged with parking at unbroken double yellow lines on 22 Oc tober 2003 at about 7.44pm, along Upper Serangoon Road. There was no dispute that the appellant had stopped his c ar on three oc c asions along this road on this date and at about this time, and that there were unbroken double yellow lines along this stretc h of road. The only issue in c ontention at the trial below was whether the appellant’s ac tions had amounted to “parking” as defined in s 2 of the RTA. Sec tion 2 of the RTA states that to “park” means “to bring a motor vehic le or a trailer to a stationary position and c ause it to wait for any purpose other than that of immediately taking up or setting down persons, goods or luggage”. 


4       The Prosec ution’s c ase was that Mardiono bin Tukiman (“PW1”), a uniformed traffic warden, was c arrying out enforc ement duties at the material time. He saw the appellant’s c ar stop along Upper Serangoon Road, just outside a _nasi lemak_ stall. After about ten sec onds, PW1 waved to the driver of the c ar to move on. The appellant drove on and stopped for about 30 sec onds at a sec ond position, whic h was only a few metres further down the road. PW1 started to key in the registration number of the appellant’s c ar into his portable handheld terminal. The appellant subsequently moved to a third position along the same road and stopped for about 30 sec onds, before finally moving away altogether. All three positions were along the same road with the double yellow lines. During PW1’s entire observation of the c ar, he did not see any persons, goods or luggage being taken up or set down. There was also no obstruc tion in front of the c ar, and the c ar c ould have moved off easily. PW1 observed that the appellant only signalled to filter out after he had stopped for the third time. 

5       The appellant, however, c laimed that he had dropped off his wife, Malkit Kaur (“DW2”), and a family friend, Karthiani d/o Mani Nair (“DW3”), at the _nasi lemak_ stall on the day of the alleged offenc e to buy dinner, and had driven off immediately after that. He did not see PW1 waving at him. However, as there was heavy traffic in the lane to his right and a stationary lorry in his lane obstruc ting his path, he had to stop at the sec ond position, a few metres further down the road. He then saw PW1 approac hing his c ar from behind, and waited bec ause he wanted to tell PW1 that he intended to drive away and was not parking there. As PW1 did not reac h his c ar, he again moved forward to drive away. However, he had to stop at the third position, as he still c ould not enter the lane on his right due to heavy traffic. He was only able to filter into the right lane from the third position. 

**The decision below** 

6       The trial judge found PW1 to be an honest, forthright and c andid witness, and believed his version of the events (see <span class="citation">[2004] SGDC 279</span>). He found that the appellant had been at the three positions for ten sec onds, 30 sec onds and 30 sec onds respec tively. The trial judge reasoned that PW1 c ould have seen the appellant’s c ar after the appellant’s wife and friend had alighted. He found that after the appellant’s wife and friend had alighted, the appellant was probably waiting for them to finish purc hasing the food from the _nasi lemak_ stall, but when the appellant realised the presenc e of PW1, he had moved the c ar slightly further down the road and stopped again. The appellant had waited for PW1 to approac h, but PW1 did not do so. 

7       The trial judge found that there was no obstruc tion bloc king the appellant’s path, and there was thus no lawful exc use for the appellant to wait as he did at the first and sec ond positions after his passengers had alighted. At the sec ond position, the appellant’s wait in order for PW1 to approac h him did not c onstitute a lawful reason for him to remain there. At the third position, illegal parking had also oc c urred until suc h time as the appellant had formed his intention to filter out. Ac c ordingly, the appellant was sentenc ed under s 131(1A) of the RTA to a fine of $700, and in default thereof, seven days’ imprisonment. 

**Appeal against conviction** 

8       I found it helpful to group the appellant’s grounds of c ontention into four broad c ategories, whic h were that: 

 (a) The trial judge had plac ed too muc h weight on the testimony of PW1, even though PW1 was evasive in his answers throughout his c ross-examination and there were glaring inc onsistenc ies in his evidenc e. 


 (b) PW1 had booked the appellant bec ause he felt that the appellant was c hallenging him after he had waved him on, and PW1, in the c irc umstanc es, had over-reac ted to the situation. 

 (c ) The trial judge was biased. 

 (d) The trial judge had prevented the appellant from c ross-examining one Esther Chong (“PW2”), by saying that the appellant was only required to raise a reasonable doubt by c rossexamining PW1 and that he had done a fine job. This had raised the expec tations of the appellant, thereby preventing further c ross-examination of PW2. 

9       I now deal with eac h ground in turn. 

**_Whether the trial judge was wrong to place too much weight on the testimony of PW_** 

10     I found that although there were instanc es of evasiveness during PW1’s c ross-examination and there were some inc onsistenc ies in his evidenc e, the trial judge had made a finding of fac t that PW1 was an honest, forthright and c andid witness, and had c hosen to believe his evidenc e. It is trite law that an appellate c ourt will not disturb findings of fac t unless they are plainly wrong or c learly reac hed against the weight of evidenc e. This is bec ause an appellate c ourt has not seen or heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judge’s findings and his reasons: _Lim Ah Poh v PP_ <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 713</span>; _Teo Kian Leong v PP_ <span class="citation">[2002] 1 SLR 147</span>. In partic ular, where findings of fac t hinge on the trial judge’s assessment of the c redibility and verac ity of witnesses, an appellate c ourt should be slow to overturn these findings of fac t: _Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP_ <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 656</span>. As a result, I c ould only overturn the trial judge’s findings of fac t if they were plainly wrong or c learly reac hed against the weight of evidenc e. 

11     PW1 was evasive when he was asked whether he was behind the appellant’s c ar when he waved at the c ar to move away, and whether he thought that it was nec essary to ask the appellant why he had stopped before taking down the appellant’s number. PW1 was also evasive when he was questioned as to whether it was possible that passengers had alighted from the appellant’s c ar before he saw the c ar. Further, PW1 had mentioned that when he saw the c ar, it was already at a stationary position, but with the brake lights still on. He was evasive when he was questioned as to whether he was suggesting that the brake lights were still on bec ause the vehic le had just c ome to a stop. 

12     I was of the opinion that PW1’s evasiveness went towards fac ts that were not material to the appellant’s c onvic tion. First, PW1 was not obliged to give the appellant a c hanc e to explain himself before issuing a summons against him. Sec ond, PW1 was c lear in his evidenc e that he had not seen anyone getting into or alighting from the c ar at the three stationary positions that he observed the c ar to be in. Sinc e that was the c ase, whether or not passengers had indeed alighted from the appellant’s c ar before PW1 saw the c ar was irrelevant. So long as the appellant had not driven away from the double yellow lines after he had allowed his passengers to alight, he would be guilty of the offenc e in question. 

13     As a result, I found that the fac t that PW1 was evasive during his c ross-examination did not show that the trial judge was plainly wrong in ac c epting his evidenc e. However, PW1 was inc onsistent in his testimony on the c ruc ial issue of whether the road in front of the appellant was obstruc ted. If the appellant had intended to drive away but was prevented from doing so bec ause the road was obstruc ted, he would not be guilty of the offenc e of illegal parking. In this regard, PW1 first gave 


evidenc e that there was a vehic le about 25m to 30m ahead of the appellant’s c ar, and the vehic le was moving along the lane. He did not see a stationary lorry. He subsequently gave evidenc e that he was only c onc entrating on the appellant’s c ar, and that he was not sure if he c ould see the lane in front of the c ar. When PW1 later gave evidenc e in Malay with the help of a Malay interpreter, the trial judge again questioned him on this issue. PW1 then said that he c ould see the lane in front of the appellant’s c ar c learly up to a distanc e of about 30m. There was a bus stop in front of the c ar, and the nearest bus was about 25m away. There were no other c ars in the lane. During his reexamination, PW1 reiterated that there was no obstruc tion in the lane in front of the appellant’s c ar, and the appellant was free to drive off. 

14     Although PW1 had given inc onsistent evidenc e on the issue of whether the road in front of the appellant was obstruc ted, I bore in mind the fac t that the trial judge was in a better position to determine the c redibility of the evidenc e given by eac h witness, and he had found that PW1 was a c redible witness. Moreover, I was of the opinion that the evidenc e given by the Defenc e on this issue was equally inc onsistent. The appellant testified that there was a stationary lorry in the first lane on the left. This lorry was about 20 ft and some three to four c ar lengths away, and was involved in the unloading of goods. DW2, however, initially said that there were two vehic les within 1.5m in front of the appellant’s c ar, and passengers were alighting from these vehic les. She c ould not remember what these vehic les were. Subsequently, DW2 testified that these vehic les were c ars, and she did not remember seeing a bus or a lorry. 

15     It was therefore c lear to me that the evidenc e given by the Defenc e as to whether the lane in front of the appellant’s c ar was bloc ked was just as c ontradic tory as the evidenc e given by PW1. In the c ase of the Prosec ution, I also noted that after PW1 got a Malay interpreter, he gave c lear evidenc e that he c ould see the lane in front of the appellant’s c ar, and that there were no obstruc tions. In these c irc umstanc es, I found that as the trial judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanour of the various witnesses when they gave evidenc e in c ourt, he was justified in c oming to the finding of fac t that there was no obstruc tion in front of the appellant’s c ar. There was thus no reason for me to disturb this finding. 

16     There were also other disc ernible inc onsistenc ies in PW1’s evidenc e. PW1 had given inc onsistent evidenc e as to whether the appellant had seen him approac hing the c ar when the c ar stopped for the first time along the double yellow lines. However, I found that this was an immaterial disc repanc y that had no direc t bearing on whether the appellant had c ommitted the offenc e in question. Whether the appellant moved off bec ause he saw PW1 waving him off or whether he had driven away of his own ac c ord was immaterial, bec ause PW1 was not obliged to give the appellant a c hanc e to move off. As I noted in _Ng Kwee Leong v PP_ <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 942</span>, in suc h a c ase the trial judge was entitled to find that the immaterial disc repanc y did not detrac t from the general verac ity of the prosec ution witness on the material issues. 

17     As a result, I found that despite the fac t that PW1 was evasive and that there were c ertain inc onsistenc ies in his evidenc e, it c ould not be said that the trial judge was plainly wrong in ac c epting his evidenc e. PW1 had given c lear evidenc e about the other material elements of the offenc e: that the c ar had stopped three times, for ten sec onds, 30 sec onds and 30 sec onds respec tively; and that he had not seen anyone getting into or alighting from the c ar during these three periods. In this regard, I noted that although DW2 and DW3 initially testified that the appellant must have seen them alighting from the c ar, DW3 later agreed with the prosec uting offic er that when she alighted from the vehic le, she c ould not be sure whether PW1 was looking at the appellant’s vehic le or at some other vehic le. As PW1 c ould well have been looking at something else when DW2 and DW3 alighted, I found that the trial judge was justified in finding that PW1 c ould have first seen the appellant’s c ar only 


after DW2 and DW3 had alighted. 

18     The highly unsatisfac tory evidenc e adduc ed by the Defenc e fortified my holding that the trial judge was not plainly wrong in ac c epting PW1’s evidenc e. First, the appellant’s c ontention that he formed his intention to filter out of his lane after his passengers had alighted was c learly unmeritorious. The appellant had alleged that this intention c ould be seen from the fac t that he had turned on his c ar’s signal light when he was at the first position. However, the appellant had not mentioned that he had turned on the signal light during his examination-in-c hief and when he put his c ase to PW1. He only mentioned this when the c ourt questioned him on this issue. If he had truly formed the intention to filter out from the left lane from the start, he would have mentioned the fac t that he had turned on his signal light when he was c ross-examining PW1, bec ause he would then be able to show that PW1 was wrong in taking down his partic ulars when it was obvious that he was trying to filter out of the left lane. In this regard, I found that the trial judge’s reasoning was c ogent and c onvinc ing. Also, if the appellant’s signal light were indeed turned on, he would not have had to wait for PW1 to walk over to tell PW1 that he was not parking and intended to move away. This would have been apparent from his signal light. The appellant’s further explanation that the signal was automatic ally c anc elled when his steering wheel was straightened also did not fit in with his version of the events, bec ause, as the trial judge reasoned, if the appellant had indeed maintained his steering wheel in a position ready to filter out, the steering wheel would not have been straightened, and the signal light would have remained turned on. 

19     Sec ond, I found that the evidenc e given by DW2 was extremely dubious. I found that the trial judge was onc e again c ogent in his reasoning that DW2’s evidenc e was unreliable. DW2 had given evidenc e that after she had alighted from the appellant’s c ar, she had seen the appellant’s c ar two lanes to the right of the extreme left lane. She also pointed out on a photograph the position where she saw the appellant’s c ar. However, as a matter of logic , it was impossible for the appellant to have reac hed that partic ular position, bec ause that position was too near to the original position of the c ar when it had stopped to allow DW2 to alight. Further, DW2 had also c laimed that she saw PW1 writing down the vehic le’s registration number on paper, but PW1 had in reality used his portable handheld terminal to key in the c ar numbers of motorists who had parked at the unbroken double yellow lines. 

20     Third, I found that there were also c ontradic tions between the evidenc e given by DW3 and the evidenc e given by the appellant. The appellant had given evidenc e that there were no buses behind his c ar when he stopped, but DW3 had said that there were a few buses behind the appellant’s c ar. 

21     I was therefore of the opinion that the evidenc e adduc ed from the defenc e witnesses was c ontradic tory and highly unsatisfac tory. In these c irc umstanc es, I had no doubt that the trial judge was not plainly wrong, and it was not against the weight of evidenc e, for him to ac c ept PW1’s evidenc e over the evidenc e of the defenc e witnesses. 

**_Whether PW1 had booked the appellant because he felt that the appellant was challenging him after he had waved him on, and whether PW1 had over-reacted to the situation_** 

22     The reason why the appellant c ould have thought that PW1 had booked him for c hallenging PW1’s authority was bec ause of a sentenc e that PW1 had said during his c ross-examination. PW1 had stated, “It appeared as if the driver was c hallenging me.” PW1 had said this when he was trying to explain why the appellant had driven the c ar forward and then stopped at the sec ond stationary position, after PW1 had waved the c ar to move on. However, I noted that upon further questioning by the appellant on this sentenc e, PW1 had made it c lear in c ourt that he did not feel any animosity 


towards the appellant, but felt that he had to be tac tful in c arrying out his duty. I therefore found that there was no basis to hold that PW1 had issued a summons against the appellant only bec ause PW1 had felt that the appellant was c hallenging him, and he wanted to assert his authority over the appellant. 

23     In any c ase, I found that whether PW1 had over-reac ted to the situation and booked the appellant only bec ause he felt that the appellant was c hallenging him was irrelevant, as there was no obligation on PW1 to give the appellant a c hanc e to move away before taking down his partic ulars. For the c harge against the appellant to be made out, all that had to be proved was that the appellant had parked at the side of the road and that there was no lawful exc use for the appellant to have done so. As I held above, the trial judge was not plainly wrong in finding that the appellant had indeed stopped three times at the side of the road and that there was no lawful exc use for the appellant to do so. In these c irc umstanc es, I found that the c harge against the appellant had been made out, and the motive that PW1 had in booking the appellant was irrelevant. 

**_Whether the trial judge was biased_** 

24     The appellant argued that the trial judge had presided over the c ase with a “pre-judged mind” after having uttered the following sentenc e during the pre-trial c onferenc e: “If it is not parking then what is it?” The appellant also argued that the trial judge appeared to be “prosec ution-minded”, as he c laimed that his c omplaint about the prosec ution offic er’s c onduc t, as well as an inappropriate remark allegedly uttered in c ourt by the prosec ution offic er, was dismissed without any queries. 

25     I found that the appellant’s c laim was frivolous, and did not meet the high threshold required for an argument of bias to suc c eed. For the appellant to suc c eed in his argument, apparent bias would suffic e and there was no need to prove ac tual bias: _Mohamed Ferooz v PP_ <span class="citation">[1997] 3 SLR 345</span>. The test to be applied in order to determine if the judge was biased was set out in _Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew_ <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR 310</span> at 338: Would a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in c ourt and knowing all the relevant fac ts have a reasonable suspic ion that a fair trial for the appellant was not possible? 

26     I found that the appellant made a wholly unsubstantiated allegation against the trial judge. It was evident from the Notes of Evidenc e and the trial judge’s Grounds of Dec ision that he had reac hed his findings through logic al reasoning and a detailed examination of the evidenc e given by both parties. A reasonable person would not suspec t that a fair trial for the appellant had not taken plac e. There was absolutely no basis for the appellant to ask for a re-trial based on the fac t that the trial judge was biased. I therefore dismissed this ground of appeal summarily. 

**_Whether the trial judge had prevented the appellant from cross-examining PW_** 

27     PW2 was an investigating offic er with the Traffic Polic e Division. The appellant submitted that during the trial, the trial judge had told the appellant that he was only required to raise a reasonable doubt by c ross-examining PW1 and that the appellant had done a fine job. This had raised the expec tations of the appellant, thereby preventing him from further c ross-examining PW2. 

28     I noted that in the Notes of Evidenc e, there was no rec ord of the trial judge telling the appellant that he was only required to raise a reasonable doubt by c ross-examining PW1, and that the appellant had done a good job. In any c ase, even if the trial judge had indeed told the appellant that, there was forc e in the Prosec ution’s submission that it was not surprising for a trial judge to offer a lay person who c onduc ted his own defenc e appropriate guidanc e on aspec ts of trial proc edure. 


Further, it was diffic ult to see what the appellant would ac hieve by a c ross-examination of PW2, whose role was merely to prepare the c harge, interview the reporting offic er and prepare for trial. Given that PW2 had not ac tually observed the inc ident on the day in question, it was unlikely that her evidenc e would be able to assist the appellant in overturning his c onvic tion. 

29     In light of the above, I c onc luded that the appellant’s grounds of appeal against his c onvic tion were wholly unmeritorious. Ac c ordingly, I dismissed the appeal against c onvic tion. 

**Appeal against sentence** 

30     The appellant also submitted that the sentenc e imposed by the trial judge was manifestly exc essive, in view of the appellant’s c lean rec ord and the fac t that the offenc e was a minor one with no aggravating fac tors. 

31     A c omparison of this c ase with sentenc ing prec edents revealed that a fine of $700 was not manifestly exc essive. Due to a dearth of authorities c onc erning the direc t issue of parking at unbroken double yellow lines, I also examined similar c ases on the issue of illegal parking. 

32     In _Tan Soo Phuan v PP_ <span class="citation">[2001] SGDC 249</span>, the ac c used was c harged with parking opposite double white lines, an offenc e under r 22(A) of the Road Traffic Rules read with s 83 of the RTA and punishable under s 131(1)(d) of the RTA. Sec tion 131(1)(d) set out the same penalty as that found in s 131(1A) of the RTA. This c ase was not direc tly relevant to the present c ase, as the ac c used in _Tan Soo Phuan v PP_ was a subsequent offender and was thus subjec t to a different sentenc ing tariff. What was relevant, however, was the fac t that one of the ac c used’s antec edents was for parking at unbroken double yellow lines under r 22(b) of the Road Traffic Rules. The ac c used was fined $1, for that offenc e. 

33     In _Teo Kay Hoe v PP_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No 248 of 2000, unreported judgment dated 21 September 2000), the ac c used was c onvic ted of parking within a “Demerit Points No Parking” zone in c ontravention of r 24A of the Road Traffic Rules and punishable under s 131(1)(d) of the RTA. He was fined $600, and in default thereof, one week’s imprisonment, for the offenc e. 

34     In _PP v Theseira Noel Edmund_ <span class="citation">[2003] SGDC 328</span>, the ac c used was also c onvic ted for parking within a “Demerit Points No Parking” zone. Although the dec ision only dealt with the ac c used’s appeal against his c onvic tion at the Distric t Court level, the sentenc e imposed by the Magistrate’s Court in that c ase was instruc tive. The ac c used was sentenc ed to a fine of $700, and in default thereof, seven days’ imprisonment, by the Magistrate’s Court. 

35     It c ould be seen from these c ases that the fine imposed in suc h c ases of illegal parking was about the same or higher than that imposed in the present c ase. In light of these sentenc ing prec edents, I was of the opinion that a fine of $700 in this c ase was not manifestly exc essive, even though there were no aggravating fac tors and the appellant had no antec edents. 

**Conclusion** 

36     For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed both appeals against c onvic tion and sentenc e.
