: This c ase c onc erns the c opyright in the following music al works (the `Music al Works`): 

 (a) Bitc h ) (b) Singalong Junk ) Jerry Maguire Works (c ) Momma Miss Americ a ) (d) Nearer My God to Thee ) (e) Marguerite Waltz ) (f) Song Without Words ) (g) Etudiante ) Titanic Works (h) Titsy Bitsy Girl ) (i) Valse Septembre. ) 

The first music al work listed above was c omposed by Mic hael Phillip Jagger and Keith Ric hards, the sec ond and third works were c omposed by Paul James Mc Cartney and the remaining six works were arranged by John Neville Rufus Altman. The last six works are works in whic h c opyright in the original had expired. This c ase c onc erns the c opyright in c ertain arrangements of those works by Mr Altman. (M/s Jagger, Ric hards, Mc Cartney and Altman shall be c ollec tively referred to as the `c omposers of the Music al Works`. 

The first plaintiffs, The Performing Right Soc iety Ltd (`PRS`), is a c ompany inc orporated in the United Kingdom and is the owner of the rights of public performanc e, broadc asting and diffusion by c able of all music al works c omposed, arranged or published by their members. By separate Deeds of Assignment, the c omposers of the Music al Works had assigned, inter alia, all performing rights whic h then belonged to or whic h would thereafter vest in them to PRS. 

The sec ond plaintiffs, Composers and Authors Soc iety of Singapore Ltd is a c ompany inc orporated in Singapore. It is the exc lusive lic ensee of the PRS to authorise and administer, within the territory of Singapore, the performing rights of works c omprised in the repertoire of the PRS. 

The defendants, United Artists Singapore Theatres Pte Ltd (`United Artists`), are exhibitors of motion pic tures in Singapore. They obtain lic enc es from distributors of motion pic tures to sc reen motion pic tures to the public at its threatre c omplexes at Shaw Towers and Bugis Junc tion. 

The present dispute arises over the sc reening of two motion pic tures `Jerry Maguire` and `Titanic ` 


- by United Artists at its theatre c omplexes some time in 1997 and 1998. The first three music al works listed above (the `Jerry Maguire Works`) had been sync hronised or inc orporated into the film `Jerry Maguire` whilst the remaining six works (the `Titanic Works`) had been sync hronised into the film `Titanic `. United Artists obtained its lic enc e to sc reen `Jerry Maguire` from Buena Vista Columbia Tristar Films (Singapore) Pte Ltd and its lic enc e to sc reen `Titanic ` from Twentieth Century Fox (East) Pte Ltd. 

**_The plaintiffs` case_** 

The plaintiffs` c ase is that United Artists had infringed their rights in the Jerry Maguire Works and in the Titanic Works by sc reening the films `Jerry Maguire` and `Titanic ` respec tively. It is part of the plaintiffs` c ase that the sc reening of the two films also c onstituted a performanc e of those Music al Works whic h had been sync hronised into the soundtrac k of eac h film. It should be c larified at the outset that although referenc e is made to the sync hronisation of the Music al Works, it is ac tually sound rec ordings of the Music al Works whic h have been sync hronised into the soundtrac ks of the two films. 

It is not in dispute that PRS is the owner of the rights of performanc e in the Jerry Maguire Works by virtue of the Deeds of Assignment referred to above. In respec t of the Titanic Works, however, United Artists have raised an issue as to the ownership of the c opyright. They allege that c opyright in the Titanic Works vested in Twentieth Century Fox (`TCF`), the produc er of the film. I shall deal with this issue last. 

Assuming that PRS is the owner of the performing rights in both the Jerry Maguire Works and the Titanic Works, the following questions need to be answered: 

(a) What are the rights in the Music al Works held by the plaintiffs? 

(b) How, if at all, have the rights of the plaintiffs in the Music al Works been affec ted by the sync hronisation of rec ordings of the Music al Works into the c inematograph films `Jerry Maguire` and `Titanic `? 

(c ) Has United Artists infringed any of the plaintiffs` rights by exhibiting the films `Jerry Maguire` and `Titanic ` to members of the public? 

As the events in question in this c ase took plac e some time in 1997 and 1998, the relevant princ iples of the law of c opyright are as stated in the Copyright Ac t (Cap 63, 1987 Ed) (`the Ac t`). It may be noted that under s 4 of the Ac t, no c opyright shall subsist otherwise than by virtue of the Ac t. 

**_(a) The plaintiffs` rights in the Musical Works_** 

PRS`s rights arise as a result of the Deeds of Assignment between them and the c omposers of the Music al Works. Sec tion 26 of the Ac t provides: 

 (1) For the purposes of this Act, unless the contrary intention appears, copyright, in relation to a work, is the exclusive right 

 (a) in the case of a literary, dramatic or musical work, to do all or any of the following acts: 


 (i) to reproduce the work in a material form; 

 (ii) to publish the work if the work is unpublished; 

 (iii) to perform the work in public ; 

 (iv) to broadcast the work; 

 (v) to include the work in a cable programme; 

 (vi) to make an adaptation of the work; 

 (vii) to do, in relation to a work that is an adaptation of the first-mentioned work, any of the acts specified in relation to the first-mentioned work in subparagraphs (i) to (vi). [Emphasis is added.] 

PRS ac quired the rights under s 26(a)(iii) of the Ac t from the c omposers of the Music al Works. The mec hanic s of PRS`s ac quisition through assignment is c onsidered later in relation to United Artists` arguments on the ownership of rights in the Titanic Works. 

The `performanc e` referred to in s 26(a)(iii) is further defined in s 22(1) of the Ac t as follows: 

 Subject to this section, a reference in this Act to performance shall 

 (a) be read as including a reference to any mode of visual or aural presentation, whether the presentation is by the operation of wireless telegraphy apparatus, by the exhibition of a cinematograph film , by the use of a record or by any other means; and 

 (b) ... 

 and a reference in this Act to performing a work or an adaptation of a work shall have a corresponding meaning. [Emphasis is added.] 

PRS`s rights in the Music al Works would therefore inc lude the right to perform the Music al Works as part of a c inematograph film, unless suc h a right is somehow exc luded by another part of the Ac t or is otherwise restric ted by c ompeting rights of other parties under the Ac t. United Artists makes an argument along suc h lines, whic h will be addressed later when question (b) is c onsidered. 

The above view on PRS`s performing rights in respec t of the Music al Works ac c ords with the view that George Wei takes in his book, **_The Law of Copyright in Singapore_** (2nd Ed). Commenting on s 22(1) of the Ac t, George Wei, at p 534, states: 

 Accordingly, if a literary work is turned into a cinematograph film, the making of the cinematograph film will constitute a reproduction in material form in respect of which a licence will be needed. If the cinematograph film is shown to the public, that will constitute a performance of the literary work. If a licence has 


 not been obtained, not only will there be an infringement of the copyright in the cinematograph film, there will also be an infringement of the public performance right in the literary work. [Emphasis is added.] 

Although the above passage from George Wei relates to literary works, there is no reason for a distinc tion to be drawn between literary works whic h are inc orporated into a c inematograph film and music al works so inc orporated unless suc h a distinc tion arises from another part of the Ac t. 

**_(b) Synchronisation of the Musical Works into cinematograph films_** 

United Artists have sought to rely on c ertain provisions of the Ac t pertaining to c inematograph films in their defenc e, primarily ss 117(1) and 18(1). Sec tion 117(1) of the Ac t makes a distinc tion between rights in sound rec ordings (or c inematograph films) and those in original music al works. Sec tion 117(1) states: 

 Where copyright subsists in any subject-matter by virtue of this Part, nothing in this Part shall be taken to affect the operation of Part III in relation to any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work from which that subject-matter is wholly or partly derived, and any copyright subsisting by virtue of this Part is in addition to, and independent of, any copyright subsisting by virtue of Part III. 

Sec tion 117(1) c ontains two propositions: 

(a) first, that the operation of Pt IV (in whic h rights in sound rec ordings and c inematograph films arise) does not affec t the operation of Pt III in relation to, inter alia, music al works upon whic h a Pt IV work is wholly or partly derived; and 

(b) sec ondly, that any c opyright subsisting by virtue of Pt IV is in addition to and independent of any c opyright subsisting by virtue of Pt III. 

If the films `Jerry Maguire` and `Titanic ` c an be said to be derived, whether wholly or partly, from the Jerry Maguire Works and Titanic Works respec tively, then, by reason of s 117(1) it is c lear that PRS`s rights under s 26(a)(iii) are not affec ted by the sync hronisation of the Music al Works in the two films. 

United Artists c ontends that the c inematograph films `Jerry Maguire` and `Titanic ` are not derived from the Jerry Maguire Works and Titanic Works and therefore there has been no infringement on their part. They further c ontend that as the Music al Works had been c onverted into sound rec ordings (whic h were then sync hronised into the films), PRS`s rights vis-.-vis the sound rec ordings would be extinguished when the rec ordings were sync hronised into the films. This sec ond c ontention is based on United Artists` interpretation of s 18(1) of the Ac t. 

**The s 117 argument** 

United Artists` first c ontention seems to be based on the fac t that it is sound rec ordings of the Music al Works whic h are sync hronised into the films. Although the Music al Works were made into sound rec ordings whic h had, in turn, been sync hronised into the soundtrac ks of the c inematograph films, it is c lear that the sound rec ordings are derived from the Music al Works. Sec tion 117(1) 


preserves the rights in the original music al works notwithstanding that a sound rec ording may have been derived from them. Consequently, it c annot be said that the rights in the original music al works are somehow merged into the rights in the sound rec ordings derived from those works suc h that the owner of the rights in the original music works c annot enforc e them as against the maker of a c inematograph film who inc orporates the sound rec ording into his film. 

Further, based on a plain reading and interpretation of the word `derived`, it is c lear that the c inematograph films `Jerry Maguire` and `Titanic ` had been derived from the Jerry Maguire Works and the Titanic Works respec tively when sound rec ordings of those works were sync hronised into the soundtrac ks of the two films. 

**The s 18(1) argument** 

As noted above, PRS has, under s 26(1) of the Ac t, the exc lusive right to perform the Music al Works in public by exhibiting them as part of a c inematograph film. Sec tion 7(1) of the Ac t defines the term `c inematograph film` as inc luding `the aggregate of the sounds embodied in a soundtrac k` assoc iated with the visual images whic h are c apable, whether on their own or when embodied in another artic le or things, of being shown as a moving pic ture. Sec tion 18(1), however, provides: 

 For the purposes of this Act, sounds embodied in a sound-track associated with visual images forming part of a cinematograph film shall be deemed not to be a sound recording. 

United Artists c ontend that sinc e the Music al Works had been c onverted into sound rec ordings and thereafter inc orporated into the soundtrac k of `Jerry Maguire` and `Titanic ` and sinc e the soundtrac k assoc iated with a film is, by s 18(1), deemed not to be a sound rec ording, there c an be no infringement on the part of United Artists. In support of their c ontention, United Artists c ite the Federal Court of Australia in **EMI Music Australia Pty Ltd v Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations** (Unreported) , and the minority dec ision of the High Court of Australia in **Phonographic Performance Company of Australia Ltd v Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations** [1998] 40 IPR 225. The plaintiffs c ontend that the majority dec ision in the latter c ase is to be preferred. 

Both c ases c ited by United Artists relate to the differenc es in the rights c omprised in the c opyright of sound rec ordings and that of c inematograph films. They are thus different from the present c ase where the issues c onc ern the rights of music al works as against those relating to c inematograph films. Another signific ant differenc e is that the nature of c opyright in sound rec ordings in Singapore is very different from that in Australia. Under s 85(1) of the Australian Copyright Ac t 1968, c opyright in relation to a sound rec ording gives the c opyright holder the exc lusive right (inter alia) to c ause the rec ording to be heard in public and to broadc ast the rec ording. This is not so under our Ac t (see s 82(1)). The law and the fac ts in the two Australian c ourts were therefore materially different from the law and the fac ts in the present c ase. 

Nevertheless, the main issue in the **_Phonographic Performance Company_** c ase (supra) is instruc tive as the c ourt in that c ase had to c onsider whether the broadc ast of a c inematograph film, the soundtrac k of whic h embodied a sound rec ording, also c onstituted the broadc ast of the sound rec ording. At p 230, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ, giving the majority dec ision state: 

 The respondents contention was that because s 23(1) [in pari materia with s 18(1) of the Act] deems the sounds embodied in a sound-track not to be a 


 sound recording, broadcasting the film does not broadcast the sound recording embodied in the sound-track. But the fact that the sound-track is not a sound recording ... does not mean that the broadcast of a film embodying a sound recording does not broadcast that sound recording as well as the film. The broadcast of a sound recording may occur in many contexts. The simplest, and most obvious, is the radio or television station that plays the recording in the course of its transmission to the public. But if, in the course of a live production of a dramatic work which is broadcast by radio or television, a sound recording is broadcast, there is a broadcast of that sound recording for the purposes of s 85 [which is different from our local equivalent, s 82]. No less is there a broadcast of a sound recording when a cinematograph film, the soundtrack of which embodies the sound recording, is broadcast to the public. The fact that the sound-track is deemed by the Act not to be a sound recording is not to the point. The question is whether the aggregate of sound embodied in the sound recording has been broadcast. What the Act deems not to be a sound recording is the aggregate of sounds that is recorded in a particular form: a sound-track. Usually, the aggregate of sounds recorded in the sound-track will be larger than or, in some other way, different from the aggregate of sounds that constitutes the sound recording. Broadcasting the film broadcasts the sound-track (which is not a sound recording) but it also broadcasts the aggregate of sounds which constitutes the sound recording. [Emphasis is added.] 

Mc Hugh and Kirby JJ in their minority judgment, put forward a different view. At pp 236 and 237 they state: 

 It [meaning the Australian s 23(1)] is the means by which the Act reconciles the grant of apparently inconsistent exclusive rights to different owners. The effect of the section is to maintain the exclusive right of the owner of a sound recording in all situations except where that owner has licensed the embodiment of the sound recording in the sound-track of a cinematograph film in exercise of its exclusive rights under s 85. Where the sound recording is so embodied in a sound track of a cinematograph film, by licence from the owner of the sound recording, the exclusive right in relation to the collation of sounds constituting the sound-track (which may or may not contain sounds additional to the original sound recording) is treated by the Act as separate and different from the sound recording. It belongs to the owner of the copyright in the cinematograph film. The broadcast of the sound-track of the cinematograph film does not, therefore, involve the broadcast of the sound recording, as such, because [f]or the purposes of [the] Act parliament has provided that the sounds embodied in a sound-track are deemed not to be a sound recording. In short, they are to be dealt with, and dealt with only, in terms of the rights of the owner of copyright in the cinematograph film. 

Regardless of whic h of the above views is preferred as to the prec edenc e of the rights in sound rec ordings and c inematograph films, s 117(1) is c lear that rights in original music al works under Pt III would not be affec ted by the rights subsisting under Pt IV. Even if the minority view is ac c epted and the broadc ast of the soundtrac k does not at law amount to a broadc ast of the sound rec ording, that does not affec t the analysis put forward earlier that the soundtrac k of the film is derived from the original music al work as it inc orporated a sound rec ording of that music al work. Consequently, s 117(1) would preserve the rights in original music al works under s 26 notwithstanding that s 18(1) of the Ac t may affec t the distribution of rights in two different Pt IV works. Consequently, it is unnec essary in the present c ase to dec ide whic h of the above views is c orrec t. 


In the c irc umstanc es, United Artists have been unable to show that the s 26 rights of PRS have been exc luded or restric ted by the sync hronisation of rec ordings of the Music al Works into the two films. In view of s 117(1), the rights of PRS under Pt III of the Ac t have not been affec ted by the sync hronisation of sound rec ordings of the Music al Works into the two films and PRS is able to assert those rights against United Artists. 

**_(c) Infringement of PRS`s rights_** 

It is not disputed that United Artists sc reened the films `Jerry Maguire` and `Titanic ` to members of the public some time in 1997 and 1998. Subjec t to United Artists` argument as to the ownership of rights in the Titanic Works, I hold that the sc reening of the two films did amount to a performanc e of the Music al Works and henc e c onstituted an infringement of PRS`s s 26(a)(iii) rights in the Music al Works. 

**_Ownership of the rights in the Titanic Works_** 

As noted, United Artists have also raised a separate issue c onc erning ownership of the performing rights in the Titanic Works. Before c onsidering this point, the mec hanic s of PRS`s ac quisition of rights by way of the Deeds of Assignment mentioned earlier must be c onsidered. 

Sec tion 194 of the Ac t provides: 

 (1) Subject to this section, copyright shall be transmissible by assignment, by testamentary disposition, or by operation of law as personal or movable property. 

 (2) An assignment of copyright may be limited in any of the following ways, or in any combination of 2 or more of those ways: 

 (a) so as to apply to one or more, but not all, of the classes of acts which by virtue of this Act the owner of the copyright has the exclusive right to do (including any one or more classes of acts not separately designated in this Act as being restricted by the copyright, but falling within any of the classes of acts so designated); 

 (b) ... 

 (c) ... 

 and references in this Act to a partial assignment are references to an assignment so limited. 

 (3) No assignment of copyright (whether total or partial) shall have effect unless it is in writing signed by or on behalf of the assignor. 

Sec tion 195(1) of the Ac t provides: 

 Where by an agreement made in relation to any future copyright , and signed 


 by or on behalf of the prospective owner of the copyright, the prospective owner purports to assign the future copyright (wholly or partially) to another person (referred to in this subsection as the assignee), then if, on the coming into existence of the copyright, the assignee or a person claiming under him would, apart from this subsection, be entitled as against all other persons to require the copyright to be vested in him (wholly or partially, as the case may be), the copyright shall, on its coming into existence, vest in the assignee or his successor in title accordingly by virtue of this subsection and without further assurance. [Emphasis is added.] 

The term `future c opyright` is defined in s 7(1) of the Ac t as `c opyright to c ome into existenc e at a future time or upon the happening of a future event`. 

Reading these sec tions together, the Deeds of Assignment signed by the c omposers of the Music al Works would, apart from the arguments of United Artists c onc erning the ownership of the Titanic Works, effec t a partial assignment of their rights, in partic ular their rights under s 26(a)(iii) of the Ac t, to PRS. 

United Artists c ontend, however, that although Mr Altman arranged the Titanic Works, c opyright in respec t thereof did not vest in Mr Altman and therefore would not be c aught by the assignment exec uted by him. The thrust of United Artists` argument was that Mr Altman as is evident from the `Rec ord Produc er Borrowing Agreement` (`RPBA`) was, at the material time, under a c ontrac t of employment with Head Arrangements Ltd (`HA`). As an employee of HA, c opyright in any works c reated by him, suc h as the Titanic Works, would (by virtue s 30 of the Ac t) vest in HA. And HA having, under the RPBA, transferred those rights to TCF, the rights would vest in TCF. 

It would be relevant to look at s 30 of the Ac t before going into the c ontrac tual arrangements between Mr Altman, HA and TCF. Sec tion 30 provides: 

 (1) This section shall have effect subject to Part X. 

 (2) Subject to this section, the author of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work shall be entitled to any copyright subsisting in the work by virtue of this Part. 

 (3) The operation of subsection (4), (5) or (6) in relation to copyright in a particular work may be excluded or modified by agreement. 

 (4) ... 

 (5) ... 

 (6) Where a literary, dramatic or artistic work to which subsections (4) and (5) do not apply, or a musical work, is made by the author in pursuance of the terms of his employment by another person under a contract of service or apprenticeship, that other person shall be entitled to any copyright subsisting in the work by virtue of this Part. 

In view of s 30(6) of the Ac t, if Mr Altman was in the employ of HA under a c ontrac t of servic e or 


apprentic eship, then c opyright in his works would vest, not in Mr Altman, but in HA. If that be the c ase, then PRS c ould have no c laim under the Deed of Assignment to any c opyright in those works and the present proc eedings by the plaintiffs against United Artists would, insofar as the Titanic Works are c onc erned, fail. 

Sec tion 130(1) of the Ac t would be relevant in this c ontext. Sec tion 130(1) states: 

 In an action brought by virtue of this Part 

 (a) copyright shall be presumed to subsist in the work or other subject-matter to which the action relates if the defendant does not put in issue the question whether copyright subsists in the work or other subject-matter; and 

 (b) where the subsistence of the copyright is established the plaintiff shall be presumed to be the owner of the copyright if he claims to be the owner of the copyright and the defendant does not put in issue the question of his ownership. 

United Artists had, in this c ase, put the question of ownership of the c opyright in issue. The presumption in s 130 would therefore not arise and it would be inc umbent on PRS to prove that it held the performanc e rights in respec t of the Titanic Works. 

The RPBA was the only doc ument produc ed by the plaintiffs that went towards showing where the c opyright in respec t of the Titanic Works lay. The RPBA (in c l 8(e)) refers to a c ontrac t of employment between HA and Mr Altman. Paragraph 1 of the RPBA states: 

 Lender [HA] hereby agrees to furnish the services of Artist [Mr Altman] to arrange , record, produce and deliver to Producer [TCF] the completed Sound Only Recordings (Soundtrack Masters) embodying the performance by the musical recording artists p/k/a I Salonisti (Performer) of the musical compositions listed in Schedule 1 hereto (Compositions) for inclusion in the soundtrack of the Picture [Titanic] and in the soundtrack Album derived from the Picture (Soundtrack Album), if any, and Phonorecords derived therefrom ... [Emphasis is added.] 

The works listed in the sc hedule referred to inc lude the six music al piec es c omprised in the Titanic Works. Paragraph 3(a) of the RPBA, however, goes on to say: 

 Ownership : Producer [TCF] shall solely and exclusively own throughout the universe in perpetuity all rights of every kind and nature including the copyright and all rights of copyright in and to the Soundtrack Masters, all components thereof, and all of the results and proceeds of Artists services hereunder and in connection with the Soundtrack Masters in whatever stage of completion that such Soundtrack Masters or such results and proceeds may exist from time to time together with the rights generally known as the moral rights of authors and the exclusive right to distribute and otherwise market and exploit the Soundtrack Masters and all components thereof in any manner and by any and all means, media, devices, processes and technology whether now known or hereafter known or devised (including audiovisual devices). 


Paragraph 3(a) then states: 

 Lender [HA] acknowledges that all results and proceeds of Artists services are being specially ordered by Producer for use as part of a Motion Picture and shall be considered a work made for hire for Producer and, therefore, Producer shall be the author and copyright owner thereof for all purposes throughout the universe without limitation of any kind. If and to the extent the foregoing provisions do not operate to vest fully and effectively in Producer all or any of such rights as beneficial owner Artist hereby grants and assigns to Producer all rights of every kind and nature whether now or hereafter known or created which may not have so vested (and so far as may be appropriate by way of immediate assignment of future copyright) throughout the universe in perpetuity. Lender [HA] and Artist hereby expressly waive any and all rights in law or in equity or otherwise which Lender and/or Artist may have or claim to have based upon or as a result of any alleged infringement of Lenders and/or Artists so-called moral rights or authors. [Emphasis is added.] 

And paragraph 3(b) of the RPBA states: 

 Assignment : If and to the extent that all or any of the provisions of Paragraph 3(a) do not operate to vest fully and effectively in Producer [TCF] all or any of the rights set forth in Paragraph 3(a), Lender [HA] and/ or Artist, as beneficial owner, hereby grants and assigns to Producer [TCF] all rights not so vested (and so far as may be appropriate by way of immediate assignment of future copyright) throughout the universe in perpetuity including all rights to exploit the results, produce and proceeds of Artists services in and by any and all manner, media, devices, processes and technology, whether now or hereafter known or created free from all restrictions and limitations, together with the rights generally known as the moral rights of authors (which to the extent such moral rights of authors may not be granted are hereby waived) and the exclusive right to distribute and otherwise market and exploit the Picture, the Soundtrack Masters and all components of each (to the extent that the results, product and proceeds of Artists services may be incorporated therein) in and by any manner, media, devices, processes and technology whether now or hereafter known or created. [Emphasis is added.] 

It was submitted by United Artists that in the light of the provisions in the RPBA, TCF had ac quired rights in the nature of c opyright either from HA or Mr Altman. However, insofar as the RPBA may operate as an assignment to TCF by Mr Altman of his rights in the Titanic Works, Mr Altman`s prior assignment to PRS would take prec edenc e: that would be the effec t of s 195(1) of the Ac t. TCF c ould therefore ac quire suc h rights, if at all, only through HA. The question therefore is: did c opyright in the Titanic Works vest in HA? 

The fac t that RPBA ac knowledged that Mr Altman was under a c ontrac t of employment with HA and the fac t that Mr Altman himself signed the RPBA and c onfirmed all the grants, representations, warranties and agreements made therein by HA, indic ated that Mr Altman ac c epted that c opyright in the Titanic Works vested in HA. If Mr Altman ac c epted that c opyright vested in HA, it would be odd for the plaintiffs, as the c ollec ting agent of Mr Altman, to maintain this ac tion in respec t of the Titanic Works. To negative the effec t of the provisions in the RPBA and show that Mr Altman, although employed by HA, retained the c opyright in respec t of the Titanic Works, the terms of the c ontrac t of employment between Mr Altman and HA would be relevant. In the light of s 30(6) of the 


Ac t, whether c opyright vested in HA or not would depend on whether that c ontrac t of employment was a c ontrac t of servic e or a c ontrac t for servic es. 

In this c onnec tion, the c omments by George Wei in **_The Law of Copyright in Singapore_** (2nd Ed) at paras 7.25 and 7.26 are helpful: 

 7.25 Who then is an employee-author? Section 30(6) approaches this from the perspective of whether the author was employed by another person under a contract of service or apprenticeship. The Act does not set out any statutory definition of either of these expressions. At common law, the courts have always had some difficulty in formulating a comprehensive test for what constitutes a contract of service. A contract of service is to be distinguished from a contract for services. An individual working under the latter arrangement is said to be an independent contractor. In the case of a contract of service, he is said to be an employee. 

 7.26 It follows that authors who are independent contractors are in a much better position than authors who make works in the course of employment. ... The question as to what constitutes a contract of service, accordingly, is very important due to the consequences that it attracts. The cases suggest that a number of different factors can be looked at. First, there is the question of control. As a general rule, the greater the degree of control which the person said to be employer has over the person said to be employee, the greater the likelihood that a contract of service will be found. This is particularly so where the control relates to both what work is to be done ... Other factors have to be taken into account. These include whether the author is engaged to perform a particular assignment for which he receives a lump sum payment. If so, this may suggest that he is an independent contractor under a contract for services. [Emphasis is added.] 

The plaintiffs, however, failed to produc e the c ontrac t of employment between Mr Altman and HA. They have therefore failed to disc harge the burden on them of proving that c opyright in the Titanic Works was vested in them. 

For the above reasons, the plaintiffs` c laim in this ac tion suc c eeds in respec t of the Jerry Maguire Works but not in respec t of the Titanic Works. The performing rights in the Jerry Maguire Works vests in PRS and United Artists are ac c ountable to the plaintiffs for the public performanc e of those Works. As the plaintiffs have failed to prove that the performing rights in the Titanic Works vests in them, their c laim against United Artists in respec t of the Titanic Works fails. As the plaintiffs were only partially suc c essful in their c laim against United Artists, I order that United Artists pay two-thirds of the c osts of the plaintiffs. 

## Outcome:
