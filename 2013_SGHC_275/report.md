**Introduction** 

1       These are the anc illary proc eedings in a long-running ac rimonious dispute between the parties following the exec ution of a deed of separation dated 28 Marc h 2003 (“the Deed”) and their subsequent divorc e three years later. Of primary c onc ern in these anc illary proc eedings is the approac h the c ourt should take towards enforc eable deeds of separation as well as the weight that should be ac c orded to a deed of separation under s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”). 

2       The parties, Mr Wong Kien Keong (“the Plaintiff”) and Mdm Khoo Hoon Eng (“the Defendant”), divorc ed after a marriage of more than 28 years. The Plaintiff is a lawyer, while the Defendant is an assoc iate professor at the National University of Singapore (“NUS”). As of 2013, the Plaintiff is 61 years old while the Defendant is 62 years old. The c hildren of the marriage, two sons, are now adults. 

3       On 12 Marc h 2003, the Defendant moved out of the matrimonial home to live in an apartment at Aspen Heights. Shortly thereafter, the parties signed the Deed. 

4       After the Deed was exec uted, the Defendant c ommenc ed divorc e proc eedings on 29 June 2004, whic h were later disc ontinued on 20 Marc h 2006. The Plaintiff then filed for divorc e based on three years of separation. The _decree nisi_ of 28 May 2006 was made absolute on 13 May 2011, before anc illary proc eedings were c ompleted. 

5       In the meantime, the hearing of anc illary matters was delayed by the Defendant’s applic ation _vide_ Summons No 1553 of 2011 filed on 8 April 2011 to set aside the Deed. Her applic ation was dismissed on 21 Marc h 2012 (see _Wong Kien Keong v Khoo Hoon Eng_ <span class="citation">[2012] SGHC 127</span> (“the 2012 Judgment”)). The Defendant appealed against my dec ision in Civil Appeal No 32 of 2012 (“CA 32/2012”). The Court of Appeal ordered CA 32/2012 to be stayed until the anc illary proc eedings were c ompleted as it was envisaged that the prospec t of an appeal against orders made in the anc illary proc eedings was likely, and in the interest of expedienc y, all related appeals should to be heard at the 


same time. 

6       The parties duly proc eeded with the anc illary proc eedings for the division of matrimonial assets, with the matter listed for hearing on 2 Oc tober 2012. By this time, some nine years had elapsed sinc e the signing of the Deed, and six years from the _decree nisi._ The anc illary issue of division of matrimonial assets was the main area of c ontention between the parties. After four intermittent days of hearing, I reserved judgment. 

7       The anc illary proc eedings were made diffic ult by extensive disc overy applic ations and interrogatories, numerous voluminous affidavits, and the various written submissions c overing the different positions taken from time to time as the Defendant adjusted her c ase along the way. 

**The parties’ arguments on division of the matrimonial assets** 

8       The Plaintiff’s c ase was that the Deed should be given full weight in whic h c ase an order adopting the terms of the Deed should be granted. He maintained that the Deed was exc eedingly fair and just when it was made. He relied on his expert’s report to show that the Defendant stood to 

rec eive 44% of the assets as at 12 Marc h 2003. [note: 1] The Plaintiff’s c ounsel, Mr Randolph Khoo (“Mr Khoo”), emphasised that this perc entage division of 44% of the matrimonial assets c omprised in the Deed for the Defendant was higher than the range of perc entages between 35% and 40% derived 

from c ases that broadly shared the same fac ts. [note: 2] 

9       In c ontrast, the Defendant’s position was that no weight should be given to the Deed. On its fac e, the Defendant was given only one out of the five immoveable properties in Singapore, and one out of seven immoveable properties in Malaysia. Counsel for the Defendant, Ms Suc hitra Ragupathy (“Ms Ragupathy”) argued that a fair and equitable division would be to give the Defendant 60% of all the immovable matrimonial assets as c ompared to what she was given under the Deed whic h was allegedly a mere 18% of all the matrimonial assets. Ms Ragupathy also c omplained of the Plaintiff’s failure to make full and frank disc losure. For instanc e, she referred to the Plaintiff’s retirement benefits that were not inc luded in the list of matrimonial assets under the Deed, and relied on the omission to support her c ontention that the agreed division under the Deed was unfair and inequitable to the Defendant. I will deal with this c ontention in due c ourse. 

10     A related issue is the appropriate date of valuation of the matrimonial assets. The Plaintiff c ontended that the appropriate date of valuation should be 12 Marc h 2003 when the Defendant moved out of the matrimonial home to live on her own, sinc e their divorc e was granted on the basis of 3 years’ separation from that date. In c ontrast, the Defendant argued for a later date, 2 Oc tober 2012, being the start of the hearing of the anc illary matters. Mr Khoo disagreed with Ms Ragupathy’s c hoic e of dates. His c ontention was that the unwarranted litigation had prolonged the dispute to the 

point of obsc uring the reality that the marriage had long sinc e ended. [note: 3] He ac c used the Defendant of skewing the fac ts by using 2012 valuations whic h were muc h higher (as c ompared to 2003) to give an inac c urate pic ture of the Deed made in 2003. 

**Overview of this judgment** 

11     In this judgment, I shall examine the c ourt’s approac h to post-nuptial agreements in Singapore. The Deed was upheld in the 2012 Judgment and as suc h, the existenc e of the Deed is one of the fac tors to be taken into ac c ount under s 112(2) of the Charter. As a first step to determining the weight to be ac c orded to the Deed, the c ourt looks at the perc entage division of the matrimonial assets under the Deed. 


12     In addition, the Deed would be sc rutinised in light of the other fac tors set out in s 112(2). If a c onsideration of the other relevant fac tors and c irc umstanc es show that the division presc ribed under the Deed is unfair, the division under the Deed is unlikely to be ac c orded any weight whatsoever and it will be disregarded from the c ourt’s assessment of a fair and equitable award for the parties. However, this is not the only approac h that the c ourt c an take. A mixture of fac t and the exerc ise of disc retion may justify a different approac h, as was the c ase in _AFS v AFU_ <span class="citation">[2011] 3 SLR 275</span>. I will be disc ussing this c ase later in the judgment. 

13     As a related observation, where parties have failed to point towards any form of inequity in the s 112(2)( _e_ ) agreement, the c ourt is not likely to substitute its own disc retion or judgment for that of the parties, and will instead seek to uphold the agreement. Where parties have agreed to c omprehensively and c onc lusively organise their financ ial arrangements after or in c ontemplation of their separation, there would be no good reason why suc h an agreement should not be given full weight. This approac h was first observed in _Wong Kam Fong Anne v Ang Ann Liang_ <span class="citation">[1992] 3 SLR(R) 902</span> where Mic hael Hwang JC c onsidered the c ourt’s exerc ise of its powers under s 106(1) of the Women's Charter (Cap 353, 1985 Rev Ed) (now s 112(1) of the Charter) in relation to an agreement made by the parties prior to their divorc e c onc erning the disposal of their matrimonial assets. While s 106(2) did not c ontain a provision similar to s 112(2)( _e_ ) of the Charter, Hwang JC’s observations are useful in highlighting the importanc e of exerc ising c aution when interfering with a s 112(2)( _e_ ) agreement. At [36]: 

 The deed was therefore intended as a c omprehensive financ ial and property settlement between the parties. The deed was made at a time when the parties had already been separated, and divorce was viewed as a real possibility, although not necessarily in the immediate future. Under these c irc umstanc es, I c onsidered that the onus was on the husband, who was seeking to disc laim the effec tiveness of the deed, to justify why the c ourt should proc eed to exerc ise its powers under s 106 in disregard of the express intentions of the parties made in c ontemplation of prec isely the situation whic h had now arisen. [emphasis added] 

14     Returning to the present c ase, a c entral fac tual question for me to dec ide is what perc entage share in the division of the assets was asc ribed to the Defendant by the Deed. For the further reasons explained in this judgment, the Defendant’s perc entage share is 34% based on a c omputation of the Marc h 2003 values of the assets that was determined to be S$8,307,351. 

15     The c ourt’s task is to make a fair and equitable award having regard to the assets that are determined to be matrimonial assets subjec t to division and the applic able valuation date or dates that are used to arrive at the total monetary value of the matrimonial assets. In so doing, I will give c onsideration to the Deed and all the other relevant fac tors in this c ase. On the fac ts and evidenc e, I find that the Plaintiff’s retirement benefits is a matrimonial asset that should be up for division and that a fair and equitable division for the Defendant is 40% of this adjusted pool of assets based largely on 2003 values. In this respec t, the anc illary orders that I make in this c ase do not disc ard but give effec t to some of the terms in the Deed, and will also deal with how this 6% inc rease is to be provided for by the Plaintiff. 

16     In this judgment, maintenanc e is disc ussed after the division of assets. The Defendant asked for maintenanc e if she was not suc c essful in sec uring a division of 60% of the immovable matrimonial assets. It is not disputed that the Deed did not deal with maintenanc e. For the reasons below, there is justific ation for awarding the Defendant lump sum maintenanc e. 

**The approach towards post-nuptial agreements** 


17     In the division of the matrimonial assets, s 112(2) of the Charter requires the c ourt to have regard to “all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase” inc luding a non-exhaustive list of fac tors, of whic h s 112(2)( _e_ ) is of partic ular signific anc e in this c ase. The non-exhaustive list of fac tors are: 

 ( a ) the extent of the c ontributions made by eac h party in money, property or work towards ac quiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets; 

 ( b ) any debt owing or obligation inc urred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any c hild of the marriage; 

 ( c ) the needs of the c hildren (if any) of the marriage; 

 ( d ) the extent of the c ontributions made by eac h party to the welfare of the family, inc luding looking after the home or c aring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party; 

 ( e ) any agreement between the parties with respec t to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in c ontemplation of divorc e; 

 ( f ) any period of rent-free oc c upation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exc lusion of the other party; 

 ( g ) the giving of assistanc e or support by one party to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), inc luding the giving of assistanc e or support whic h aids the other party in the c arrying on of his or her oc c upation or business; and 

 ( h ) the matters referred to in sec tion 114(1) so far as they are relevant. 

18     The legal position in Singapore is now trite: the c ourt has the overriding power to sc rutinise the terms of both pre-nuptial and post-nuptial agreements (inc luding deeds of separation) and will do so in ac c ordanc e with the princ iples of justic e, fairness and equity to both parties (see _TQ v TR and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 961</span> at [73]–[75]). In _AOO v AON_ <span class="citation">[2011] 4 SLR 1169</span>, the Court of Appeal reiterated in _obiter_ that the approac h towards the division of matrimonial assets set out in _TQ v TR_ (a dec ision on pre-nuptial agreements) also applied to post-nuptial agreements (at [19]): 

 On a related note, we would also observe that even agreements between parties in respec t of the division of matrimonial property are not enforc eable in and of themselves. The law governing agreements on division of matrimonial assets is well established: ultimate power is vested in the c ourt in the c ase at hand to divide matrimonial assets in a proportion whic h is just and equitable. In partic ular, a postnuptial agreement between parties is only one of the fac tors to be c onsidered by c ourt, and any suc h agreement c annot oust the jurisdic tion of c ourt. This is made c lear by s 112 of the Ac t itself .... [emphasis in original] 

19     Rec ently, Chao Hic k Tin JA in _AQS v AQR_ <span class="citation">[2012] SGCA 3</span> reiterated the legal position at [35]: 

 In any c ase, an agreement between the parties made in c ontemplation of divorc e c ould not be dec isive. It is only one of the fac tors listed in s112(2) of the Women’s Charter that the c ourt must take into ac c ount as part of its overarc hing duty to reac h a just and equitable division in light of all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase. This Court affirmed in TQ v TR and another appeal <span class="citation">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 961</span> at [75] that even though post-nuptial agreements c ould be ac c orded more weight than pre-nuptial agreements, how muc h weight was to be alloc ated to a postnuptial must 


 ultimately depend on the prec ise c irc umstanc es of the c ase. ... 

20     Mr Khoo relied on _Granatino v Radmacher_ [2010] 3 WLR 1367 (“ _Granatino_ ”) for the proposition that the c ourt should defer to the wishes of the parties and be slow to interfere in a marital agreement, espec ially a separation agreement, unless there was a signific ant or material c hange in 

c irc umstanc es to diminish or eliminate the weight to be given to the marital agreement. [note: 4] Mr Khoo’s point was that when a separation agreement was put together with divorc e in mind, in the absenc e of exc eptional grounds amounting to a c hange of c irc umstanc es (and there was no suggestion of suc h a c hange in this c ase), the Deed should be ac c orded full weight. Spec ific ally, the English Supreme Court in _Granatino_ noted at [65] that: 

 ... A separation agreement is designed to take effec t immediately and to address the c irc umstanc es prevailing at the time that it is made, as well, of c ourse, as those c ontemplated in the future. It will have regard to any c hildren of the family, to the assets of husband and wife, to their inc omes and to their pension rights. Thus it makes sense to look for a signific ant c hange of c irc umstanc es as the c riterion justifying a departure from the agreement. 

21     There are two other c ases before _Granatino_ that dealt with the c irc umstanc es to be c onsidered in determining the weight to be given to marital agreements. Ormrod LJ in _Edgar v Edgar_ [1980] 1 WLR 1410 observed at 1417: 

 To dec ide what weight should be given, in order to reac h a just result, to a prior agreement not to c laim a lump sum, regard must be had to the c onduc t of both parties, leading up to the prior agreement, and to their subsequent c onduc t, in c onsequenc e of it. It is not nec essary in this c onnec tion to think in formal legal terms, suc h as misrepresentation or estoppel; all the c irc umstanc es as they affec t eac h of two human beings must be c onsidered in the c omplex relationship of marriage. So, the c irc umstanc es surrounding the making of the agreement are relevant. Under pressure by one side, exploitation of a dominant position to sec ure an unreasonable advantage, inadequate knowledge, possibly bad legal advic e, an important c hange of c irc umstanc es, unforeseen or overlooked at the time of making the agreement, are all relevant to the question of justic e between the parties. Important too is the general proposition that formal agreements, properly and fairly arrived at with c ompetent legal advic e, should not be displac ed unless there are good and substantial grounds for c onc luding that an injustic e will be done by holding the parties to the terms of their agreement. There may well be other c onsiderations whic h affec t the justic e of this c ase; the above list is not intended to be an exc lusive c atalogue. [emphasis in original] 

22     Ormrod LJ’s observations bec ame the basis of a test c reated by the Privy Counc il in _MacLeod v MacLeod_ [2009] 3 WLR 437 (“ _MacLeod_ ”) wherein the party c laiming anc illary relief despite financ ial arrangements having been made must show a c hange in c irc umstanc es whic h would make these arrangements manifestly unjust, suc h as a failure to make proper provision for any c hild of the family, or that it is c ontrary to public polic y to c ast onto the public purse an obligation whic h ought properly to be shouldered within the family (see [41]). 

23     The majority of the Supreme Court in _Granatino_ approved the approac h established in _MacLeod_. It must be noted that Baroness Hale of Ric hmond in her dissenting judgment in _Granatino_ disapproved of the majority introduc ing a presumption or starting point in favour of giving effec t to a nuptial agreement untainted by vitiating fac tors as it was “an inadmissible judic ial gloss” to do so (see _Granatino_ at [166] and [169]). Instead, she preferred a test of fairness (at [169]): 

 ... The test to be applied to suc h an agreement, it seems to me, should be this: “ Did each party 


 freely enter into an agreement, intending it to have legal effect and with a full appreciation of its implications? If so, in the circumstances as they now are, would it be fair to hold them to their agreement?” That is very similar to the test proposed by the majority, but it seeks to avoid the “impermissible judic ial gloss” of a presumption or starting point, while mitigating the rigours of the MacLeod v MacLeod test in an appropriate c ase. It allows the c ourt to give full weight to the agreement if it is fair to do so and I adhere to the view expressed in MacLeod v MacLeod [2010] 1 AC 298 that it c an be entirely fair to hold the parties to their agreement even if the outc ome is very different from what a c ourt would order if they had not made it. ... [emphasis added] 

24     In my view, the majority’s approac h in _Granatino_ , whic h introduc es a presumption in favour of giving full weight to a valid marital agreement, is inc onsistent with the approac h artic ulated in _TQ v TR_ and reiterated by the Court of Appeal in subsequent c ases. Indeed, the majority’s approac h in _Granatino_ c ontradic ts s 112 of the Charter whic h requires the c ourt to take into ac c ount various fac tors and not to give priority to the existenc e of a marital agreement. 

25     I do not ac c ept Mr Khoo’s additional argument that a c hange of c irc umstanc es is the only c riterion justifying a departure from the Deed. A c hange in c irc umstanc es, whether unforeseen or overlooked at the time of entering into the marital agreement, may be relevant in c onsidering how muc h weight should be ac c orded to the agreement (see also the 2012 Judgment at [55]). However, it would most c ertainly not be the _only_ rationale for departing from the agreement. Otherwise, the c ourt would effec tively be giving an overriding effec t to the Deed, whic h as mentioned earlier, would be c ontradic tory to s 112(2) of the Charter. For c ompleteness, the rec ent Court of Appeal dec ision of _AYM v AYL_ <span class="citation">[2013] 1 SLR 924</span> (although a c ase on s 112(4) of the Charter) made c lear that not just any c hange in c irc umstanc e will suffic e. At the very least, the new c irc umstanc e must be seen as so radic al a c hange as to justify a variation of the c onsent order. Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA delivering the judgment of the appellate c ourt said at [25]: 

 ... We are of the view that where new c irc umstanc es have emerged sinc e the order was made whic h so radically change the situation so that to implement the order as originally made would be to implement something whic h is radic ally different from what was originally intended, this would amount to unworkability, and the c ourt would make, inter alia , the nec essary variation to deal with suc h unworkability. [emphasis in original] 

26     At these anc illary proc eedings, the c ourt will have regard to the Deed in making the anc illary orders. The legislative intent of s 112(2)( _e_ ) is to give regard to a marital agreement that is fair and equitable. In the rec ent Court of Appeal c ase of _Lian Hwee Choo Phebe v Tan Seng Ong_ <span class="citation">[2013] 3 SLR 1162</span>, the c ourt remarked at [16]: 

 It bears mention that if in any partic ular divorc e proc eedings it is established that an agreement falling within s 112(2)( e ) exists, that agreement is only one of the fac tors the c ourt has to c onsider when dec iding how the matrimonial assets are to be divided. Depending on the c irc umstanc es, this may not be the main fac tor in the division. The parties and the Judge were fully aware of this aspec t and the Judge noted at [55] of his judgment that his finding on the existenc e of the Agreement was not the end of the inquiry and the c ourt would have to look at all the c irc umstanc es to determine how muc h weight to give to the Agreement. 

27     In the later dec ision of _Sita Jaswant Kaur v Surindar Singh s/o Jaswant Singh_ <span class="citation">[2013] 4 SLR 838</span> (“ _Sita Jaswant Kuar_ ”), Choo Han Tec k J found that the settlement agreement that parties had signed after a mediation session was unjust and inequitable as it did not enc ompass all the matrimonial assets and the division was disadvantageous to the wife. Choo J observed at [6]: 


 ... In a division of matrimonial assets proc eedings, the c ourt is not merely enforc ing an agreement or the resolution of a mediation; it is exerc ising its disc retion under s 112(2), taking into ac c ount any agreement whic h may have been made and any other c irc umstanc es present, to determine what is a fair and equitable division. ... 

28     He thus c onc luded that a just and equitable division would be to give eac h party an equal share of the matrimonial assets. _Sita Jaswant Kuar_ showed that in a c ase of an unjust and inequitable agreement, the c ourt c an give little or no weight to the agreement and divide the assets as it deems fair and equitable. 

29     Conversely, an alternative approac h was adopted by Andrew Ang J in _AFS v AFU_. In that c ase, the husband and wife had entered into a deed of separation, in whic h one c lause provided that the assets ac quired by either party after the date of the deed would remain as assets of the ac quiring party, while two rec itals required full disc losure by both parties. The deed was entered into on 19 February 2003, and a _decree nisi_ was obtained on 28 April 2006. The anc illary proc eedings c ame before Andrew Ang J only four years after the _decree nisi_ and orders were made on 25 November 

2010\. By this time, some seven years had already elapsed sinc e the deed. Ang J observed at [18] that even if the agreement was not set aside, the c ourt had liberty to dec ide that an agreement “ought not to apply if the c ourt does not c onsider it just and equitable”. 

30     Ang J found that it would be inequitable to the wife to hold both parties to the c lause in question as the husband, in breac h of the rec itals, had failed to disc lose his ac quisition of shares worth some S$12m and S$985,000 as c onsideration thereof in the drawing up of the separation agreement, and had subsequently failed to c omply with his duty of full and frank disc losure to the c ourt. These shares and the c onsideration were found to be matrimonial assets whic h the wife would have had a share of had they been disc losed under the agreement. Therefore, Ang J awarded the wife a 25% share of the shares and the c onsideration, leaving undisturbed the wife’s earlier 50% share of the matrimonial assets under the agreement. In doing so, Ang J had given c onsiderable weight to the agreement and had only tweaked spec ific parts of the agreement suc h that he c ould arrive at a just and equitable division in relation to the shares and the c onsideration. 

31     How muc h weight the c ourt ac c ords to a marital agreement depends on the division under the agreement as well as the fac ts of the c ase, whic h means that not only the terms but also the parties’ c onduc t surrounding the making and the exec ution of the agreement would be sc rutinised. In addition, the c ourt will look at the marital agreement in light of the other fac tors set out in s 112(2). I propose to approac h the problem here in the following manner. First, the starting point is to asc ertain the manner of division under the Deed as this is nec essary to determine how muc h weight should be ac c orded to it. Sec ond, the Deed will be c onsidered in light of the various fac tors listed under s 112(2) to arrive at a fair and equitable division. 

**The 2012 Judgment** 

32     I should mention again the 2012 Judgment where the standard vitiating fac tors that would negate the effec t of the Deed were c onsidered and rejec ted. There was no unworthy c onduc t giving c ause to reduc e or eliminate the weight to be attac hed to the Deed. Consequently, the referenc e to the parties’ c onduc t (at [31] above) should not be interpreted as re-opening the question of whether the Deed should be enforc ed. As stated, the issue of the parties’ c onduc t leading to the signing of the Deed was already addressed in the 2012 Judgment where I had found the Deed to be valid based on the following findings: 

 (a) The Defendant had apprec iated the legal signific anc e of the Deed (at [30]–[34]); 


 (b) The Defendant had rec eived legal advic e on the Deed (at [35]–[36]), and had even bargained with the Plaintiff for a larger division of 50% of the matrimonial assets (at [31] and [33]); 

 (c ) The Defendant was not too affec ted or depressed to think c learly and rationally before signing the Deed (at [37]–[42]); 

 (d) The Defendant had not signed the Deed on the Plaintiff’s false promise of rec onc iliation (at [47]–[48]); and 

 (e) The Defendant’s ability to func tion normally at work was c onsistent with the evidenc e that at the material time she was not in either a depressive state or that she was mentally vulnerable (at [49]). 

I am thus minded not to dwell on the c irc umstanc es surrounding the making of the Deed even though Ms Ragupathy c ontinued to press the point that the Defendant was depressed and was c oerc ed into signing the Deed. 

33     In this c ase, the c ontemporaneous doc umentation exhibited by the parties indic ates how and why the division resulted. In an e-mail dated 21 Marc h 2003, a few days before the Deed was signed, the Plaintiff informed the Defendant in no unc ertain terms that he was giving her “more than a 20% split” of their matrimonial assets. This e-mail was written to the Defendant as a response to her letter whic h raised the argument that she was entitled to at least 50% of all the assets that were ac quired 

during the marriage. In his e-mail, the Plaintiff wrote: [note: 5] 

 I am very annoyed by your letter as I have stated over the phone. There is no split of 50% to you. I do not agree and will never agree. The only way for you to hope to ac hieve that is for us to have a full blown legal dispute over our matrimonial assets. ... 

 ... 

 Thirdly, I believe that if I split 20% of our total assets as of end 2002 to you, it would be a fair split. The proposal that I gave you had more than a 20% split. ... 

 .... 

 The separation deed will be drafted. It will be binding. If you love me you do not fight with me and take what I think is fair. If you fight me you will lose me forever. 

34     An earlier e-mail sheds light on the Plaintiff’s rationale for his proposal of more than a 20% split of the matrimonial assets. In his e-mail dated 6 Marc h 2003, the Plaintiff set out his proposed financ ial 

arrangements for the separation and justified it in the following manner: [note: 6] 

 ... But I have to set out our financ ial agreement nevertheless, pending a formal agreement whic h we will sign ... 

 ... 

 The financ ial arrangements are fair in my view. First, you have lived a good life with me ec onomic ally, materially and I believe intellec tually. Sec ondly, I gave you an opportunity to c ome to Singapore and you ac hieved self-ac tualization, fulfilment... Thirdly, had we separated after

 your desertion to Meng Keat 16 years ago, you would not have lived as full a life as you did. ... On my part, I ac knowledge the c ontribution you have made to my life and the enric hment that I have had bec ause of you. ... 

 If you wish to boil down the financ ial arrangements, you have gotten c lose to S$450,000 on Aspen Heights already in hand, plus S$100K now, plus another S$100K by end 2004 plus the down payment for your c ar ... of about S$80K, plus the apartment in KL. Should I assist you to pay for the remainder of Aspen Heights, I would be giving you another S$450K. If you add up the worst c ase sc enario, you have $630K immediately and perhaps another S$550K into the future, giving you a total of S$1,130,000 whic h is more than your life savings. Even S$630K would be more than your life savings. The apartment represents the proc eeds of the bungalow sold and I have not c ounted it therefore. I also did not c ount the other c ars whic h you drove and the fac t that you lost no money on the investments in share that we both made (I am happy to absorb the losses as they were mainly my dec isions). I also helped you furnished your apartment and of c ourse let you have whatever you need to set you up. Of c ourse, you should not forget that the boys are funded by me all the way through university and you need not worry about that. If we want to be really fair, you should bear half of that, but I am not asking you to. 

 ... 

 I hope I have made myself reasonably transparent for you to see where I am c oming from. Please take this as a statement of the reasons for the financ ial arrangements. ... 

The same e-mail also stated that the Plaintiff would c ontribute to “half of the monthly instalment payments” for Aspen Heights. 

35     The e-mails revealed the Plaintiff’s intentions quite c learly — that the Defendant would rec eive more than 20%, but not more than 50% of the matrimonial assets, and that this proposal was based on the Plaintiff’s sense of fairness and the Plaintiff’s financ ial ability to pay for the outstanding loans on the properties. The Defendant had eventually agreed to this arrangement as borne out by her signing of the Deed. Nevertheless, Mr Khoo argued that fairness should not be measured against the e-mail c ontents but on the objec tive basis of the parties’ gains from the separation whic h I will now 

turn to. [note: 7]

**2. Cash on Deposit or in Bank Account**

**1. Real Properties** 

1\.1 25 Leonie Hill #12-01, Leonie Gardens (“Leonie Hill”) 

**2. Cash on Deposit or in Bank Account** 

 (b) The Defendant 

 (c ) Assets held jointly by both parties 


 2.1 Fixed 4-Year Term US Dollar Deposit by way of a princ ipal sum of US$200,000 with the DBS Bank (the “Fixed Term Deposit”) 

37     Notably, the Deed did not provide for any spec ific valuations of the assets. The Deed also did not provide for a full partic ularisation of the matrimonial assets. These were points of c ontention between the parties and they will be elaborated upon below. 

38     The Deed provided for a further elaboration on part (c ) whic h related to assets held jointly by the parties. The Leonie Hill property was the parties’ original matrimonial home whic h they bought in April 1993. The relevant portion of c lause 2.3.1 relating to the Leonie Hill property stated that it was to be benefic ially owned in proportion to the respec tive c ontributions of the Plaintiff to the Singapore Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) and the Defendant to the Ac ademic Staff Provident Fund Sc heme of the National University of Singapore (“ASPF”). Clause 2.31 also stated that: 

 ... The [Plaintiff ] shall purc hase from the [Defendant] her share of [the Leonie Hill property] subjec t to the approval of the CPF, ASPF and the DBS Bank, at a c onsideration equivalent to the redemption amount for the ASPF and the [Plaintiff] shall also assume the entire loan obligations to the DBS Bank inc luding all monthly mortgage repayments without rec ourse to the [Defendant] upon suc h purc hase. After the purc hase of [the Leonie Hill property] by the [Plaintiff ], it shall bec ome a [part (a) asset] and all rights, benefits and liabilities in respec t of [the Leonie Hill property] shall be enjoyed and/or borne by the [Plaintiff]. 

39     By this c lause, the Plaintiff was to purc hase the Defendant’s benefic ial ownership in the Leonie Hill property based on the Defendant’s c ontributions to her ASPF. The Defendant’s ASPF c ontributions 

amounted to S$437,834 before interest, [note: 8] while the Plaintiff’s c ontributions were S$603, before interest. As of Marc h 2003, the Plaintiff would have had to pay $437,834 to the Defendant for her ASPF c ontributions. 

40     As for the Fixed Term Deposit, the Deed provided that this was to be shared equally between the Plaintiff and Defendant. 

41     The Deed also provided at c lauses 2.4 and 2.5 that 

 (a) All assets and bank ac c ounts held and all liabilities borne solely in the name of the Plaintiff or held jointly by the Plaintiff and the Defendant not listed in the Deed shall be owned or borne legally and benefic ially by the Plaintiff; and 

 (b) All assets and bank ac c ounts held and all liabilities borne solely in the name of the Defendant not listed in the Deed shall be owned or borne legally and benefic ially by the Defendant. 

42     Additionally, under c lause 3 of the Deed, the Plaintiff was to pay the Defendant an annual sum of S$100,000 for eac h year from 2003 to 2008 on top of a sum of S$100,000 to be paid on or before 3 Marc h 2003. This amounts to a total of S$700,000. 

43     During the hearing before me, Ms Ragupathy argued that a fair and equitable division would be to see the Defendant exit the marriage with 60% of all the immoveable properties as c ompared to what she was getting under the Deed whic h she maintained was a mere 18% of all the matrimonial assets. On the other hand, Mr Khoo argued that the Deed provided for a fair and equitable distribution 


as the Defendant would rec eive 44% of all the matrimonial assets. 

**_The value of the pool of assets under the Deed_** 

44     I note that the Deed does not mention the values of the total assets c omprised in the pool and does not partic ularise the assets in the names of the respec tive parties. This gives rise to the problem of determining the prec ise asset pool and monetary value.. For this sec tion alone, I will be relying on the values as of Marc h 2003 as the Deed was signed on 28 Marc h 2003. 

45     For the purposes of the anc illary proc eedings, eac h side produc ed an ac c ountant’s report to partic ularise the nature and value of the assets subjec t to division under the Deed. Suffic e it to say, the Plaintiff’s expert, Cheng Soon Keong (“CSK”), c alc ulated that the total value of the monetary assets under the Deed as S$6,225,549 to c onc lude that the Defendant was getting 44% of the pool of assets under the Deed as of Marc h 2003. On the other hand, the Defendant’s expert, Loke Poh 

Keun (“LPK”), estimated a larger pool of matrimonial assets valued at S$16,950,520 as of 2010. [note: 9] It appears that LPK and CSK were working on different bases: LPK had inc luded additional assets 

into the pool and had utilised later valuation dates than CSK. I note that LPK’s valuation dates were inappropriate in this exerc ise of determining the value of the assets and its division under a doc ument that was signed in Marc h 2003. 

46     I will now examine CSK’s figures and explain my c onc lusion that a 44% division to the Defendant was inac c urate. 

47     Mr Khoo attempted to show through CSK’s report that the Defendant was rec eiving a sum that entitled her to 44% of the matrimonial assets in 2003 and that this was a fair and equitable distribution of the assets. In this report, there were deduc tions totalling S$989,926 for tax liabilities, remittanc es and insuranc e payments for the c hildren whic h resulted in a smaller pool of assets available for distribution. This approac h is untenable. Notably, these deduc tions were for payment 

obligations after Marc h 2003. [note: 10] Moreover, the balanc es in some of the bank ac c ounts, whic h I will turn to later, were ac tually larger in Marc h 2003 than what was stated in CSK’s report whic h c ontributed to the inflated figure of 44%. In these c irc umstanc es, the 44% share of the matrimonial assets was not sustainable. 

48     On a review of the evidenc e, I am of the view that the Defendant was given 34% under the Deed, based on a total valuation of S$8,307,351, being the sum total of all the assets listed in the Deed. There were four main c omponents that c onstitute the entire portfolio of assets under the Deed whic h I will now elaborate upon: First, the immovable properties under the Deed (“the Properties”); sec ond, an alleged S$3.4m in some of the bank ac c ounts and investments portfolios (the “Contested Ac c ounts”); third, the Fixed Term Deposit (see point 2.1 of the table at [36(c )]); and fourth, the remaining ac c ounts that inc luded shares and unit trusts in Singapore and overseas, as well as the rest of the matrimonial assets whic h both parties did not c ontest (“the Unc ontested Assets”). 

_The Properties_ 

49     The issue here was with the valuation of the Properties. The valuations that I dec ided to adopt were those provided by CSK. His report had valued the Properties at 12 Marc h 2003 whic h was the c losest date to the Deed. I note that while CSK attempted to substantiate his values by c rossreferenc ing these values to the Plaintiff’s affidavits, they were not entirely ac c urate. Overall, there was a lac k of evidenc e on the part of the Defendant for that period in time despite the many adjournments and opportunities to furnish the relevant evidenc e. Instead, the Defendant c hose to 


value the Properties at a later stage as seen from LPK’s report. In any event, there was no c hallenge by the Defendant to the Plaintiff’s valuations as of 12 Marc h 2003. Therefore, as of Marc h 2003, the Properties, inc luding their liabilities, were valued at S$3,091,795. The values for eac h immovable property c an be found below in Annex 1. 

_The Contested Accounts_ 

50     It was not disputed that the monies in the bank ac c ounts and investment portfolios were matrimonial assets. The Defendant’s c omplaint was that before the Deed was signed, an alleged S$3,461,103.10 in some of the bank ac c ounts and investments portfolios were withdrawn by the Plaintiff. For ease of referenc e, this amount will be referred to as S$3.4m. On the other hand, the Plaintiff c ontended that the amount in question was muc h smaller and was S$1,718,389.88. I have set out the amounts c ontended by both parties in Annex 2 ( _ie_ , the Contested Ac c ounts). 

51     Both the Plaintiff and Defendant tabulated a list of the amounts they alleged were in the 

Contested Ac c ounts. [note: 11] From the outset, it must be noted that the paper trail for the movement of monies in the bank ac c ounts and investment portfolios was not c lear from either of the parties’ affidavits, although both parties were given ample time to produc e doc uments to support their c ases. Further, c ounsel did not assist in the c larific ation of how these Contested Ac c ounts were related to the spec ific ac c ounts listed in the Deed. I thus made referenc e to the ac c ounts listed in the Deed ac c ording to the evidenc e that I had before me. 

52     For S/N 1 of Annex 2, the Defendant produc ed an ABN AMRO bank letter whic h stated the 

balanc e in the ac c ount as of 1 November 2002 to be S$879,624.30. [note: 12] The Plaintiff stated that the bank ac c ount was c losed on 7 April 2003, and the monies were transferred to another ABN AMRO 

bank ac c ount. [note: 13] The remaining balanc e in the c losed ac c ount was US$565.79. [note: 14] 

Ac c ording to the Plaintiff, the monies were then transferred into a HSBC ac c ount. [note: 15] As of 31 

Aug 2006, the c redit balanc e in the HSBC ac c ount was US$258,088.69. [note: 16] As there was no paper trail for me to asc ertain the movement of the monies, I adopted the Wife’s number instead. 

53     As for S/N 2 of Annex 2, the Defendant had relied on the Dec ember 2002 statement of ac c ount 

to arrive at the figure of $1,897,486.72. [note: 17] However, she had misread this doc ument by simply lifting the figure from the debit value without looking at the balanc e whic h was ac tually zero. It c ould be inferred from the doc ument that the ac c ount was used to make time deposits whic h meant that monies that flowed in always flowed out into other deposits. The Plaintiff showed that the amount in 

the ac c ount as of 31 Oc tober 2002 was US$492,010. [note: 18] Monies c redited into that ac c ount were moved by the Plaintiff into another UBS AG ac c ount after he found out about the Defendant’s infidelity. The Plaintiff was otherwise unable to show any later figure in this other UBS AG ac c ount 

exc ept for a figure as of 31 July 2006. [note: 19] The figure of S$731,939.79 stated by CSK c ould also 

not be rec onc iled with his report. [note: 20] Due to the lapse of time and the absenc e of values as of Marc h 2003, I adopted the 31 Oc tober 2002 figure as this was c losest in time to the date of the Deed. Converted into Singapore dollars with the exc hange rate used by the Defendant (US$1=S$1.70), the amount was S$836,417. 

54     The Defendant arrived at her figure at S/N 3 of Annex 2 based on a portfolio summary for 

August 2002. [note: 21] The Plaintiff was unable to support his number with any doc umentary 

evidenc e. [note: 22] Henc e, I adopted the Defendant’s number whic h is S$117,708.88. 


55     The Defendant asserted that although the monies in S/N 4 of Annex 2 went into the Plaintiff’s sole DBS Ac c ount No [xxx72-5], they were initially transferred from a joint DBS Ac c ount No [xxx47-0]. [note: 23] The Plaintiff however had earlier asserted that the joint DBS Ac c ount No [xxx47-0] was a 

sole ac c ount. [note: 24] Even so, sinc e the Plaintiff did not dispute that the sole DBS Ac c ount No [xxx72-5] c ontained funds that were part of the matrimonial pool, I ac c epted it to be so. However, I c ould not ac c ept the Defendant’s figure of S$235,318.00 as there was no substantiation for it. Neither c ould I ac c ept the Plaintiff’s figure of S$174,002.61, as this was not the amount stated in his affidavit of asset and means. Instead, I found a c opy of the deposits made in Oc tober 2002 whic h 

amounted to AUD$161,677.05. [note: 25] Using the c losest exc hange rate I c ould find to that date, _ie_ , the rate furnished by CSK for 28 Marc h 2003, I c alc ulated that the amount was S$170,714.80. 

56     For the investments listed as S/N 5 to 7 in Annex 2, the Defendant relied on an e-mail from a representative at DBS. The numbers stated by the Defendant in Annex 2 were the proc eeds rec eived 

when the investments were sold on 31 Marc h 2004. [note: 26] The proc eeds were then plac ed in the Plaintiff’s POSB Ac c ount. CSK seemed to have permutated the numbers to reflec t what he thought it 

would be as at 12 Marc h 2003. [note: 27] However, there was no methodology to explain how he arrived at the amounts. Therefore, the only numbers that were substantiated were supplied by the Defendant, albeit with a year’s differenc e, and so I ac c epted the Defendant’s numbers. 

57     In c onc lusion, I find that as of Marc h 2003, the Contested Ac c ounts c omprised S$2,335,430. The breakdown of this figure c an be found below in Annex 3 ( _ie_ , the Revised Contested Ac c ounts). 

_Fixed Term Deposit_ 

58     As of Marc h 2003, the Fixed Term Deposit whic h amounted to S$348,240 [note: 28] was supposed to be split equally by the parties _ie_. S$174,120 eac h. There is no dispute on this figure. 

_The Uncontested Assets_ 

59     As for the Unc ontested Assets, I ac c epted the figures in CSK’s report whic h totalled 

S$2,531,886 as they were valued in Marc h 2003. [note: 29] A full list of the Unc ontested Assets as well as their values c an be found below in Annex 4. 

_Conclusion on total value of assets and division under the Deed_ 

60     I find that the value of all the matrimonial assets as of Marc h 2003 was S$8,307,351, being the sum total of the Unc ontested Assets, the Revised Contested Ac c ounts, the Fixed Term Deposit and the Properties. 

61     Ac c ordingly, under the Deed, the Wife would rec eive S$1,060,197 of the Unc ontested Assets, [note: 30] S$427,586 for Aspen Heights and W Vista Kiara, S$174,120 from the Fixed Deposit, and 

S$437,834 from Leonie Hill (see above at [39]). Furthermore, the Plaintiff would have to pay the Defendant S$700,000 pursuant to c lause 3 of the Deed. Therefore, the Defendant would rec eive S$2,799,737, or 34% under the Deed. 

**Is the 34% share under the Deed fair and equitable?** 

62     I will now deal with the Defendant’s c omplaints as to why the Deed was unfair and inequitable. Subsequently, I will assess what would be a fair and equitable division under s 112(1) of the Charter, 


bearing in mind that the Deed is a fac tor to be taken into c onsideration under s 112(2)( _e_ ). 

**_The Defendant’s complaints on excluded assets_** 

63     The first c omplaint was that some assets had been exc luded from the Deed. I will deal with this c omplaint first, leaving her sec ond c omplaint on the perc entage figures to later (see [77]). Should I find any of the c omplaints to be valid, this may affec t the weight I ac c ord to the Deed, bearing in mind the broad brush approac h that the c ourt is to take. 

_Suria Stonor_ 

64     Ms Ragupathy had initially argued that a property purc hased by the Plaintiff in Malaysia known as Suria Stonor should be inc luded in the pool. However, she dropped this c laim in the c ourse of oral arguments seeing that the Plaintiff had purc hased the property on 31 July 2006, whic h post-dated the Deed, and thus this property did not belong in the pool of assets. 

_Rental income_ 

65     The Defendant also c ontended that the pool of matrimonial assets should inc lude the rental 

inc ome earned from the various properties up to 2002. [note: 31] The Defendant’s c laim for the rental inc ome was untenable as the monies were applied to the various properties to c over part of the 

mortgage loans and other property-related expenses on the various properties up to 2002. [note: 32] To c laim that they were to be inc luded into the pool would be to overlook where the monies were applied to and double c ount the amount, whic h c annot be c orrec t. I thus rejec t the Defendant’s c laim for rental inc ome earned. 

66     Ms Ragupathy also argued that rental inc ome c ollec ted by the Plaintiff in the period 2008 to 

2010 should be inc luded in the division. [note: 33] I disagree simply bec ause this rental inc ome ac c rued after the Deed. 

_The alleged S$3.4m_ 

67     Ms Ragupathy submitted that S$3.4m was taken by the Plaintiff from the bank ac c ounts and investment portfolios before the Defendant signed the Deed, and that these monies should rightly be added to the pool of assets. I have already dealt with the ac tual amount of monies in these ac c ounts (see [50]–[57]) and have c onsidered these monies to be part of the pool of assets when I found that the Defendant was to rec eive 34% under the Deed. 

68     As regards Ms Ragupathy’s related argument that the Plaintiff had dissipated S$3.4m and that they were no longer available for division, this point is now moot sinc e I have c alc ulated the total value of the asset pool under the Deed to be S$8,307,351, and the Defendant’s 34% share was derived partly from this figure as well. In any c ase, as parties had heavily c ontested this point before me in the anc illary hearing, for c ompleteness, I will deal with this issue. 

69     Ms Ragupathy c ontended that even before the Deed was signed, the Plaintiff had transferred monies from some of the parties’ joint ac c ounts into his sole ac c ounts in Dec ember 2002 and February 2003, and had refused to produc e statements of ac c ounts as of November 2002. Ms Ragupathy argued that there was some S$2.4m in the Contested Ac c ounts that the Defendant c ould not attain as part of the matrimonial assets bec ause of the movement of funds by the Plaintiff before the Deed 

was signed. [note: 34] Ms Ragupathy then argued that this amount had inc reased to S$3,461,103. 


during the hearing on 2 Oc tober 2012. [note: 35] I have c onc luded that S$2,335,430 was in the Contested Ac c ounts and this was the amount in issue ( _ie_ , the Revised Contested Ac c ounts at Annex 3). 

70     For the Defendant’s allegation to suc c eed, the Defendant must prove that the balanc es in the Revised Contested Ac c ounts had dec reased, and that the Plaintiff had used the amounts in them for his own means even though they belonged in the pool of matrimonial assets. Mr Khoo argued that in respec t of the amounts in the Revised Contested Ac c ounts, the monies were not stolen or misapplied, [note: 36] and that there were legitimate expenses between 2002 and 2006 to explain where the 

monies went. 

71     Mr Khoo explained the nature of these legitimate expenses. [note: 37] At the hearing before me, Mr Khoo produc ed a list of expenses that inc luded a c ash payment to the Defendant, the payment of the Plaintiff’s tax liabilities, the insuranc e polic ies and educ ation for their c hildren, and mortgage 

payments for the Aspen Heights property from Marc h 2003 to September 2006. [note: 38] I note that some monies were utilised for the part payment of the purc hase pric e for #10-01 Pebble Bay before 2003 and the losses of investments in Horizon Global Equity, Eight C Fund and Eight D Fund, but Ms Ragupathy did not refute any of the expenses. Any remaining unac c ounted monies at the end of 2006 would likely to have been S$177,918.28. However, this amount would have already been taken into ac c ount in the total value of the pool of assets under the Deed, _ie_ , S$8,307,351 (see above at [57] about Annex 3). In c onc lusion, I find that the allegation of dissipation was not made out. 

_The Plaintiff’s retirement benefits_ 

72     As for the Plaintiff’s retirement benefits, Ms Ragupathy argued that they should be up for division. Ms Ragupathy also c omplained that the Plaintiff has not fully disc losed his inc ome and/or interests in his legal prac tic e. 

73     This issue of non-disc losure has already c ropped up several times in these proc eedings. In Summons 3708 of 2007 and 3819 of 2007, the Deputy Registrar rejec ted the Defendant’s applic ation for disc overy in relation to the Plaintiff’s inc ome and interests in all c ompanies under the umbrella of Baker & Mc Kenzie and all related doc uments. On appeal, the Distric t Judge in Chambers allowed the appeal and ordered for disc overy and interrogatories to be made in relation to the inc ome and interest of the Plaintiff in Baker & Mc Kenzie and Abogado Pte Ltd only. The Plaintiff appealed against the order 

of the Distric t Judge. Andrew Ang J allowed the appeal after the Plaintiff filed the 4th affidavit of Mr Robert S Spenc er (“Mr Spenc er”), the Chief Financ ial Offic er of Baker & Mc Kenzie International. The Plaintiff thus obtained four affidavits from Mr Spenc er, whic h c larified and stated the Plaintiff’s interests and inc ome from the various c ompanies under the umbrella of Baker & Mc Kenzie. 

74     Ms Ragupathy alleged that the evidenc e of Mr Spenc er c ould not be believed as Mr Spenc er was somehow c omplic it with the Plaintiff in omitting relevant information or avoiding answering questions, despite having been sworn to state the truth in his affidavits. 

75     This is a spec ulative and grave allegation that I am not willing to entertain in the absenc e of objec tive evidenc e. The four affidavits of Mr Spenc er c umulatively show that all the inc ome and interests whatsoever that the Plaintiff had in the c ompanies have been disc losed at paragraph 7 of 

the first affidavit of Mr Spenc er. [note: 39] Spec ific ally, Mr Spenc er stated at paragraph 6 of his third affidavit that all inc ome rec eived by the Plaintiff from Baker & Mc Kenzie has been inc luded in 

paragraph 7 of the first affidavit. [note: 40] I am not willing to infer from the omission of Mr Spenc er to 


state this in his first and sec ond affidavit that Mr Spenc er is deliberately evasive and understating the Plaintiff’s inc ome. The subsequent affidavits filed after the first affidavit c larified the first affidavit. There is thus no basis for the Defendant’s allegations of non-disc losure. 

76     However, as a matter of princ iple, I did rec ognise that even though the entitlement to the benefits was prospec tive in nature it would nevertheless be c onsidered a matrimonial asset. 

**_The Defendant seeks 60% share of the immovable properties_** 

77     The Defendant’s sec ond c omplaint relates to the perc entage of division under the Deed. She maintained that she was entitled to 60% of the immovable properties. Ms Ragupathy c ontended that ac c ording to the valuation as of 26 November 2012, the Defendant was given only 18% of all the 

matrimonial assets. [note: 41] Therefore, the division under the Deed was unfair. However, in my judgment, there was no legal justific ation for using the 2012 values. As for the 60% share, the Defendant’s assertion was without merit. This will be c lear from my elaboration below. 

**_Other relevant factors_** 

78     Generally, to determine a just and equitable division in terms of perc entage under s 112(2) of the Charter, I will have to c onsider the relevant fac tors listed. 

79     It is trite law that the division of matrimonial assets esc hews an examination of the exac t c ontributions of husband and wife (see _NK v NL_ <span class="citation">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 743</span> at [28]). The relevant princ iples are suc c inc tly stated by Phang JA in _Pang Rosaline v Chan Kong Chin_ <span class="citation">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 935</span> at [23]: 

 In arriving at our dec ision as to what was a “just and equitable” division ... we bore in mind, in partic ular, the following princ iples. The first c entred on the fac t that the division of matrimonial assets under s 112 of the Ac t is not – and c annot be – a prec ise mathematic al exerc ise and that the c ourt’s disc retion is to be exerc ised in broad strokes instead ... In this regard, it was also pointed out in NK v NL (at [22]–[27]), that direct financ ial c ontributions are not to be c onsidered as a prima facie starting point although they nevertheless c onstitute a fac tor whic h should be c onsidered by the c ourt pursuant to the exerc ise of its disc retion under s 112 of the Ac t (whic h involves what is essentially a multi-fac torial approac h). We have also referred to the need to ensure that indirect c ontributions are also ac c orded due rec ognition (see [21] above). 

80     The Court of Appeal’s observations in _BCB v BCC_ <span class="citation">[2013] 2 SLR 324</span> (at [13]–[26]) are apposite in this c ase where the Plaintiff’s direc t financ ial c ontributions to the ac quisition of real properties in Singapore and Malaysia during the marriage were signific antly more than the Defendant who had a muc h lower inc ome. At [27]: 

 The purpose of highlighting the above dec isions (whic h nec essarily c onstitute but an indic ative sample only) is to demonstrate a c ertain trend in c ases that share broadly similar fac ts. This trend appears to be that, for marriages of moderate lengths of time ... or for marriages whic h have lasted for a very long time ... and where there are c hildren to the marriage and both parties are working and have made direc t as well as indirec t c ontributions to the marriage, the c ourts would rec ognise all these c ontributions despite arguments to the effec t that one party had made more direct financ ial c ontributions. [emphasis in original] 

81     Adopting a “broad brush” approac h to a division of the matrimonial assets is of partic ularly relevanc e in this c ase espec ially given (a) the signific ant number of assets, (b) that the exac t financ ial c ontribution of eac h party to the ac quisition of the assets was not fully doc umented by 


either party, and (c ) the c onflic ting ac c ounts of the extent of their c ontributions offered by both parties. As stated in _Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2011] 2 SLR 1157</span> (“ _Yeo Chong Lin_ ”) at [66] and [81]: 

 ... What must be c learly rec ognised is that when the c ourt makes suc h a determination it is not undertaking an exerc ise based on arithmetic but a judgmental exerc ise based, in part at least, on feel. 

 ... 

 ... At the end of the day, we wish to undersc ore the point that the broad brush approac h, as stated in [66], is all about feel and the c ourt’s sense of justic e. 

82     The Plaintiff argued that whatever the Defendant was given under the Deed was fair as he had paid for most of properties in Singapore and Malaysia. The Defendant, on the other hand, c ontended 

in her affidavits [note: 42] that she had also made direc t financ ial c ontributions towards the ac quisition of the properties too and alleged that the rental inc omes from the various properties were used to pay off the loans on the properties. However, she was unable to adduc e direc t evidenc e of her payments towards suc h ac quisitions. She referred to payments out of a Gleneagles and Kent Ridge 

ac c ount but no evidenc e was adduc ed to show the amounts and the periods of payments. [note: 43] In partic ular, while the Defendant alleged that she paid c ash and used monies from her ASPF ac c ount 

to pay for the Leonie Hill property, [note: 44] she did not produc e doc uments showing her c ontributions in this respec t. Nevertheless, the Plaintiff did not deny that she had c ontributed financ ially, though in 

a limited way, to the ac quisition of Leonie Hill. [note: 45] 

83     The Plaintiff has adduc ed evidenc e showing that he had made substantial, if not the majority of 

the financ ial c ontributions towards the ac quisition of the properties, [note: 46] in partic ular the Leonie Hill, #10-01 Pebble Bay and Aspen Heights properties. At any rate, it is not unreasonable to infer from the Plaintiff’s larger inc ome earnings that he financ ed the ac quisition of the properties. It was also an observable trend that the family’s wealth grew in the 1990s when the Plaintiff began working in Singapore. Their matrimonial home, Leonie Hill, was purc hased in 1993, and the bulk of the properties in Singapore and in Malaysia were ac quired after the Plaintiff bec ame an international partner in Baker 

& Mc Kenzie in 1993. [note: 47] 

84     There is no doubt that the Plaintiff’s earnings as a lawyer in Singapore were more than the Defendant who was an ac ademic. A c omparison of the inc ome tax dec larations of the parties c learly showed that the Plaintiff’s inc ome grew steadily over the years and was muc h larger than the 

Defendant’s inc ome. [note: 48] 

85     It was c lear from the affidavits that the Plaintiff has worked hard and done very well in his sec ond c areer and that his c areer switc h has benefitted the family. He paid for most of the c hildren’s 

educ ation and living expenses overseas, [note: 49] as well as the insuranc e premiums for the c hildren. [note: 50] The Defendant did not deny that the Plaintiff had paid for most of the c hildren’s overseas 

educ ation. [note: 51] 

86     There is one other point in the Plaintiff’s favour. The properties in Singapore and Malaysia that were enc umbered were largely repaid by 2012 and in this way, the Plaintiff managed to keep the bulk of the matrimonial assets intac t without the assistanc e of the Defendant after 2003. In fac t, the Plaintiff had paid for all the outstanding loans on the Aspen Heights property even though the 


Defendant was supposed to pay for half of them after the date of the Deed. From Marc h 2003 to May 2012, the Plaintiff had managed to pay off the outstanding mortgage balanc e on the Leonie Hill property. Between Marc h 2003 and 31 Dec ember 2010, the mortgage for #10-01 Pebble Bay was also fully paid for by the Plaintiff. Between Marc h 2003 to February 2013, the Plaintiff had managed to pay off the Aspen Heights mortgage (albeit partly with the use of the matrimonial assets, see above at [71]), and S$722,362.07 of the #12-01 Pebble Bay mortgage from Marc h 2003 to Dec ember 2011. Between Marc h 2003 and January 2012, the Plaintiff had also managed to pay S$306,129.73 of the 

mortgage over the #12-10 Pebble Bay property. [note: 52] It was c lear from the Plaintiff’s metic ulous spread sheets that the loans (and their interest) were paid off by him, for whic h due c redit for asset preservation should be ac c orded to him. In this regard, the Plaintiff’s wealth management efforts must be rec ognised. 

87     The c ontributions of the Defendant must be c onsidered too. The dynamic s of the parties’ relationship and events prior to 1987 when the Plaintiff moved to Singapore to work as a lawyer are partic ularly important. For the first ten years of the marriage, the Defendant earned more than the 

Plaintiff. [note: 53] When the Plaintiff was in England studying for his engineering doc torate and law 

degree, the Defendant took a year’s sabbatic al to be with him and the family. [note: 54] During those 

years, the Defendant c ared for the older son and ran the household. [note: 55] The Defendant said she 

helped the Plaintiff c omplete his doc toral thesis. [note: 56] During the intervals when the Plaintiff was studying overseas and the Defendant was bac k in Malaysia with her son, the Defendant had to take c are of her son and ran the household. Later, in the transition and during the early stages of the Plaintiff’s professional c areer, the family expanded with the birth of the parties’ sec ond son, and the Defendant’s full time employment in ac ademia would have given some measure of ec onomic stability to the family. 

88     The Defendant c laimed that she paid for the Plaintiff’s tuition fees at Oxford, [note: 57] whic h 

the Plaintiff strongly denied. [note: 58] The Defendant submitted that from the years 1977 to 1987, she earned substantially more than the Plaintiff and all her earnings went towards the family expenses, paying off government/bank loans and supporting the Plaintiff in obtaining his degree. In c ontrast, the Plaintiff c laimed that he was granted fully paid study leave and paid for his tuition and living expenses with monies from his pay and his sc holarship allowanc e. He relied on his inc ome tax 

statements from 1987 to 1988 to show that he was rec eiving an inc ome during that period. [note: 59] In this respec t, I am inc lined to agree with the Plaintiff that he provided substantial funding for his studies. However, it is undeniable that the Defendant made indirec t and non-financ ial c ontributions to the family while the Plaintiff was studying, by supporting the Plaintiff and taking c are of the older son. 

89     Between 1982 and 1984, the Plaintiff read law and c onc urrently pursued an engineering doc torate. The Plaintiff admitted that during those years, the family’s financ es were tight. His evidenc e ac knowledges that the Defendant’s salary was used largely to support herself and the elder c hild and to pay for the instalments on a house in Malaysia. His salary was used to support himself as well as pay for the instalments on a house he had purc hased. A third property in Malaysia was financ ed by the rental inc ome they c ollec ted. It is not disputed that the Plaintiff’s earnings in the period 1978 to 1987 c ompared to the Defendant’s earnings were about 40:60 in the Defendant’s 

favour. [note: 60] Thereafter, the Plaintiff worked in Singapore as a lawyer. 

90     Indeed, the family’s fortune c hanged and improved tremendously in Singapore with the Plaintiff’s very substantial earning power whic h, over a lengthy marriage, generated a sizeable number of properties and a high standard of living for the family inc luding overseas educ ation for the c hildren. Thus, the Plaintiff’s _opportunity_ to be a high-inc ome earner was the result of the parties’ earlier joint 


efforts. 

91     Ms Ragupathy submitted that the Plaintiff was “made” by the Defendant. To c laim that the Defendant “made” the Plaintiff who he is today is to downplay the Plaintiff’s own ability and drive. That said, a signific ant feature in this c ase was the Defendant’s c ontributions to the marriage by providing the nec essary environment for the Plaintiff to suc c essfully pursue a law degree and an engineering doc torate degree c onc urrently. It was a signific ant c ontribution to the marriage, for without his law degree, the Plaintiff would not have been able to c onfidently embark upon and suc c essfully ac hieve a c areer switc h that turned out to be one of the best dec isions they made as a c ouple. In my view, the Defendant’s c ontributions to the marriage in the early years were essential to the Plaintiff attaining his law degree. However, there c omes a point in time when the Plaintiff’s own ability to exc el in his c areer allowed him to reap the benefits of a suc c essful professional c areer and this c ontinued after the separation and divorc e. 

92     As for their two c hildren, there is c onflic ting evidenc e on both sides on their c are and welfare. The Defendant maintained that she played a substantial role in the two c hildren’s lives ferrying them to and from sc hool and their extra c lasses, helping them with their homework, in addition to managing the household when the c hildren were young. The Plaintiff disagreed, arguing that the Defendant c ontinued to pursue her interests of reading extensively and attending c lasses for Chinese guzheng and embroidery art stitc hing. It was he who spent most of his free time with the c hildren in their early c hildhood. Needless to say, both parents were working professionals and had to c ope with the demands of balanc ing work and family. In my view, both c ontributed what they c ould in terms of time and effort within the spheres of their own work and non-work related ac tivities to the welfare of the c hildren. 

93     During better times, both parties were good for eac h other as husband and wife. This was ac knowledged by the Plaintiff in the e-mail dated 6 Marc h 2003 (mentioned above at [34]) whic h bears repeating here: 

 ... On my part, I ac knowledge the c ontribution you have made to my life and the enric hment that I have had bec ause of you. ... 

and in an earlier e-mail to the Defendant on 8 February 2003, [note: 61] where he wrote: 

 ... [I] should be able to get over you over a period of time – 1 year, 2 years, who knows? [D]epends on whether [I] will find myself a good c ompanion. [T]hat would be diffic ult. [Y]ou are a hard act to follow. [emphasis added] 

**_Recent awards_** 

94     Turning now to some relevant awards by the c ourt, I observed that in the c ontext of a working mother for a moderate to long marriage, the wife was generally awarded between 35% and 40% of the pool of assets. In _Liew Chui Fong v Yew Kok Chin_ <span class="citation">[2007] SGHC 225</span>, the marriage lasted 28 years and the parties had two c hildren. The wife who had worked throughout the marriage rec eived 40% of the property. In _Pang Rosaline v Chan Kong Chin_ <span class="citation">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 935</span>, the parties were both working and had c hildren. The wife was awarded 40% of the assets after 32 years of marriage. In _AYQ v AQR_ <span class="citation">[2013] 1 SLR 476</span>, the family had two c hildren and both spouses were working. The wife was awarded almost 41% of the assets after 23 years of marriage. In _BHN v BHO_ <span class="citation">[2013] SGHC 91</span>, where both spouses were gainfully employed and were married for more than 20 years with two c hildren, the wife rec eived 40% of the matrimonial assets. 


95     As for the following c ases, the wife rec eived 35% of the assets. In _Leong Choon Kum v Chia Kin Tuck_ <span class="citation">[2005] SGHC 73</span>, the working mother of two attained about 35% of the assets after 22 years of marriage. In _ZD v ZE and Another_ <span class="citation">[2008] SGHC 225</span>, the wife was awarded 35% of the matrimonial assets. She had been married nearly 17 years and had three c hildren. She had worked at the husband’s c ompany and had also looked also after the c hildren who were all diagnosed with Attention Defic it Hyperac tive Disorder. In _AOH v AOI_ <span class="citation">[2011] SGHC 14</span>, the c ourt ordered the husband to pay 35% of the assets to the wife who was working full-time. The c ouple had been married for 12 years and had one c hild. 

96     I observed that in most of the c ases identified in the sample above, where the wife rec eived 35% of the matrimonial assets, the marriage was generally less than 20 years. On the other hand, for marriages more than 20 years, the wife was awarded 40%. However, I note that in exc eptional c ases where the value of the assets is very large, then even for long marriages, the perc entage awarded to the wife c ould be less than 35%. This was the c ase in _Yeo Chong Lin_ where the c ourt upheld the trial judge’s order of 35:65 even though the marriage lasted for 49 years, and the wife had been a housewife. 

**_Just and equitable division_** 

97     There are features in this c ase whic h warrant a departure from the 34% division under the Deed to the Defendant, but this does not mean that the Defendant is entitled to 60% of the matrimonial assets as she c ontended or that the Deed will be given little or no weight. In this partic ular c ase, a just and equitable division would require a reapportionment of the perc entage division under the Deed based on an asset pool of S$8,307,351. In addition, the Plaintiff’s retirement benefits whic h were not 

c overed by CSK’s report [note: 62] and not explic itly stated in the Deed will be dealt with separately from the Deed. 

98     After c onsidering all the fac ts and c irc umstanc es of this c ase, inc luding the Deed as a fac tor under s 112(2)( _e_ ) of the Charter, I find that a just and equitable division would be a 40% share to the Defendant. This leads me to the next issue whic h is the pool of assets and the valuation dates. 

_Applicable dates to the pool of assets and valuation_ 

99     The debate between the parties was as follows. Mr Khoo argued that the matrimonial assets should be determined and valued as of the date of the Deed, while Ms Ragupathy argued that what c onstituted a matrimonial asset should be determined as of the date of the Deed, but they should be valued as of the first anc illary hearing on 2 Oc tober 2012. 

100    The Court of Appeal in _Yeo Chong Lin_ rec ognised that there was no definitive operative date for dec iding what fell in the c ategory of matrimonial assets, and that depending on the nature of the assets and the c irc umstanc es surrounding their ac quisition, multiple dates were distinc tly possible (at [36]). The c ourt noted that broadly, there were four timelines that a c ourt c ould adopt: 

 [39] ... The first is the date of separation. The sec ond is the date on whic h the petition of divorc e is filed. The third is the date on whic h a dec ree nisi is granted. The fourth is the date of hearing of anc illary matters (inc luding the date of the hearing of an appeal). ... 

101    On the fac ts, I found that the date on whic h the Deed was signed was the date at whic h parties had formally rec orded the parties’ dec ision to go their own separate ways. The Deed itself was set out in a manner to bring an end to the relationship and was indeed the date of separation. In the Deed, it was c learly stated in the rec itals that parties had agreed to live apart from eac h other from 


12     Marc h 2003 and that parties were now seeking “financ ial independenc e of eac h other”. Furthermore, the Deed stated that the Deed was a formalisation of the division of assets. At c lauses 2.6 to 2.10 of the Deed, the parties had agreed to stop using overdraft fac ilities, wind down joint ac c ounts in Malaysia, Singapore and anywhere else, and c anc el eac h other’s supplementary c redit c ards. I found this to be a c lear sign that the parties no longer wanted to be financ ially liable to eac h other and for eac h other’s debts. I thus used Marc h 2003 as the operative date for identifying all matrimonial assets in the pool. 

102    As for the value of the pool, _Yeo Chong Lin_ had stated at [39] that the value “must be assessed” as at the date of the hearing. In this c ase, this meant a valuation of assets as of 2012. However, it must be kept in mind that _Yeo Chong Lin_ was not a c ase where a s 112(2)( _e_ ) agreement was in issue. 

103    One interpretation of the reasoning in _Yeo Chong Lin_ c ould be that the assets should be divided at the latest time possible so that both parties share the benefit or burden of the inc rease or dec rease in the value of the asset. On the other hand, some c ases seem to support the position that there is judic ial disc retion to c hoose another date whic h might be more just. In a dec ision after _Yeo Chong Lin, Anthony Patrick Nathan v Chan Siew Chin_ <span class="citation">[2011] 4 SLR 1121</span> (“ _Anthony Patrick Nathan_ ”), Quentin Loh J preferred a more flexible rule to the date of valuation and c onc luded at [29]: 

 Ultimately, the date on whic h matrimonial assets should be valued is up to the c ourt's disc retion, just as it is when it c omes to the operative date on whic h the pool of matrimonial assets should be determined. What is c ritic al is to arrive at a "just and equitable division" ... in all the c irc umstanc es in eac h partic ular c ase. 

However, _Anthony Patrick Nathan_ did not disc uss the ruling in [39] of _Yeo Chong Lin_. 

104    The same approac h was observed by Loh J in the later c ase of _Yong Shao Keat v Foo Jock Khim_ <span class="citation">[2012] SGHC 107</span> at [10], and Steven Chong J in _Chan Yuen Boey v Sia Hee Soon_ <span class="citation">[2012] 3 SLR 402</span> followed _Anthony Patrick Nathan_. These two c ases also did not disc uss the ruling in [39] of _Yeo Chong Lin_. 

105    In an appropriate c ase, as Loh J rightly observed, an alternative valuation date c an apply, as illustrated in the c ase of _Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee and another appeal and another matter_ <span class="citation">[2012] 4 SLR 405</span> (“ _Wan Lai Cheng_ ”), where the Court of Appeal unanimously dec ided that several of the properties were to be valued as at the date a few days after the wife filed for divorc e (this was done for the c onvenienc e of both parties) _ie_ , 31 July 2007, rather than at the date of the judgment _ie_ , 14 January 2011. In _Wan Lai Cheng_ , the Court of Appeal found that after 31 July 2007, the husband had enhanc ed the liabilities over the properties for his own benefit, and not for the benefit of both spouses. It was therefore just and equitable for the c ourt to dec ide that a later date should not be c hosen, but rather an earlier date whic h was c loser to the c ommenc ement of the divorc e proc eedings. 

106    Therefore, although the general starting point would be that as iterated in _Yeo Chong Lin_ , the c ase law seems to indic ate that the c ourt will have disc retion to c hoose a more appropriate date of valuation. 

107    In this c ase, I find that the appropriate date to value the pool would be Marc h 2003. On its fac e, the Deed was c learly meant to sever all relationships between the parties. The three years in between would be for parties to sort out their various obligations under the Deed and eventually allow for either party to file for a divorc e. Clause 1.6.2 makes it even c learer that the division was to be as 


at the date of the Deed: 

 In the event that a petition is filed for a dec ree of divorc e based on the ground that the marriage has broken down irretrievably..., the party against whom the petition for a dec ree is filed, hereby irrevoc ably agrees to give her or his c onsent: (a) in writing ... and (b) to the consent order of court embodying such terms as the [Plaintiff] and the [Defendant] may agree based upon the general division of assets set out in this Deed. [emphasis added] 

What the c lause suggests is that parties c ontemplated that they would still be bound by the Deed in an applic ation for divorc e filed three years later. The inferenc e to be drawn was that the assets were to be valued as of 2003, at the point of the division, and that there would be, in effec t, no reopening of the distribution of assets. 

108    The inferenc e above is reinforc ed by the reasons stated above at [101]. I agree with Mr Khoo that the marriage had long sinc e ended and the separation was c ertainly final in light of the Plaintiff’s serious relationship with his c urrent wife bac k then. 

109    Mr Khoo even tabulated a c hronology of proc eedings to show the development of the long

drawn dispute between the parties. [note: 63] Mr Khoo’s related argument was that the Defendant had prolonged the proc eedings so as to take advantage of the rising property market to enhanc e the size of her share. Ac c ording to the valuations submitted by Ms Ragupathy, as of 26 November 2012, the 

values of the Properties had inc reased to S$14,544,193. [note: 64] I ac c ept that the anc illary proc eedings were indeed prolonged, however, it was not nec essary for me to dec ide on whether the time lapse between the separation and the first anc illary hearing was unwarranted. As stated earlier, I did not ac c ept Ms Ragupathy’s c alc ulation of the Defendant’s c laim based on the 2012 valuations. 

110    By way of observation, an appropriate c ase where the date of a s 112(2)( _e_ ) agreement c ould be departed from, is where there is evidenc e of bad faith demonstrating one party’s deliberate attempt to prolong the period before the anc illary hearing to the disadvantage of the other in the knowledge of the value of the pool inc reasing over time for reasons suc h as an _en bloc_ sale. This will result in a division at the later date looking more unjust as it will be tilted in favour of the party guilty of bad faith. 

_The assessment_ 

111    In light of the matters aforesaid, I find that the pool of assets and the valuation would be as of Marc h 2003. Further, as stated in my finding earlier at [98], a just and equitable division is to award a 40% share to the Defendant. 

112    To rec apitulate, stric tly under the Deed (see [60]–[61]), the Defendant would be rec eiving S$2,799,737 out of the total assets of S$8,307,351. The division to her was as follows: 

 (a) S$1,060,197 of the Unc ontested Assets; 

 (b) S$427,586 for Aspen Heights and W Vista Kiara; 

 (c ) S$174,120 from the Fixed Deposit; 

 (d) S$437,834 from Leonie Hill; and 

 (e) S$700,000 per c lause 3 of the Deed (of whic h the Plaintiff has already paid S$100,000). 


113    With the reapportionment of the perc entages to 40%, the Defendant would be rec eiving 6% more of the total assets c omprised under the Deed, or, S$498,441, and I so award her this additional amount in c ash c ontributions from the Plaintiff. 

114    In relation to the Plaintiff’s retirement benefits, I find that the Defendant would have been entitled to a share of the Plaintiff’s retirement benefits up to Marc h 2003. 

115    As for the dispute on the quantum, the Defendant c laimed that she was entitled to part of a 

sum of US$951,056. [note: 65] This was based on an amalgamation of numbers found in Mr Spenc er’s various affidavits. As of 2008, the Plaintiff would be able to withdraw US$348,724 from his c apital 

ac c ount, and attain US$134,124.67 that was withheld for c ontingent tax liabilities. [note: 66] Additionally, should the Plaintiff retire at age 65, he would be entitled to a lump sum payment of US$271,208, a seniority-based annual entitlement of $77,000. As for his c lient origination-based 

entitlement, LPK estimated this based on 2008 figures and arrived at US$120,000. [note: 67] It was quic kly apparent that the numbers were c ontingent on time as well as the Plaintiff’s date of retirement. 

116    Based on the best information available before me, I used the 2007 values found in Mr Spenc er’s affidavits. Therefore, as of 2007, the Plaintiff would have been able to withdraw US$323,724 from his c apital ac c ount and attain US$60,064.15 for c ontingent tax liabilities. Should the Plaintiff have retired in 2008 (after one year’s notic e from 2007) he would be entitled to US$31,469 as a lump sum payment and US$60,800 as a seniority-based portion of his annual entitlement. His c lient origination portion would be about US$100,000, being the average of what Mr Spenc er had stated. [note: 68] Therefore, the total amount would be US$576,057. 

117    Ac c ordingly, I order that the Plaintiff to pay the Defendant 40% of US$576,057, being US$230,422.80 in c ash c ontributions. 

_Adjustments between the parties within the Deed_ 

118    Ac c ording to c lause 2.2, read with c lause 2.3.1(a) of the Deed, the Defendant was to pay for half of the mortgage on the Aspen Height property, however she did not do so. As mentioned above at [71], the Plaintiff had used part of the matrimonial assets (from the Revised Contested Ac c ounts _ie_ , Annex 3) to pay off the mortgage payments for the Aspen Heights property from Marc h 2003 to September 2006 whic h totalled S$354,542.88. Subsequently, the rest of the mortgage payments were paid for by the Plaintiff out of his own poc ket. I was also informed by Mr Khoo that by Marc h 2013, 

the mortgage had been fully redeemed by the Plaintiff. [note: 69] Ac c ording to Mr Khoo’s letter to the c ourt dated 14 May 2013, the Plaintiff had paid a total of S$1,024,260.26 inc luding interest from Marc h 2003 onwards. It would be double-c ounting not to deduc t the payments made from the Revised Contested Ac c ounts. Therefore, the Plaintiff had essentially paid S$669,717.38 for both his and the Defendant’s share of the loan. As suc h, the Plaintiff is entitled to be paid bac k S$334,858.69 by the Defendant under c lauses 2.2 and 2.3.1(a) of the Deed. 

119    At the same time, the Plaintiff was required to pay a total of S$700,000 to the Defendant by 2008 under c lause 3 of the Deed, but did not c arry this part out entirely. Ac c ording to Ms Ragupathy’s letter to the c ourt dated 17 May 2013, the Plaintiff withheld the payments under c lause 3 of the Deed as the Defendant had refused to transfer the benefic ial interests in some of the properties to him and he had deemed the withholding of the sums as a means to pay off the Defendant’s share in the property loans. Thus far, the Defendant has rec eived S$100,000. Henc e, the Plaintiff is required to pay the Defendant the remaining S$600,000. I also note that the Plaintiff has 


not refunded the Defendant’s princ ipal ASPF c ontributions to the Leonie Hill property. 

120    In the final adjustment between the parties, they would have to ac c ount for the sums stated above to eac h other. Therefore, in setting off the amounts owed between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, I find that the Plaintiff is to pay the Defendant the net sum of S$265,141.31 under c lause 3 of the Deed. In arriving at this net figure, I have already taken into ac c ount the S$100,000 that the Plaintiff has paid. Additionally, I find that the Plaintiff is to pay the Defendant for her princ ipal ASPF c ontributions to the Leonie Hill property. 

**Maintenance** 

121    The Defendant argued that if she c ould not attain 60% of the immoveable properties, she wanted maintenanc e at $2,500 a month. In the light of my award of 40% to the Defendant, I have to c onsider what an appropriate amount of maintenanc e would be. Sec tion 114(1) of the Charter states that: 

 (1) In determining the amount of any maintenanc e to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, the c ourt shall have regard to all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase inc luding the following matters: 

 ( a ) the inc ome, earning c apac ity, property and other financ ial resourc es whic h eac h of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future; 

 ( b ) the financ ial needs, obligations and responsibilities whic h eac h of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future; 

 ( c ) the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage; 

 ( d ) the age of eac h party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage; 

 ( e ) any physic al or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage; 

 ( f ) the c ontributions made by eac h of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, inc luding any c ontribution made by looking after the home or c aring for the family; and 

 ( g ) in the c ase of proc eedings for divorc e or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) whic h, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the c hanc e of ac quiring. 

122    The Plaintiff rejec ted the Defendant’s c laim for maintenanc e as fanc iful and the quantum as exc essive. He submitted that the Defendant is financ ially independent and does not need maintenanc e. To reinforc e his c ontention, he pointed out that after the parties separated, the Defendant did not seek maintenanc e from the Plaintiff, and did not apply for interim maintenanc e. The arguments are legally unsound for as a matter of princ iple, the Defendant is entitled to seek maintenanc e under the Charter. 

123    The princ iples governing the c ourt’s power to order maintenanc e for a former wife were c omprehensively c anvassed by the Court of Appeal in _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_ <span class="citation">[2012] 2 SLR 506</span> at [12]–[19] (“ _Foo Ah Yan_ ”). The overarc hing princ iple is that of financ ial preservation, whic h requires the wife to be maintained at a standard, whic h is, to a reasonable extent, c ommensurate

with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage ( _Foo Ah Yan_ at [13]). The c ourt applies s 114(2) in a c ommonsense holistic manner that takes into ac c ount the new realities that flow from the breakdown of a marriage and responds to the requirements of justic e in eac h c ase ( _Foo Ah Yan_ at [15]–[16]). Henc e it has been observed that the aim in ordering maintenanc e of a wife is to even out any financ ial inequalities between spouses, taking into ac c ount any ec onomic prejudic e suffered by the wife during the marriage. The c ourts have also held that a former wife must, where possible, exert reasonable efforts to sec ure gainful employment and c ontribute to preserve her prebreakdown lifestyle and that although the husband is _prima facie_ obliged to maintain his former wife beyond his retirement and up to the former wife’s remarriage or the death of either party, the former wife who has assets of her own should not expec t a full subsidy for her lifestyle. The Court of Appeal i n _Foo Ah Yan_ also made it c lear at [20]–[22] that the non-provision of maintenanc e to the wife during marriage does not prec lude the c ourt from ordering maintenanc e for the wife after divorc e. 

124    Ultimately, it is the reasonableness of the maintenanc e c laim c ompared to the husband’s ability to pay whic h guides the c ourt’s applic ation of the princ iple of financ ial preservation ( _Foo Ah Yan_ at [19]). 

125    The c ourt’s power to order maintenanc e is supplementary to its power to order a division of the matrimonial assets, suc h that the c ourts regularly take into ac c ount eac h party’s share of the matrimonial assets when assessing the appropriate quantum of maintenanc e ( _Foo Ah Yan_ at [26]. 

126    The Defendant had earlier stated that her living expenses were about S$23,438 a month, while 

her monthly take home pay was S$14,865. [note: 70] There was no explanation on how the Defendant made up for the shortfall sinc e 2003, and I agree with Mr Khoo that there was also no evidenc e to support her expenses. I also agree that the Defendant had grossly overstated her initial c laim of S$23,438 a month seeing that Ms Ragupathy eventually proposed a signific antly reduc ed monthly figure of S$2,500 at the adjourned hearing. 

127    The Defendant is now 62 years of age and will be looking to retiring in the near future and with that, her earnings from ac ademia will stop, leaving her only with potentially passive inc ome from the properties. Bearing in mind the relevant princ iples c ited above, I am of the view that the Defendant should be given a monthly sum of S$1,650. 

128    As the divorc e was ac rimonious, I am of the view that a lump sum maintenanc e would be appropriate in the c irc umstanc es. Ac c ordingly, I order that the Plaintiff is to pay the Defendant a lump sum maintenanc e of S$200,000 to the Defendant, being the rounded up monthly sum of S$1,650 multiplied by the multiplic and of 10, representing 10 years of maintenanc e. 

**Orders to be made** 

129    The parties are to c arry out the terms of the Deed in the light of the orders made here at [113], [117], [119], [120] and [128]. To this end, parties are direc ted to work out the prec ise orders they require from this c ourt, taking into ac c ount the set-offs at [120]. Arithmetic al c orrec tions, if any, should be dealt with in the prec ise orders to be made. Parties are to write in to the Registry as soon as they are ready with a draft order. At the same time, I will hear parties on c osts.
