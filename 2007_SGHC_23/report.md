**V K Rajah J:** 

1       Credit c ards are now widely ac c epted as a preferred mode of payment for daily transac tions. Unfortunately, the plethora of c redit c ard transac tions has in turn engendered a multiplic ity of c redit c ard offenc es. The financ ial burden perpetrated by suc h c redit c ard frauds falls on the shoulders of the issuers, the banking industry and c redit c ard holders. Indeed, the very substantial interest that c redit c ard issuers and banks c harge for instalment payments and defaults c an also be direc tly attributed to the substantial losses these institutions c ontinue to c halk up from c ard frauds and sc ams. It would be no exaggeration to assert that the entire c redit c ard holding c ommunity bears the palpable and painful brunt of suc h offenc es. In addition, the inc onvenienc e, frustration, distress and perhaps even loss of reputation suffered by vic tims of fraud are often inc alc ulable and irremediable. 

2       It is therefore important to have a c oherent and c onsistent sentenc ing regime to deter the c ommission of suc h offenc es in Singapore. The relevant sentenc ing c onsiderations, princ iples and appropriate sentenc ing tariffs for offenc es c onc erning the fraudulent use of c redit c ards are assessed and expounded upon in these grounds of dec ision. 

3       The respondent pleaded guilty to two c harges: (a) c riminal misappropriation of a c redit c ard under s 403 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”), read with s 3(1) of the Tokyo Convention Ac t (Cap 327, 1985 Rev Ed); and (b) c heating and dishonestly induc ing a delivery of property by the fraudulent use of a c redit c ard, c ontrary to s 420 of the Penal Code. In addition, two 


other similar c heating c harges under s 420 of the Penal Code, as well as one other attempted c heating c harge under s 420 read with s 511 of the Penal Code, were taken into c onsideration for the purpose of sentenc ing. The learned distric t judge (“trial judge”) sentenc ed the respondent to two months’ imprisonment for the c heating c harge, and a c onsec utive sentenc e of two weeks’ imprisonment for the c riminal misappropriation c harge: see _PP v Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar Fernando_ <span class="citation">[2006] SGDC 304</span> (“GD”). Dissatisfied with the sentenc es, the Prosec ution appealed. On hearing the appeal, I enhanc ed the sentenc es for the c heating c harge to six months’ imprisonment, and for the c riminal misappropriation c harge to two months. Both sentenc es are to run c onc urrently. 

**The facts** 

4       The respondent is a 20-year-old male Sri Lankan national c urrently residing and working in New Zealand. On 17 November 2006, the respondent boarded an SIA flight from New Zealand to Singapore where he was to take a further c onnec ting flight to Colombo. During the flight, the respondent found in the proximity of his seat a c redit c ard belonging to Ms Sanderson Weijde Kirsten Anna Maria (“Ms Sanderson”), a fellow passenger sitting next to him. The respondent dec ided to retain the c redit c ard for his own use. Ms Sanderson only disc overed that her c redit c ard was missing when she was in transit at Singapore Changi International Airport (“Changi Airport”). She immediately reported the loss to her bank. 

5       Upon arrival at Changi Airport Terminal 2, the respondent promptly and in great haste used the c redit c ard to purc hase the following items: 

 (a) A lap-top valued at $1,522 (this was the subjec t matter of the s 420 of the Penal Code c harge to whic h the respondent pleaded guilty); 

 (b) A watc h valued at $469.81; and 

 (c ) A hand phone valued at $1,288. 

6       When the respondent attempted to purc hase a fourth item – a brac elet valued at $2,728.01 – he was informed by the c ashier that the c redit c ard fac ility had been bloc ked. The respondent then immediately left the shop and quic kly made his way to the departure gate. There, he was identified and arrested. The items that he had fraudulently purc hased were seized. 

**Decision of the trial judge** 

**_Aggravating factors_** 

7       The trial judge noted that the respondent’s misappropriation of the c redit c ard would have c aused tremendous anxiety and inc onvenienc e to Ms Sanderson, a foreign traveller. He further observed that the c redit c ard was used to make several purc hases and that the total value of these purc hases was fairly signific ant (GD at [14]-[16]). 

**_Mitigating factors_** 

8       The respondent had c ooperated with the investigations, and had promptly pleaded guilty, instead of c hanc ing on the Prosec ution’s ability to sec ure Ms Sanderson’s attendanc e in Singapore as a witness against him. The trial judge relied on this in c onc luding that the respondent was genuinely remorseful: see GD at [19]. 


9       Further, the trial judge took into ac c ount the fac t that the respondent was both young and a first offender. He surmised that offenc es were out of c harac ter and possibly a c onsequenc e of the respondent’s ‘youthful folly’ c ulminating in an error of judgment (GD at [20] and [21]). 

10     The trial judge also c onsidered it pertinent that all the fraudulent purc hases were made by the respondent within less than an hour and that all the items were in any event rec overed. In the learned judge’s view the respondent did not derive any benefit from his offenc es and no loss was oc c asioned to anyone: see GD at [23]. 

**_Other considerations_** 

11     The trial judge distinguished the present c ase from the following types of c ases, in whic h heavy jail sentenc es are imposed as a matter of c ourse (GD at [22]): 

 (a) where a foreigner has c ome to Singapore for the sole purpose of c ommitting offenc e; 

 (b) where the offender has planned to steal c redit c ards for fraudulent use, or has made use of forged c redit c ards; 

 (c ) where the offender is part of a sophisticated c redit c ard syndicate ; or 

 (d) where the offender has c ommitted c redit c ard fraud on a large scale. 

12     Lastly, the trial judge emphasised that while the princ iple of general deterrenc e admittedly featured signific antly in offenc es suc h as that c ommitted by the respondent, the notion of deterrenc e should nonetheless be tempered by the notion of proportionality. In other words, sentenc es imposed should reflec t the severity of the offenc e c ommitted as well as the moral and legal c ulpability of the offender: see GD at [24] to [26]. 

**The appeal against sentence** 

13     On appeal, the Deputy Public Prosec utor (“DPP”) submitted that the trial judge erred both in law and in fac t by _inter alia_ : 

 (a) Failing to ac c ord suffic ient weight to the nature of the offenc es c ommitted, whic h involved c redit c ard fraud, and thereby failing to impose a sentenc e that would deter similar opportunistic c onduc t in like-minded offenders; 

 (b) Failing to ac c ord suffic ient weight to the manner in whic h the offenc es were c ommitted, and to the fac t that there were three other c harges to be taken into c onsideration for the purpose of sentenc ing; and 

 (c ) Attac hing undue weight and signific anc e to both the respondent’s plea of guilt and his c ooperation with the investigations, the respondent’s age, the fac t that the respondent was a first offender and evidenc e of the respondent’s good c harac ter. 

**Preliminary observations** 

14     First, it should be noted that this appeal was heard on 12 January 2007, _after_ the respondent had been released from prison on 8 January 2007, having c ompleted the sentenc e imposed by the trial judge. The enhanc ed sentenc es on appeal have resulted in the respondent having to return to prison 


after his release. This was by no ac c ount due to want of diligenc e on the part of the Prosec ution in prosec uting the appeal. Having said that, it is highly desirable that the relevant Court Registries and c ounsel involved in c riminal c ases pertaining to foreigners sentenc ed to short terms of imprisonment use their best endeavours to ensure that the appeals are expedited: see also the observations of Yong Pung How CJ in _PP v Siew Boon Ling_ <span class="citation">[2005] SGHC 20</span> at [29]. Indeed the written appeal submissions and possibly the trial judge’s detailed grounds of dec ision may be dispensed with or alternatively replac ed by short skeletal submissions/grounds of dec ision. In c ases suc h as this, time is of the essenc e in ensuring that legitimate expec tations about the administration of justic e are not unnec essarily undermined. Where the liberty of an individual is at stake, c ertainty should always replac e unc ertainty as a matter of urgenc y and priority. I single out foreigners bec ause they may be hard put to raise adequate sec urity for bail in this regard. Similar c onsiderations should also apply to impec unious Singaporeans and permanent residents. 

15     Given the c irc umstanc es, I direc ted that the sentenc es be bac kdated to the date of c ommenc ement of the sentenc e imposed by the trial judge, and that the period when the ac c used was released (ie., 8 January 2007 to 12 January 2007) not be added to the sentenc e. 

**_Probation order unsuitable_** 

16     Sec ondly, the respondent is 20 years old. In _PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice_ <span class="citation">[1999] 1 SLR 138</span>, Yong Pung How CJ stated that rehabilitation is the dominant c onsideration where the offender is 21 years and below (at [21] and [25]). However, the authorities suggest that probation is unsuitable for an offender who is a foreign national not resident in Singapore: _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ (2nd Ed, 2003) (“ _Sentencing_ ”) at page 39. This proposition was explained in _Tan Choon Huat v PP_ [1991] SLR 805 by Rubin JC at 811 in the following terms: 

 ... having regard to the nature of the offenc e, the c irc umstanc es of the c ase and the fac t that the appellant is a foreign national not resident in Singapore, a probation order appears to be wholly inappropriate .” 

 [emphasis added] 

17     The logistic al and administrative diffic ulties involved in the monitoring and supervision of a nonresident render a probation order both inappropriate and imprac tic able in the c ase of an offender. A key feature of probation is rigorous supervision against the bac kdrop of a nurturing environment. I am however loathe to _completely_ rule out the possibility of probation as a sentenc ing option in the c ase of _all_ foreigners. For instanc e, a foreign offender with some loc al roots in the form of relatives who are loc ally resident may in appropriate c irc umstanc es c onstitute a suitable c andidate for a probation order. In this c ase, quite c orrec tly, there was no attempt by c ounsel for the respondent to suggest that a probation order would be suitable. The respondent has no roots to anc hor him here. 

**General sentencing principles for credit card offences under s 420 of the Penal Code** 

18     Sec tion 420 of the Penal Code (“s 420”) is a provision that embrac es a wide spec trum of c heating offenc es. It states: 

 Whoever c heats and thereby dishonestly induc es the person dec eived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable sec urity, or anything whic h is signed or sealed, and whic h is c apable of being c onverted into a valuable sec urity, shall be punished with imprisonment of a term whic h may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine. 


19     Simple c heating is punishable under s 417 of the Penal Code for a term that may extend to one year or with a fine or with both. An offenc e c ontrary to s 420, whic h presc ribes a maximum term of imprisonment of seven years and liability to a fine, is sometimes desc ribed as aggravated c heating, an offenc e of far greater c ulpability. The fraudulent use of c redit c ards has ac c ounted for some of the harsher sentenc ing prec edents in the c ontext of s 420 offenc es. In fac t, c redit c ard fraud is often regarded as a fac tor enhanc ing the gravity of a c heating offenc e: see _Sentencing_ at pages 451-452. In _PP v Mihaly Magashazie_ <span class="citation">[2005] SGDC 35</span> (“ _Mihaly Magashazie_ ”) at [19], the Distric t Court observed that suc h offenc es have always been viewed with severity bec ause they involve dec eption of financ ial institutions and business establishments, and while they are easy to c ommit, they are diffic ult to detec t. In a similar vein, Tay Yong Kwang J in _Lim Pei Ni Charissa v PP_ <span class="citation">[2006] SGHC 128</span> (“ _Lim Pei Ni Charissa_ ”) rec ognised that the c ourts must c ertainly treat c ases of c redit c ard fraud with disapprobation and c ensure; that it is very muc h in the public interest for the c ourts to take a harsh stand against c redit c ard fraud in order to deter both the ac c used person and like-minded potential offenders from c ommitting suc h c rimes in the future: at [20] and [30]. 

20     Singapore’s standing as an international financ ial, c ommerc e and transit hub is premised upon its ability to ensure that financ ial transac tions are easily c arried out and yet adequately safeguarded. The prevalenc e of c redit c ard offenc es will erode public c onfidenc e and c ould have a deleterious effec t on Singapore’s standing as a preferred destination for tourism, trade and investment. To c hec k the abuse of c redit c ards, a severe stanc e has to be c onsistently adopted and applied against all c redit c ard offenders, regardless of whether they are c itizens, residents or transient visitors. In the present c ase, the respondent was a transit passenger in a Singapore airport. I stress that deterrenc e should be of equal, if not greater, c onc ern in suc h c ases, as short term visitors to Singapore should not be permitted to take advantage of and abuse the hospitality ac c orded and c ommerc ial opportunities available to them. 

21     Credit c ard offenc es under s 420 c an c ommonly be divided into two main c ategories of c ases: c ounterfeit c ards (whic h also c onc urrently attrac ts the attention of s 474 of the Penal Code) and/or syndic ate c ases; and use of stolen/misappropriated c redit c ard c ases. Heavier sentenc es are appropriate for the former c ases as they involve dec eption that invariably assumes a degree of sophistic ation and planning. This is illustrated in the dec ision of _Ong Tiong Poh v PP_ <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 853</span> (“ _Ong Tiong Poh_ ”) at 862, where Yong CJ enhanc ed the sentenc e to take into ac c ount the fac t that the appellant appeared to be part of a sophistic ated syndic ate, c apable of c ommitting c ounterfeit c redit c ard fraud on a large sc ale and was skilled at avoiding detec tion. That the same sentenc ing fac tors do not invariably apply to stolen/misappropriated c redit c ard c ases was highlighted in _PP v Poh Leong Boon David Danille_ <span class="citation">[2006] SGDC 104</span> (“ _Poh Leong Boon_ ”). Thus, due to the aggravating fac tors present in the c ounterfeit c ards and/or syndic ate c ases, offenders in those c ases would generally be treated more severely than offenders in the stolen/misappropriated c redit c ard c ases. It should also be pointed out that the penal polic y embodied in s 474 of the Penal Code appears to presc ribe more severe sentenc ing for infrac tions involving c ounterfeiting. While suc h a broad princ iple seems to be relatively well established, an overview of the relevant c ase law pertaining to c redit c ard offenc es indic ates that the latter does not c onsistently embody c lear sentenc ing norms. Nor does it c oherently reflec t the relevant sentenc ing princ iples. 

**The relevant case law for credit card offences** 

**_Counterfeit cards and/or syndicate cases_** 

22     In _Ong Tiong Poh_ ([21 _supra_ ]), the prosec ution proc eeded on ten c harges against the appellant 

- two c harges of c heating and eight of abetment of c heating by the use of c ounterfeit c redit c ards. The prosec ution’s evidenc e was that the appellant helped to run a c ounterfeit c redit c ard syndic ate. 


The Distric t Court c onvic ted the appellant on all the c harges, and sentenc ed him to _eight months’_ imprisonment for eac h of his c heating c harges, and _14 months’_ imprisonment for eac h of his abetment c harges. Three of the sentenc es for the abetment c harges were ordered to run c onsec utively with eac h other and c onc urrently with the other seven sentenc es, making a total of 42 months’ imprisonment. The distric t judge detec ted no remorse in the appellant but noted that he was only 21 years old. He also took into c onsideration the sentenc es ranging between two to three years imposed on the appellant’s ac c omplic es. On appeal, Yong CJ was of the view that the sentenc es imposed on the ac c omplic es did not c onstitute _per se_ a valid reason for the relatively light sentenc e imposed on the appellant by the distric t judge. Yong CJ emphasised that the ac c omplic es had pleaded guilty, and that the appellant had played a more important role in the c redit c ard operation than his ac c omplic es. Thus the sentenc es imposed by the distric t judge did not properly reflec t the seriousness of the appellant’s offenc es and were to that extent manifestly inadequate. The appellant’s sentenc es for the two c heating c harges were therefore _enhanced_ to _12 months’ imprisonment_ for eac h c harge, and the sentenc es for the eight abetment c harges were enhanc ed to _20 months’ imprisonment_ for eac h c harge. The total c umulative sentenc e was 60 months’ imprisonment. 

23     The appellant in _Than Stenly Granida Purwanto v PP_ <span class="citation">[2003] 3 SLR 576</span> (“ _Purwanto_ ”) pleaded guilty to a c harge of c onspirac y to possess forged c redit c ards with intent to use them as genuine, and five c harges of c onspiring to c heat using c ounterfeit c redit c ards, with another 16 similar c harges taken into c onsideration. He was sentenc ed to a _total of six and a half years’_ imprisonment by the trial judge, and this sentenc e was _upheld_ by the High Court on appeal. In view of the potential injury that suc h offenc es may c ause to Singapore’s c redibility as a reputable financ ial c entre, Yong CJ opined that the distric t judge had properly exerc ised his disc retion in imposing a deterrent sentenc e. The aggravating fac tors in this c ase inc luded the involvement of an international c riminal syndic ate; the appellant’s ac tive role in the c ommission of the offenc e, even if he was not ac tually the mastermind; and the substantial loss that the offenc es entailed ($14,630.46 inc luding the c harges taken into c onsideration). Further, the appellant’s plea of guilt had little weight bec ause the appellant was literally c aught red-handed with the forged c redit c ards upon his arrest in the very midst of attempting another fraudulent c ard transac tion. The fac t that the appellant had not obtained any benefit from the c ommission of yet another offenc e as a result of his arrest did not warrant a reduc tion in sentenc e. 

24     In another syndic ate c ase, _Navaseelan Balasingam v PP_ <span class="citation">[2006] SGHC 228</span> (“ _Navaseelan Balasingam_ ”), c ounterfeit ATM c ards were used to withdraw c ash from ATMs. On appeal, Tay Yong Kwang J _revised the total sentence of five and a half years’ imprisonment to seven and a half years_. The polic y c onsiderations for suc h c ases are by and large quite similar to offenc es involving the fraudulent use of c redit c ards, and the distric t judge in this c ase had c onsidered sentenc ing prec edents for the c losely related offenc e of c redit c ard frauds in arriving at the appropriate sentenc e. He noted that where a _first offender_ is involved in a large sc ale c redit c ard fraud involving a _genuine_ c redit c ard, the High Court had imposed or affirmed substantial c ustodial sentenc es of between 14 to 18 months. He relied on the dec isions in _Fadilah bte Omar v PP_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No 168 of 1996, unreported) (“ _Fadilah bte Omar_ ”) and _PP v Rohaazman bin Ali & 2 ors_ (Magistrate’s Appeal Nos 286-288 of 2001) (“ _Rohaazman bin Ali_ ”) to support his view. In the c ase of _counterfeit_ c redit c ard fraud, the distric t judge in _Navaseelan Balasingam_ had relied on _Ong Tiong Poh_ ([19] and [20] _supra_ ), _PP v Edward Lekwachi Cox_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No 464 of 1993, unreported) (“ _Edward Lekwachi Cox_ ”) and _Vasudevan A/L Thandavan v PP_ (“Magistrate’s Appeal No 77 of 1996, unreported) (“ _Vasudevan A/L Thandavan_ ”) in c onc luding that the High Court has imposed or affirmed sentenc es ranging from 20 to 30 months for _first offenders_. 

25     In _Edward Lekwachi Cox_ , the ac c used had pleaded guilty to three c harges of engaging with another to c onspire to c heat by dishonestly presenting c ounterfeit c redit c ards. The ac c used had no 


antec edents. He was sentenc ed on eac h c harge to _12 months’_ imprisonment, whic h was _enhanced to two years’_ imprisonment on eac h c harge on appeal. In _Vasudevan A/L Thandavan_ , the appellant had pleaded guilty to four c harges of c onspirac y to c heat using a c ounterfeit c redit c ard (s 420 read with s 109 of the Penal Code), with eighteen similar c harges taken into c onsideration. The total value of the purc hases amounted to $13,231.10 and the High Court imposed a sentenc e of _two years and six months_ on eac h of the c harges on appeal. The c umulative sentenc e was a term of imprisonment of 60 months. 

**_Use of stolen or misappropriated credit card cases_** 

2       6 _Rohaazman bin Ali_ ([24] _supra_ ) involved postal offic ers who had stolen 42 c redit c ards whic h they interc epted in the c ourse of c arrying out their mail sorting duties with Singapore Post. Purc hases amounting to $81,142.39 were made with the c redit c ards. The prosec ution proc eeded with seven c ounts of c heating and four c ounts of theft against two of the ac c used persons, Rohaazman and Jamaludin, with another 219 c harges taken into c onsideration. The trial judge found that Rohaazman was c learly the mastermind in the operation and c onsidered the massive number of c harges (230), the number of c redit c ards involved (42), and the length of the time the sc am went undetec ted ( months), c ritic al fac tors. The total value of the fraudulent transac tions was also taken into ac c ount. However, the trial judge was mindful of the fac t that the sc am was unsophistic ated and their modus operandi both simple and apparently c onsistent. He was therefore persuaded that it was inappropriate to equate Rohaazman’s and Jamaludin’s c ulpability with that demonstrated by offenders typic ally involved in syndic ated c ounterfeit c redit c ard operations. Rohaazman and Jamaludin were sentenc ed by the Distric t Court to _nine months’_ and _six months’_ imprisonment respec tively for eac h of the c harges. In the aggregate, Rohaazman was sentenc ed to a total of 24 months’ imprisonment, while Jamaludin was to serve a total of 18 months. The prosec ution’s appeal was allowed, and the terms of imprisonment for eac h c harge for Rohaazman and Jamaludin were _enhanced_ to _two years’_ imprisonment and _18 months’_ imprisonment respec tively, with Rohaazman rec eiving a total of five and a half years’ imprisonment and Jamaludin rec eiving five years’ imprisonment. 

27     In _Fadilah bte Omar_ ([24] _supra_ ), the 16-year-old ac c used pleaded guilty to, _inter alia_ , three c ounts of c heating under s 420. 11 other c harges were taken into c onsideration for the purposes of sentenc ing. The ac c used had c ommitted a relatively unsophistic ated offenc e by misappropriating and using a c redit c ard she found in a public toilet. She subsequently surrendered herself to the authorities and pleaded guilty to the c harges. The total value of all the c harges (inc luding those taken into c onsideration) was $1,325.62. The Distric t Court sentenc ed her to _12 months’ imprisonment_ for eac h of the c heating c harges, ordering that the sentenc es run c onc urrently. This sentenc e was _upheld_ on appeal. 

2       8 _One year’s imprisonment_ was imposed in respec t of eac h of the three s 420 c harges preferred a ga ins t _Mihaly Magashazie_ ([19] _supra_ ), with two of the sentenc es of imprisonment running c onsec utively. The appeal against sentenc e by the ac c used was dismissed. In that c ase, there was a plea of guilt, but the distric t judge had attac hed little weight to it as he c onsidered that the ac c used had no c hoic e but to plead guilty and c ooperate in the c irc umstanc es of arrest; the ac c used had been arrested outside a jewellery shop after making a fraudulent purc hase with one of the stolen c redit c ards. The fac t that the respondent did not derive any benefit and no loss was oc c asioned to anyone was dismissed as ‘purely fortuitous’, as the ac c used was arrested with the fruits of his c rime whic h were duly seized ( _Mihaly Magashazie_ at [13]). The fac t that the ac c used had broken into sec ured loc kers three times to steal the c redit c ards, and had adopted stealthy tac tic s to delay detec tion of his misdeeds weighed heavily on the distric t judge’s mind in this c ase. The distric t judge c ontrasted the fac ts with a c ase in whic h the ac c used was a ‘mere opportunist who – after c hanc ing upon unattended wallets left in public plac es – was momentarily tempted by greed to steal the c redit 


c ards and use [sic ] them’ ( _Mihaly Magashazie_ at [16]). He then went on to state that any ac t c ommitted after deliberation and with premeditation, as opposed to an ac t c ommitted on the spur of the moment and ‘in hot blood’ is an aggravating c irc umstanc e. Finally, the ac c used had used the stolen c redit c ards to make numerous fraudulent purc hases, altogether c ommitting nine c ounts of c heating and five c ounts of attempted c heating with the stolen c redit c ards; the total fraudulent purc hases amounted to a total of $23,105. The distric t judge felt that the large number of offenc es c ommitted had justified the imposition of longer c ustodial sentenc es. 

29     In _Poh Leong Boon_ ([21] _supra_ ), the 27-year-old ac c used pleaded guilty to, _inter alia_ , seven c ounts of c heating under s 420. 27 other similar c harges were taken into c onsideration. The Distric t Court sentenc ed the ac c used to _six months’_ imprisonment for one of the c heating c harges and _three months’_ imprisonment for eac h of the remaining six c heating c harges. The sentenc es for the first c heating c harge and two of the remaining six c heating c harges were ordered to run c onsec utively, making up a total of 12 months’ imprisonment for the s 420 c harges. The first c heating c harge involved the most valuable item fraudulently purc hased – a gold c hain valued at $7,103.62 – whic h was $2,000 more than any of the other items fraudulently proc ured. The total value of the items (inc luding those in the c harges taken into c onsideration) was $36,504.57. The distric t judge distinguished _Mihaly Magashazie_. The ac c used in _Mihaly Magashazie_ was said to have c ommitted a string of offenc es targeting hotels and foreign nationals whic h ‘struc k at the heart of Singapore’s tourism industry’ ( _Poh Leong Boon_ at [21]). The distric t judge c onc luded that the offenc es in this c ase, where the ac c used had stolen c redit c ards from his neighbours’ letterboxes, were in c ontrast relatively unsophistic ated; his grounds of dec ision suggested that this warranted a lower sentenc e. No appeal against sentenc e from the prosec ution ensued. In my view the sentenc es meted out by the distric t judge were c learly inadequate and did not appropriately reflec t the c ulpability of that ac c used. 

30     The 22-year-old ac c used in _Glynis Wong Dwe May v PP_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No 7/99/01) had pleaded guilty to three c ounts of c heating under s 420 for using a stolen c redit c ard in her purc hase of goods, with three other c ounts taken into c onsideration. The offenc e was not premeditated and involved the ac c used removing, in a moment of indisc retion, her c olleague’s c redit c ard whic h had been left lying in a wallet in an open drawer. The total value of the fraudulent purc hases (inc luding those taken into c onsideration) amounted to $4,735.45. The Distric t Court noted that the ac c used was a first offender and had expressed real remorse. _Seven months’ imprisonment_ was imposed on eac h of the three c heating c harges, with two of the sentenc es to run c onsec utively. This sentenc e was _upheld_ on appeal. 

31     Lastly, in _Lim Pei Ni Charissa_ ([19] _supra_ ), the 20-year-old ac c used had c laimed trial and was c onvic ted on seven c harges under s 420 read with s 109 of the Penal Code, for the abetment of c heating offenc es relating to the use of stolen c redit c ards. On appeal, Tay Yong Kwang J ordered _probation_ for her. He c onsidered _Fadilah bte Omar_ ([24] and [27] _supra_ ), and distinguished that c ase. Tay J was of the view that although the amount involved in _Fadilah bte Omar_ was muc h smaller than in this c ase, the misappropriation and the fraudulent use in the former had both been c arried out by the offender; Fadilah’s c ulpability was therefore c orrespondingly greater ( _Lim Pei Ni Charissa_ at [20]). 

**Sentencing patterns discernible from case law** 

**_The decision in Lim Pei Ni Charissa to be confined to its exceptional facts_** 

32     The last c ase disc ussed above appears at first blush to be anomalous in its departure from the deterrent c ustodial sentenc es imposed on c redit c ard offenc es in the other relevant c ases. The Distric t Court in _Lim Pei Ni Charissa_ had imposed a total sentenc e of 33 months’ imprisonment on the 


ac c used, as the distric t judge felt that the ac c used person’s punishment should reflec t suffic ient disapprobation of her ac ts and deter similarly-minded persons in future. He also wanted to c onvey the message that the c ourts did not c ondone the theft of c redit c ards and their subsequent use. 

33     However, Tay Yong Kwang J had allowed the appellant’s appeal on sentenc e. With respec t to the probation order, he stated that the guiding princ iple is the likely responsiveness of the young offender to rehabilitation, and that the c ourt must apply its mind to the fac ts of eac h c ase and, in partic ular, the probation report ( _Lim Pei Ni Charissa_ at [17]). The c omprehensive and detailed probation report in that c ase _strongly recommended_ a probation order for the appellant. 

34     Ac c ording to the probation report, the appellant had established a stable relationship with her c urrent boyfriend and she had just given birth to a three-month-old daughter. Sinc e the birth of her daughter, the appellant had been ac c epted by the University of Western Australia to pursue a degree c ourse and was also enrolled in a one-year diploma c ourse in law at the Singapore Institute of Commerc e. The probation report also indic ated that sinc e the birth of her c hild, the appellant had unequivoc ally left behind her previous wayward life and had now turned over a new leaf. The probation offic er was c onvinc ed that the appellant would respond positively to supervision. 

35     The probation report proposed the maximum term of probation c oupled with an intensive individualised c ase management plan, whic h inc luded a prison visit, psyc hologic al c ounselling and a parenting programme. Tay J was persuaded that the probation programme envisaged for the appellant was c arefully-c rafted, taking into ac c ount the appellant’s c irc umstanc es and needs; it was c orrec tly premised and c ontingent upon the reliable network of family support that the appellant c ould avail herself to. He was also c learly moved by the fac t that although prison regulations permit the appellant to be with her infant while she served a c ustodial sentenc e, it was eminently more desirable that the appellant’s baby be brought up in a positive familial environment, rather than in prison (at [29]). 

36     Quite apart from the probation report, Tay J noted that the appellant was neither the princ ipal offender nor the instigator of the theft of the c redit c ards (at [19]). Nor was the nature of the operations symptomatic of a syndic ate engaged in large-sc ale c redit c ard fraud. In light of these fac tors, Tay J was of the view that a happy medium between public interest and the interest of the offender would not be c ompromised by the imposition of a probation order. 

37     In the result, Tay J was prompted by the _exceptional_ c irc umstanc es of this c ase to grant probation to the appellant. His dec ision was prec ipitated by a _unique_ c onfluenc e of fac tors, inc luding the appellant’s age at the time of the offenc es, her role in the offenc es, her subsequent ac knowledgment of her misdemeanours, her family support, her newborn baby and her rec eptiveness to the terms of her intensive individualised probation plan (at [30]). Tay J c onc luded at [30]: 

 In the final analysis, I was persuaded by the exceptional circumstances of this c ase to grant probation to a young woman who had exhibited maturity sinc e the c ommission of her offenc es and deserved a c hanc e to right the wrongs she had c ommitted against soc iety. 

 [emphasis added] 

As a sentenc ing prec edent that c ase should be c onfined to its very exc eptional c irc umstanc es and unique fac tual matrix; it should not by any ac c ount be viewed as portending or signalling a departure from the severe sentenc ing prec edents for c redit c ard offenc es. 

**_Fraudulent use of credit cards relevant sentencing considerations_** 


38     I set out below various relevant fac tors to be taken into ac c ount in the sentenc ing of c redit c ard offenc es. However, these fac tors are by no means exhaustive, and needless to say every c ase must ultimately be c onsidered on the basis of its own fac tual matrix. 

_Planning and premeditation_ 

39     As disc ussed in [21], syndic ated c redit c ard offenc es would almost invariably attrac t more severe sentenc ing than non-syndic ated offenc es. This stems from the trite law that a deterrent sentenc e should be _de rigueur_ where an offenc e is c ommitted with premeditation and planning: _Ooi Joo Keong v PP_ <span class="citation">[1997] 2 SLR 68</span>; this is partic ularly so when an offender has c olluded with the ac tivities of an organised c riminal syndic ate: _Ong Tiong Poh_ ([21] _supra_ ); _Purwanto_ ([23] _supra_ ). 

40     The rationale for this approac h is summarised with admirable c larity and suc c inc tness by Professor Andrew Ashworth in _Sentencing and Criminal Justice_ (Butterworths, 3rd Ed) at page 136: 

 A person who plans or organises a c rime is generally more c ulpable, bec ause the offenc e is premeditated and the offender is therefore more fully c onfirmed in his anti-soc ial motivation than someone who ac ts on impulse.... Planned lawbreaking c onstitutes a great threat to soc iety, sinc e it betokens a c onsidered attac k on soc ial values, with greater c ommitment and perhaps c ontinuity than a spontaneous c rime. 

41     I should add that the princ iple that planned and premeditated offenc es are more alarming, insidious and malignant, thus warranting more serious treatment applies with equal forc e to nonsyndic ated offenc es. Indeed, in _Mihaly Magashazie_ (at [26]), the ac c used person quite c orrec tly was found to have planned his offenc e, instead of having c ommitted it on the spur of the moment and in “hot blood”. This was deemed to be an aggravating fac tor for the purposes of sentenc ing. The ac c used in that c ase was c learly preying on vic tims and appeared to be a rec alc itrant offender. 

_Sophistication of offences and measures taken to defy detection_ 

42     Inextric ably linked to the idea of premeditation and organised c rime is the level of sophistic ation that c harac terises an offenc e. A sophistic ated offenc e replete with c arefully orc hestrated efforts and steps to avoid detec tion is an aggravating fac tor in sentenc ing. This is illustrated in _Ong Tiong Poh_ ([21] _supra_ ), where Yong CJ adverted to the sophistic ation of the offenc e and the syndic ate’s adeptness at avoiding detec tion as relevant fac tors when enhanc ing the sentenc e. Conversely, where an offenc e was relatively unsophistic ated, and minimal prec autions are taken to avoid detec tion, a c omparatively lower sentenc e would generally be imposed: _Poh Leong Boon_ ([21] _supra_ ). In _Lim Pei Ni Charissa_ ([19] _supra_ ), the fac t that the offenc es were c ommitted by extrac ting c redit c ards from mailboxes with a pair of c hopstic ks (as opposed to a more sophistic ated modus operandi) c onstituted yet another dimension in the exc eptional c irc umstanc es within whic h Tay Yong Kwang J felt he should impose a probation order. I would add this further observation: often, the more sophistic ated c rimes c ause greater c onsternation and raise the ante for better protec tive measures to prevent a rec urrenc e of similar offenc es. This results not only in substantial c osts being inc urred by potential institutional vic tims but also muc h inc onvenienc e and perhaps even loss of reputation. Financ ial institutions, partic ularly in c ounterfeit c ases, have also to fac e the wrath of c ard holders who are inc onvenienc ed and embarrassed. 

43     The length of time a partic ular sc am or offenc e has gone undetec ted would be yet another relevant c onsideration in sentenc ing. In _Rohaazman bin Ali_ ([24] _supra_ ), the fac t that the sc am went undetec ted for 20 months was a c onsideration the trial judge felt he c ould not overlook. This was the c ase even though he found that the sc am was unsophistic ated and the modus operandi simple. The 


relevanc e of this is as a sentenc ing c onsideration may also be tied to the rec alc itranc e of the offender. In the c ase of a hardened offender, he would have repeatedly c ommitted a pattern of offenc es without any sign or ac knowledgment of c ontrition or remorse. The longer the period of time over whic h the offenc es have been c ommitted, the more irrefutable it is that the offender manifests the qualities of a habitual offender. Spec ific deterrenc e is inc ontrovertibly an important sentenc ing c onsideration in suc h c ases. 

_Role of the accused_ 

44     The severity of the sentenc e imposed should reflec t the role played by the ac c used in the c redit c ard offenc e. This princ iple features prominently in c ases involving syndic ates. In _Purwanto_ ([23] _supra_ ), the appellant’s ac tive role in the c ommission of the offenc es was c onstrued as an aggravating fac tor. Although the appellant in that c ase was not the mastermind, the appellate c ourt was of the view that his partic ipation was hardly minor, nor ac c idental, and that his c ulpability surpassed that of his ac c omplic es. The c ourt found it signific ant that the appellant had a sizeable stake in the outc ome of the sc am. 

45     Even in non-syndic ate c ases, the role of the ac c used person is a relevant sentenc ing c onsideration. In _Rohaazman bin Ali_ ([24] _supra_ ), it was noted that Rohaazman was c learly the mastermind and that his c o-ac c used, Jamaludin, had a lesser role. This c onsideration resulted in the imposition of a higher sentenc e on Rohaazman. In _Lim Pei Ni Charissa_ ([19] s _upra_ ), the fac t that the appellant was neither the princ ipal offender nor the instigator of the offenc es was also deemed to be a relevant c onsideration. 

_Number of offences and quantum involved_ 

46     As both a matter of c ommonsense and general princ iple, it c an be said that the larger the number of offenc es c ommitted the longer the c ustodial sentenc e. The applic ation of this princ iple in c redit c ard offenc es is amply illustrated by _Mihaly Magashazie_ ([19] _supra_ ) where the c ourt c onc luded that the numerous fraudulent purc hases made by the ac c used justified the imposition of longer c ustodial sentenc es. The massive number of c harges in _Rohaazman bin Ali_ ([24] _supra_ ) also proved to be a relevant c onsideration for the c ourt in sentenc ing. 

47     With respec t to quantum, it c an also be generally surmised that the higher the quantum, the heftier the sentenc e (see Lee Tec k Leng in “Sentenc ing in Cheating Offenc es”, _Law Gazette_ , August 2000(4) (“ _Law Gazette Article_ ”)). That the sentenc ing tariffs for c heating offenc es under s 420 are based on the quantum in eac h c harge is well illustrated in the _Law Gazette Article_. In my view, this applies ac ross the board to all s 420 c heating offenc es, _including_ c redit c ard offenc es. 

48     The nexus between the number of offenc es and quantum involved was also disc ussed in the _Law Gazette Article_. Lee Tec k Leng observes: 

 ... the total sentenc e imposed on an offender c onvic ted of multiple c harges would still bear some semblanc e to the sentenc e that may be passed in a c ase where an offender is c onvic ted of a single c heating offenc e involving the same sum of money. This is due to the fac t that from the vic tim’s view point, the sentenc es to be imposed should not, logic ally speaking, depend greatly on whether the vic tim was c heated a hundred times amounting to a total of $250,000 or c heated onc e to the tune of $250,000. Having said that, it is also quite c lear that an offender who has c heated a vic tim of small amounts a hundred times over is a serial offender and he would rightly be regarded as being more c ulpable than an offender who c heated only onc e, albeit of a large sum. Amalgamating both perspectives, it would appear that the total sentence imposed on the 


 serial cheat would probably be slightly higher than the sentence imposed on an offender convicted of a single cheating offence, if the total quantum is identical in both instances. 

 [emphasis added] 

To this I would add that sentenc es meted out in serial c heating c ases should not be only ‘slightly higher’ as c ompared to that assigned to a single offender for the same quantum. The sentenc e c ould in the appropriate c irc umstanc es be _significantly_ higher. _A serial offender would be hard put to credibly submit that his conduct was the result of a momentary indiscretion_. 

_Actual loss and damage_ 

49     Quite apart from the quantum involved in c heating offenc es (as disc ussed above) is the notion of the extent of loss or damage _actually_ suffered as a result of the offenc es. In _Khoo Ban Hock v PP_ [1988] 3 MLJ 22, it was held that as there was no evidenc e of loss to the public , lenienc y should be ac c orded to the appellant. Similarly, in _Hoo Chee Keong v PP (No.2)_ [2000] 5 MLJ 448, the c ourt in assessing the appropriate sentenc e, briefly alluded to the fac t that the evidenc e adduc ed failed to reveal that the ac c used had c aused heavy financ ial loss to anyone by the use or intended use of forged c redit c ards. The English Court of Appeal in _R v Lennon (Jeffrey)_ [1996] CLY 2087 noted that the fac t that the fraudulent sc heme was frustrated and that no loss oc c urred should be a mitigating c onsideration. In _R v Harjit Singh Samra_ (1992) 13 Cr App R (S) 168 the Court of Appeal c onstrued the lac k of evidenc e that loss had been suffered as a result of the frauds c ommitted by the ac c used, as having c onstituted at least limited mitigation. In my view, the fac t that no or minimal loss has oc c urred bec ause the offender has been apprehended or bec ause the items or proc eeds of c rime are subsequently rec overed is a _relevant but not decisive factor_ in assessing the appropriate sentenc e. The c ogenc y of suc h a c onsideration will have to be evaluated in its proper matrix. Almost invariably in every c ase of c ommerc ial fraud, it c annot be gainsaid that a serious offenc e has indeed been c ommitted. That the loss has been minimised bec ause of external intervention is purely fortuitous. Apart from the ac tual amount involved in a c redit c ard fraud, it should also be emphasised that a c hain of parties is inevitably involved in every transac tion. Damage or loss may sometimes be intangible when it assumes the form of inc onvenienc e, embarrassment, loss of reputation, time and c osts expended in investigations as well as time, researc h, effort and c osts involved in enhanc ing sec urity measures. Every c redit c ard fraud, regardless of whether the money or items are eventually rec overed would c ause inc onvenienc e and some form of intangible damage to either the c ard holder or an involved financ ial institution. General and spec ific deterrenc e must therefore feature as the vital if not dominant sentenc ing c onsiderations for suc h offenc es. Indeed, in _PP v Ng Tai Tee Janet_ <span class="citation">[2001] 1 SLR 343</span>, Yong CJ was also of the view at [28] that when c onsiderations of public interests were implic ated, the fac t that no ac tual harm or loss was suffered by any party was of less relevanc e. 

50     However, if an ac c used of his own volition and out of c ontriteness returns the items or benefits proc ured before his personal involvement is noted or detec ted, this should have a material bearing on the sentenc e imposed. It c ould be persuasively argued that this c onstitutes proper ac knowledgment of guilt sinc e it is manifested by genuine remorse. That said, restitution of any kind is also usually a relevant sentenc ing c onsideration. This may be illustrated by another English Court of Appeal’s dec ision, _R v Harivadan Patel_ (1986) 8 Cr App R (S) 67. Webster J in that c ase rejec ted the appellant’s argument that the vic tim from whom the appellant had stolen money had taken proc eedings to rec over that money and therefore would probably be able to rec over his loss. He added, if on the other hand, the thief before being sentenc ed has realised his assets and has attempted to repay, or has repaid, the loss or a substantial part of it that c onstitutes potential mitigation. Similarly, in the Australian c ase of _The Queen & ors v Debra Jane Mitchell & Anor_ 


[1998] WASCA 299, the Supreme Court of Western Australia c onc luded that a loss to the vic tim, would be a fac tor rendering the offenc e more serious; the fac t that the loss has been made good is, however, a mitigating fac tor. Loc al authorities have also proposed that making restitution may provide some evidenc e of remorse, genuine good c harac ter or reformation, thereby c arrying some mitigating value: see for example, _Krishnan Chand v PP_ <span class="citation">[1995] 2 SLR 291</span>; _Tan Sai Tiang v PP_ <span class="citation">[2000] 1 SLR 439</span>. At this junc ture, it must be reiterated that attac hing mitigating value to efforts at restitution is largely premised on the assumption that voluntary restitution reflec ts true remorse. In instanc es where in spite of monetary restitution, the ac c used has shown no remorse, suc h restitution would be of little mitigating value: see _Ng Kwee Seng v PP_ <span class="citation">[1997] 3 SLR 205</span> at 209, [15], where the c ourt wryly observed that the appellant in attempting to c astigate the c redibility of the prosec ution witnesses had showed no remorse whatsoever despite having made monetary restitution. 

_Plea of guilt_ 

51     Generally, a timeous plea of guilt is a mitigating fac tor: _Xia Qin Lai v PP_ <span class="citation">[1999] 4 SLR 343</span>; _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">[2006] 4 SLR 653</span>. This princ iple has been applied to c redit c ard offenc es, as amply illustrated in the dec ision in _Rohaazman bin Ali_ ([24] and [26] _supra_ ); the distric t judge noted that the ac c used persons pleaded guilty unreservedly at virtually the earliest possible opportunity, thereby demonstrating at least some basic dec enc y and remorse. However, the weight to be attac hed to a plea of guilt must depend on the fac ts of eac h c ase. 

52     In _Wong Kai Chuen Phillip v PP_ [1990] SLR 1011 (“ _Wong Kai Chuen_ ”), one of the leading loc al authorities on this issue, Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) had c ommented at page 1014, [14]: 

 ... I do not dissent from the princ iple applied by the senior distric t judge that the voluntary surrender by an offender and a plea of guilty by him in c ourt are fac tors that c an be taken into ac c ount in mitigation as they may be evidenc e of remorse and a willingness to ac c ept punishment for his wrongdoing. However, I think that their relevance and the weight to be placed on them must depend on the circumstances of each case. I do not see any mitigation value in a robber surrendering to the polic e after he is surrounded and has no means of esc ape, or muc h mitigation value in a professional man turning himself in in the fac e of absolute knowledge that the game is up. 

 [emphasis added] 

53     In a similar vein, Kow Keng Siong DJ in _Mihaly Magashazie_ ([19] _supra_ ) c orrec tly attac hed little weight to the ac c used person’s guilty plea. He was of the view that the ac c used, having been arrested outside a jewellery shop and having just made a fraudulent purc hase with a stolen c redit c ard, had no c hoic e but to plead guilty and c ooperate with the authorities. Similarly, in _Purwanto_ ([23] _supra_ ), the disc ount for the plea of guilt was minimal as the appellant was c aught red-handed with the forged c redit c ards upon his arrest, whilst attempting another fraudulent c ard transac tion. 

54     _Wong Kai Chuen_ ([52] _supra_ ) should not however be c onstrued as signalling that a plea of guilt c a n _never_ be of mitigating value, when c onvic tion is inevitable. In _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">[2006] 4 SLR 653</span>, I endorsed a remorse-based approac h to a plea of guilt. I was of the view that the exc eptions to the prac tic e of reduc ing sentenc es for guilty pleas, for instanc e where the evidenc e against the offender was truly overwhelming, or where the offender was c aught red-handed, simply represent and reflec t judic ial and c ommon experienc e. They are no more than helpful analytic al and evidential presumptions to assist a c ourt in assessing whether the offender’s guilty plea is ac tivated by sinc ere remorse: at [69]. I have adopted a similar view in the present c ase and note that this remorse-based approac h was ac tually adopted in _Lim Pei Ni Charissa_ ([19] _supra_ ). In that c ase, Tay J 


rec ognised that the appellant had c hosen to c laim trial rather than plead guilty. Nonetheless, the appellant’s subsequent ac knowledgment of her wrongs was indic ative of her remorse and c ould be taken into ac c ount. Tay J based that finding on the probation report whic h stated that the appellant had sinc e taken responsibility for her ac tions. 

**The larger picture: A broad overview of the entire spectrum of credit card frauds** 

55     Thus far, c redit c ard offenc es have been disc ussed ac c ording to their c lassific ations into two broad c ategories: c ounterfeit c ards and/or syndic ate offenc es and stolen/misappropriated c ards offenc es. Suc h a dic hotomy is virtually inevitable as these two genres of c redit c ard fraud not only seem to feature most prominently in loc al c ase law, the c ulpability that eac h c ategory of offenders attrac ts might also be c ompared and c ontrasted ac c ordingly. However, it would be appropriate to point out that in point of fac t, an entire gamut of potential c redit c ard frauds exists with varying levels of seriousness. That said, the sentenc ing c onsiderations just disc ussed above c ontinue to be relevant ac ross the board. In fac t, it is the c ommonsense applic ation of c onsistent sentenc ing c onsiderations to the different types of c redit c ard frauds that yields differing degrees of sentenc ing severity in eac h c ase. In asc ending levels of seriousness (and attrac ting c orrespondingly asc ending levels of sentenc ing severity), the princ ipal types of c redit c ard frauds may be c ategorised in more depth and detail as follows. This list is by no means c omprehensive or exhaustive in sc ope and c annot be presumed to c over every c onc eivable c redit c ard fraud/sc heme that may be c onc oc ted by inventive c riminal minds: 

 ( a ) Lost and stolen cards : This c orresponds to the stolen/misappropriated c ards c ategory as adverted to in our previous, more simplistic dic hotomy. Misappropriated use of suc h c ards would c ome to the owner’s attention fairly quic kly and these offenc es generally require minimal c riminal expertise; they are therefore the most c ommonly c ommitted type of c redit c ard frauds. 

 (b) Intercept fraud : This is a related c ategory to that of lost and stolen c ards. Postal interc ept fraud oc c urs when a c ard is stolen from the postal servic e before it reac hes its owner. The theft of suc h c ards depends on individuals who work for the postal servic e, and involves a breac h of trust by these individuals. 

 (c ) Application fraud (financial fraud) : This oc c urs when an individual applies for a c redit c ard, but gives false details about himself or herself. The most c ommon sc enario is where an individual exaggerates his or her inc ome. This may prove relatively diffic ult to detec t. Financ ial institutions try to safeguard themselves from this sort of fraud both by requiring doc umentary support of a c ard applic ant’s financ ial c laims, and by c arrying out c redit c hec ks on an applic ant’s financ ial status and c urrent address. By and large, this sort of fraud neither requires nor involves any real sophistic ation. 

 ( d ) Application fraud (assumed identity) : This is a long-standing mode of c redit c ard fraud. A c riminal assumes another person’s identity, solely for the purpose of rec eiving another individual’s c redit c ard. The c arrying out of suc h offenc es requires more planning and pre-meditation than the other type of applic ation fraud (financ ial fraud) disc ussed in (c ) above; to that extent it ought to be viewed as a more serious offenc e. 

 ( e ) Fake cards : Fake c ards are c ards c reated c ompletely from sc ratc h and they require substantial effort and skill to produc e. Banks have found ways to safeguard themselves against this method of c redit c ard fraud by instilling features in the c redit c ard, suc h as holograms. The modern c redit c ard is therefore even more diffic ult to c reate c ompletely from sc ratc h. Indeed, hologrammed c ards ac c ount for the inc reased c osts that banks and financ ial institutions, and 


 c onsequently c redit c ard holders suffer as a result of c redit c ard frauds. But just as c redit c ards have evolved in sophistic ation, c redit c ard fraudsters have c orrespondingly bec ome more ingenious. Modern tec hnology has been deployed to improve and refine methods of c redit c ard frauds, resulting in a plethora of more c omplex sc hemes for the fraudulent use of c redit c ards (disc ussed below from (f) to (i)). 

 (f ) Skimming : This oc c urs where the data c ontained in the magnetic stripe on a c redit c ard is c opied on to the stripe of another c ard. Skimming is very diffic ult, if not entirely impossible to trac e. Even the modern and apparently more sec ure smart c hip c redit c ards c an now have their data c opied with the appropriate tec hnology. Spec ial devic es are required for skimming and elaborate planning and premeditation are invariably involved. As is evident, skimming is a sophistic ated mode of proc uring c ounterfeit c ard information, and is extremely diffic ult to detec t. 

 ( g ) Site cloning and false merchant sites : In this type of fraud, the Internet provides the details required by fraudsters to c ommit c redit c ard frauds. Site c loning oc c urs when fraudsters c lone websites or webpages from whic h online transac tions are made. These c loned sites are identic al to the real ones and the unsuspec ting c ustomers would fill in their details, inc luding their names, addresses and full c redit c ard details, whic h would then be c ollec ted by the c redit c ard fraudsters. False merc hant sites often offer the c ustomer an extremely c heap servic e, with the requirement that c ustomers must enter their full c redit c ard details, names and addresses in order to ac c ess the c ontent of the site. These sites are set up to ac c umulate as many c redit c ard numbers as possible, so that the numbers may be used, or sold to smaller fraudsters. Suc h offenc es are very sophistic ated, premeditated, and usually operate on a large sc ale. Detec tion is onc e again very diffic ult. 

 ( h ) Triangulation : This is similar to site c loning and false merc hant sites. The fraudster operates from a website, where goods are offered at heavily disc ounted rates and shipped before payment. The c ustomer must furnish his or her name, address and valid c redit c ard details to purc hase the goods. The fraudsters then order the goods from a legitimate site using another set of stolen c redit c ard details and with the c ustomer’s name and address. The c ustomer’s own c redit c ard details are in turn used to purc hase other goods. This proc ess is designed to avoid early detec tion by c reating a great deal of preliminary c onfusion for the authorities. The authorities trac k down the c ustomers of the site whose names were used to purc hase goods with stolen c redit c ard details, but substantially more time is required to trac k down the fraudsters operating the website. The sites are usually c losed down within a few weeks, and new fraudulent sites subsequently opened. Authorities therefore often have little or no c hanc e to apprehend the operators of the networks. The inherently high level of sophistic ation involved in suc h a method of c redit c ard fraud, and the very deliberate avoidanc e of detec tion c ontribute to the gravity of suc h offenc es. 

 ( i ) Credit card generating : This method of c redit c ard fraud manifests by far the highest degree of sophistic ation among all the c redit c ard frauds identified so far. Computer programs are used to generate valid c redit c ard numbers and expiry dates by generating lists of c redit c ard ac c ount numbers from a single ac c ount number. These generators c ould entail grave reperc ussions and send the levels of c redit c ard fraud soaring on a global sale.

56     This brief outline and overview provides a flavour of the many guises of c redit c ard fraud that have now surfac ed to plague both financ ial institutions and their c ustomers. By and large, with the 


exc eption of simple theft, most forms of c redit c ard fraud require c onsiderable planning, ac tual knowledge of how elec tronic c redit c ards operate and a c omprehensive understanding of how to c irc umvent existing safeguards. However, for the purposes of the present grounds of dec ision, the c learer, albeit more simplistic dic hotomy of c redit c ard offenc es will suffic e to illustrate the appropriate treatment of suc h offenc es. For the purposes of assessment of sentenc e, however, the c ourt should bear in mind the c ontext of the whole multifac eted sphere of c redit c ard fraud, as outlined and disc ussed, should always be adjusted with referenc e to the level of planning and sophistic ation involved and the c onsequenc es flowing from eac h c rime. 

**Approach and range of sentences for credit card cheating offences in some foreign jurisdictions** 

57     Purely for the purposes of a c omparative study of sentenc ing c onsiderations, I now turn to look briefly at the sentenc ing prec edents for similar offenc es in Hong Kong and United Kingdom. 

**_Hong Kong_** 

58     Credit c ard c heating offenc es are treated severely in Hong Kong, given its apparent prevalenc e in that jurisdic tion. This is evident from the observations of Mac dougall JA in _R v Wong Fu-keung_ Criminal Appeal No 5 of 1991 (unreported) at page 5: 

 It is a notorious fac t that the illegal use of c redit c ards has bec ome widespread. Those who are engaged in this type of ac tivity c an expec t to be dealt with severely by the c ourts. 

59     The _raison d’etre_ for suc h a tough stanc e was furnished by Liton JA in _R v Kwai Ying-ho_ Criminal Appeal No 527 of 1992 (unreported) at page 5: 

 Credit c ard frauds have in rec ent years been an insidious poison in the c ommunity. It affec ts a large number of c itizens. It erodes the c redit c ard system and damages Hong Kong’s standing in the international c ommunity. 

Whilst those words spec ific ally applied to c harges of c onspirac y in that c ase, they were adopted by the c ourt in _Attorney-General v Chan Piu-sang and Another_ [1994] 1 HKCLR 211 (“ _Chan Piu-sang_ ”) in relation to c redit c ard frauds in general. 

60     It would appear that Hong Kong c ourts view offenc es c onc erning _forged_ c redit c ards as more serious than those c onc erning _stolen_ c redit c ards. Stolen c ard offenc es are likely to c ome more quic kly to the attention of the c redit c ard c ompany so that retailers c an in turn be expeditiously alerted. The period of time within whic h stolen c ards c an be suc c essfully employed is therefore usually limited. On the other hand, the employment of a forged c ard is in the normal c ourse of events not likely to surfac e until the true c ard holder rec eives a statement of ac c ount whic h he then observes to be inc orrec t (see _The Queen v Chan Sik Kwan_ Magistrac y Criminal Appeal No 1284 of 1989). 

61     In so far as _forged_ c redit c ards are in issue, it suffic es to note that the Court of Appeal in _R v Chan Siu To and Another_ [1996] HKCA 385 (“ _Chan Siu To_ ”) imposed two years’ imprisonment on eac h c harge of obtaining property by dec eption, taking into ac c ount that the sc heme was ‘not a very sophistic ated one’. For similar c harges, the Court of Appeal in _The Queen v Leung Kwok Chung_ [1995] HKCA 178 similarly took a starting point of two years’ imprisonment for eac h c harge. In _Chan Piu-sang_ ([59] _supra_ ), the trial judge’s sentenc e of six months’ imprisonment was enhanc ed to two years by the Court of Appeal with respec t to the c harge of attempting to obtain property by 


dec eption using a forged c redit c ard. 

_Use of stolen credit cards_ 

62     _The Queen v Ajibola Swaju Oyalowo and Another_ [1985] HKCA 50 involved the use of stolen c redit c ards to obtain property/servic es. The applic ants were c onvic ted of 11 c harges. The Court of Appeal opined that the sentenc e of 18 months’ imprisonment imposed by the trial judge on eac h c harge was a proper sentenc e. The trial judge had emphasised that the applic ants’ one and only objec t in proc eeding to Hong Kong was to defraud shopkeepers. It was deemed to be a systematic fraud, well-planned and orc hestrated with the use of stolen c redit c ards and tantamount to a threat both to Hong Kong’s business ac tivities as well as their c redit struc ture. Further, as the applic ants were c aught red-handed, very little disc ount was given to their pleas of guilt. The Court of Appeal c onc luded by suggesting that in future, the appropriate sentenc e in similar c ases should be a minimum of 18 months. 

63     Different fac ts arose in _HKSAR v Lam Pui Tak_ Magistrac y Appeal No 655 of 2001. In that c ase, the sentenc e of eight months’ imprisonment imposed by the Magistrate for eac h of the four c harges of obtaining by dec eption was upheld. The Magistrate had taken a starting point of 12 months for eac h offenc e, but he had given the appellant full c redit for her plea of guilt, the appellant having c onfessed to having stolen the c redit c ard and having voluntarily surrendered to the polic e. Further, there was no suggestion that the appellant was heavily involved in c redit c ard fraud, or that she had in her possession additional c redit c ards, or that she was working as a member of any syndic ate. It should, however, be noted that the Magistrate, in c onsidering sentenc e, took the view that offenc es relating to the use of c redit c ards were very c ommon, and that even a first-time offender had to be sentenc ed to an immediate sentenc e of imprisonment for the purpose of deterrenc e. 

64     In _HKSAR v See Chun Fat Billy_ Magistrac y Appeal No HCMA367 of 2005, the appellant stole c redit c ards from letterboxes. The Magistrate had taken 18 months’ imprisonment as the starting point, but the term was reduc ed by a third upon a plea of guilt. On appeal, it was held that the sentenc e was not too severe. Credit c ard fraud is a serious matter whic h is prevalent and c auses signific ant loss. The appellant’s involvement demonstrated premeditation and was not perpetrated in a sudden moment of greed. The orders were thus c onfirmed. 

65     Higher sentenc es were imposed in _R v Blancaflor_ Criminal Appeal No 294 of 1986 (“ _Blancaflor_ ”), _HKSAR v Wong Wan Shan_ Criminal Appeal Nos 9 & 10 of 2002 (“ _Wong Wan Shan_ ”) and _HKSAR v Chan Kwai-Fui_ [1998] HKCA 377 (“ _Chan Kwai-Fui_ ”). In all three c ases, elements of syndic ation or group c onspirac y to c ommit the offenc es c an be found. In _Blancaflor_ , a _group_ of persons used stolen c redit c ards to obtain goods. It was a _planned_ fraud and a sentenc e of 21 months was c onfirmed. In _Wong Wan Shan_ , a starting point of three to four years’ imprisonment was taken and sentenc es of between two years and four months’ imprisonment and two years and eight months’ imprisonment eac h were imposed for c harges of obtaining property by dec eption. That the offenc es had been c ommitted over a lengthy period of time and the fac t that the applic ant was a persistent offender, _acting in concert with others as part of an accomplished thieving syndicate_ c onstituted aggravating fac tors in that c ase. Lastly, in _Chan Kwai-Fui_ , a four-year starting point was taken for eac h of the five c harges of obtaining property by dec eption through the fraudulent use of stolen c redit c ards. The sentenc ing was subsequently disc ounted and reduc ed to two years and eight months’ imprisonment. The judge took into ac c ount, _inter alia_ , the prevalenc e of suc h offenc es and the indic ation that _the applicant was involved with others in the offences_. The sentenc e was upheld on appeal. 

_Factors considered by the Hong Kong judiciary_ 


66     In _Chan Siu To_ ([61] _supra_ ), a non-exhaustive list of fac tors to be c onsidered by a sentenc ing judge in c redit c ard fraud c ases was set out by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal. These fac tors inc luded: 

 (a) The size of the operation (whether it involves large sums of money, large numbers of persons or large numbers of fraudulent c redit c ards); 

 (b) The planning that has gone into perpetrating the fraud (whether it is elaborate or simple, whether tec hnic al skills were used); 

 (c ) Whether there is an international dimension; 

 (d) Whether the ac c used played a major role (whether the ac c used ran the syndic ate, organised the use of the fraudulent c ards, or was a mere ‘c og in the wheel’); and 

 (e) Whether there is a plea of guilty. 

67     The fac tors listed by the Hong Kong c ourt are essentially largely similar to the relevant sentenc ing c onsiderations I have set out in [38] to [54] above. With the possible exc eption of fac tor (c ) (international dimension), it should be noted that our loc al c ourts have generally also paid attention to all the other fac tors when sentenc ing perpetrators of c redit c ard offenc es. I agree with and endorse the Hong Kong Court of Appeal’s inc orporation of the international dimension as a relevant sentenc ing c onsideration. _Foreigners and/or criminal syndicates who single out Singapore as a platform for their crimes must be uncompromisingly visited with very severe sentences_. 

**_United Kingdom_** 

68     The English c ourts also c onsider the fraudulent use of c redit c ards as a relatively serious offenc e. The threat that suc h c rimes might bec ome prevalent also appears to be a c ritic al sentenc ing c onsideration. 

69     In _R v Jackson and Jackson_ (1992) 13 Cr App R (S) 22 (“ _Jackson_ ”), the appellants had pleaded guilty to three c ounts of obtaining by dec eption using stolen c redit c ards, with 31 and 47 similar offenc es to be taken into c onsideration respec tively. The c ourt regarded these offenc es as meriting a sentenc e of immediate imprisonment as they had been c ommitted over a substantial period of time. The general preponderenc e of suc h offenc es given that they required little effort or exertion was yet another c ritic al fac tor prompting the c ourt to c onc lude that suc h c onduc t should be severely dealt with for the purposes of general deterrenc e. Ultimately, in that c ase, however, the positive c harac ter referenc es of the appellants and their dire financ ial predic ament dissuaded the c ourt from imposing c ustodial sentenc es. Community servic e orders were presc ribed instead. 

70     In the more rec ent dec ision of _R v Shellie Wallace_ [2001] EWCA Crim 1405, where the appellant had pleaded guilty to _inter alia_ four c harges of obtaining property by dec eptively employing a c redit c ard, a different c onc lusion was reac hed. 133 offenc es were taken into c onsideration, and she was sentenc ed to eight months’ imprisonment on eac h c harge. The c ourt c onsidered the sentenc e in _Jackson_ ([69] _supra_ ) as pec uliar to its fac ts, emphasising that _Jackson_ raised and affirmed deterrenc e as a c ritic al c onsideration. The Court of Appeal emphasised that eac h c ase must be assessed on its own merits. The sentenc e of eight months in that c ase was upheld. 

71     The older English c ase of _R v Peacock_ [1967] Crim LR 548 appears to have imposed more severe sentenc es for c redit c ard offenc es. There, the ac c used had c ome into possession of a c redit c ard 


belonging to someone else and with others, had used it to obtain goods worth £53 from shopkeepers. He pleaded guilty to two c harges of obtaining goods by false pretenc es, with three similar offenc es to be taken into ac c ount. The ac c used was sentenc ed to 18 months’ imprisonment and in upholding his sentenc e, the Court of Appeal stated that the fraudulent use of c redit c ards is a serious matter. 

72     In light of the relatively inc onsistent sentenc ing prac tic es for c redit c ard offenc es in the United Kingdom, and partic ularly bec ause of the differing c ultural, soc ial and polic y c ontexts prevailing in the UK and Singapore, I am not inc lined to adopt the sentenc ing prec edents in the UK. The relevanc e of English and Hong Kong authorities in Singapore on c redit c ard frauds should be stric tly c onfined to the broad and essential princ iples distilled from both – that c redit c ard offenc es ought to be viewed seriously, and the deterrenc e _must_ feature signific antly in the sentenc ing equation. 

**Summary of relevant sentencing considerations for credit card offences** 

73     In summary, any assessment of sentenc ing fac tors in a c redit c ard c heating offenc e should take into ac c ount the following: 

 (a) degree of planning and premeditation, see [39] to [41]; 

 (b) sophistic ation of offenc e and measures taken to avoid detec tion, see [42] to [43]; 

 (c ) role of the ac c used, see [44] to [45]; 

 (d) number of offenc es and quantum involved, see [46] to [48]; 

 (e) extent of ac tual loss, damage and adverse c onsequenc es (both tangible and intangible) to vic tims and c onnec ted parties, see [49] to [50]; 

 (f) international dimension, see [66] to [67]; and 

 (g) remorse shown, see [49] to [54] 

**The sentencing benchmarks for credit card cheating offences** 

74     One c ommon thread quite perc eptibly runs through c ases on c redit c ard offenc es in all three jurisdic tions of Singapore, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom: suc h offenc es have been deemed almost invariably to warrant deterrent sentenc es. There are indeed sound public interest c onsiderations underpinning and warranting benc hmark sentenc es for this genre of offenc es so that a deterrent message is unequivoc ally c onveyed. Potential offenders should be alerted to the c onsequenc es of c ommitting c redit c ard frauds. Further, benc hmark sentenc es would engender a greater degree of c onsistenc y and c ertainty in the sentenc ing of suc h offenc es. However, I pause here to c aution that despite suc h obvious advantages of benc hmark sentenc es, they should never be applied mec hanic ally, without a proper c onsideration and assessment of the individual fac ts of the c ase. Ultimately, eac h c ase must be determined on its own fac tual matrix. The proc ess of sentenc ing is a matter of law that involves manifold fac tors so that no two c ases c ould ever be totally identic al for the purposes of sentenc ing: _Wan Kim Hock v PP_ <span class="citation">[2003] 1 SLR 410</span>. Thus while past c ases (and benc hmark sentenc es) are c learly helpful in providing guidelines for the c ourt, they must be ac knowledged as just that and no more. In the final analysis, while c onsistenc y in sentenc ing is a desirable objec tive, it should never bec ome an overriding or inflexible princ iple: _Mohd Shahrin bin Shwi v PP_ <span class="citation">[1996] 3 SLR 553</span>. I am inc lined at this junc ture to reiterate my observations in _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_ <span class="citation">[2005] 3 SLR 1</span> at [24]: 


 The c irc umstanc es of eac h c ase are of paramount importanc e in determining the appropriate sentenc e. Benc hmarks and/or tariffs (these terms are used interc hangeably in this judgment) have signific anc e, standing and value as judic ial tools so as to help ac hieve a c ertain degree of c onsistenc y and rationality in our sentenc ing prac tic es. They provide the vital frame of referenc e upon whic h rational and c onsistent sentenc ing dec isions c an be based. They ought not, however, to be applied rigidly or religiously. No two c ases c an or will ever be c ompletely identic al or symmetric al. The lower c ourts, while obliged to pay c areful and thoughtful attention to tariffs and/or sentenc ing prec edents, must not plac e them on an altar and obsessively worship them. The judic ial prerogative to depart in a reasoned and measured manner from sentenc ing and prec edent guidelines in appropriate c ases should not be lightly shrugged off. Sentenc ing is neither a sc ienc e nor an administrative exerc ise. Sentenc es c annot be determined with mathematic al c ertainty. Nor should they be arbitrary. The sentenc e must fit the c rime. Every sentenc e reflec ts a c omplex amalgam of numerous and various fac tors and imponderables and requires the very c areful evaluation of matters suc h as public interest, the nature and c irc umstanc es of the offenc e and the identity of the offender. Most c ruc ially, it c alls for the embodiment of individualised justic e. This in turn warrants the applic ation of sound disc retion. General benc hmarks, while highly signific ant, should not by their very definition be viewed as binding or fossilised judic ial rules, induc ing a mec hanic al applic ation. 

75     In my view, the starting point of the sentenc ing tariffs for the various s 420 c redit c ard c heating offenc es should figure in the following range: 

 ( a ) Syndicated and/or counterfeit/forged credit card and/or sophisticated offences : 24 to 36 months’ imprisonment for eac h c harge 

 ( b ) Non-syndicated stolen/misappropriated credit card offences : 12 to 18 months’ imprisonment for eac h c harge 

Mitigating and aggravating fac tors should then be assessed in dec iding whether they should be allowed to tip the balanc e so that the sentenc e is disc ounted or enhanc ed ac c ordingly. The adoption of a spec trum of sentenc ing options for first time offenders will permit c onsideration to be duly ac c orded to the many and varied imponderables that inevitably figure in the sentenc ing equation. 

**The present appeal in relation to the s 420 cheating charge** 

76     Non-syndic ated misappropriated c redit c ard offenc es c onstitute the subjec t matter of the present c ase. A starting point of 12 months’ imprisonment is the appropriate benc hmark. 

77     In this respec t, I noted that the value of the fraudulent purc hases made by the respondent amounted to $6,007.82 (inc luding the c harges taken into c onsideration). This is not an insubstantial amount. The respondent had also made no less than four attempts at the fraudulent use of the misappropriated c redit c ard and had only stopped on the fourth attempt bec ause the c redit c ard was rejec ted. 

78     The distric t judge was c learly impressed and persuaded by the respondent’s plaintive plea that the offenc es were the result of a “momentary indisc retion”; no benefit was derived by him; and no loss was oc c asioned to anyone. With all due respec t, if this is indeed to be c onstrued as a folly from a “momentary indisc retion”, it was a rather long “moment”. The respondent appears to have embarked on an extended shopping binge and stopped, not bec ause he was plagued by pangs of guilt, but bec ause the last transac tion was literally bloc ked by the issuing bank. I agree with the prosec ution’s submission that in light of the two c harges proc eeded against the ac c used and three other c harges 


that had to be taken into ac c ount for sentenc ing purposes, the respondent’s infrac tions c annot be deemed a ‘one-off’ or isolated transgression. This was nothing less than a disturbing spate of c alc ulated c onduc t redolent of avaric e and c allousness. What prevented him from returning the c ard to Ms Sanderson when he knew she was the rightful owner? Why did he embark on a series of extravagant purc hases in a state of frenzy? It was c learly his intention to take full advantage of his short transit stop to maximise his returns and then quietly slip out of the jurisdic tion. The intention to c ommit the offenc es was assuredly not formed on the spur of the moment. It must have been perc olating while he was in flight, after he misappropriated the c ard. That he selec ted items of substantial value and made several quic k suc c essive purc hases is testament to a c alc ulated and premeditated c onduc t. 

79     I find his c onduc t in seeking to take advantage of his short transit stay in Singapore and thereafter attempting to literally take ‘flight’ troubling. A c lear, unequivoc al signal must be sent to all would be offenders enjoying a transit stop in Changi Airport that any attempt whatsoever to c ommit c redit c ard fraud during their transit stay will entail a severe penalty. Millions of passengers use Singapore’s international airport as a transit hub and this fac ility and hospitality must not be abused to provide a platform for c riminal ac tivities. The emergenc e of c redit c ard fraud at shops loc ated at Changi Airport’s terminals c an only result in financ ial losses, warranting additional sec urity measures and inc onvenienc e all round. It may in time also damage the reputation of the airport as a transit hub. This is unthinkable. 

80     I should also add for the sake of c ompleteness that the respondent’s age in this c ase affords limited mitigating value. Youth provides neither a c riminal c rutc h to lean on nor a lic ense to deliberately c ommit offenc es. 

81     The trial judge ac c orded c onsiderable mitigating value to the respondent’s early plea of guilt, c oupled with his full and c omplete c o-operation with the polic e investigations. However, the c irc umstanc es of the respondent’s arrest – given that the respondent was apprehended with the fraudulent purc hases and misappropriated c redit c ard on his person – raised, initially, dubious questions about his remorse; the c ase against him was overwhelming to say the least; a foregone c onc lusion, one might say. The relianc e on the early plea of guilt and c o-operation with the polic e _per se_ was therefore insuffic ient by itself to reflec t true remorse. In a remorse-based approac h, only a genuine finding of remorse c an warrant a disc ount in sentenc e: see above at [50] to [53]. I did, however, after c areful c onsideration ac c ept Mr Peter Fernando’s persuasive plea on behalf of the respondent that he is now c ontrite and fully ac knowledges his mistake. 

82     Having assessed a two-month term of imprisonment for these c redit c ard frauds as wholly inadequate, I have nevertheless determined that the benc hmark sentenc e of 12 months admittedly be disc ounted to take into ac c ount c ertain mitigating fac tors. While the offenc es were pre-meditated in nature, they were c ommitted without any proper planning and c learly lac ked any measure of sophistic ation. 

83     Further, the respondent’s personal c irc umstanc es in this partic ular c ase should also be taken into ac c ount in assessing the appropriate sentenc e. The respondent’s relative youthfulness (albeit of limited mitigating value _per se_ ), his lac k of antec edents as well as a good family bac kground and upbringing point to a higher amenability to rehabilitation and a c orrespondingly lower nec essity for spec ific deterrenc e. A disc ount from the benc hmark sentenc e was therefore justified. The fac t that no loss was oc c asioned was also a relevant though not dec isive c onsideration: see [49] and [50] above. I also made an allowanc e for the fac t that he had been released from prison c ustody before the sentenc e was enhanc ed. 


84     For the above reasons, I enhanc ed the sentenc e of two months’ imprisonment to six months’ imprisonment for the s 420 c harge of c heating with a misappropriated c redit c ard. 

**The criminal misappropriation charge under s 403 of the Penal Code** 

85     The c ase law for c riminal misappropriation c harges seems relatively c onsistent in c ontradistinc tion to the s 420 authorities. The prosec ution highlighted two relevant c ases in its submissions on sentenc e. These c ases, bec ause they are by and large fac tually similar to the present c ase, afford useful guidelines for the imposition of a sentenc e for the respondent’s c harge pursuant to s 403 of the Penal Code. 

86     In the c ase of _Fadilah bte Omar_ ([24] _supra_ ), the 16-year-old ac c used had misappropriated a c redit c ard that she had found in a toilet. She pleaded guilty to one c ount of c riminal misappropriation and two months’ imprisonment was imposed. The sec ond c ase c ited is the unreported c ase of _Siti Nor Anin Binti Tugiman_ (Distric t Arrest Case No 10126 of 2006 & ors). There, the 20-year-old ac c used had misappropriated a c redit c ard whilst working as a c ashier. She had similarly pleaded guilty to one c ount of c riminal misappropriation and was sentenc ed to three months’ imprisonment. I regard sentenc es of imprisonment in the range of two to six months as an appropriate benc hmark for first offenders. 

87     Given the fac ts of the present c ase, I was of the view that a two months’ imprisonment term for the s 403 of the Penal Code c riminal misappropriation offenc e was proportionate to his c ulpability and provide suffic ient deterrenc e and value. I therefore enhanc ed the sentenc e of two weeks’ imprisonment imposed by the trial judge to two months’ imprisonment, to run c onc urrently with the sentenc e imposed for the s 420 c harge. 

**Conclusion** 

88     The sentenc es imposed by the distric t judge were manifestly inadequate. Offenc es involving c redit c ards inevitably warrant severe treatment, save in exc eptional c ases. Given the pre-eminenc e and pervasiveness of c redit c ards as a preferred mode of payment in day to day c ommerc e, suc h rec urrent offenc es threaten to grievously undermine both its reliability as a mode of payment as well as the entire sec urity of our c redit infrastruc ture. An enormous amount of time, money and effort is unnec essarily expended by financ ial institutions and authorities in c ombating suc h fraud. Suc h offenc es, if left unc hec ked, would be akin to a slow drip of a subtle but potent poison that will inexorably and irremediably damage Singapore’s standing both as a financ ial hub as well as a preferred c entre of c ommerc e. Further, as a key global financ ial player, Singapore bears international responsibility in ensuring that it does not afford a platform either for the launc h or perpetration of this genre of fraud. Financ ial institutions fac e a c onstant and relentless struggle eac h and every time a sec urity risk posed by a c redit c ard fraudster surfac es. Indeed, the entire c redit c ard holding c ommunity bears the brunt, both financ ial and the inc alc ulable inc onvenienc e, whenever suc h an offenc e rears its ugly hydra head. The pric e of sec urity is unstinting vigilanc e and the unflinc hing imposition of appropriately stiff sentenc es in dealing with transgressions. Offenders must expec t to fac e harsh c ustodial sentenc es; general deterrenc e is a vital if not paramount c onsideration in assessing how severe the sentenc e should be in any given c ase. 

89     In the result, I made the following orders: 

 (a) Offenc e of c riminal misappropriation (Distric t Arrest Case No 52684 of 2006): sentenc e of two weeks’ imprisonment to be enhanc ed to two months’ imprisonment; 


 (b) Offenc e of c heating (Distric t Arrest Case No 52683 of 2006): sentenc e of two months’ imprisonment to be enhanc ed to six months’ imprisonment; 

 (c ) Both sentenc es are to run c onc urrently and c ommenc e from 18 November 2006. The period that the ac c used has been released (i.e. 8 to 12 January 2006) is not to be added on to this sentenc e. 

90     Finally, I would like to thank c ounsel for their assistanc e in this matter. While some of their arguments did not resonate with me, I nevertheless found them helpful. Considerable effort and diligenc e had c learly gone into the preparation of the c ases on both sides. In partic ular, I would like to c ommend Mr Peter Fernando, c ounsel for the respondent, for the c larity and c ogenc y of his advoc ac y as well as the even-handed manner in whic h he vigorously pressed his c lient’s c ause. While he may have not have suc c eeded in c onvinc ing me of the merits of his c lient’s c ause, I c ommend him for more than suc c essfully disc harging his obligations to the c ourt and to his c lient.
