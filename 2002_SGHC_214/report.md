## Judgment Cur Adv Vult 

### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

1\. This is a sequel to Suit No. 1777 of 1999, a c ase c onc erning a fire that oc c urred on 20 February 1999 at Senang Cresc ent. In the trial of Suit No. 1777 of 1999 the owners and oc c upiers of No. 23 Senang Cresc ent sued the owners of the next door premises, No. 25 (the first defendants), t he tenants who oc c upied the top floor of No. 25 (the sec ond defendants), and the sub-tenants of the sec ond defendants who oc c upied the lower floor of No. 25 (the third defendants). The c auses of ac tion in that suit were based on negligenc e as well as under the rule in _Rylands v Fletcher_. The c laim against the first and sec ond defendants were dismissed at the c lose of the plaintiffs’ c ase. It was found that no liability attac hed to the owners and tenants in law on the c ase pleaded. The c laim against the third defendants (who elec ted to c all evidenc e) was allowed. The plaintiffs there appealed against the dismissal of their c laim against the first and sec ond defendants. The third defendants appealed against the finding of liability against them. Both appeals were subsequently dismissed by the Court of Appeal. 

2\. In the present ac tion, the first, sec ond, and third plaintiffs alleged that they were the oc c upiers of No. 21, 35 and 37 Senang Cresc ent respec tively at the material time, namely 20 February 1999. These were the premises behind No. 23 and No. 25. The fourth, fifth and sixth plaintiffs alleged that they were the owners of No. 21, 35 and 37 of Senang Cresc ent respec tively. 


The defendants in this ac tion were the owners of No. 25 (the first defendants in the previous suit). Their tenants, and more importantly, the sub-tenants who were found liable in Suit No. 1777 of 1999 were not joined as parties in the present Suit. Mr. Gn, c ounsel for the present plaintiffs (and who also represented the plaintiffs in Suit No. 1777 of 1999) informed the c ourt that the sub-tenants are not being sued bec ause they have no means of making payment should they be found liable. Mr. Gn also stated that the present c laim was brought by way of subrogation by the insuranc e c ompany of the plaintiffs. The c auses of ac tion in the present ac tion are based on the rule in _Rylands v Fletcher_ , negligenc e and nuisanc e. At the outset, c ounsel withdrew the c laim based on the rule in _Rylands v Fletcher_. For c ompleteness, it should be noted that in the previous ac tion in Suit No. 1777 of 1999 the plaintiffs there did not sue in nuisanc e. 

3\. In view of the c onnec tion with the fac ts in Suit No. 1777 of 1999, c ounsel were asked if they c ould agree fac ts and evidenc e to expedite the trial. However, c ounsel after c onferring with eac h other, were only able to agree that there was a fire at No. 23 and No. 25 Senang Cresc ent on 20 February 1999 and that the fire started at the front yard of No. 25. 

4\. Mr. Gn advanc ed the present c ase on the basis of only one point. He submitted that the three fuse wires found in the fuse holder in No. 25 Senang Cresc ent after the fire, had been tampered with as early as 1978, but c ertainly before the tenants (in Suit No. 1777 of 1999) began their tenanc y. His entire c ase was c onstruc ted on the following premises. First, the fire was c aused by the esc ape of elec tric ity "through the elec tric al fuses and found its way into the front yard of No. 25." Sec ondly, the fuses were tampered or up-rated. Thirdly, the defendants failed to inspec t the fuse holder, or maintain proper fuses in the holder before handing the premises over to their tenants (in the c ase presently pleaded, the tenants referred to were the sec ond defendants in Suit No. 1777 of 1999). The statement of c laim elaborated on a number of other partic ulars of negligenc e but they fall essentially within the three broad c ategories that I have just set out. I shall have to revert to the plaintiffs' pleadings shortly. 

5\. Signific antly, none of the plaintiffs gave evidenc e at all. The only witnesses c alled on their behalf were a c ouple of c lerks to produc e c ertified true c opies of c ertific ates of titles in respec t of 21, 35 and 37 Senang Cresc ent, as well as a c ouple of loss adjusters testifying that they spoke to some of the plaintiffs who c laim to be owners or oc c upiers of the said premises. One of them, Mr. Yeo Pec k Hong admitted that he had no personal knowledge but had formed his opinion on the basis that he had seen invoic es and insuranc e polic ies from the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs' evidenc e was mainly from Prof. Jimmy Chen and Mr. Tan Jin Thong, the two experts who gave expert evidenc e in the trial of Suit No. 1777 of 1999, as well as Mr. Yee Kum Choon who gave evidenc e in that same suit as a witness of fac t, but returning in this trial to give expert evidenc e on the size of wires. I overruled Mr. Cheong's objec tion to Mr. Yee being c alled as suc h, and I am mindful of the pec uliar nature of suc h evidenc e, and whether there is suc h a person who c an be c alled a "wire expert". Consequently, I am of the view that the evidenc e will be permitted, but whether it amounts to anything is a matter for submission. Another expert, Dr. Jonathan Lloyd was c alled to give evidenc e as to the c ause of the c ondition of the three strands of wires found in the fuse holder in 25 Senang Cresc ent. He was of the view that the brittleness of the wires was due to heat c reated by an elec tric al c urrent (as opposed to direc t external heat). The plaintiffs' evidenc e was that the measurement of the diameter of the wires was 0.71mm (and not, c ounsel c onc eded, 0.75mm as Mr. Yee Kum Choon testified in the previous trial). Also relying, in part, on the evidenc e of Mr. Ng Kong, a direc tor of the Energy Market Authority, that after 1 September 1978 the old Imperial gauge wires were offic ially to be replac ed by new metric gauge (0.75mm) wires, Mr. Gn then put the plaintiffs' c ase on the basis that the wires must have been c hanged before 1 September 1978. He next relied on the obviously hearsay evidenc e of Mr. Lu Hui Huang, who had oc c upied the upper floor of 25 Senang Cresc ent sometime from November 1987 to May 1994 when he moved next door to 23 Senang Cresc ent. He said that he 


notic ed that the lower floor was ‘unoc c upied by tenants’ for a c ouple of weeks in July 1988 and January 1989. He admitted under c ross-examination that he did not know whether the premises were let out during the period whic h he said the premises at 25 Senang Cresc ent were unoc c upied. 

6\. Mr. Gn c onstruc ted his c ase on the basis of the evidenc e above. He submitted that three "tampered, rewired, and up-rated elec tric al fuses c onstituted [a] fire hazard". The fuses served the wire that had short-c irc uited in the front yard of 25 Senang Cresc ent. Between 1979 and 1999 the defendants were in c ontrol of the lower floor of those premises. The fire started in the front yard of 25 Senang Cresc ent. The defendants are therefore liable, in nuisanc e and negligenc e, bec ause they "repeatedly let out the premises without c hec king and rec tifying the elec tric al fire hazards". 

7\. At the c lose of the plaintiffs' c ase Mr. Cheong, c ounsel for the defendants, applied for leave to submit no c ase to answer without being put to elec tion that no evidenc e will be c alled on behalf of the defendants. He produc ed a Prac tic e Note entitled _Submitting 'No Case To Answer'_ whic h is reproduc ed in [1932] MLJ 61 whic h reports that the Registrar of the Supreme Court, in answer to an inquiry by the Law Soc iety, replied that the Counc il of Judges (in Singapore) had ruled that we should adopt the same prac tic e as that in the King's Benc h Division in England, as opposed to the prac tic e in the Chanc ery Division in whic h a defendant making a submission of no c ase to answer is put to elec tion. However, Mr. Cheong c onc eded that in rec ent times, the Court of Appeal had ruled otherwise. In _Tan Song Gou v Goh Ya Tian_ [1983] 1 MLJ 60, 62 the opinion of the trial judge was approved by the Court of Appeal in the following passage: "We agree with the observation of Lai Kew Chai J. that the proper prac tic e, if c ounsel for a defendant wishes to make a submission of no c ase to answer, is for the judge to refuse to rule on it unless c ounsel elec ts to c all no evidenc e". In the more rec ent c ase of _Central bank of India v Hemant Govindaprasad Bansal_ <span class="citation">[2002] 3 SLR 190</span>, 196 Rajendran J was also of the view that the defendant must be put to elec tion. Mr. Cheong submitted that the Prac tic e Note of 1932 was not brought to the attention of the c ourts in the c ases c ited. Furthermore, he relied on Australian authorities that appear to favour the King's Benc h prac tic e in holding that the c ourt has a disc retion not to put the defendant to elec tion. _Rasomen v Shell_ (1996) 142 ALR 135 was c ited in support. Notwithstanding that the Prac tic e Note of 1932 (on a dec ision made in 1930) emanated from the Counc il of Judges, a High Court judge is bound by the dec isions of the Court of Appeal. In this regard, it was not nec essary for me to express any further view on this issue, and ac c ordingly, I ruled that I would not hear a submission of no c ase to meet unless the defendants elec t not to c all evidenc e. Consequently, Mr Cheong dec lined to make a submission of no c ase to meet. 

8\. Only two witnesses were c alled on behalf of the defendants. The first was Mr. Lee Hoc k Chuan, the youngest son of the owner of 25 Senang Cresc ent who testified that after his father's death he took over the management of the premises. The other plaintiffs are his siblings. He testified that as far as he knew, the premises were let out to tenants ever sinc e they were purc hased in 1970. The date of purc hase was not c hallenged but Mr. Gn pointed out that the various tenanc y agreements produc ed by the defendants appear to overlap. He submitted that the inferenc e must be that the previous tenant had moved out before the new tenanc y took effec t. This was denied by Mr. Lee. In my view, the mere overlap does not mean that the premises were left untenanted although there may be a week or two in whic h they were unoc c upied. On the evidenc e, I am unable to find that there were any period of time in whic h the defendants had exc lusive right of possession of the premises in 25 Senang Cresc ent, or that the premises were indeed left unoc c upied for any period. The evidenc e from Mr. Lu is unreliable, and the inferenc e that Mr. Gn wants me to draw from the tenanc y agreements is too tenuous. 

9\. There are a great deal more problems in the plaintiffs' c ase. First, to suc c eed in nuisanc e or negligenc e, the plaintiff must prove damage. In this c ase damage was not even pleaded save that the 


statement of c laim prays for spec ific sums in respec t of eac h plaintiff with no partic ulars as to the type or nature of damage. This is inadequate. A plaintiff c annot merely pray for a spec ific sum of money (for example, $65,487.85 for the first plaintiff in this c ase) without telling the defendant (and the c ourt) what the damage was. It was left to Mr. Gn to inform me from the Bar (therefore, of no evidential value so far as the merits of the c ase are c onc erned) that the damage to the plaintiffs was not c aused by direc t fire but by heat c aused by the fire. Counsel did not even tell me whether the resulting damage was to the premises (and if so, where) or to c hattels (and if so, what). It is no answer for him to say that the registry had fixed the matter for trial on liability only with damages to be assessed at a later date. That is c learly a c onfusion between damage and damages. The latter is relevant only when the former has been pleaded and proved. 

10\. Furthermore, a plaintiff who sues in private nuisanc e must first prove that he has an interest in land bec ause nuisanc e is a tort against land. See _The Law of Torts_ , Common Law Series, 2002 Ed, Ch 22 page 901 for a detailed historic al bac kground to this tort. Whatever the plaintiff may rec over from the defendant depends on the interest that he (the plaintiff ) has. Henc e, the lic ensee in _Malone v Laskey_ [1907] 2 KB 141 was held to have insuffic ient interest in land to sue the next door oc c upier in nuisanc e. It follows that the plaintiffs must plead and adduc e evidenc e of their respec tive interests in land. The c ase for the first, sec ond, and third plaintiffs in this c ase must fail from the outset bec ause they c laim as 'oc c upiers'. That is c learly insuffic ient. The fourth, fifth, and sixth plaintiffs c laim as owners. Not a single affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief was filed by any one of the six plaintiffs. If the owner is not in oc c upation, then he c an only suc c eed if he c an show that he had a right of immediate possession, or that he suffered damage in respec t of his reversionary interest. See _Shelfer v City of London Electric Lighting Co_ [1895] 1 Ch 287, 312, per Lindley LJ. Nothing to this effec t was pleaded nor proved. The c ertified true c opies of title deeds produc ed by the solic itor's c lerk only prove ownership at best, but, as I said, mere ownership is not suffic ient, espec ially where, as in this c ase, it is not known who had possession or right to immediate possession of the premises known as 21, 35, and 37 Senang Cresc ent. The c ertific ates also show that the properties were mortgaged at the material time. 

11\. Thus, the c laim by the fourth, fifth and sixth plaintiffs must also fail. The plaintiffs' basis for asserting that the defendants are liable in negligenc e in not c hec king or maintaining the fuse holder must fail on the c ase as presented by Mr. Gn - whic h was that the defendants had a window period in whic h they had the right to exc lusive possession (although Mr. Gn used the term 'having possession and c ontrol'). Even if the defendants had exc lusive possession at a relevant time, there is yet another fundamental reason why the plaintiffs' c laim in negligenc e must fail. There is no basis for finding a duty of c are on the part of an owner, to third parties, to make periodic c hec ks on the elec tric al system of his premises. The duties and obligations of the landlord are owed to his tenant. To suc c eed in negligenc e against the landlord, a third party has to prove a spec ific duty of c are. Generally, the duty of c are in negligenc e does not inc lude ac ts of omission, whic h is essentially the c ase presented by Mr. Gn against the defendants. Thus, his relianc e on _Virco Metal Industrial Pte Ltd v Carltech Trading & Industries Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2000] 2 SLR 201</span> is misplac ed bec ause the fac ts are entirely different. The faulty power switc h there was installed by the defendants in that c ase. In the present c ase, the breac h of duty alleged was in failing to find out that there was a faulty fuse. There is more. Mr. Gn adduc ed no evidenc e to show that the fuse holder was faulty and that it was that fuse holder that c aused the fire. I had asked if parties were able to agree fac ts at the beginning of this trial, but no material fac ts were agreed other than that a fire started in the front yard of 25 Senang Cresc ent on 20 February 1999. That being so, the plaintiffs were obliged to prove their c ase with evidenc e. Mr. Gn sought to rely on the findings of fac t in the grounds of judgment in Suit No. 1777 of 1999. The findings of fac t are not evidenc e in this regard - it is merely the opinion of a c ourt as to what fac ts he thought existed in the c ase upon whic h he was trying. They c annot be used as evidenc e to prove primary fac ts that are inc umbent upon a party to prove in another trial. In a separate and 


independent trial, evidenc e, unless agreed, must be properly adduc ed to prove what the parties have to prove. 

12\. Finally, I must address the point in respec t of what Mr Gn c alled the 'fresh evidenc e'. I am inc lined to agree with the opinion of Mr. Mullen that we c annot c onc lude that the three fuses were inst alled prior to 1978 just by examining the measurement alone. Even if the measurement was c orrec tly taken, of whic h there is some doubt, espec ially sinc e the measurement had been taken in the previous trial and put to the c ourt (by the same experts for the plaintiffs) to be of a different gauge, one c annot draw the inferenc e that it must have been installed prior to 1978. Assuming that the regulations required new metric gauge wires after 1 September 1978, old wires that were still in stoc k might still have been used as Mr Mullen also observed. The plaintiffs' witnesses c onfirmed that suc h c hanges c an be performed by any handyman and no inspec tion or testing is required to be made by the authorities c onc erned. In any event, even if the wires were installed prior to 1978, they would have been approved wires then. There is no evidenc e that the regulators required all suc h wires to be c hanged to the new metric ones. Henc e, it is also entirely plausible that the wires might already have been c hanged in 1970 when the defendants bought the premises. There is also no evidenc e that the three fuses were in c ontravention of any statutory regulation or guideline. In any event, Mr. Gn c onc edes that the plaintiffs' c ase was not made on the basis of a negligent ac t of installation, but on an omission to c hec k. I have already stated above that there is, in my opinion, no suc h duty in law applic able to the fac ts of this c ase. 

13\. For the reasons above, the plaintiffs' c laim is dismissed with c osts to be taxed if not agreed.
