1       This is an ac tion brought by the plaintiffs against the defendant (“FFC”) seeking various reliefs from its breac h of a Lic enc e Agreement (“the Agreement”) for the use of premises known as Stall No 10 at Bloc k 624, Choa Chu Kang Street 62, Singapore 689142 (“the Yew Tee Stall”). 

2       The ac tion was begun by the first plaintiff (“Seah”) but at the trial the sec ond plaintiff (“Wee”) joined in the ac tion as a previously undisc losed princ ipal. Wee is Seah’s wife. I shall therefore refer to them c ollec tively as “the plaintiffs” exc ept where it is nec essary to differentiate between them. 

3       FFC has filed a c ounterc laim for $31,201.45 for sums whic h it alleges are owing in respec t of Stall No 14A at 55 Sungei Kadut Street 1, Singapore 729358 (“the Sungei Kadut Stall”). 

**The facts** 

4       The plaintiffs own and operate the “Yu Kee” c hain of duc k ric e stalls in Singapore. 


5       On or about 1 April 2003, following earlier negotiations with FFC, Seah signed a “Letter of Offer” prepared by FFC c onfirming his intention to enter into a three-year fixed term “Lic enc e Agreement” in respec t of the Yew Tee Stall. The said “Letter of Offer” set out detailed terms in respec t of the plaintiffs’ use of the Yew Tee Stall and expressly provides, at c l 16.2 that: 

 Pending the exec ution of the Lic enc e Agreement, the Lic ensee [plaintiffs] shall be bound by the provisions of this Letter of Offer and the Lic enc e Agreement as if the latter had been duly exec uted PROVIDED THAT if any term in the Letter of Offer and the c orresponding term in the Lic enc e Agreement are inc onsistent, the term c ontained in this Letter of Offer shall prevail. 

6       On 29 April 2003, Seah rec eived a letter from FFC informing him that the Agreement had been prepared by its solic itors and giving instruc tions in relation to the exec ution of the Agreement. Ac c ording to Seah, he subsequently rec eived the Agreement from FFC’s property agent, Calvin Yeo Kia Seng (“Calvin Yeo”), signed it and returned it with the following c heques due under the Agreement: 

 (a) Balanc e Sec urity Deposit, under c l 3.1 of the Agreement – amounting to $8,000 – the initial sum of $10,000 having been paid earlier. 

 (b) Renovation Contribution, under c l 2.3.1, amounting to $42,000. 

7       Seah also rec eived a bill from FFC’s solic itors for preparation of the Agreement. Under c l 13.4(a) of the Agreement, the plaintiffs were required to pay the legal fees in relation to the preparation of the Agreement. Seah duly paid the said bill. 

8       By a subsequent letter dated 21 Oc tober 2003 to Seah, FFC c onfirmed as follows: 

 We refer to the Lic enc e Agreement dated 10/7/2003 made between us and you. 

 We write to c onfirm that your lic ense [ sic ] period for Stall No. 10 at Blk 624, Choa Chu Kang St. 62, #02-222/224, Singapore 689142 [the Yew Tee Stall] c ommenc ed with effec tive [ sic ] from 22/08/2003. 

9       By c l 2.1 of the Agreement, the monthly fee was c harged at the rate of 21% of the monthly turnover for the Yew Tee Stall, subjec t to a minimum fee of 21% of $29,000 ( _ie_ , $6,090) and a c ap of 21% of $48,000 ( _ie_ , $10,080). On or about 20 January 2004, Seah rec eived a fax from FFC by whic h it purported unilaterally to remove the fee c ap. 

10     On 15 Marc h 2004, long after the Agreement took effec t, FFC wrote to Seah alleging that Seah had promised it at the time he signed the Agreement that “the stall operation at [the Yew Tee Stall] would be tied up with business operation at [the Sungei Kadut Stall]”. 

11     Subsequently, by an undated letter entitled “Notic e to Quit” whic h was sent around April 2005, FFC purported to give Seah notic e to c ease all operations at the food stall “latest by 15 April 2005”. 

12     By a letter dated 12 April 2005, the plaintiffs’ solic itors informed FFC that any attempt prematurely to evic t the plaintiffs from the Yew Tee Stall before expiry of the three-year term in August 2006 would be unlawful. Despite the said letter, at around 1pm on 15 April 2005, FFC terminated the elec tric ity supply to the Yew Tee Stall. Almost immediately, the plaintiffs’ solic itors wrote to FFC giving it 24 hours’ notic e to reinstate the elec tric ity supply, “failing whic h [Seah] shall have no c hoic e but to c ommenc e the nec essary legal proc eedings to protec t his business and 


c ommerc ial interests”. The letter also expressed the hope that “good sense and fair play will prevail and thus obviate the need for litigation”. 

13     FFC failed to reinstate the elec tric ity supply to the Yew Tee Stall. Instead, shortly after 2pm on 15 April 2005, FFC’s solic itors wrote to the plaintiffs’ solic itors alleging that FFC had validly terminated the Agreement bec ause the Agreement was allegedly given on c ondition that the plaintiffs would c ontinue to c onc urrently operate the Sungei Kadut Stall. 

14     The plaintiffs denied that there was any agreement linking the operation of the Yew Tee Stall with the Sungei Kadut Stall. 

15     At the time FFC terminated the Agreement on 15 April 2005, it had retained all the plaintiffs’ sales proc eeds from the Yew Tee Stall for the period 1 Marc h 2005 to 15 April 2005. FFC also purported to forfeit the plaintiffs’ sec urity deposit of $18,000 under the Agreement. In addition, FFC retained all the plaintiffs’ equipment, goods and effec ts at the Yew Tee Stall. 

16     The present proc eedings c ommenc ed on 2 June 2005. By the c laim herein, the plaintiffs seek the following relief: 

 (a) Damages in the sum of $204,914.98 for repudiation of the Agreement in respec t of the period 16 April 2005 to 21 August 2006. 

 (b) An ac c ount of the total c ash c ollec ted by FFC from the sales at the Yew Tee Stall for the period 1 Marc h 2005 to 15 April 2006 under c l 7.7 of the Agreement. 

 (c ) A refund of the sec urity deposit sum of $18,000. 

 (d) The sum of $30,574.73 being the overc harged Lic enc e Fees for the period February 2004 till February 2005. 

 (e) Damages for c onversion of the plaintiffs’ equipment, goods and effec ts at the Yew Tee Stall. 

 (f) Interest and legal c osts. 

17     The defenc e, in essenc e, is that the written Agreement has no applic ation at all bec ause FFC did not sign it. Alternatively, FFC asserts that the Agreement is subjec t to oral c onditions agreed between the parties (“the Oral Conditions”). Further, in the alternative, FFC pleads that it was entitled to terminate the Agreement in April 2005 on ac c ount of the c onduc t of the plaintiffs’ employee who, it is alleged, had in Oc tober 2003 and May 2004 dishonestly omitted to key into the c ash register transac tions amounting to $3. 

18     FFC also asserts that the plaintiffs’ c omputation of damages is inc orrec t. FFC has also belatedly filed a c ounterc laim for $31,201.45 for sums allegedly outstanding in respec t of the Sungei Kadut Stall. 

**The issues** 

19     The issues are: 

 (a) Whether FFC has wrongfully repudiated the Agreement (“Issue 1”). As to this, the following sub-issues arise: 


 (i) Whether the Agreement is applic able at all. 

 (ii) If the Agreement is applic able, is it unenforc eable on ac c ount of s 6(d) of the Civil Law Ac t (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)? 

 (iii) If the Agreement is enforc eable, is it subjec t to the alleged Oral Conditions? 

 (iv) Did Seah breac h the restric tion against assignment and subletting c ontained in the Agreement as alleged by FFC? 

 (v) In the event the Agreement is subjec t to the Oral Conditions and/or Seah breac hed the restric tions against assignment and/or subletting, is FFC’s termination of the Agreement nevertheless wrongful bec ause the plaintiffs in fac t had a lease (not a lic enc e) of the Yew Tee Stall and FFC failed to serve the requisite statutory notic e under s 18(1) of the Conveyanc ing & Law of Property Ac t (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed). 

 (b) Whether the plaintiffs are the proper parties to sue for the alleged losses c laimed in this ac tion? (“Issue 2”). 

 (c ) Whether FFC is obliged to refund to the plaintiffs c ertain sums in respec t of the sales generated at the Yew Tee Stall for the period 1 Marc h 2005 to 15 April 2005? (“Issue 3”). 

 (d) Are the plaintiffs entitled to a refund of the $18,000 sec urity deposit? (“Issue 4”). 

 (e) Are the plaintiffs entitled to seek rec overy of the overc harged Lic enc e Fees for the Yew Tee Stall for the period February 2004 till February 2005? (“Issue 5”). 

 (f ) Is FFC liable for c onversion of the plaintiffs’ equipment, goods and effec ts at the Yew Tee Stall? (“Issue 6”). 

 (g) Is FFC entitled to its c ounterc laim? (“Issue 7”). 

**_Issue 1: Whether FFC has wrongfully repudiated the Agreement_** 

20     As noted above, there are sub-issues whic h have to be answered before one c an arrive at an answer to this main question. 

21     It was pleaded in the defenc e that: 

 (a) the Agreement is inapplic able; and that in any c ase, 

 (b) the Agreement is unenforc eable on ac c ount of s 6(d) of the Civil Law Ac t. 

The basis for FFC’s c ontention that the Agreement is inapplic able is that the plaintiffs were given both the Agreement and a Deed to sign simultaneously; that the plaintiffs failed to sign the Deed, returning only the Agreement duly signed; and that for that reason FFC did not return a c opy of the Agreement exec uted by FFC. In my view, this defenc e is unsustainable. 

22     Firstly, suc h a defenc e is inc onsistent with FFC’s express relianc e upon the terms of the Agreement to justify its retention of the plaintiffs’ equipment at the Yew Tee Stall. 


23     Sec ondly, FFC had, by its c onduc t and its own c ontemporaneous doc uments, c onsistently relied upon the terms of the Agreement. The following are instanc es: 

 (a) It c harged and ac c epted payment from the plaintiffs for legal fees for the preparation of the Agreement. 

 (b) In its letter of 21 Oc tober 2003, it expressly referred to the Agreement and informed the plaintiffs that the Agreement c ommenc ed with effec t from 22 August 2003. 

 (c ) In its fax of 19 January 2004, it informed the plaintiffs that it was relying upon c ll 12 and 13.8 of the same Agreement to lift the fee c ap for the Yew Tee Stall, to terminate the Agreement with immediate effec t and to replac e the Agreement with a “temporary tenanc y agreement”. 

 (d) In its letter of 18 Marc h 2004, it again referred to the Agreement. 

 (e) Following FFC’s termination of the plaintiffs’ operation of the Yew Tee Stall, even FFC’s solic itors expressly referred to and relied upon c ll 12.1, 12.6, 13.4, 13.9 and 13.10 of the Agreement. 

24     Thirdly, Jason Lim Chye Teng (“Jason Lim”) (a partner in FFC) c onc eded that the Agreement had applic ation although (ac c ording to him) subjec t to the Oral Conditions. I therefore find no merit in FFC’s c ontention that the Agreement has no applic ation. 

25     FFC’s next c ontention is that the Agreement is unenforc eable on ac c ount of s 6(d) of the Civil Law Ac t. Its position is that FFC never signed the Agreement and therefore s 6(d) is not satisfied. 

26     Case law has shown that: 

 (a) Provided the doc ument relied on by the plaintiffs c ontains all the material terms, it need not have been deliberately prepared as a memorandum: Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston’s Law of Contract (Sec ond Singapore and Malaysian Edition, Butterworths, 1998) (“ Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston ”) at p 366 and c ases therein c ited. 

 (b) The requirement for writing/signature c an be satisfied via two doc uments, of whic h only one has been signed: Burgess v Cox (1950) 2 All ER 1212 Ch D. 

27     In the present c ase, it is permissible to put FFC’s letter of 21 Oc tober 2003 side by side with the unsigned Agreement. The letter of 21 Oc tober 2003 expressly refers to the Agreement and bears the signature of CK Lim, another partner of FFC. The letter further c onfirms that the plaintiffs’ lic enc e at the Yew Tee Stall c ommenc ed with effec t from 22 August 2003. In the light of this, there c an be no doubt that the writing/signature requirement in s 6(d) of the Civil Law Ac t is satisfied. 

28     It should also be noted that the effec t of a failure to c omply with the statutory requirement is that the c ontrac t is unenforc eable but not void ( _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ , vol 7 (LexisNexis, 2005) at para 80.135. Where there has been part performanc e, equity will intervene on the ground of estoppel to prevent a defendant from sheltering behind the statute. 

29     Even if the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy s 6(d) of the Civil Law Ac t, there have been more than suffic ient ac ts of part performanc e whic h are referable to the Agreement. In partic ular: 

 (a) The plaintiffs paid the deposit of $18,000 due under c l 3.1. 


 (b) The plaintiffs also forwarded to FFC 12 post-dated c heques totalling $42,000 by way of c ontribution towards the renovation c osts as required under c l 2.3.1. 

 (c ) The plaintiffs paid a monthly lic enc e fee c harged by FFC based on a formula set out in the Agreement. 

 (d) The plaintiffs paid the legal fees for the preparation of the Agreement. 

 (e) At all times, the parties c onduc ted themselves in ac c ordanc e with the terms of the Agreement. Inter alia , all sales from the Yew Tee Stall were proc essed through the c ash register at the food stall and then deposited with FFC’s designated c ashier (c onsistent with c ll 7.1, 7. and 7.5). Further, FFC then deduc ted from the monthly takings the various c harges under the Agreement and refunded the balanc e to the plaintiffs the following month (c onsistent with c l 7.7). 

For the above reasons, the defenc e based on alleged non-c omplianc e with s 6(d) of the Civil Law Ac t must fail. 

30     I move on to c onsider the next sub-issue, _viz_ , whether the Agreement was subjec t to the alleged Oral Conditions. It will be nec essary to review the evidenc e and the key planks in FFC’s c ase in this regard. At the trial FFC’s c ase was that: 

 (a) In January 2003, Jason Lim and Seah reac hed an agreement for Seah to run both the Sungei Kadut Stall and the Yew Tee Stall. The terms for the operation of the Sungei Kadut Stall and the Yew Tee Stall were disc ussed and agreed at the same time at the parties’ first meeting in January 2003. 

 (b) As part of the agreement reac hed in January 2003, Seah agreed that if he terminated the operation of the Sungei Kadut Stall, FFC c ould terminate the operation of the Yew Tee Stall. 

 (c ) Seah further agreed that, if he terminated the operation of the Sungei Kadut Stall, FFC was free to lift the fee c ap for the Yew Tee Stall. 

 (d) FFC then prepared, in July 2003, both a Lic enc e Agreement and a Deed whic h it handed over to Seah’s representative Lim Fah Choy. Thereafter Lim Fah Choy returned only the signed Agreement but not the Deed. 

 (e) In January 2004, bec ause Seah terminated the operation of the Sungei Kadut Stall, FFC was free to lift the fee c ap for the Yew Tee Stall and also to terminate the operation of the Yew Tee Stall at any time thereafter. 

31     I ac c ept the submissions of the plaintiffs’ c ounsel that the overwhelming weight of the evidenc e is against FFC’s c ase outlined above. The reasons are as set out in the following paragraphs. 

32     Firstly, FFC’s c ase at trial was c ompletely at odds with the version and the c hronology set out in its originally pleaded defenc e. In FFC’s original defenc e, it pleaded that the parties had first agreed on the Sungei Kadut Tenanc y and that it was only “thereafter” ( _ie_ , after Seah’s representative had exec uted the tenanc y agreement for Sungei Kadut) that Seah bec ame “desirous” of taking up the Yew Tee Stall. Clearly, this c hronology and version is c ompletely inc onsistent with FFC’s version at trial that Jason Lim and Seah had disc ussed and agreed on the terms for the operation of both the 


Sungei Kadut Stall and the Yew Tee Stall at the same time in January 2003. Jason Lim initially refused to ac c ept that there was an inc onsistenc y but eventually did so when pressed. 

33     Sec ondly, quite apart from the inc onsistenc y, equally troublesome is the fac t that FFC’s original defenc e omitted any mention of: 

 (a) the Deed having been prepared and given to the plaintiffs; 

 (b) the alleged efforts of the operations manager of FFC, Mic hael Lim Chuan Hoong (“Mic hael Lim”) in c hasing the plaintiffs to sign the Deed; and 

 (c ) Seah’s alleged oral c onfirmation to Mic hael Lim that he would honour the tying of the Sungei Kadut Stall to the Yew Tee Stall. 

34     These are fundamental and c ruc ial points whic h, if true, would have been c overed in the pleadings from the beginning. 

35     There is yet another fundamental inc onsistenc y in FFC’s c ase. Whereas FFC’s evidenc e at trial was that the lic enc es for the Sungei Kadut Stall and Yew Tee Stall were disc ussed at the same time and the agreement tying the two was reac hed in January 2003, its position in its original defenc e and further and better partic ulars was that the lic enc e for the Sungei Kadut Stall was agreed first, that disc ussions relating to the Yew Tee Stall followed thereafter and that the link between the two stalls was agreed to only in July 2003 ( _ie_ , about four months after the plaintiffs began operating the Sungei Kadut Stall). 

36     Apart from the fundamental inc onsistenc ies between FFC’s c ase at trial in regard to the alleged Oral Conditions and that in the original pleadings and the further and better partic ulars, what was not explained was why the Oral Conditions were not reduc ed into writing. 

37     Considering that formal c ontrac ts were being drawn up and that FFC at all material times had ac c ess to lawyers and that the c osts of appointing suc h lawyers was never an issue for FFC (sinc e it would be borne by the plaintiffs), one would have expec ted that the most fundamental terms amongst the alleged Oral Conditions would be reflec ted in the c ontrac tual doc uments. Inexplic ably, they were not. 

38     Jason Lim’s evidenc e was that if Seah had signed the Deed all would have been in order. Yet, the Deed itself (assuming _arguendo_ that suc h a doc ument was indeed handed to Seah) c ontradic ts FFC’s c ase. 

39     Firstly, the Deed does not c ontain any provision that if the plaintiffs c eased to operate the Sungei Kadut Stall, FFC would be entitled to terminate the lic enc e for the Yew Tee Stall. 

40     Sec ondly, it does not c ontain any c lause that if the plaintiffs c eased to operate the Sungei Kadut Stall, FFC would be entitled to lift the fee c ap for the Yew Tee Stall. 

41     Thirdly, what the form of Deed provides is only that if the plaintiffs terminated either the Sungei Kadut Stall or Yew Tee Stall, FFC would be entitled to c laim liquidated damages from the plaintiffs for the unexpired term of the relevant agreement. There is no right to terminate the other agreement. 

42     Fourthly, the evidenc e of FFC’s solic itor, Ms Haridas Devi, was that she was never instruc ted by FFC to provide a term in the Deed matc hing FFC’s desc ription of the Oral Conditions. 


43     On FFC’s pleaded c ase that Seah breac hed c l 10.2 on “Assignment and Subletting”, I find that there was no breac h, Seah having entered into the Agreement as agent for an undisc losed princ ipal. 

44     In the result, I find that FFC wrongly repudiated the Agreement. 

**_Issue 2: Whether the plaintiffs are the proper parties to sue for the alleged losses claimed in this action_** 

_Can both the agent and the undisclosed principal bring a suit against the third party?_ 

45     As stated earlier, when the ac tion was first c ommenc ed, Seah was the sole plaintiff. On the first day of trial, c ounsel for FFC suggested to Seah that he was not the party who suffered the losses alleged to have been c aused by FFC’s repudiation of the Agreement. Seah admitted, under c ross-examination, that he was not the owner of the business at the Yew Tee Stall, I allowed Seah’s applic ation to join Wee as his undisc losed princ ipal and to amend the statement of c laim ac c ordingly. Nevertheless, FFC c ontended that the plaintiffs failed to establish a _prima facie_ c ase against it and that neither of the plaintiffs was the proper party to sue for the alleged losses. 

46     In _Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp v San’s Rent A-Car Pte Ltd_ [1994] 3 SLR 593 ( _“San’s Rent-A-Car”_ ) at [23] the Court of Appeal adopted the summary of the law on undisc losed princ ipals by Lord Lloyd of Berwic k in _Siu Yin Kwan v Eastern Insurance Co Ltd_ [1994] 2 WLR 370, whic h is as follows: 

 (1) An undisc losed princ ipal may sue and be sued on a c ontrac t made by an agent on his behalf, ac ting within the sc ope of his ac tual authority. (2) In entering into the c ontrac t, the agent must intend to ac t on the princ ipal’s behalf. (3) The agent of an undisc losed princ ipal may also sue and be sued on the c ontrac t. (4) Any defenc e whic h the third party may have against the agent is available against his princ ipal. (5) The terms of the c ontrac t may, expressly or by implic ation, exc lude the princ ipal’s right to sue, and his liability to be sued. The c ontrac t itself, or the c irc umstanc es surrounding the c ontrac t, may show that the agent is the true and only princ ipal. 

It is c lear from the above that both the undisc losed princ ipal and his agent have the c apac ity to sue and be sued on a c ontrac t entered into by the agent exc ept where the terms of the c ontrac t expressly or impliedly exc lude the princ ipal’s right to sue or his liability to be sued. The further question is whether, if either the princ ipal or the agent exerc ises his right to sue the third party, the other party is prec luded from doing the same. 

47     There are authorities whic h suggest that only one or the other may sue the third party. In this regard, _Halsbury’s Laws of England_ , vol 2(1) (LexisNexis, 4th Ed Reissue, 2003) states (at para 195) that: 

 Where an agent is entitled to sue upon a c ontrac t made by him, his right is lost by the intervention of his princ ipal, and is subjec t to any settlement with the princ ipal. An agent who has a spec ial interest in the subjec t matter of the c ontrac t may enforc e it, notwithstanding any settlement with the princ ipal, unless the agent has not been prejudic ed by the settlement, or unless he is estopped from setting up his interest against the other c ontrac ting party. 

48     What c onstitutes an “intervention” by the princ ipal? _Fridman The Law of Agency_ (6th Ed, Butterworths, 1990) (“ _Fridman_ ”) at p 241 states that: 

 First , if the principal himself sues the third party , or has otherwise intervened, by way of 


 prohibiting the agent from suing, or settling with the third party, then the agent cannot sue. The general rule is that the right of the princ ipal prevails over that of his agent and the right of the agent to enforc e the c ontrac t is destroyed by the intervention of the princ ipal in the exerc ise of his own right. In Atkinson v Cotesworth : 

 The c ommander of a ship (the agent of the owners) made a c harterparty in his own name. The owners rec eived the agreed freight from the c harterer. It was held that the agent c ould no longer maintain an ac tion for the freight. 

 But this will not prevent the agent himself from suing where he has a lien (or other interest) over the goods whic h are the subjec t-matter of the c ontrac t: for then he is protec ting his own personal advantage under the c ontrac t both against the princ ipal and the third party. [emphasis added] 

49     I also have regard to _Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston_ at p 823 whic h states: 

 Where an agent, having authority to c ontrac t on behalf of another, makes the c ontrac t in his own name, c onc ealing the fac t that he is a mere representative, the doc trine of the undisc losed princ ipal c omes into play. By this doc trine, either the agent, or the princ ipal when disc overed, may be sued; and either the agent or the principal may sue the other party to the contract. [emphasis added] 

50     Similarly, in _Halsbury’s Laws of Australia_ , vol 6 (Butterworths, 1992), it was stated (at para 110-3030) that: 

 The agent or the undisc losed princ ipal, but not both , c an sue and be sued on the c ontrac t: if the agent sues, the damages are for the loss suffered by the agent, on the footing that the agent was princ ipal. [emphasis added] 

51     Following from the authorities c ited above, it may be suggested that where an undisc losed princ ipal and his agent seek to sue a third party, only one party may bring the suit. In the instant c ase, at first blush, it may be thought that if Seah has brought the suit against FFC, Wee is prec luded from being a party to the ac tion on the basis that it is Seah’s pleaded c ase that she is his undisc losed princ ipal; as both Seah and Wee are suing FFC c onc urrently, the pleadings are bad. 

52     However, it is interesting to c ompare this position with the situation where the third party is the plaintiff. In suc h c ases, it is established law that the third party must c hoose between the princ ipal and the agent. The princ iple has been justified on the basis of merger and elec tion (but see Art 82 of _Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2006) ( _“Bowstead”_ ) generally for a disc ussion of the c onc eptual diffic ulties attendant on this apparently simple proposition). What is of interest to us is the point at whic h suc h merger or elec tion takes plac e. It is c lear that onc e _judgment_ has been given against an agent of an undisc losed princ ipal, the third party may no longer proc eed against the princ ipal: _Bowstead_ at para 8-117. What is less c lear is whether situations short of judgment c an c onstitute an elec tion or merger. In _Clarkson Booker Ltd v Andjel_ [1964] 2 QB 775, while the plaintiffs’ solic itors had threatened to proc eed against both the agent and the undisc losed princ ipal, eventually a writ was issued and served only on the princ ipal. However, when the princ ipal bec ame insolvent, the plaintiffs sought to proc eed against the agent. Willmer LJ of the Court of Appeal said at 791: 

 It is c lear that the institution of proc eedings against either agent or princ ipal is at least strong evidenc e of an elec tion suc h as, if not rebutted will prec lude subsequent proc eedings against the 


 other. In other words, it raises a prima fac ie c ase of elec tion. 

53     Willmer LJ did not spec ify what sort of evidenc e would be nec essary to refute the strong evidenc e arising from the institution of proc eedings against one party. However, in the c irc umstanc es, it was held that the plaintiffs had given c redit to the agent, as they had done over previous transac tions. Correspondenc e also demonstrated that the plaintiffs always c onsistently looked to the agent for payment. Furthermore, although the plaintiffs initially dec ided to sue the princ ipal first, the threat of proc eedings against the agent had never been withdrawn. The plaintiffs also took no further ac tion against the agents beyond the issuanc e and servic e of the writ. As suc h, the plaintiffs did not unequivoc ally elec t to sue the princ ipal rather than the agent. Russell LJ, who delivered the other speec h in this judgment, agreed with this c onc lusion along broadly similar lines. 

54     On the other hand, some other c ases have held that elec tion only oc c urs on the obtainment of judgment against either the princ ipal or the agent. In _Morgan v Lifetime Building Supplies Ltd_ (1967) 61 DLR (2d) 178, the third party sued both the undisc losed princ ipal and its agents jointly and severally. The agents did not enter an appearanc e and the third party obtained an order that entitled him to judgment against the agents and for damages to be assessed. However, at the trial, judgment was awarded against the princ ipal and the ac tion against the agents was dismissed. The princ ipal argued that the third party had already elec ted and obtained judgment against the agents. The Supreme Court of Alberta first held that the order for the third party’s entitlement to judgment was not a final judgment. It also noted at [23] that while judgment c ould not be obtained against both the princ ipal and the agent, “it is plain that it is not the suing of both princ ipal and agent that debars an ac tion against one of them. The elec tion to look to one or the other is not made until judgment has been obtained against one or the other.” In the c irc umstanc es, the third party had elec ted to look to the princ ipal and sued it to judgment after the ac tion against the agents was dismissed. 

55     I also refer to the c ase of _Petersen v Moloney_ (1951) 84 CLR 91 whic h did not involve a third party suing a princ ipal and his agent, but rather, a vendor of a house who first sued the purc haser for unpaid purc hase money but later joined her estate agent as a defendant for liability in the alternative. Judgment was obtained against the estate agent but the vendor on appeal sought to have the judgment against the estate agent set aside and entered against the purc haser instead. It was c lear to the Australian High Court that this was a c ase of alternative liability – either the estate agent or the purc haser might be liable to the vendor but not both. The c ourt said (at 102): 

 In suc h a c ase a final elec tion to treat either as liable would prec lude the plaintiff from proc eeding against the other, and it is a well-settled general princ iple that, while the commencement of an action against one of two persons alternatively liable does not, the entry of judgment against one of them does, constitute a final and irrevocable election : see Morel Bros. & Co. Ltd. v. Earl of Westmoreland. In the present c ase the plaintiff (as she was c learly entitled to do) proc eeded against both of the persons possibly liable, c laiming alternatively as against eac h. After Walker J. had pronounc ed his dec ision she entered judgment against Pulbrook [the agent]. Did this amount to a final elec tion to treat Pulbrook as liable to the exc lusion of Moloney [the purc haser]? Apart from appeal, c learly it would amount to suc h an elec tion. But the judgment was subjec t to appeal, and we do not think that the plaintiff c an, by suing in the alternative and having judgment against one defendant, be prec luded from maintaining on appeal that the judgment against that defendant should be disc harged and that judgment should go against the other defendant. This is what the plaintiff seeks on this appeal, for her notic e of appeal asks that the whole of the judgment of Walker J. should be set aside and that in lieu thereof the judgment should be against Moloney. She has never asked, or put herself in a position where she must be treated as asking, for a judgment against both defendants. Herein the c ase differs from Morel Bros. & Co. Ltd. v. Earl of Westmoreland and from Moore v. Flanagan. 


 In eac h of those c ases the plaintiff had obtained judgment against one of two defendants, of whom one but not both might have been liable, and then, without setting aside or seeking to set aside that judgment, had sought judgment against the other. This offended against the rule stated by Atkin L.J. (as he then was) in Moore v. Flanagan that “a plaintiff c annot sue an agent to judgment and then sue the princ ipal”. The plaintiff in this c ase is not offending against that rule. [emphasis added] 

56     The Americ an position is also that elec tion only arises on judgment, but it has been suggested by at least one eminent authority that even that does not go far enough. _The Restatement (Third) of Agency_ (2006) (“the _Restatement_ ”) states at § 6.09: 

 However, when an agent made a c ontrac t on behalf of an undisc losed princ ipal, it was believed that the third party c ontrac ted for only one c ause of ac tion and one judgment and must elec t between princ ipal or agent. As stated in Restatement Sec ond, Agenc y § 337, if the third party obtained a judgment against the princ ipal, the agent’s liability was disc harged. Under Restatement Sec ond, Agenc y § 210, if the third party obtained a judgment against the agent after learning of the princ ipal’s identity, the princ ipal’s liability was disc harged. 

 Although the elec tion rule is supported by many c ases, the better rule, stated in several rec ent and well-reasoned opinions and by statute in New York, is that only the satisfac tion of a judgment disc harges the liability of an undisc losed princ ipal or an agent who made a c ontrac t on behalf of an undisc losed princ ipal. The “satisfac tion” rule is c onsistent with the c ontemporary view that a judgment against one person who is liable for a loss does not terminate the c laim that the injured party may have against another party who may also be liable for the loss. See Restatement Sec ond, Judgments § 49. 

57     The rules whic h govern whether a third party c an sue both the undisc losed princ ipal and his agent should logic ally mirror the rules when the latter two parties seek to c laim against the third party. While I need not go so far as to adopt the _Restatement_ “satisfac tion” rule, I am persuaded that the authorities should be interpreted in this manner – when it is said that the agent loses his right to sue the third party on the intervention of the undisc losed princ ipal when the latter sues, this is a referenc e to “suing to judgment”. Drawing from _Morgan v Lifetime Building Supplies Ltd_ and _Petersen v Moloney_ ([53] _supra_ ), it is not inc onsistent for both the undisc losed princ ipal and the agent to sue a third party, provided that it is not c laimed that the third party is thus liable to judgment with respec t to both princ ipal and agent simultaneously. At the very least, it is c lear from _Clarkson Booker Ltd v Andjel_ ([51] _supra_ ) that the mere ac t of either the princ ipal or the agent c ommenc ing suit should not be automatic ally taken as c onc lusive evidenc e that inc onsistent rights would be exerc ised against the third party. 

58     In the instant c ase, the relevant part of the plaintiffs’ statement of c laim is as follows: 

 19A. [Seah] (as agent for [Wee], an undisc losed princ ipal) is the proper party to sue and entitled to c laim for all the losses set out above. If, whic h is denied, [Seah] is not the proper party to sue for the losses c laimed in this Statement of Claim, and/or suc h losses are not [Seah’s] losses, [Wee] maintains all the said c laims and relief. 

59     This pleading may be broken down into the following alternative situations: 

 (a) Seah c laims against FFC on the basis that he is the agent of Wee. 

 (b) Wee c laims against FFC if Seah is not the proper party to sue AND Seah has not suffered 


 loss. 

 (c ) Wee c laims against FFC if Seah is not the proper party to sue. 

 (d) Wee c laims against FFC if Seah has not suffered loss. 

60     Situations (a), (b) and (c ) above do not involve both Seah and Wee c laiming jointly against FFC. These are c laims by the two parties in the alternative. The problem lies with Situation (d). It may be thought that in this c ase both Seah and Wee are making a joint c laim – after all, Situation (d) seems to envisage a situation where Seah has not suffered loss but nonetheless is still a proper party. However, c onstruing the pleading as a whole, I c onc lude that this is not a c ase of the intent. The relevant pleading ends with “the 2nd Plaintiff maintains all the said c laims and relief”. This, to my mind, indic ates that in the c ase where Situations (b), (c ) and (d) apply, Seah is nec essarily dropping his entitlement to c laim. His entitlement to c laim for losses suffered only arises in Situation (a). Thus understood, in Situation (d) Seah is no longer maintaining his c laim even though he might be a proper party. 

_Is Wee the undisclosed principal?_ 

61     In any event, I find that this is not a c ase where the undisc losed princ ipal and her agent are c laiming against the third party. Upon a review of the evidenc e, I am of the view that, on a balanc e of probabilities, Wee is not the owner of the stall. Henc e she c annot be the undisc losed princ ipal. 

62     FFC had argued that as a matter of law neither Seah nor Wee were the true owners of the Yew Tee Stall. In this regard, FFC took great pains to adduc e the following evidenc e to rebut Wee’s assertions at trial that she was the owner of the stall: 

 (a) Wee was unable to explain why her inc ome tax submissions did not reflec t, inter alia , the sales, deposit, lic enc e and rental fees for the Yew Tee Stall. 

 (b) Wee did not dec lare her expenses in her inc ome tax submissions even though this would have supported her attempt to reduc e the inc idenc e of tax. 

 (c ) Rather than Wee, a c ompany known “Yu Kee Duc k and Noodle House Pte Ltd” wrote to FFC on 27 Oc tober 2004 and 10 Dec ember 2004 to ask for a rental rebate in view of the bird flu c risis. These letters were signed not by Wee but by Seah. 

63     I agree with FFC that there is little to show that Wee is the owner of the Yew Tee Stall. There is, in fac t, not muc h more than the say-so of the two plaintiffs on that sc ore. Doc umentary evidenc e, as adduc ed by FFC, suggests otherwise. In other words, we c an readily disregard Situations (b), (c ) and (d) of the plaintiffs’ pleaded c ase. 

64     There remains a problem for Seah in that Situation (a) of his pleaded c ase is premised upon Wee being his undisc losed princ ipal. As I have found that Wee is not the owner of the Yew Tee Stall, to c onstrue Situation (a) stric tly would mean that Seah’s c laim fails _in limine_. This would result in Seah, as a c ontrac ting party (albeit an agent of an undisc losed princ ipal) being unable to c laim against FFC on a c ontrac t of whic h a breac h has c learly been found by the c ourt. Suc h an outc ome would be anomalous to say the least. 

65     Fortunately, I believe that the essenc e of Seah’s c laim, whic h is that he is the agent of some undisc losed princ ipal, remains intac t whether or not it is shown that Wee in partic ular is that princ ipal. 


To read the pleadings in this broad manner would not c ause injustic e to FFC in regard to liability as that has been determined purely on the basis of the c ontrac t between Seah and FFC. For reasons whic h I will explain later, the princ ipal’s identity is also immaterial to the question of damages. Furthermore, all the evidenc e and arguments relevant to determining the issue on the basis that Seah is the agent of a c ertain unidentified princ ipal are before me. As suc h, I will proc eed to determine this c laim as if the pleadings had read: “The 1st Plaintiff ( _as agent for an undisclosed principal_ ) is the proper party to sue and entitled to c laim for all the losses set out above”. 

_Must the undisclosed principal be identified?_ 

66     In my view, in some c irc umstanc es it is appropriate for an agent to bring a suit in his c apac ity as an agent without disc losing the identity of his princ ipal. In this c ase, the c ommerc ial realities of the business Seah and Wee were engaged in c onstitute one suc h c irc umstanc e. To fully apprec iate this point, I should first give a short historic al ac c ount of the doc trine of the undisc losed princ ipal. 

67     Ac c ording to Markesinis and Munday’s ac c ount in _An Outline of the Law of Agency_ (Butterworths, 4th Ed, 1998) at pp 155 and 156, the genesis of the doc trine c an be found in the nature of partic ular trading relationships in the 18th and 19th c enturies, with the rise of the use of fac tors and brokers as middlemen in c ommerc ial transac tions. In partic ular, business began to be c onduc ted at a faster pac e and, when agents began to assume greater risks, bankruptc ies also bec ame more c ommon. As a result, the c ourts rec ognised the right of the princ ipal to intervene in the c ontrac ts between bankrupt agents and third parties. The development of the middleman meant that the identity of the princ ipal bec ame unimportant to the third party. In disc ussing these developments, Sir Frederic k Polloc k, (1887) 3 LQR at p 359, identified the “c ommon law equity” whic h arose from “the feeling that a princ ipal who had got the advantage of a purc hase ought to pay for it if the agent to whom the seller really trusted was not able to do so”. 

68     In _San’s Rent A-Car_ ([45] _supra_ ), the Court of Appeal ac knowledged the rough-and-ready origins of the doc trine when it quoted Lord Berwic k’s exposition of the justific ations for it, whic h was as follows (at 600): 

 The origin of, and theoretic al justific ation for, the doc trine of the undisc losed princ ipal has been the subjec t of muc h disc ussion by ac ademic writers. Their Lordships would espec ially mention the influential artic le by Goodhart and Hamson ‘Undisc losed Princ ipals in Contrac t’ (1932) 4 CLJ 320, c ommenting on the then rec ent c ase of Collins v Associated Greyhound Racecourses Ltd [1930] 1 Ch 1. It seems to be generally ac c epted that, while the development of this branc h of the law may have been anomalous, sinc e it runs c ounter to fundamental princ iples of privity of c ontrac t, it is justified on grounds of c ommerc ial c onvenienc e. 

69     In applying the undisc losed princ ipal doc trine to the fac ts of the instant c ase, I bear in mind that the doc trine is, and always has been, a lively response to c ommerc ial realities. In some ways it is an antidote to the legalistic stric tures of c ontrac t law. The instant c ase, involving a typic ally Singaporean hawker family business, reflec ts a vastly different kind of world from that of merc hant fac tors in 18th c entury England but, nonetheless, I believe that the robustness of the undisc losed princ ipal doc trine is exac tly intended to address these c hanging c ommerc ial pec uliarities ac ross the ages. 

70     The evidenc e shows that Seah owns or operates a c hain of duc k ric e stalls in Singapore as well as several duc k-supply related c ompanies, inc luding Yu Kee Management Pte Ltd, Yu Kee Duc k & Noodle House Pte Ltd and Yu Kee Retail Pte Ltd. Of the many stalls, some are owned by private limited c ompanies of whic h Seah and/or Wee are shareholders and others are sole proprietorships 


under Seah or Wee’s name. 

71     It is evident that the arrangements between Seah and Wee in relation to the business they ran were highly c onvoluted. The informal nature of these arrangements was reflec tive of the fac t that this was a relatively small family business rather than a large c orporation. The oral testimonies of both Seah and Wee c onfirmed to me that these were not highly sophistic ated business persons who had the benefit of expert advic e as to how to struc ture their enterprise. Although I am not speaking with c ertainty, it may well be that it is impossible to disentangle the web of relationships between the two plaintiffs, their various c ompanies and their various assets and business c onc erns. In other words, it may be diffic ult or even impossible to identify the true legal owner of the Yew Tee Stall in the stric test tec hnic al sense. This does not mean that the plaintiffs – as a “family business” in the everyday, c ommonsensic al meaning of the phrase – did not suffer losses arising from FFC’s wrongful ac tions. This issue of loss is c entral to the entire c ase and I will return to it later. 

72     I venture to suggest that it is not nec essary, in suc h c irc umstanc es, for the undisc losed princ ipal to be identified. Where ownership and c ontrol of a tangled family business is not easily established, it would be easier to ac c ept that the member of the family who signed the c ontrac t is the agent of an undisc losed princ ipal. He ac ts, in effec t, as a representative for the greater family interest. Lord Diploc k in _Freeman & Lockyer v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd_ [1964] 2 QB 480 at 503 posited that the rule of the undisc losed princ ipal “c an be rationalised as avoiding c irc uity of ac tion”. The referenc e was to a different reasoning but I think the phrase is apt here. It would be c irc uitous for the undisc losed princ ipal to be pinpointed, for that would only lead to protrac ted and unhelpful arguments as to whether that identified party is truly the princ ipal or not. That has already happened with Wee’s inc lusion in the suit whic h was, and I speak now with the benefit of hindsight, a distrac tion from the determination of the main issues of liability. 

73     There is further support for the proposition that the princ ipal’s identity need not be asc ertained at trial in _Bowstead_ at para 9-015, whic h states: 

 [I]t has been held that in an ac tion by the vendor for spec ific performanc e of a c ontrac t of sale of land, the plaintiff is not entitled to interrogate the defendant for the purpose of asc ertaining whether he was ac ting as agent for an undisc losed princ ipal. And in general it would seem that, the c ontrac t being that of the agent, he is under no duty when suing or sued to disc lose the existenc e of his princ ipal. 

If the agent need not disc lose even the _existence_ of his princ ipal, it must follow that his identity need not be disc losed. 

74     There is authority against this position whic h I would respec tfully dec line to follow. In _Abu Dhabi National Tanker Co v Product Star Shipping Ltd_ (The Produc t Star) [1992] All ER 20, the plaintiffs, having c hartered a ship from the defendant owners, brought proc eedings against the defendants, alleging that the latter had repudiated the c harter. The defendants sought disc overy against the plaintiffs in relation to the damages c laimed. The plaintiffs only provided limited disc overy, arguing that most of the doc uments were in the hands of their foreign parent c ompany. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs were really agents of the parent and that the ac tion should be stayed until the parent provided disc overy. Webster J of the Queens’ Benc h Division agreed, holding that where a nominal plaintiff ( _ie_ , the agent) brought an ac tion, a stay would be granted until the real plaintiff (the undisc losed princ ipal) provided disc overy whic h he would have been required if he were a party to the c ontrac t. He was persuaded by the fac t that the benefic ial interest in the proc eedings was that of the undisc losed princ ipal and that the agents had no interest in the proc eedings other than their right to bring them. 


75     _Bowstead_ at para 8-083 referred to this dec ision and c ommented: 

 As a matter of disc losure this may be c orrec t, for what is revealed may well be relevant to the c laimant’s damages. But it seems to have been assumed that the agent in suc h a c ase had no interest in the proc eedings other than the right to bring them in his own name. In view of the interest of the agent of an undisc losed princ ipal in the c ontrac t made, as explained above, this seems doubtful. 

I agree. It must be borne in mind that it is an established proposition that the agent has a right to sue the third party bec ause he does so as a party to the c ontrac t. Further, it c annot be said that he has no interest in the proc eedings other than his right to bring them. Indeed, as will be seen, the agent may in some situations c laim for substantial losses. 

_Can Seah sue for substantial losses?_ 

76     A diffic ult question arises as to whether Seah c an c laim for losses whic h were not suffered personally by him but only by the undisc losed princ ipal. 

77     If Seah is c onsidered to have brought his suit as a c ontrac ting party, the general princ iple of c ontrac t is that a party to a c ontrac t c an only c laim for his own loss arising from a breac h of that c ontrac t: _Chia Kok Leong v Prosperland Pte Ltd_ [2005] 2 SLR 484 (“ _Chia Kok Leong_ ”) at [10]. On that basis, Seah, as a c ontrac ting party who suffered no loss, should not be able to c laim substantial damages. In my view, the c hief justific ation for suc h a rule is that it would be unfair to the third party who suddenly must bear the c ompletely unforeseen and idiosync ratic loss of a princ ipal of whose existenc e he has been c ompletely unaware at the time of c ontrac ting. This logic is sound. 

78     There has not been extensive debate on the issue in English law and what judic ial statements we have are somewhat c ryptic. In _Alfred McAlpine Construction Ltd v Panatown Ltd_ [2001] 1 AC 518 (“ _Panatown_ ”) at 581, Lord Millett disc ussed the doc trine of the undisc losed princ ipal in the c ontext of being one of “several apparent but well-established exc eptions” to the general rule stated above, whic h were “explic able in a manner c onsistent with the rule”. Although Lord Millett was in the minority in this dec ision, the speec hes of the majority, whic h dec ided the c ase on different grounds, were not inc onsistent with this point. He said: 

 A sec ond apparent exc eption arises where the ac tion is brought by an agent to rec over in respec t of the loss sustained by an undisc losed princ ipal. In suc h a c ase the agent c an both sue and be sued on the c ontrac t. But the agent is treated as suing in respec t of his own loss, not his princ ipal’s, and it is no defenc e to the party in breac h that by reason of the agent’s dealings with a third party the ac tual inc idenc e of the loss may fall elsewhere. 

79     The very first sentenc e of this passage appears to say that an agent c an c laim for the substantial losses suffered by his undisc losed princ ipal. But, Lord Millett went on to say that, in so doing the agent is “treated” as suing for “his own loss, not his princ ipal’s”. By this, I understand his Lordship to mean merely that in the eyes of the law the agent is c laiming his own loss, even though this may be only a legal fic tion to preserve the sanc tity of the general rule under c ontrac t law. The passage c annot be read to mean that the agent c an only c laim for his own personal loss – and this was the reading advoc ated by FFC’s c ounsel with whic h I would disagree. Suc h an interpretation is c ompletely at odds with the first sentenc e of the quotation as well as the last sentenc e whic h stresses that Lord Millett was referring to a situation where “the ac tual inc idenc e of the loss may fall elsewhere [other than on the agent himself]”. 


80     I am of the view that a similar interpretation is to be taken of the other authority c ited by FFC’s c ounsel, whic h is admittedly somewhat ambiguous when read in isolation. In _Allen v F O’Hearn & Co_ [1937] AC 213 (“ _O’Hearn_ ”) at 218, Lord Atkin said: 

 So far as the rights of the parties depend upon c ontrac t either Clarke’s c ustomers were undisc losed princ ipals of Clarke in relation to the defendants, and had the c ontrac tual rights of suc h princ ipals, or they were not. If they were, they had the right of suit for breac hes of c ontrac t, or alternatively until they exerc ised their rights Clarke c ould sue: but these are ordinary legal rights. The supposed agent’s rights would be to recover the damages suffered by him on the footing that he had been principal. [emphasis added] 

_Bowstead_ has c alled this “a puzzling passage” (footnote 76 at p 508), and I have to agree. FFC’s c ounsel also c ited a passage from _Halsbury’s Laws of Australia_ ([49] _supra_ ) as additional support for his stanc e but that passage was no more than a c itation of the proposition in _O’Hearn_. 

81     Professor Tan Cheng Han (who, inc identally, drafted FFC’s c ounsel’s further written submissions) wrote FFC’s c ounsel has written an artic le, “ _Undisclosed principals and contract_ ” (2004) 120 LQR 480, in whic h he argued at footnote 32 that the dec ision of the majority in _Panatown_ suggested that the agent c ould not c laim the undisc losed princ ipal’s loss. Ac c ording to Prof Tan, the majority had dec ided that an exc eption existed to the general c ontrac t rule that a c ontrac ting party c an only c laim for damages suffered by him personally where the rule results in a situation of a “legal blac k hole” – this is the famous “narrow ground” of the dec ision. Suc h a situation arose where the person who c ould sue did not suffer the loss but the person who suffered the loss had no privity of c ontrac t and henc e c ould not sue. However, in an undisc losed princ ipal situation there is no blac k hole bec ause either the agent or the princ ipal c an sue the third party and the c auses of ac tion by eac h are “similar”. As suc h, _Panatown_ does not provide support for allowing the agent to c laim his princ ipal’s loss. 

82     I agree with Prof Tan on this point. However, the majority in _Panatown_ were not disc ussing the undisc losed princ ipal doc trine and no position was taken as to whether the agent c an c laim his princ ipal’s loss. Notably, the fac ts of _Panatown_ did not involve any agenc y at all. The rationale for the agent’s ability to make suc h a c laim is based on quite different premises from the c onc erns voic ed by the _Panatown_ majority and is founded on the representative c apac ity in whic h the agent sues. 

83     In the Sc ottish c ase of _A.F Craig & Company Ltd v A.F. & J.C. Blackater_ 1923 SLT 240 ( _“Blackater”_ ), a third party sold boilers to the agents, the “managing owners” of a ship, not knowing that the agents were ac ting on behalf of their undisc losed princ ipal who was the registered owner and thus the true legal owner. Full payment for the boilers was not made and the third party sued the agents for the unpaid balanc e. The agents c ounterc laimed against the third party on the basis that the boilers were defec tive and as a result the agents suffered loss and damages. It later transpired during the trial that the agents were only ac ting for their undisc losed princ ipal. The agents amended their defenc e to say that they were both defending and c ounterc laiming “as representing and for and on behalf of the [undisc losed princ ipal]”. The third parties argued that the agents had no title to sue and, further, that they suffered no loss through the breac h of the c ontrac t. 

84     The trial judge, Lord Sands, held the following at 243, whic h I note ac c ords exac tly with FFC’s submissions in the instant c ase before me: 

 I take it to be in ac c ordanc e with our law and prac tic e that a party who desires to enforc e a c ontrac t or rec over damages for the breac h of it must sue in his own name. The rule is thus stated by Lord Shand in Levy v Thomsons (10 R. 1134 at p. 1137): 


 In the ordinary c ase although a c ontrac t has been entered into by an agent for a princ ipal, proc eedings to enforc e it must be taken by the princ ipal who must sue in his own name. 

 No doubt where an agent has entered into a c ontrac t for an undisc losed princ ipal he may be sued and, as a c ounterpart, he may sue in his own name (Mac kay, p. 128; M’Laren, p.220). But in suc h a c ase the ac tion, so far as the other party to the c ontrac t is c onc erned, is the agent’s own ac tion. If the agent’s ac tion be one of implement, it is for implement to the agent: if it be one of damages, it is for damages suffered by the agent. In order to rec over damages the agent must instruc t damage suffered by himself. In the present c ase the c ontrac t was made by the defenders with the pursuers, who were ac ting as the agents for an undisc losed princ ipal. These agents sue for damages for breac h of that c ontrac t. But the damages whic h they have instruc ted are not damages suffered by themselves, but damages suffered by their undisc losed princ ipal. 

85     On appeal, Lord Sands’ dec ision was reversed. The Lord Justic eClerk (Alness), and their Lordships Ormidale, Anderson and Hunter were of the unanimous opinion that Lord Sands was inc orrec t to hold that his hands were tied by the unfortunate legal “ _cul-de-sac_ ”, as Lord Anderson put it, whic h the agent had found himself in. I mention in partic ular the c omments by the Lord Justic eClerk: 

 [Counsel for the third party], as I understood his argument, admitted that [the agents] have a title to sue, but he maintained that they c ould not rec over damages bec ause they had themselves sustained none. But if [the agents] sue, it must surely be in their princ ipal’s interest. Though they have suffered no damage, they represent a person who has. Why should they not enforc e their princ ipal’s right? That is prec isely what they are endeavouring to do. They do not propose to put a penny in their own poc ket. They sue, so they aver, for and on behalf of the [undisc losed princ ipal], and that averment, be it observed, [the third parties] deny. Why should [the agents] not have an opportunity of proving their statements, and of rec overing damages for their princ ipal on whose behalf they c laim to ac t? It is true [the agents] found on no assignation, and it is also true that, in my opinion, they c an c laim to possess no mandate under the artic les of assoc iation. But why should not the representational c apac ity in whic h they c laim to ac t, if proved in fac t, yield the same result in law? I c annot see that any legal princ iple is infringed by giving effec t to their c laim. 

86     It is true that at least as far as Lords Ormidale, Anderson and Hunter were c onc erned, it was important that the third parties, as the plaintiffs in the primary c laim, elec ted to pursue the agents despite the disc losure of the princ ipal halfway into the trial. For instanc e, Lord Hunter said: 

 But as [the third parties] c hose to c ontinue their ac tion against the agents after they asc ertained who the undisc losed princ ipal was, they were bound to allow these agents to plead any breac h of the c ontrac t that they had c ommitted. Liability to be sued on the c ontrac t was ac c ompanied with right to plead as a c ounterpart the [third parties’] failure to implement the c ontrac t. The fac t that rec overy of suc h damages is made in a representative c apac ity, or as quasi -trustees for the undisc losed princ ipals does not c onstitute an effec tive plea of no title to sue. 

87     Their Lordships felt it unfair to deny the agents to c ounterc laim as if they were the princ ipal when the third parties had elec ted to treat them as the princ ipal in the main c laim. This reasoning is, of c ourse, not applic able to the present c ase, where FFC has not exerc ised any elec tion. But the more general point expressed by the Lord Justic eClerk remains pertinent: that no perverse result arises if the agent is allowed to c laim the losses of the princ ipal in his representational c apac ity. In 


short: why not? 

88     There is no risk of double rec overy bec ause the agent’s ability to c laim for the princ ipal’s losses, as stressed by both the Lord Justic eClerk and Lord Hunter, is premised on the representative c apac ity in whic h he ac ts for his princ ipal. Just like the agents in _Blackater_ , Seah has made c lear in his pleadings that he is suing in a representative c apac ity. As pointed out by the Lord Justic eClerk, the agent does not get to keep the damages reaped from the ac tion. There was no elaboration in _Blackater_ as to how the agent would be ac c ountable to the undisc losed princ ipal and it should not matter to the third party at any rate. Lord Atkin said in _O’Hearn_ : 

 What happens to the proc eeds of a suc c essful c laim by suc h an agent is another matter. By virtue of his fiduc iary relation to his princ ipals he may have to ac c ount to them for what he rec eives: but this is not the c onc ern of the other party. 

89     It has been suggested by Derham in “ _Set-off and Agency_ ” [1985] 44 CLJ 384 ( _“Derham”_ ) at footnote 31 that while it is established law that as regards the third party, the agent and the princ ipal are not in a trust relationship, it may be that the agent is a trustee vis-à-vis the princ ipal. This c omment was made in the c ontext of set-off (see below) but I would not think it unreasonable that a trust relationship c ould arise on the agent’s rec eipt of the princ ipal’s damages, quite apart from the agent’s relationship with the third party. Furthermore, the rules disc ussed earlier whic h prohibit a third party from pursuing the princ ipal if he has sued the agent to judgment, logic ally have their mirror-image c ounterparts whic h prohibit a princ ipal from suing the third party after the agent has sued him to judgment for the princ ipal’s losses. 

90     A c onc ern raised by FFC’s c ounsel is that it would be unjust to make a third party liable to the agent for the princ ipal’s losses when he is unable to assert, against the agent, defenc es whic h would have been available against the princ ipal had the princ ipal brought the suit himself. I must c onfess to being somewhat c onfused by this argument bec ause FFC’s c ounsel went on to quote, on a related point, a passage from _Fridman_ at 242 whic h states: “the third party [when sued by the agent] c an set up against the agent any defenc e whic h would have been available against the undisc losed princ ipal”. The proposition in _Fridman_ states the c orrec t position in law. In _Garnac Grain Co. Inc v HMF Faure and Fairclough Ltd_ [1966] 1 QB 650, for instanc e, the third party was allowed to avail himself of defenc es arising out of the fraud or misrepresentation of the princ ipal himself even when there was no fraud by the agent. It is also arguable that the third party should also be allowed to set off any debts owing to him by the princ ipal. This proposition is favourably disc ussed in _Derham_ at 405 and 406. _Fridman_ , c ommenting on _Derham_ , suggests that the right of set-off is available “probably” only where the ac tion is brought on behalf of the princ ipal. This is so in the instant c ase. 

91     Counsel for FFC also argued that in c ases where the undisc losed princ ipal remained unidentified even at trial, it would be prejudic ial to the third parties to be liable for suc h princ ipal’s losses bec ause the third parties would be unable to find out what defenc es they c ould have raised against the princ ipal. I should only note that FFC has been unable to even suggest what sort of defenc es _might_ have been available if the undisc losed princ ipal were to be identified in this c ase. From the fac ts, I do not think that any new defenc es c ould have arisen no matter who the undisc losed princ ipal was. As suc h, there is no prejudic e to FFC. 

92     On the other hand, by allowing the agent to c laim for the princ ipal’s loss we are able to avert the unfortunate results whic h Lord Sands c omplained bitterly of but regretfully c onc luded were the inevitable by-produc ts of his dec ision: 

 I c onfess I reac h this result with reluc tanc e and distaste. There is no substanc e in the diffic ulty. 


 The c irc umstanc e that the title of the ship was in the [undisc losed princ ipal] does not prejudic e the [third party] in the least. Nor does it make any differenc e either to the [agents] or to the princ ipals behind them, who are really very muc h the same parties under a different legal persona ... There may have been a long litigation and an expensive proof; it must all go for nothing. The whole expense must be thrown away. Everything must be begun over again. ... In no other sphere of human ac tivity would the like be c ontemplated, exc ept perhaps in the domain of sport, where rigid enforc ement of arbitrary penalties, disproportionate to the mistake, is sometimes thought to add zest to the game. 

93     His lament is partic ularly poignant to the c ase presently before me as prec isely the same c onc erns would arise if I were to deny Seah his c laim on behalf of his undisc losed princ ipal. In partic ular, the true owner of the Yew Tee stall is very likely to be Seah and Wee under a different legal persona. However, like their Lordships who reversed Lord Sands’ dec ision on appeal, I do not believe the law to be so rigidly c onstituted. 

94     The c ase of _Corfield v David Grant_ (1992) 29 Con LR 58 (“ _Corfield v Grant_ ”) c ited by the plaintiffs is apt. Here, the defendant, a hotelier and his wife engaged the plaintiff, an arc hitec t, to redesign a building as a hotel. The building itself was ac tually owned by the defendant and his wife’s c ompany, although the plaintiff was unaware of this fac t at the time of c ontrac ting. When the plaintiff sued the defendant for unpaid fees, the defendant c ounterc laimed for damages arising from the plaintiff’s breac hes of his c ontrac tual duties. The plaintiff, in resisting the c ounterc laim, argued that the defendant did not suffer the loss he c laimed for and that the c ompany, who suffered the loss, was not joined as a party. 

95     Judge Bowsher QC held that the defendant was the agent of the c ompany, the undisc losed princ ipal, even though the defendant may not have apprec iated the legal implic ations of his ac tions when c ontrac ting direc tly with the plaintiff at that time. He said: 

 For the plaintiff it is submitted that there is no mention of the c ompany in the doc uments passing between the plaintiff and the defendant and the existenc e of the c ompany was not a reasonably foreseeable possibility and therefore no damage suffered by the c ompany should be rec overable. That point is not taken in the pleadings. If one disregards legalistic arguments, that submission is nonsense. The plaintiff must have realised that errors on his part might and probably would adversely affec t the proposed business of the hotel and it c an have made little differenc e to him whether that hotel was owned by the defendant or by a private c ompany owned by the defendant and his wife. In modern c onditions it was more likely than not that the hotel would be owned by a private c ompany. 

 ... 

 [I]n any event I propose to dec ide this ac tion on the assumption that the defendant is c ounterc laiming on behalf of the c ompany. Any damages awarded to the defendant on the c ounterc laim are to be treated as awarded to him as trustee for the c ompany, and any ac tion by the c ompany in respec t of the same subjec t matter hereafter would no doubt be stayed as an abuse of the proc ess of the c ourt. At the same time, I have no doubt that any judgment or other liability of the defendant arising out of this ac tion will quite properly be treated as between the defendant and the c ompany as a liability of the c ompany. 

96     There has been some c ritic ism of this dec ision, but in the present c ase I need not go even as far as Judge Bowsher did, for the pleadings c learly state that Seah is c laiming as an agent of his undisc losed princ ipal. Nevertheless, the princ iple behind his dec ision is c lear – the loss was not an 


unforeseen c onsequenc e of the third party’s breac h of the c ontrac t. 

97     The idea of the foreseeability of the princ ipal’s loss was also disc ussed by _Bowstead_ at para 9013 in c onsidering the dec ision in _Panatown_ : 

 Where the c ontrac t has a value whic h c an be assessed objec tively, its breac h, whether by way of supply of inferior goods or servic es, c an be assessed on the basis of that value and the problem c an be met. But when what is c laimed is loss idiosync ratic to the third party, it may be diffic ult to say that suc h loss was in the c ontemplation of the parties. There are nevertheless in the Panatown c ase suggestions that, whic hever view is adopted, the rule is one of law, and that suc h loss c an be taken in on an objec tive basis. 

 In the c ontext of undisc losed princ ipal suc h theoretic al problems are ac ute, as the third party has no c ontemplation of the existenc e of another party to the c ontrac t, let alone of spec ial losses whic h that party might suffer. It is however assumed that some sort of objec tive assessment is to be applied as a matter of law, though it c annot be said that the matter is exhaustively argued. 

98     I would adopt the distinc tion drawn between “objec tively assessable loss” on the one hand and “spec ial” or “idiosync ratic loss” on the other. Indeed, that distinc tion lies at the very heart of the entire issue. An agent should not be able to c laim for some idiosync ratic loss of the undisc losed princ ipal, partic ularly where the undisc losed princ ipal remains unidentified at trial. I c ould imagine suc h a situation arising where the agent and the princ ipal are not merely legally rec onstituted versions of eac h other but radic ally different entities with unrelated interests in the c ontrac t. 

99     Whether the princ ipal’s loss is objec tively assessable or idiosync ratic is a matter of fac t. In the instant c ase, it would have been c lear to FFC even from the start that breac hing the c ontrac t in the manner it did would inflic t suc h manner of damages upon the person whom the c ontrac t is designed to benefit. FFC may have thought it was Seah personally who would suffer suc h losses; it turned out that it was not Seah but his undisc losed princ ipal. But it c annot be said that the losses were not in the c ontemplation of FFC when it entered into the c ontrac t. This c ase turns on the fac t that FFC knew that it was dealing with a family business unit and those losses would be suffered by that unit. By saying this I am by no means c reating some novel and amorphous legal entity with rights and duties. I merely rec ognise that it is disingenuous for FFC to c laim that it did not c ontemplate that the losses arising from the breac h of the Agreement would fall on some manner of legal person be it some permutation of Seah, Wee, or the c ompanies they c ontrolled. 

100    Exac tly what damages the plaintiffs will be able to prove is, of c ourse, an entirely different matter, but these would have to be dealt with at the assessment stage. 

_Applicability of Chia Kok Leong_ 

101    I now turn to the plaintiffs’ argument that Seah c ould c laim his undisc losed princ ipal’s loss under the “broad ground” of _Chia Kok Leong_ ([76] _supra_ ) where the Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiff to rec over substantial damages for the loss of his “performanc e interest” in not rec eiving the bargain for whic h he had c ontrac ted. The plaintiffs argue that 

 (a) Seah had suffered the loss of his performanc e interest whic h is c ompensatable under the “broad ground”; and 

 (b) at any rate, the princ iple in Chia Kok Leong is not limited to the loss of a performanc e interest but also inc ludes the loss of profits. 


1       0 2 _Chia Kok Leong_ involved a developer who built a c ondominium. After the c ompletion of the projec t, the management c orporation bec ame the proprietor of the c ommon property of the c ondominium. The developer sued the building c ontrac tor for breac h of c ontrac t for defec tive works and against the arc hitec ts for breac h of c ontrac t whic h resulted in the defec tive works. Notably, the developers were no longer the owners of the c ondominium at the time of suit, nor had they expended any money to effec t repairs. 

103    The Court of Appeal c onsidered the history of exc eptions to the rule that a c ontrac ting party who has suffered no loss c annot c laim substantial profits. The c entrepiec e of the dec ision was the c ourt’s analysis of _Panatown_. The c ourt’s summary of the law disc ussed in that c ase is as follows: 

 30 The differenc e between the majority and the minority approac hes in Panatown is of a doc trinal nature. The majority took the view that as the c ontrac tual arrangement between the building employer and the builder envisaged and provided for a direc t c ontrac tual c laim by the third party (by way of the DCD) against the builder, it must follow that where the loss was suffered by the third party, the latter should be the person to make the c laim. To hold otherwise would run c ounter to the implic it c ontrac tual intention of the building employer and the builder. It is based on what was within the presumed intention of the parties [“the narrow ground”]. However, the minority did not think that just bec ause the c ontrac tual arrangement envisaged the giving of a c ontrac tual right, though limited, to the third party, it must nec essarily follow that the primary right of the building employer to obtain relief for breac h of the building c ontrac t should thereby be c urtailed. There was no justific ation to presume that the rights of the building employer were to be subsumed under or subordinate to those of the third party under the DCD. The building employer should be c ompensated for what he had paid for but did not rec eive and the grant of suc h relief to the building employer would have nothing to do with the exc eption in Dunlop v Lambert [“the broad ground”]. 

104    Turning to the fac ts of _Chia Kok Leong_ , the c ourt applied both the narrow and broad grounds. However, the c ourt said that “the broad ground is probably more c onsistent with princ iple”. 

105    I now address Seah’s first argument. Seah argued that in entering into the Agreement he had a performanc e interest that he may c ontinue to operate the Yew Tee Stall for the full term of the Agreement. FFC’s repudiation of the Agreement c aused Seah to fail to rec eive what he had bargained for and he thereby suffered the loss of his performanc e interest. 

106    In response, c ounsel for FFC argued that the broad ground was nonetheless limited by the c onsideration that in _Panatown_ and like c ases there was a gap in the sense that there was a mismatc h between c ontrac tual rights and ac tual loss, or where the rights under the c ontrac t were different from the rights of the parties who had ac tually suffered loss. He argued that it would be an unac c eptable subversion of the general princ iple (that a party c an only c laim for ac tual loss suffered) to allow the c ontrac ting party to c laim substantial losses simply bec ause he did not get what he bargained for, even when he did not suffer loss _and_ the party who suffered loss would be able to bring the exac t c ontrac tual c laim. 

107    I note that the Court of Appeal made no suc h qualific ation to the broad ground. I quote: 

 55 As mentioned in [32] above, the main ground upon whic h the appellants sought to argue that Prosperland c ould not c laim for substantial damages was that, as the MCST was entitled to sue the appellants in tort, there was no legal blac k hole. It was also pointed out that if Prosperland were to be allowed to c laim for substantial damages, it would expose the appellants to double liability. In our opinion, these arguments miss the fundamental premise upon whic h the 


 broad ground is based. It has nothing to do with the “filling up” of a legal blac k hole. We c an do no better than quote the following passage of Steyn LJ (as he then was) in Darlington Borough Council v Wiltshier Northern Ltd (1994) 69 BLR 1 at 24: 

 The rationale of Lord Griffiths’ wider princ iple is essentially that if a party engages a builder to perform spec ified work, and the builder fails to render the c ontrac tual servic e the employer suffers a loss. He suffers a loss of bargain or of expec tation interest. And that loss c an be rec overed on the basis of what it would c ost to put right the defec ts. 

108    In the premises, I agree that Seah _could_ have c laimed, on the basis of the broad ground, that he has lost his performanc e interest. However, he did not do so in his pleadings and for that reason alone _Chia Kok Leong_ is inapplic able. But for the sake of c ompleteness, I would note that the measure of damages under a performanc e loss c ould be measured in terms of the differenc e between the c ost of obtaining a lease of similarly sized premises in a similar loc ation with a similar amount of human traffic , _etc_ , and the c ost of the lease c ontrac ted for under the Agreement. Seah would have needed to adduc e evidenc e of suc h a differenc e if he had wished to c laim for his performanc e interest. Notably, this performanc e interest does _not_ c over the loss of profits. This point dovetails neatly into my treatment of the plaintiffs’ sec ond argument in the following paragraphs. 

109    In relation to the plaintiffs’ sec ond argument, it is c lear to me that the c ourt in _Chia Kok Leong_ only had the performanc e interest in mind when formulating the “broad ground”. This c ruc ial statement appears: 

 53 As we have disc ussed above, the basis on which a plaintiff is entitled to claim for substantial damages under the broad ground is that he did not receive what he had bargained and paid for. It has nothing to do with the ownership of the thing or property. As to the value of this performanc e interest, it seems to us that the observation of Lord Sc arman in Woodar Investment Development Ltd v Wimpey Construction UK Ltd [1980] 1 WLR 277, that the fac t that a c ontrac ting party has required servic es to be supplied at his own c ost to a third party is at least prima facie evidenc e of the value of those servic es to the party who plac ed the order, is a useful pointer. [emphasis added] 

110    It is not surprising that the c ourt limited the proposition in suc h a way bec ause this is both c onsistent with c ase law and princ iple. The _only_ loss whic h c an be c laimed by the party not rec eiving the bargain he c ontrac ted for is the performanc e loss and nothing else. This muc h is c lear from the speec h of Lord Griffiths in _St Martins Property Corporation Ltd v Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd_ [1994] 1 AC 85, at 96–97, whic h is the seminal statement of the princ iple: 

 I c annot ac c ept that in a c ontrac t of this nature, namely for work, labour and the supply of materials, the rec overy of more than nominal damages for breac h of c ontrac t is dependent upon the plaintiff having a proprietary interest in the subjec t matter of the c ontrac t at the date of breac h. In everyday life c ontrac ts for work and labour are c onstantly being plac ed by those who have no proprietary interest in the subjec t matter of the c ontrac t. To take a c ommon example, the matrimonial home is owned by the wife and the c ouple’s remaining assets are owned by the husband and he is the sole earner. The house requires a new roof and the husband plac es a c ontrac t with a builder to c arry out the work. The husband is not ac ting as agent for his wife, he makes the c ontrac t as princ ipal bec ause only he c an pay for it. The builder fails to replac e the roof properly and the husband has to c all in and pay another builder to c omplete the work. Is it to be said that the husband has suffered no damage bec ause he does not own the property? Suc h a result would in my view be absurd and the answer is that the husband has suffered loss because he did not receive the bargain for which he had contracted with the first builder and 


 the measure of damages is the cost of securing the performance of that bargain by completing the roof repairs properly by the second builder. [emphasis added] 

111    Lord Millett in _Panatown_ also made referenc e to Oliver J’s c omments in _Radford v De Froberville_ [1977] 1 WLR 1262, where he said: 

 Now, it may be that, viewed objec tively, it is not to the plaintiff’s financ ial advantage to be supplied with the artic le or servic e whic h he has stipulated. It may be that another person might say that what the plaintiff has stipulated for will not serve his c ommerc ial interests so well as some other sc heme or c ourse of ac tion. And that may be quite right. But that, surely, must be for the plaintiff to judge. Pac ta sunt servanda. If he c ontrac ts for the supply of that whic h he thinks serves his interests – be they c ommerc ial, aesthetic or merely ec c entric – then if that whic h is c ontrac ted for is not supplied by the other c ontrac ting party I do not see why, in principle, he should not be compensated by being provided with the cost of supplying it through someone else or in a different way , subjec t to the proviso, of c ourse, that he is seeking c ompensation for a genuine loss and not merely using a tec hnic al breac h to sec ure an unc ovenanted profit. [emphasis added] 

112    Both the above quotations appear in _Chia Kok Leong_ at [17] and [28]. It is c lear from the above that the “bargain” whic h the c ontrac ting party did not rec eive c omprises the performanc e of an obligation. He is c ompensated for the loss of that bargain by damages whic h equal the c ost of performing that obligation in another way. The bargain does not inc lude profits whic h would have been made as a c onsequenc e flowing from the performanc e of the obligation. The animating princ iple behind the “broad ground” is that the c ontrac ting party has suffered _a real and direct loss_. But the loss of profits c annot be c onsidered as a loss c laimable under the broad ground for the simple reason that the c ontrac ting party was never in any position to make any profits in the first plac e. If he had been, then he c ould have c laimed substantial damages without resorting to the “broad ground” at all. 

**_Issues 3 to 6: Other claims by the plaintiffs_** 

113    I will now briefly deal with the remaining issues pertaining to the plaintiffs’ c laims against FFC. 

114    In relation to Issue 3, the plaintiffs had argued that FFC is obliged to ac c ount to the plaintiffs for the sales generated at the Yew Tee Stall for the period of 1 Marc h 2005 to 15 April 2005 but, instead, FFC kept these sums to itself. The Agreement had provided that the daily takings from the operation of the Yew Tee Stall were to be handed to FFC’s c ashier. Thereafter, the balanc e after deduc tion of the relevant c harges would be paid by FFC to the plaintiffs before the 10th day of the following month. The plaintiffs argued that FFC paid over some (but not all) of the sums due in respec t of the period of 1 to 31 Marc h 2005. The plaintiffs c alc ulated the sum due to them as $41,138.48. However, FFC only paid them a sum of $40,359.45 on 27 June 2005. In relation to the period of 1 April to 15 April 2005, FFC argued that a sum of $15,570.10 is due, while the plaintiffs argue that the sum due is $17,342.35. 

115    The plaintiffs have adduc ed evidenc e of figures whic h support their c laimed sums but I note that FFC’s submissions c ontain nothing to rebut the plaintiffs’ c alc ulation of the sums due. Its defenc e c onsists of a bare denial. In these c irc umstanc es. I order that an ac c ount be taken of the sums due for the period 1 Marc h 2005 to 15 April 2005. 

116    As for Issue 4, FFC have c onc eded in their defenc e at [24.2] that the sum of $18,000, being the sec urity deposit to be refunded at the end of the three-year term under c l 3.1 of the Agreement, is due to the plaintiffs. 


117    In relation to Issue 5, as I have already dec ided earlier, the Agreement was not subjec t to any of the alleged Oral Conditions whic h would have allowed FFC to immediately lift the upper fee c ap for the Yew Tee Stall. I therefore find that the plaintiffs are entitled to the sum of S$30,574.73 being the amount overc harged for the use of the Yew Tee Stall for the period of February 2004 till February 2005. 

118    In Issue 6, the plaintiffs c laimed that FFC were liable for c onversion of the plaintiffs’ equipment, goods and effec ts at the Yew Tee Stall when the lease was terminated. These items, listed in Annex B of the plaintiffs’ statement of c laim, c onsist of elec tric al applianc es, furniture and kitc henware. FFC’s c ase is that suc h items bec ame its properties by virtue of c l 12.5 of the Agreement, whic h reads: 

 Upon termination of this Agreement for any reasons whatsoever, any improvements made to the Food Stall shall remain the property of the Lic ensor and/or the Grantor and the Lic ensee shall not c laim any c ompensation of ex-gratia payment for suc h improvements done. 

119    The question is whether the items c ould be c onsidered “improvements” for the purposes of c l 12.5. The word was not defined in the Agreement. FFC c ited the c ase of _Morcom v CampbellJohnson_ [1955] 3 All ER 264, in whic h Denning LJ (as he then was) said that “if the work whic h is done is the provision of something new for the benefit of the oc c upier, that is, properly speaking, an improvement”. The word had arisen in s 2(1)(a) of the Inc rease of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restric tions) Ac t 1920 whic h permitted an inc rease in rent if the landlord had inc urred expenditure on improvements to the dwelling-house. I should only need to point out that his Lordship was making a distinc tion between an “improvement” and a “repair” whic h was defined as “the replac ement of something whic h was already there”. The c rux of the distinc tion was between “new” and “old” alterations to the property whic h I do not find helpful in the present c ase. Furthermore, the c ase itself c onc erned a drainage system, a c old-water supply and the lowering of an area in the middle of or adjac ent to the flats in question and the other example of an “improvement” drawn from c ase law was a nine-inc h thic k c onc rete bed put into a house bec ause the water level in the area had risen. Both these items, I note, are definitely permanent and immoveable. 

120    FFC also c ited the work of Lye Lin Heng in _Landlord and Tenant_ (Butterworths 1990), where the learned author said: 

 A tenant has no right to be c ompensated for any improvement whic h he has made to the property. He is bound, at the end of his lease, to deliver possession to his landlord, together with all improvements whic h he has c arried out, and together with all fixtures whic h he is not entitled to remove. If, on the other hand, the premises are not delivered in the proper state of repair as required by the lease, the tenant is required to c ompensate his landlord. 

This passage does not assist FFC bec ause it suggests that improvements c annot be physic ally removed from the property and henc e are c lassed together whic h physic ally removable fixtures whic h the tenant is not entitled under law to remove. 

121    PF Smith in _The Law of Landlord and Tenant_ (6th Ed) at pp 500 and 501 disc ussed the c onc ept of an “improvement” under the Landlord and Tenant Ac t 1927 whic h provided in Part I for a tenant to obtain c ompensation on the termination of a business tenanc y if he has done qualifying improvements to the property. It was noted in footnote 2 that there was no statutory definition of “improvements” but “it is c onfined to physic al improvements suc h as new buildings ... and does not inc lude trade or tenant’s fixtures”. The distinc tion between a permanent and immoveable struc ture like a building on one hand and fixtures on the other is signific ant. I find further support in Kim Lewison QC’s _Drafting_ 


_Business Leases_ (6th Ed) at pp 215 to 217, where the learned author opined that “a c ovenant against ‘alterations’ is wider than a c ovenant against ‘improvements’” while at the same time defining an “alteration” as “something whic h alters the form or c onstruc tion of a building”. It follows that an improvement is some kind of alteration of the form or c onstruc tion of a building, quite distinc t from a mere fixture. 

122    However, the strongest evidenc e of what should be c onsidered an improvement remains the terms of the Agreement itself. Clause 12.6 speaks of the lic ensor’s ability to re-enter the premises and to remove, dispose, destroy and/or sell “the Lic ensee’s goods, effec ts, fittings, equipment or other belongings”. In partic ular, “the Lic ensor shall be deemed not to be liable for c onversion, damage or lost [ _sic_ ] to the Lic ensee for any loss or damage oc c asioned by suc h removal, disposal, destruc tion or sale”. If the items in question are to be c onsidered “improvements”, then this c lause would be rendered otiose. In the c irc umstanc es, I hold that the items in Annex B are not “improvements” under the Agreement and henc e FFC is liable for c onversion of these items. 

**_Issue 7: FFC’s counterclaim_** 

123    FFC is c laiming a sum of $31,201.45 in respec t of unpaid rental and fees with regard to the Sungei Kadut Stall as well as for the value of some c redit notes previously provided by FFC to the plaintiffs, whic h FFC c laims it is entitled to withdraw. 

124    On 10 Marc h 2003, Seah had entered into a Tenanc y Agreement with FFC for the Sungei Kadut Stall. The tenanc y was to run till 9 Marc h 2004. The stall did not do well. On 16 Oc tober 2003, FFC issued c ertain c redit notes to Seah. Subsequently, ac c ording to both parties, Seah c eased operation of the Sungei Kadut Stall in or around January 2004. The plaintiffs c laim that at that time they had found a c ertain Mr Teo See Han to take over the lease. FFC c laims that the plaintiffs only proposed that Mr Teo take over the stall on 11 February 2004, the same day when the new tenanc y with Mr Teo was signed. As it turned out, ac c ording to FFC, Mr Teo only operated the stall for a month before absc onding. 

125    I will first deal with the c redit notes. Ac c ording to FFC, it agreed to issue c redit notes to Seah as “financ ial assistanc e” with the effec t of c anc elling whatever sums the plaintiffs owed to FFC as of Oc tober 2003. Ac c ording to FFC, the c redit notes were issued on the “understanding” that if Seah breac hed the Sungei Kadut Tenanc y Agreement the c redit notes would be withdrawn. The plaintiffs denied that there were any sums owing to FFC prior to Oc tober 2003 and c laimed that the c redit notes were issued bec ause the rental under the Tenanc y Agreement had been wrongly stated and thus the plaintiffs had been overc harged. The plaintiffs also denied that there were any c onditions attac hed to the c redit notes. 

126    FFC did not adduc e any evidenc e at all of a c ondition whereby the termination of the tenanc y would nullify the c redit notes. As suc h, I find that there was no suc h “understanding”. Further, there is no mention of the c redit notes anywhere in FFC’s defenc e and c ounterc laim (Amendment No 5). As suc h, I have no diffic ulty in finding that FFC wrongfully purported to withdraw the c redit notes. 

127    As for the unpaid rental and fees, the last payment by the plaintiffs was on 9 January 2004 for the month of January 2004. FFC alleges that the plaintiffs only vac ated the stall on 11 February 2004. They did not pay the rental, servic e and plate c ollec tion fees due for the period of 1 February to 11 February 2004. Utility and other c harges suc h as the worker levy and the doc umentation fee for the month of January 2004 as well as the 11 days of February were also unpaid. 

128    The plaintiffs c laim that from the time they c eased operating the Sungei Kadut Stall in January 


2004 till February 2006, FFC never onc e asserted that there were any sums outstanding in respec t of the Sungei Kadut Stall. 

129    I first note that FFC had pleaded at [20] and [30] of their defenc e and c ounterc laim that the sum of $31,201.45 was due as at the time of the plaintiffs’ alleged breac h of the Tenanc y Agreement. This, as stated by FFC itself, was in January 2004 when the plaintiffs allegedly c eased business at the Sungei Kadut Stall. But FFC now c laims that the sum c omprises further payments that fell due _after_ January 2004 – that is, for the period of 1 February to 11 February 2004. Furthermore, the statement of ac c ounts provided by FFC to the plaintiffs disc loses that as of 1 Dec ember 2003 the outstanding was only $3,748.84, whic h c onstituted the sums due for rent and fees for the month of Dec ember 

2003\. There were no other outstandings at that time. FFC has not explained how, given their c onc ession that the plaintiffs’ last payment was in January 2004 for the sums due that month, the total sum due c ould reac h $31,201.45 subsequently. 

130    In these premises, I dismiss FFC’s c ounterc laim.
