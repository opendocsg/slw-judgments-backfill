**V K Rajah J:** 

**Introduction** 

1       In these proc eedings, the defendant pleads that c ertain c ommerc ial transac tions it has entered into with the plaintiff ought to be voided. It asserts that these transac tions c onstitute _de facto_ and _de jure_ moneylending. The parties’ rival c ontentions squarely bring into sharp foc us the objec tives and ambit of the Moneylenders Ac t (Cap 188, 1985 Rev Ed) (“MLA”). Is the MLA invariably c ontravened whenever the objec t of a transac tion is to raise money? 

2       The plaintiff is engaged in the business of selling and distributing sanitary fittings, in addition to other household goods and applianc es. Its rec ent average annual turnover was in the region of $30m. Lau Chui Chew (“LCC”) has been the managing direc tor of the plaintiff sinc e its inc orporation. 

3       The defendant used to trade in elec tric al applianc es and elec tronic equipment. Sinc e 2003, however, it has remained a dormant c ompany. Goh Boon Chye (“GBC”) was the managing direc tor of the defendant while it c onduc ted business. 

4       LCC bec ame ac quainted with GBC in or around 1990 while GBC was an employee of Pertama Holdings Ltd (“Pertama”). Around this time, Thunderflash Enterprise Sdn Bhd (“Thunderflash”), a Malaysian c ompany, whose managing direc tor was an ac quaintanc e of both LCC and GBC, proposed a trading relationship between the plaintiff and Pertama. Given that Pertama was averse to extending c redit to foreign c ompanies, Thunderflash c ould not obtain c redit direc tly from Pertama for any elec tronic goods it sought. Thunderflash therefore proposed that the plaintiff purc hase any suc h 


goods from Pertama and subsequently resell these goods to Thunderflash at a profit. This arrangement proved to be benefic ial to all the parties involved and subsisted uneventfully until about 1992. 

5       In these transac tions (“Thunderflash transac tions”), the plaintiff would purc hase the goods that were required by Thunderflash from Pertama by paying c ash. The plaintiff would then resell the same goods to Thunderflash on c redit. GBC would initially settle the partic ulars of the goods desired and invoic es required after disc ussions with Thunderflash, and thereafter arrange for Pertama to issue invoic es to the plaintiff. The plaintiff would then instruc t its bank to make payment direc tly to Pertama. After Pertama’s rec eipt of the moneys, GBC would arrange for delivery of the goods from Pertama direc tly to Thunderflash. 

6       Subsequently, GBC left the employ of Pertama and inc orporated his own c ompany, Perdana Elec tronic s Pte Ltd (“Perdana”). In late 1999, GBC proposed to the plaintiff that they initiate similar sub-sale arrangements for goods that Perdana intended to proc ure from overseas suppliers (“Perdana transac tions”). The plaintiff was amenable to this proposal. GBC in turn liaised with the overseas suppliers direc tly. The overseas suppliers would thereafter address the invoic es to the plaintiff; these invoic es would be forwarded by the overseas suppliers to GBC who would then hand them over to the plaintiff, who subsequently arranged for its bank to issue letters of c redit in favour of the various overseas suppliers. The plaintiff would then invoic e Perdana for payment. Perdana would pay the plaintiff a marked-up pric e whic h the plaintiff c ontends inc luded a profit for arranging the banking fac ilities and the delivery of the goods to Perdana by its forwarding agent, Confi Logistic s Pte Ltd (“Confi”). 

**The genesis of the claims** 

7       In February 2000, GBC approac hed the plaintiff and proposed a similar trading relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, whic h he had rec ently inc orporated. The overseas suppliers for this relationship were mainly from Hong Kong and Taiwan. The arrangement involving these overseas suppliers (“Overseas transac tions”) lasted from about February 2000 to January 2002. The struc ture of the Overseas transac tions was c onc eptualised by GBC who would also determine the type and quantity of goods that were to be purc hased. GBC direc tly negotiated with the overseas suppliers without referenc e to LCC. It also appears that GBC apparently held himself out, from time to time, to be a representative of the plaintiff. Various letters from overseas suppliers addressed to the plaintiff were expressly marked to his attention. 

8       The invoic es from the overseas suppliers, although addressed to the plaintiff, were again sent to GBC at his home. GBC would thereafter forward the invoic es to the plaintiff. The plaintiff in turn would arrange for its bank to issue the letters of c redit in favour of the overseas suppliers. When the goods arrived in Singapore, the plaintiff’s port c learanc e agent, Confi, would arrange for the port c learanc e and deliver the goods to the defendant. The plaintiff would invoic e the defendant for the goods with a mark-up, whic h it asserts signified its profit margin. 

9       GBC would periodic ally visit the plaintiff’s offic e to sign the plaintiff’s invoic es to c onfirm that the goods had been delivered to the defendant in good order and c ondition and that the invoic ed amounts were c orrec t. Payment of these invoic es would be made in ac c ordanc e with the c redit period agreed between GBC and LCC for eac h transac tion. The c redit periods varied between the various transac tions, ranging from one to three months. 

10     Around Marc h 2000, soon after the c ommenc ement of the Overseas transac tions, GBC visited the plaintiff’s offic e with a proposal. GBC desired to expand the defendant’s trading relationship with 


the plaintiff. He offered a c heque signed in blank (“the Cheque”) to LCC in order to reassure the plaintiff of his personal c ommitment in the event of a default by the defendant. The plaintiff, through LCC, ac c epted the Cheque as sec urity for any default by the defendant in meeting its payment obligations to the plaintiff. It is pertinent to note that the payee’s name in the Cheque was left blank and the printed words “or bearer” were not deleted. The Cheque was a bearer instrument. 

11     In or about June 2000, GBC again approac hed the plaintiff and proposed further transac tions with another loc al supplier, Aloh Pte Ltd (“Aloh”). The negotiations apropos the goods to be purc hased from Aloh were left, as in the earlier Thunderflash transac tions, the Perdana transac tions and the Overseas transac tions, entirely to GBC. Again, GBC solely determined both the goods to be purc hased and their pric es, arranging for the invoic es to be forwarded to the plaintiff. The plaintiff would then instruc t its bank to make payment direc tly to Aloh. GBC would direc tly arrange for delivery of the goods from Aloh to the defendant (“Aloh transac tions”). 

12     The plaintiff was aware that Aloh had a c lose working relationship with the defendant but denies any knowledge of the ac tual ownership and/or business operations of Aloh throughout the c ourse of the trading relationship. In reality, Aloh was another front for GBC. It is only now established that GBC’s brother-in-law and his wife, who were until May 2002 the ostensible direc tors c um shareholders of Aloh, had c ompletely left the day-to-day management of that c ompany to GBC. GBC’s wife offered the following explanation for the c harade: 

 A: Bec ause there are c ertain goods whic h, initially bec ause Kenric h is solely under my name and my husband’s name, so Aloh is under my brother’s name, so we can use Aloh to buy goods from certain suppliers , bec ause if they were to know that Aloh belongs to us, some of them might not want to supply goods, so we need Aloh to buy c ertain goods, then sell to Kenric h. 

 Q: So some suppliers would not know that Aloh and Kenric h are c ontrolled by the same people. 

 A: Yes. 

 [emphasis added] 

13     I ac c ept LCC’s evidenc e that he implic itly trusted GBC and believed that Aloh was an independent supplier. The provision of the Cheque by GBC had also fortified his c onfidenc e in the viability of the business transac tions and GBC’s _bona fides_. Aloh and the defendant maintained different premises and had separate administrative staff. Indeed it was established, when GBC and his wife were c ross-examined, that GBC had not only signed on behalf of Aloh all delivery orders and invoic es but had used a wholly different signature when attesting to the Aloh doc uments. When queried why he employed different signatures, GBC’s hesitant and unc onvinc ing response revealed that he did not want his suppliers to know that Aloh was owned by him. That is not the whole truth. I ac c ept that he similarly did not want the plaintiff to be aware of his ac tual relationship with Aloh. It also bears mention that until the Aloh transac tions materialised late in the relationship, all the suppliers the defendant introduc ed to the plaintiff were independent entities. LCC, by dint of the hitherto suc c essful and unblemished relationship with GBC, had absolute c onfidenc e in him. The Aloh transac tions were c arried out in a manner broadly similar to all the earlier transac tions they had been involved in together. 

14     The plaintiff would invoic e the defendant for the goods inc lusive of the mark-up whic h had been agreed to prior to eac h transac tion. The defendant would sign the plaintiff’s invoic es to c onfirm that it had rec eived the goods in good order and c ondition and that the pric e of the goods, inc lusive 


of the mark-up, was ac c eptable. It is inc ontrovertible that the transac tions bore _ex-facie_ all the adornments of regular sale and purc hase transac tions c onduc ted at an arm’s length. 

15     The plaintiff fac ilitated the Aloh transac tions by purc hasing the goods for c ash from Aloh and selling them on c redit to the defendant. It is noteworthy that goods and servic es tax (“GST”) was paid on eac h leg of the transac tions, that is to say, in relation to the plaintiff’s purc hase from Aloh as well as the defendant’s purc hase of the same goods from the plaintiff. The struc ture of the relationship would not have struc k one as a sophistic ated subterfuge; nor was it an elaborate guise to evade the provisions of the MLA. It is c lear, from the testimony given during the trial itself, that the parties did not view the transac tions at the material time as moneylending transac tions, although GBC now strenuously c ontends otherwise. 

16     The defendant paid for all the transac tions with the exc eption of those whic h form the subjec t matter of the plaintiff’s present c laim against the defendant, outlined as follows:

17     The plaintiff has in addition c laimed the sum of $5,203.99 being transportation c harges paid to Confi for the Overseas Trades. 

18     Initially, the defendant disputed neither its liability to make payment nor the quantum c laimed, issuing on the c ontrary, several post-dated c heques in the plaintiff’s favour. Part-payment in the sum of $35,972.43 was made between January 2003 and June 2003. The final part payment of $3,500 was made on 28 June 2003. After failing to rec eive the balanc e of the outstanding amount from the defendant, the plaintiff proc eeded in ac c ordanc e with GBC’s purported mandate to c omplete the Cheque for that amount. The Cheque was then deposited with the plaintiff’s bank for c learanc e, but to no avail. When the Cheque was returned, the plaintiff made a personal c laim against GBC. GBC denied any liability with regard to the Cheque and proc eedings were then initiated by the plaintiff against GBC for failing to honour his liability on the Cheque. I deal with this c laim separately in my judgment in _City Hardware Pte Ltd v Goh Boon Chye_ <span class="citation">[2005] SGHC 25</span>. 


**The statutory objective of the MLA** 

19     Farwell J, in examining the _raison d’être_ of the English Money-lenders Ac t 1900 (c 51) in _Litchfield v Dreyfus_ [1906] 1 KB 584, observed at 590: 

 The Ac t was intended to apply only to persons who are really c arrying on the business of moneylending as a business, not to persons who lend money as an inc ident of another business or to a few old friends by way of friendship. This particular Act was supposed to be required to save the foolish from the extortion of a certain class of the community who are c alled money-lenders as an offensive term. [emphasis added] 

20     The Singapore Court of Appeal in _Lorrain Esme Osman v Elders Finance Asia Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 369</span> at 378, [39] endorsed these observations and stated “what he [Farwell J] said in respec t of the English Money-lenders Ac t 1900 is equally true of the [MLA]”. 

21     A helpful c onspec tus of the views that the English Selec t Committee took into ac c ount in enac ting the English Money-lenders Ac t 1900 is c ontained in the Crowther Committee’s _Report on Consumer Credit_ (Cmnd 4596, 1971) at para 2.1.22: 

 ... Muc h of the evidenc e given to the Committee, and to its suc c essor appointed in 1898, was c onc erned with suc h vic tims of the rapac ious moneylender as the widow forc ed to borrow on a bill of sale of her household effec ts, and the young son of the aristoc rac y who in the c ourse of sowing his wild oats ran up large debts, at exorbitant interest, whic h his family were later blac kmailed into paying to avoid the public ity of c ourt proc eedings. The 1898 Committee took a wide and humane view of its task and in its report expressed grave concern as to the harmful social consequences of moneylending by professional moneylenders at high rates of interest. The Committee drew attention to numerous abuses – including extortionate rates of interest, concealment of the terms of the contract from the borrower and ruthless enforcement measures – and recommended widespread reforms. The resulting legislation, namely the Moneylenders Ac t 1900, was the first enac tment spec ific ally regulating the business of moneylending otherwise than by pledge. [emphasis added] 

22     A c ourt has to bear in mind these c ruc ial observations when interpreting and applying the provisions of the MLA. It c annot be denied that _ex facie_ , its provisions have an extensive reac h appearing to embrac e a myriad of c ommerc ial situations. In my view, it would nonetheless be wholly inappropriate to apply the MLA to c ommerc ial transac tions between experienc ed business persons or entities, whic h do not _prima facie_ have the c harac teristic s of moneylending. Having said that, I am c onstrained to observe that the position c ould be quite different if the parties had wilfully attempted to struc ture a transac tion so as to evade the applic ation of the MLA. For good measure, I also emphasise that a person or entity that c arries on a business with the primary objec t of c onduc ting unlic ensed moneylending c annot avoid the severe c onsequenc es of an infrac tion of the MLA’s provisions by pointing out the benefits the borrower has rec eived or derived from the transac tions. The c ourt has no alternative but to give effec t to the drac onian c onsequenc es of an infrac tion in the event that the MLA is offended. 

**The task of the court** 

23     The MLA prohibits the business of moneylending and not the ac t of moneylending: _Subramaniam Dhanapakiam v Ghaanthimathi_ [1991] SLR 432. While the MLA defines a moneylender as a person “whose business is that of moneylending”, it does not assist in explic itly defining what c onstitutes lending or the loan of money. In this c ontext, I find the disc ussion in Clifford L Pannam, 


_The Law of Money Lenders in Australia and New Zealand_ (The Law Book Company Limited, 1965) at p 6, to be of great assistanc e in both c onstruing and applying the MLA. The learned author states: 

 A loan of money may be defined, in general terms, as a simple c ontrac t whereby one person (“the lender”) pays or agrees to pay a sum of money in c onsideration of a promise by another person (“the borrower”) to repay the money upon demand or at a fixed date. The promise of repayment may or may not be c oupled with a promise to pay interest on the money so paid. The essenc e of the transac tion is the promise of repayment. As Lowe J. put it in a judgment delivered on behalf of himself and Gavan Duffy and Martin JJ.: “‘Lend’ in its ordinary meaning in our view imports an obligation on the borrower to repay.” Without that promise, for example, the old indebitatus c ount of money lent would not lay. Repayment is the ingredient which links together the definitions of “loan” to be found in the Oxford English Dictionary , the various legal dic tionaries and the text books. In essence then a loan is a payment of money to or for someone on the condition that it will be repaid. [emphasis added] 

24     A loan need not be given direc tly to the borrower. It suffic es that the borrower gives direc tions on the disbursement of the moneys. What c onstitutes lending must of c ourse remain a question of fac t in every c ase. Careful c onsideration has to be given to the form and substanc e of the transac tion as well as the parties’ position and relationship in the c ontext of the entire fac tual matrix. It is axiomatic that if there has been no lending there c an be no moneylending. 

25     It ought to be stressed, however, that the c ourt ought not to be overzealous in analysing or dec onstruc ting a transac tion in order to infer and/or c onc lude that the objec t of the transac tion was to lend money. Salutary advic e against adopting suc h an investigative fac tual witc h-hunt is to be found in the seminal dec ision of _Chow Yoong Hong v Choong Fah Rubber Manufactory_ [1962] AC 209 (“ _Chow Yoong Hong_ ”) at 216 where Lord Devlin stated with his c ustomary c larity and authoritativeness: 

 The fundamental error that underlies the defendants’ c ase on both groups of c heques is that bec ause they were, so they say, in need of ready c ash, and bec ause the plaintiff supplied them with it and made, if he did, a profit out of doing so, therefore there was a loan and a c ontrac t for its repayment. There are many ways of raising c ash besides borrowing. One is by selling bookdebts and another by selling unmatured bills, in eac h c ase for less than their fac e value. Another might be to buy goods on c redit or against a post-dated c heque and immediately sell them in the market for c ash. Their Lordships are, of c ourse, aware, as was Branson J., that transac tions of this sort c an easily be used as a c loak for moneylending. The task of the court in such cases is clear. It must first look at the nature of the transaction which the parties have agreed. If in form it is not a loan, it is not to the point to say that its object was to raise money for one of them or that the parties could have produced the same result more conveniently by borrowing and lending money. But if the c ourt c omes to the c onc lusion that the form of the transac tion is only a sham and that what the parties really agreed upon was a loan which they disguised , for example, as a disc ounting operation, then the c ourt will c all it by its real name and ac t ac c ordingly. [emphasis added] 

26     This brief overview of moneylending legislation would be inc omplete if no referenc e is made to the oft-c ited dec ision of Branson J in _Olds Discount Co Ltd v John Playfair Ltd_ [1938] 3 All ER 275 at 280: 

 Unless there was evidenc e upon whic h it would be proper for the c ourt to ac t that the parties had deliberately entered into those doc uments knowing that they did not represent what had been agreed between them, but that what had been agreed between them was something quite 


 different, it seems to me that the proper course for the court to take is to accept the formal agreements between the parties, and to decide their rights according to those agreements. [emphasis added] 

**Judicial pragmatism** 

27     The c ommon law c ourts have approac hed the applic ation of the MLA and its progenitors with c aution and pragmatism. It has been rec ognised that these statutory provisions have the salutary objec tive of prosc ribing rapac ious c onduc t by unlic ensed and unprinc ipled moneylenders. Nonetheless, it has never been the objec tive of these statutes to prohibit or impede legitimate c ommerc ial interc ourse between c ommerc ial persons. Instanc es of this prac tic al approac h are rec urrent and are exemplified in several judic ial dec isions suc h as: 

 ( a ) Olds Discount Co Ltd v John Playfair Ltd , where it was held that the sale of book debts is not a moneylending transac tion; 

 ( b) Chow Yoong Hong , where it was held that disc ounting c heques does not amount to moneylending; 

 (c ) A J Brush Ltd v Ralli Bros (Securities) Ltd (1967) 117 New LJ 212, where it was held that investing is not moneylending; and 

 (d) Frank H Wright (Constructions) Ltd v Frodoor Ltd [1967] 1 All ER 433, where it was held that issuing houses do not c onduc t moneylending. 

28     The Singapore c ourts have also invariably taken a pragmatic approac h in determining whether a transac tion offends both the letter and spirit of the MLA. Lord Devlin’s _dictum_ in _Chow Yoong Hong_ has been c onsistently applied by the c ourts. If transac tions are not loans in nature or in form, the law will be slow to infer or impute a relationship of moneylending. I shall briefly refer to some rec ent dec isions. In _Nissho Iwai International (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Kohinoor Impex Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1995] 3 SLR 268</span> at 273–275, [13] and [18], Lim Teong Qwee JC observed: 

 In eac h c ase the arrangements must be c onsidered as a whole and the substanc e looked at to see if the transac tions c an be c ategorized as moneylending transac tions and whether any money was lent. 

 ... I think not a few importers who use the available letter of c redit lines of banking fac ilities of their business assoc iates from time to time would be surprised if they were told that they were borrowing money by doing that and that their business assoc iates would require a lic enc e under the Moneylenders Ac t. The second defendant himself saw the transactions as credit sales and not loans and it was only well into the hearing before the senior assistant registrar that the Moneylenders Act defence was raised. In my judgment there is no loan here at all. the plaintiff’s bank pays the supplier under the letter of c redit and looks to its own c ustomer the plaintiff for reimbursement. For arranging this and accepting liability to its bank the plaintiff charges a commission and reimbursement of the letter of credit amount and bank charges and interest. These transactions are not loans in nature or in form. There is no payment of money or agreement to pay money as a loan to the first defendant or to any other party authorized by the first defendant. There is no promise of repayment. 

 [emphasis added] 


29     In _Tan Sim Lay v Lim Kiat Seng_ <span class="citation">[1996] 2 SLR 769</span> at 777, [23], Choo Han Tec k JC (as he then was) had no hesitation in c onc luding that the prac tic e of businessmen who extended their banking fac ilities to assoc iates for a c ommission was not tantamount to moneylending: 

 There is implic it in Lord Devlin’s judgment that suc h transac tions at least have the c olour of a genuine c ommerc ial transac tion other than pure moneylending. The defenc e there failed bec ause the evidenc e adduc ed was inadequate to c onvinc e the c ourt that the transac tions were not only truly what they appeared. Similar transactions may well include the extension by one party for the use of another the credit facilities at the disposal of the former in consideration of payment of a commission. Such transactions per se may not be moneylending. In the present c ase, money was ac tually advanc ed whic h were [ sic ] to be repaid with interest fixed at an exorbitant rate. [emphasis added] 

30     In _Ding Leng Kong v Mok Kwong Yue_ <span class="citation">[2003] 4 SLR 637</span>, Woo Bih Li J had to determine whether c ertain advanc es for equity investment amounted to loans. In determining that the subjec t transac tions did not amount to moneylending, Woo J astutely observed at [56]: 

 While I agree with various pleaded defenc es that Ding had taken advantage of the situation, that does not nec essarily make him a moneylender within the Ac t. Neither does it make Ding’s actions so unconscionable as to deny him the reliefs he seeks. The transactions were at arm’s length between commercially-minded persons. After all, Ding was taking the risk that he might not be repaid even the principal, a risk which has become more real as developments have shown. [emphasis added] 

**Analysis of the rival contentions** 

31     The c orrec t approac h to be taken in determining whether a business transac tion amounts to moneylending has been ac c urately and helpfully set out in Pannam’s treatise ([23] _supra_ ) at p 31: 

1\. In dec iding whether an agreement c onstitutes a loan the first step is to c arefully examine the nature of the agreement itself. 

 2. If the agreement does not c onstitute a loan then, providing it is genuine, it is irrelevant that: 

 (a) it was prepared in that form for the express purpose of avoiding the money lenders legislation; or, 

 ( b ) it c ould have ac hieved the same result by being prepared in the form of a c ontrac t of loan. 

3\. Onc e it is established that an agreement, whic h genuinely embodies the terms that the parties have agreed upon, does not c onstitute a loan that is the end of the question. 

 4. If however the evidenc e shows that an agreement is only a c loak or mask to c over the real nature of the transac tion entered into between the parties then a c ourt is entitled to go behind the form of the agreement. 

 5. The onus of adduc ing suc h evidenc e and of proving suc h an allegation lies on the person who makes it. 


6\. A c ourt has power to dec lare that the real nature of the transac tion so revealed is a loan despite the form of the agreement. 

32     I should state at the outset that I found GBC a most unsatisfac tory witness. Both his affidavit evidenc e and his oral testimony were inundated with glaring and jarring inc onsistenc ies. His oral testimony was punc tuated by long pauses and he was frequently unable to explain his departures from his earlier written testimony. He attempted to play down these differenc es by c laiming he was not well educ ated and that he did not “fully understand what was in the affidavit”. In spite of these c laims, he c ame ac ross as a shrewd business operator who was prepared to state whatever it took to stave off his c urrent financ ial diffic ulties. His evidenc e was c harac terised by his ability and willingness to manipulate fac ts, real or fic titious. LCC, on the other hand, c ame ac ross as a relatively straightforward businessman. While he was c ertainly not a naïve businessman, green at his gills, I was satisfied that he had implic itly trusted GBC, ac c epting what he told him at fac e value in c onnec tion with the Aloh transac tions. The parties had a c lose and profitable trading relationship before the defendant’s defaults oc c urred. It must also be borne in mind that throughout their dec ade-long relationship, GBC had honoured his c ommitments; furthermore, his related c ompanies had been prompt and good paymasters. While there were a few c reases in LCC’s evidenc e, he c ame ac ross, in the final analysis, as truthful on the material issues relevant to these proc eedings. 

33     GBC reluc tantly c onc eded in c ross-examination that he viewed the relevant transac tions as “normal like business” until he rec eived legal advic e late in the day in relation to the plaintiff’s c laim for the outstanding amounts. In essenc e, the plaintiff’s response to the defendant’s defenc e of moneylending is that GBC c ould not direc tly obtain banking fac ilities bec ause of his weak c redit standing with financ ial institutions. The business arrangements the parties entered into allowed the defendant to utilise the plaintiff’s banking fac ilities. The transac tions were not shams. Eac h of them was underpinned by the ac tual sale and purc hase of tangible goods. GBC ac knowledged that the plaintiff was entitled to believe that ac tual goods were transac ted: 

 Q: But what we are saying is that there were ac tual goods involved, and if you say there were no ac tual goods, I put it to you, the plaintiff was not aware of that; do you agree or disagree? 

 A: I agree. 

34     The defendant has pleaded that the plaintiff’s c laim is unenforc eable as it is grounded on moneylending. Curiously, however, it pleads that the purported moneylending was to Aloh and not to the defendant or GBC. When pressed, GBC had no alternative but to ac knowledge that there were no doc uments to substantiate this c ontention. In truth the plaintiff never looked to Aloh for payment and there were no doc uments substantiating the existenc e of any loan to Aloh or any undertaking or assumption by Aloh to ac c ept responsibility for any loan or dues to the plaintiff. While there is some evidenc e of GBC direc ting payment of some Aloh c heques to the plaintiff, this never resulted in a novated relationship between the plaintiff and Aloh. Indeed, GBC unwittingly c onc eded that there was “no point in invoic ing Aloh, if you invoic e Aloh, then Aloh have to invoic e Kenric h again [ _sic_ ]”. This offers a signific ant insight into the standing and financ ial c redibility of Aloh. Aloh was on any ac c ount a shell c ompany that GBC had deployed to mask his interest in the front end of the Aloh transac tions. The following testimony of GBC during the proc eedings is pertinent: 

 Court: You see, Mr Goh, there are two types of transac tions you had with Mr Lau; one was overseas trade ... – two transac tions were quite different, am I c orrec t? 

 A: No, but you think – you know the overseas trade is only for a few bills after that I stop, 


 then I use Aloh to filter off, not to let him know where my supplier c ome from, bec ause he not only dealt with me, he dealt with my former partner whic h is – both of us are c ompetitors, that’s why I had to use Aloh to filter off all the things not to let him know that, okay I’m buying from Newlane, I’m buying from different suppliers. 

 Court: You have not said all that on affidavit. 

 A: Yes, I never write in the affidavit, but that is our business way of doing, I c an show you all the bills whic h I – 

 Court: So you did not want Mr Lau to know really who your suppliers were? 

 A: Yes, bec ause until today he still dealt with my partners. 

 ... 

 Q: So you want to stop that and you put Aloh into the pic ture? 

 A: Yes. 

 ... 

 Court: Tell me Mr Goh, you say [you] did not want Mr Lau to know who your overseas suppliers were bec ause you were c onc erned he would do business with them direc tly? 

 A: Yes, bec ause, you know why, until today he still dealt with my partner, also elec tronic goods, same as what I dealt now. 

 Court: When you say Mr Lau would do business with them direc tly, he would engage – you were afraid, onc e he knew the names, of doing purc hases direc tly from them. 

 A: Bec ause there’s a few oc c asions it happens, same produc t, different names. It happens to me; same produc ts, everything the same exc ept the brands, different, on my c ompetitors in Malaysia, it happens to me. 

 Court : Just let me follow up on this; you were concerned that Mr Lau would, if he knew who your suppliers were, do business with them directly? 

 A: Yes. 

 Court: But if he’s just a moneylender, why would he want to do business – 

 A : Because he know a lot of electronics people. Not only I’m lending from, there’s many other people who is lending from him. 

 [emphasis added] 

35     It is signific ant that GBC sought to shield the identities of his suppliers from the plaintiff. It c annot be gainsaid that the plaintiff was legitimately engaged in substantial and legitimate business ac tivities. While it left all arrangements to GBC, the business being transac ted was of a nature that had a c lose if not overlapping similarity to its princ ipal business of being a distributor of household applianc es and goods. I should also add that the defenc e did not adduc e an atom of reliable evidenc e 


to prove that the plaintiff c onduc ted similar transac tions with other parties or was otherwise engaged in the business of moneylending. 

36     The pleaded defenc e raises two princ ipal issues. Was any money lent to Aloh, and if so, was the plaintiff a moneylender as defined by the MLA? It c annot be c redibly argued that there were loans or lending to Aloh by the plaintiff. As explained earlier at [24] above, the essenc e of lending is that it entails a c orresponding obligation of repayment. There is no evidenc e (even on the basis that GBC’s testimony is unquestioningly ac c epted) of Aloh having borrowed or having been lent any money by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had never invoic ed Aloh for any of the transac tions. The plaintiff has made no c laim against Aloh. GBC never c laimed that Aloh had been lent money until these proc eedings were c ommenc ed. Indeed, prior to these proc eedings the defendant ac c epted that the obligation to repay the outstanding amounts was its sole responsibility and had attempted to settle the outstandings direc tly through, _inter alia_ , post-dated c heques. Given that the defendant now c laims Aloh was a fig leaf, it is dubious how the defendant c an now turn around and c laim that Aloh was the princ ipal that liaised with the plaintiff in arranging for the alleged moneylending and/or was the borrower. If there was any lending by the plaintiff, it was c ertainly not to Aloh, or at Aloh’s behest. The plaintiff was dealing with GBC and the defendant. The plaintiff did not look to Aloh for repayment. 

37     The defendant has not had the temerity to suggest, either in its pleadings or submissions, that the loan was to GBC. Clearly this c ontention is not open to it given the separate legal personalities of the c orporate entities involved. Besides, the plaintiff has not made any c laim against GBC on the basis of the Aloh transac tions _per se_. The c laim against GBC is grounded on the Cheque, whic h is an altogether different c ause of ac tion. While the Defenc e has not pleaded that the moneylending was at the behest of the defendant, I pause briefly to c onsider this point. It is c rystal c lear that the defendant did not ask the plaintiff to “lend” money to Aloh. If at all there was a “loan”, the request to “lend” was made by GBC alone and not the defendant. 

38     On the basis of the existing fac tual matrix, I determine that it would be wholly inappropriate to view the Aloh transac tions as moneylending. It is inc ontrovertible that eac h of the transac tions involved the purc hase of real goods by the defendant. GST was paid for the subjec t goods both when the plaintiff purc hased them from Aloh and when the defendant in turn re-purc hased them from the plaintiff. The transac tions were not struc tured or intentionally disguised to evade the MLA. GBC’s wife also ac c epted that the suppliers to Aloh and the defendant would not have known that the transac tions were “paper transac tions”, and an impression that they were “real transac tions” prevailed. 

39     It seems highly improbable to me that if these were true “loans” the plaintiff would have been satisfied with a relatively modest mark-up on the purc hase pric e of the subjec t goods in eac h transac tion. Eac h transac tion was individually negotiated and there was no disc ussion, let alone agreement, for c ontinuing interest to be paid in the event of any default by the defendant. It must be emphasised that the defendant had to pay the same agreed invoic ed amount whether it was prompt or late in effec ting payment. The plaintiff made no c laim for ac c ruing interest in these proc eedings. It is signific ant that the highest mark-up tagged on by the plaintiff in the resales to the defendant was about nine per c ent more than the original pric e. This would have inc luded a reasonable profit after taking into ac c ount the bank c harges and interest that it had to pay to its bank. The observations of Lord Devlin in _Chow Yoong Hong_ ([25] _supra_ ) at 217 on what c onstitutes “interest” are salient in this c ontext: 

 Interest postulates the making of a loan and then it runs from day to day until repayment of the loan, its total depending on the length of the loan. ... It appears to their Lordships to be very improbable that if the plaintiff was truly a moneylender and there were truly loans for whic h the 


 post-dated c heques were only a form of sec urity, he would have been c ontent that the rate of disc ount whic h he c onsidered remunerative should apply only until maturity of the c heques (never in any of the 16 c ases longer than a month) and thereafter, if the sec urity proved valueless, to take until repayment only suc h rate of interest as the c ourt awarded. 

40     Admittedly the plaintiff did not take possession of the subjec t goods and left the implementation of the c ontrac t administration to GBC: 

 Q: [I]t would be reasonable for the plaintiff to assume that you had made the arrangement, as in the c ase of Thunderflash, where there is no overseas supply, am I right? Agreed? 

 A: Yes. 

 Q: I put it to you, Mr Goh, that the plaintiff would not know whether or not any physic al delivery of goods took plac e between Aloh and Kenric h; you would agree with me? 

 A: Yes. 

41     It is trite law that a purc haser need not take possession for delivery to be c omplete. In prac tic e many c ommerc ial transac tions are effec ted without possession of goods c hanging hands as in the c ase of “string c ontrac ts”. GBC c ould rightly be viewed as the plaintiff’s agent in taking c onstruc tive possession of the subjec t goods. It also bears mention that other than in the Aloh transac tions, the plaintiff’s forwarding agent, Confi, took possession of the goods and delivered the same to the defendant. It would not be c orrec t to view either these transac tions or the Aloh transac tions as sham transac tions. As pointed out earlier at [25], it is immaterial that the objec t of the exerc ise was to raise money for the purc hase of the goods. The c rux of the matter is whether these transac tions, whic h were supported by regular doc umentation and on whic h the relevant revenue duty was paid, were struc tured to avoid the MLA or had c harac teristic s offensive to the MLA. The answer is no. Indeed, if any party was guilty of subterfuge, it was GBC on behalf of the defendant. The following exc hange c learly explains why GBC adopted the Aloh struc tured transac tions: 

 Q: If that is c orrec t then this arrangement is not Mr Lau’s idea. 

 A: That is not Mr Lau’s idea. The first thing is not to let him know about my suppliers; sec ondly it is bec ause I am buying stoc k from the agent. 

 Q: So you c reated Aloh to prevent him from knowing who your suppliers were. 

 A: Yes. 

42     There may perhaps be another legal prism with whic h to view the subjec t transac tions even if they are not ac c epted at fac e value. It is undisputed that the defendant c ould not obtain banking fac ilities, whereas the plaintiff, given its standing, had substantial banking fac ilities. The plaintiff fac ilitated the purc hase of the goods by the defendant by making arrangements with its bank to pay direc tly for the purc hase of the goods. It c harged a fee for making these arrangements and absorbed the risk of a default by the defendant. These transac tions c ould be viewed as a “sale of c redit fac ilities” by the defendant. The arrangements c an also be c onsidered, without any gloss to the fac ts, as c ommission transac tions for banking fac ilities whic h the defendant c ould not direc tly obtain on its own standing. The mark-up or the profit element was fixed without any provision for ac c ruing interest in the event of default. Eac h of the transac tions between the plaintiff and GBC and/or the 


defendant was an arms-length transac tion between experienc ed c ommerc ial persons. The mark-up by the plaintiff was negotiated on a transac tional basis. The mark-up appeared to follow a standard formula and did not exc eed nine per c ent of the ac tual purc hase pric e paid by the plaintiff. This markup was neither exorbitant nor unusual. GBC was a shrewd operator and had managed to profitably operate his business with these arrangements in plac e until he ran into his present financ ial diffic ulties. It is preposterous that he should now not only attempt to portray these transac tions as ac ts of moneylending but that he should c laim for restitution apropos the earlier transac tions. As if defaulting on his c ontrac tual obligations to the plaintiff was not suffic ient, he now makes an avaric ious attempt to rec oup a windfall. This must be denigrated as unprinc ipled and unseemly c ommerc ial c onduc t. 

43     The plaintiff has in the alternative submitted that it c omes within exc eption (c ) in s 2 of the MLA. I agree with Woo Bih Li J’s observation in _Ding Leng Kong v Mok Kwong Yue_ ([30] _supra_ ) at [46] that this plea has to be expressly pleaded if a party intends to rely on it. I therefore hold that as the plaintiff has not pleaded this exc eption it is prec luded from relying on it. 

44     The defendant also disputes that the amount c laimed by the plaintiff is c orrec t. I note in this c onnec tion that the parties have had a running ac c ount for a substantial period. Until the present proc eedings were c ommenc ed, the defendant did not take issue with the amount c laimed, being c ontent to ask for more time and issuing post-dated c heques in partial settlement of the outstanding amount. The defendant has not adduc ed any c redible evidenc e or primary doc uments to c ontradic t the invoic ed amounts on whic h the plaintiff’s c laim is founded. The defendant’s c heques that would purportedly show the payments made to the plaintiff were not produc ed in these proc eedings. GBC’s wife c onc eded in c ross-examination that the amount c laimed to have been paid by the defendant was “unsupported” by any primary doc umentary evidenc e. Finally, I also note that LCC was subjec ted to only a perfunc tory c ross-examination on this issue. LCC’s testimony that regular monthly statements of ac c ount were furnished to the defendant was adamantine. He also resolutely maintained that the ac c ounts were properly maintained and no objec tions had been raised by GBC or the defendant c hallenging the ac c urac y of the monthly statements. 

45     In the c irc umstanc es, I am satisfied that the invoic ed amounts ac c urately represent the agreements reac hed between the parties and that the defendant has no satisfac tory evidenc e to show that the amounts stated therein have been inc orrec tly arrived at or should have been reduc ed bec ause of previous payments. The plaintiff is entitled to judgment for the amount c laimed, namely the sum of $576,621.54 with interest fixed at 6% from the date of c ommenc ement of these proc eedings to date. The defendant’s c ounterc laim for restitution is dismissed. The plaintiff is entitled to have the taxed c osts of the proc eedings subjec t to deduc tions arising from any previous order(s) of c osts in the defendant’s favour. 

46     For c ompleteness, I should add that I disallow the plaintiff’s c laim for $5,203.99 being the alleged freight forwarding c harges paid to Confi for the Overseas transac tions. There was no evidenc e of any agreement by the defendant to pay this amount. In any event, it appears to me that these c harges were part of the servic es that the plaintiff rendered to the defendant in the subjec t transac tions and were therefore already ac c ounted for in the invoic ed amounts. The defendant is entitled to the c osts of the work inc urred in resisting this c laim, whic h I fix at $750. 

**Final observations** 

47     The defenc e of moneylending is often invoked in Singapore by unmeritorious defendants who are desperate to stave off their financ ial woes. Suc h defendants should not regard the MLA as a legal panac ea. It should be viewed as a sc heme of soc ial legislation designed to regulate rapac ious and 


predatory c onduc t by unsc rupulous unlic ensed moneylenders. Its pro-c onsumer protec tion ethos was never intended to impede legitimate c ommerc ial interc ourse or to sterilise the flow of money. It is not meant to c urtail the legitimate financ ial ac tivity of c ommerc ial entities that are c apable of making c onsidered business dec isions. The c ourt has always taken and will c ontinue to take a pragmatic approac h in assessing situations when this defenc e is raised. The MLA is not invariably c ontravened in transac tions where the objec t of the transac tion is to raise money. In the final analysis, the ec onomic objec tive of an arrangement to provide c redit should not be c onfused with its legal nature. 

48     The viability of small businesses often depends on their ability to raise c apital, to improve their liquidity and/or to obtain c redit. They are often unable to obtain c redit fac ilities from established financ ial institutions as a result of their lac k of standing, unpredic table c ash flow and higher risk profile. It is c learly not the objec tive or intention of the MLA to prevent or impede legitimate businesses from entering into legitimate arrangements for improving c ash flow; nor is it the objec tive of the MLA to c onstric t the flow of financ ial liquidity in c ommerc e among smaller businesses. 

49     In this c ontext the time may have c ome for a holistic review of the MLA. It is to be noted that similar legislation in England and Australia have long sinc e been repealed. In their plac e now are more spec ific and c arefully c rafted legislation governing the provision of c onsumer c redit. In my view, the MLA, while still serving an important, nec essary and admirable soc ial objec tive, requires c onsiderable fine-tuning to meet the exigenc ies of the modern business environment. It is now a blunt instrument. The soc ial and business environment has seen a sea c hange over the last c entury sinc e the progenitor of the MLA was first enac ted in 1902. Our present legislation is largely modelled upon the Straits Settlements Moneylenders Ordinanc e 1935 (No 6 of 1935) whic h in turn was c losely fashioned on the English Money-lenders Ac t 1900. Should not the MLA be now reviewed against the wider bac kdrop of modern c onsumer c redit polic ies c urrently relevant to Singapore? 

50     Lamentably, desperate defendants c ounselled in turn by imaginative c ounsel frequently invoke the defenc e of “moneylending” in unmeritorious c irc umstanc es. Claims that ought to be dec ided summarily morph into inordinately long and protrac ted trials simply bec ause “triable” issues have purportedly been raised, or more ac c urately, “c reated”. As a result, even in relatively straightforward matters, the final and usually inevitable determinations in favour of legitimate c laimants are delayed, and substantial and irrec overable legal c osts are also inc urred – as amply illustrated in the present instanc e where the defendant has bec ome dormant. It c annot be gainsaid that justic e delayed is often justic e denied. Furthermore, valuable judic ial time is unnec essarily expended in the laborious effort required to winnow the wheat from the c haff. In the c irc umstanc es, there is a c ompelling c ase for the reform of the MLA to redress the c urrently unsatisfac tory position in this area of the law.
