**Steven Chong J:** 

**Introduction** 

1       This c ase arose from the alleged mismanagement of a c ompany by a direc tor who was also its 20 perc ent shareholder. There were only two direc tors at the material times, and the other direc tor owns the balanc e 80 perc ent shareholding. This c ase gives new meaning to the phrase “family-run business”. It is alleged by both direc tors that eac h had plac ed their wives, daughter and son and even a mistress on the c ompany’s payroll even though none of them were ever truthfully employees in the stric t sense of the word. 

2       So what brought about the disharmony whic h led to this ac tion? In or around Marc h 2009, the minority shareholder informed the majority shareholder that the c ompany needed a bank loan to sec ure a performanc e bond for a potential projec t as the funds of the c ompany were running low and that the c ompany’s expenses had inc reased. This prompted the majority shareholder to look into the c ompany’s financ es as he had always been under the distinc t impression that the c ompany’s financ es were healthy. Certified public ac c ountants, BDO LLP (“BDO”) were engaged to c onduc t a forensic examination of the ac c ounts. The investigations eventually exposed many alleged financ ial misdeeds by the minority shareholder, inc luding the fac t that his wife was paid salaries for 17 years, even though she had never reported for work. When the minority shareholder was c onfronted that his wife was a “ _phantom_ ” employee who has been rec eiving salaries from the c ompany without any proper basis, he retorted by alleging that the majority shareholder had likewise plac ed his wife and even his mistress on the payroll albeit over a shorter period. 

3       As the salary payments were made over 17 years, not unexpec tedly, limitation of ac tion 


bec ame a key _legal_ issue in this dispute. In this regard, it is c ommon ground between the parties that if the minority shareholder/direc tor is found to be in breac h of his fiduc iary duties in c ausing the c ompany to pay salaries to the “ _phantom_ ” employee, the c laim against him would not be statute barred. However, it is c ontended by the minority shareholder’s wife who rec eived the salary payments that she would nonetheless be entitled to invoke the limitation defenc e, notwithstanding that limitation may not be available to her husband. This raises an interesting question of whether there is any rational basis to justify the availability of the limitation defenc e to an ac c essory in c irc umstanc es when the princ ipal wrongdoer is unable to rely on it. 

**_The Parties_** 

4       The plaintiff, Panweld Trading Pte Ltd (“Panweld”), is a loc al private c ompany and is in the business of manufac turing spray painting booths as well as other repair and engineering works. 

5       The 1st defendant, Yong Kheng Leong (“Mr Yong”), was appointed as a direc tor of Panweld on or around 15 May 1985 and remained so until his resignation on 21 May 2009. There is some dispute 

as to whether he was Panweld’s Managing Direc tor, whic h he denies [note: 1] , but nothing really turns on his disputed status as Managing Direc tor. However, it is not disputed that Mr Yong was at least its 

General Manager. [note: 2] 

6       The 2nd defendant, Lim Ai Cheng (“Mdm Lim”), and the 3 rd defendant, Yong June Meng Gary, 

are the wife and son of Mr Yong respec tively, while the 4th defendant, Sanware Engineering Servic es (“Sanware”), was one of Panweld’s suppliers of spare parts and mac hinery. All dealings between Sanware and Panweld were c onduc ted through Mr Yong. 

7       The third party, Mr Loh Yong Lim (“Mr Loh”), was and still is a direc tor of Panweld and the majority shareholder, who owned 80 perc ent of the shares in Panweld until Dec ember 2001, when he transferred 20 perc ent of his shareholding to his son, Mr Loh Chiang Tien. Mr Loh’s son was also appointed a direc tor of Panweld in April 2002. The balanc e 20 perc ent was and still remains held by Mr Yong. The Third Party c laim was brought by Mr Yong against Mr Loh on the basis that if he is found to be liable to Panweld for the salary payments to Mdm Lim, he should be entitled to an indemnity/c ontribution from Mr Loh bec ause the payments were made with his knowledge and 

approval. [note: 3] The Third Party ac tion would logic ally be a non-starter if I find that Mr Loh was not aware and/or did not approve the salary payments to Mdm Lim. In my view, the Third Party ac tion was ill-advised bec ause if Mr Loh had approved the payments, Mr Yong would not be liable. On the other hand, if there was no approval, there c an be no rec ourse against Mr Loh for any indemnity. In either event, there is no merit in the Third Party ac tion. 

8       In the c ourse of the trial, the c laim against the 3rd defendant for the wrongful payment of a month’s salary was sensibly dropped as it only involves a very small sum of money. 

9       At the c onc lusion of the trial, the c laim against Sanware was amic ably settled in c irc umstanc es whic h I will elaborate upon below. 

**_The claims_** 

10     When the trial started, Panweld pursued five independent heads of c laim against the various defendants. All heads of c laim arose from the alleged mismanagement of Panweld by Mr Yong. The largest c laim relates to salaries paid to Mdm Lim from 1992 to 2009 amounting to the total sum of 


$873,959.20. Panweld c laims that Mdm Lim was a “ _phantom_ ” employee and was therefore wrongfully paid. 

11     The other four c laims c omprise: 

 (a) the sum of $226,636 being rental paid by Panweld’s tenant, Sun Power Engineering, whic h were wrongly c redited to Mr Yong’s direc tor’s ac c ount with Panweld; 

 (b) the sum of $178,810.01 being unauthorised expenses c laimed and paid to Mr Yong; 

 (c ) the sum of $35,238.68 being sec ret c ommissions purportedly paid by Mr Yong to Panweld’s c ustomers; and 

 (d) the sum of $95,261 being the amount whic h was refunded and rec eived by Mr Yong in respec t of inflated invoic es raised by Sanware on the instruc tions of Mr Yong. 

12     At the c lose of the trial on 9 February 2012, the parties reac hed a settlement on the above four c laims, without admission of liability, on the following terms: 

 (a) Panweld shall retain the sum of $265,000 whic h was paid by Mr Yong to Panweld prior to the c ommenc ement of the ac tion; 

 (b) Mr Yong withdraws his c ounterc laim in this ac tion; 

 (c ) Mr Yong relinquishes all his rights in respec t of the balanc e sum standing in his direc tor’s ac c ount with Panweld; 

 (d) as a c onsequenc e of the above settlement, Sanware is released from all further liabilities with no order as to c osts against Sanware; and 

 (e) the c osts in respec t of the four c laims shall follow the event of the remaining c laim for the salaries paid to Mdm Lim. 

**Salaries paid to Mdm Lim** 

13     This dec ision will therefore only deal with the remaining c laim of the salaries whic h were paid and rec eived by Mdm Lim. It is not in dispute that for 17 years, from 1992 to 2009, Mdm Lim was paid 

a total sum of $873,959.20 as a “marketing exec utive” of Panweld. [note: 4] Mdm Lim’s salary payments were duly rec orded in Panweld’s monthly payroll rec ords. In addition, payments for Mdm Lim’s Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) c ontributions were regularly made by Panweld. Further, inc ome tax returns (“IR8A”) were also prepared by Panweld’s ac c ountants, Mr Quek Siew Ping (“Mr Quek”) and his predec essor, the late Mr Mic hael Loh, on behalf of Mdm Lim in respec t of her salaries. 

14     Panweld c laims that Mdm Lim was a “ _phantom worker_ ” in the sense that she was not an employee of Panweld as she had never reported for work at the offic e, nor rendered any servic e to 

Panweld. [note: 5] Panweld c laims that Mr Yong had ac ted in breac h of his fiduc iary duty as a direc tor of Panweld in c hannelling funds belonging to Panweld in the guise of the salary payments to Mdm Lim. [note: 6] Panweld also c laims that, by reason of Mdm Lim’s knowing rec eipt of the wrongful salary 

payments and/or dishonest assistanc e in Mr Yong’s breac h, she holds those sums on c onstruc tive 


trust for and on behalf of Panweld. [note: 7] 

15     Both Mr Yong and Mdm Lim deny liability on several grounds: 

 (a) Mdm Lim was employed as a marketing exec utive of Panweld with the knowledge and approval of Mr Loh [note: 8] ; 

 (b) Mdm Lim had in fac t rendered servic es to Panweld as a marketing exec utive [note: 9] ; and 

 (c ) the bulk of Mdm Lim’s salary was in fac t paid from Mr Yong’s salary inc rements, c ar allowanc e and bonuses. [note: 10] 

16     At the c lose of the trial on 9 February 2012, Counsel for Mr Yong and Mdm Lim, Mr Singa Retnam (“Mr Retnam”) ac c epted that, in the event that the salary payments are found to have been paid in breac h of Mr Yong’s fiduc iary duties, the c laims against Mr Yong would not be barred by the Limitation Ac t (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“the Limitation Ac t”). This is c ertainly the c orrec t position to take, as will be elaborated upon later. However, Mr Retnam argued that even if Mr Yong is found to have ac ted in breac h of his fiduc iary duties, Mdm Lim is nonetheless entitled to avail herself of the defenc e of limitation under s 6 of the Limitation Ac t, _ie_ , even if Mdm Lim is found to be liable to ac c ount as a c onstruc tive trustee, time had begun to run against Panweld from the dates of eac h payment and, c onsequently, the bulk of the c laim against her is time barred, exc ept for the last six years prec eding the c ommenc ement of this ac tion from 2004 to 2009. In this c onnec tion, it is agreed by both parties that if Mdm Lim is found not to fall within s 22(1) of the Limitation Ac t, the rec overable amount would be restric ted to $338,410 instead of $873,959.20. 

**_The evolving defences raised by Mr Yong and Mdm Lim_** 

17     It is perhaps apposite to c ommenc e this inquiry by first examining the pleaded defenc e of Mr Yong and Mdm Lim and to see how it has evolved over time. It is pertinent to highlight that the defenc e, whic h was jointly filed by Mr Yong and Mdm Lim, underwent several c hanges. When the defenc e was first filed on 11 Marc h 2010, Mr Yong c laimed that Mr Loh had plac ed his wife (“Mrs Loh”) and mistress (“Sook Min”) on the payroll in Marc h 1995, even though neither of them were 

employees of Panweld in any meaningful way. [note: 11] When Mr Yong expressed c onc ern over the employment of Mrs Loh and Sook Min, Mr Loh suggested that Mdm Lim be inc luded in the payroll as 

well in 1995. [note: 12] Therefore the essenc e of the original defenc e was that Mdm Lim was inc luded in Panweld’s payroll _at the suggestion_ of Mr Loh, in reac tion to Mr Yong’s c onc ern over the employment status of Mrs Loh and Sook Min. I shall refer to this as the “reac tion theory”. For ease of referenc e, I shall refer to Mdm Lim, Mrs Loh and Sook Min as “the three wives” c ollec tively. Implic it in this defenc e is that all three wives were plac ed on the payroll even though they were not required to render any servic e to Panweld. 

18     However, this defenc e morphed when it was amended on 13 April 2011. Mr Yong c laimed that Mdm Lim was _genuinely_ employed on a temporary basis to assist him in Panweld from 1992 to 1994, 

and thereafter, from 1995 on a full-time basis. [note: 13] It is apparent that by this amendment, Mr Yong had effec tively abandoned the original “reac tion theory” given that he ac c epts that Mdm Lim was plac ed on the payroll albeit on a “temporary basis” from 1992, well _before_ Mrs Loh and Sook Min in 1995. It did not esc ape my attention that the defenc e was amended some time _after_ Panweld’s Reply denying the alleged agreement and highlighting the fac t that Mrs Loh and Sook Min were only 

plac ed on the payroll long _after_ Mdm Lim had started rec eiving salary payments. [note: 14] 


19     The defenc e underwent a further c hange on 26 May 2011. For the first time, Mr Yong alleged 

that the employment of Mrs Loh and Sook Min was to reduc e taxes payable by Panweld. [note: 15] Mr Yong now c laims that Mdm Lim’s part-time salary from 1992 to 1994 was paid from Mr Yong’s bonuses and unused annual leave pay and that her full-time salary c omprised of three c omponents, one being her fixed salary of $1,125, the sec ond being the transfer of Mr Yong’s c ar allowanc e of 

$1,000 and the balanc e from Mr Yong’s annual inc rements and/or bonuses. [note: 16] Mr Yong alleged t ha t Mdm Lim’s fixed salary c omponent of $1,125 was derived from 25 perc ent of the c ollec tive salaries of Mrs Loh and Sook Min. The underlying rationale for the fixed c omponent of $1,125 was that based on Mr Yong’s 20 perc ent shareholding in Panweld, Mdm Lim should therefore be paid 20 perc ent of the salaries paid to Mr Loh’s wife and mistress (20 perc ent of Mr Loh’s 80 perc ent). 

20     It is therefore apparent that Mr Yong’s and Mdm Lim’s defenc e to a rather straightforward c laim had undergone several inexplic able amendments. The pleaded defenc e, even in its final form, is c onfusing and bizarre: 

 (a) It c laims that Mdm Lim was employed on a part-time basis from 1992 to 1994 with the approval of Mr Loh but her salary was in fac t paid from Mr Yong’s bonuses. In other words, she worked for free as far as Panweld was c onc erned in that the financ ial burden of Mdm Lim’s salary was borne by Mr Yong and not by Panweld. 

 (b) More than a year later, the defenc e was amended to c laim that Mdm Lim’s salary was made up of three c omponents, a point whic h was not previously raised. Apart from the fixed c omponent of $1,125, the balanc e was in fac t paid from Mr Yong’s c ar allowanc e and bonuses. In other words, he c ontinued to bear the bulk of the financ ial burden in employing Mdm Lim full-time for Panweld. 

 (c ) The c onvoluted c omponents to make up Mdm Lim’s elaborate salary struc ture do not lend c redenc e to her employment status as an ordinary “marketing exec utive”. 

21     In all the different versions of the defenc e, the c ommon denominator is that the employment of Mdm Lim was with the express approval of Mr Loh. This is the princ ipal _factual_ issue before me. This 

was flatly denied by Mr Loh. [note: 17] Before examining the evidenc e as to whether Mr Loh had in fac t approved Mdm Lim’s employment, it is important to explain the relevanc e of Mr Loh’s approval in the c ontext of Mdm Lim’s employment. It is nec essary to first state at the outset that there is no requirement in law that the employment of an employee suc h as a marketing exec utive must be approved by the board of direc tors or by all the shareholders. This is a matter typic ally dec ided by the person or persons vested with the management of the c ompany, suc h as a managing direc tor or general manager. It was admitted by Mr Loh in his Affidavit of Evidenc e in Chief (“AEIC”) that Mr Yong was “in c harge of and made all key dec isions and exerc ised full authority and c ontrol over the hiring of 

[Panweld’s] employees”. [note: 18] 

22     Whether Mr Yong had ac ted in breac h of his fiduc iary duties would depend on the c ourt’s determination of whether Mdm Lim was paid a salary, even though she neither reported for work nor performed any servic e for Panweld over the extended period when she was on the payroll. If I find that Mdm Lim was not an employee of Panweld in any meaningful sense of the word, it would follow that Mr Yong would have ac ted in breac h of his fiduc iary duties in c ausing Panweld to pay Mdm Lim’s salary for 17 years. On the other hand, if I find that Mdm Lim had in fac t provided servic es to Panweld as a “marketing exec utive”, the absenc e of Mr Loh’s approval, even if proved, bec omes moot. However, if I find otherwise, then Mr Loh’s approval would be relevant to establish that the salary payments to Mdm Lim were regularly made by Panweld with the approval of all shareholders 


(c omprising Mr Yong and Mr Loh), even though she may not in truth be an employee, or that the 

breac h by Mr Yong had been waived or “barred by ac quiesc enc e” as pleaded. [note: 19] 

**_Was Mdm Lim really an employee_** 

23     It must be borne in mind that it is the c urrent pleaded defenc e that Mdm Lim had _in fact_ performed servic es as a “marketing exec utive” to Panweld. It has not been suggested that she was entitled to rec eive the remunerat ion _solely_ bec ause she was listed as an employee on Panweld’s payroll. This defenc e in itself c ontradic ts the original defenc e that all three wives were to be paid even though they were not really employees. 

24     In her AEIC, Mdm Lim desc ribes her work in Panweld as c onduc ting surveys and market researc h of the pric es of goods sold by c ompetitors, sourc ing for new produc ts and performing duties as 

Mr Yong’s personal assistant inc luding typing and filing. [note: 20] Mdm Lim also c laims that she had 

ac c ompanied Mr Yong to meet Panweld’s c ustomers both during and after offic e hours. [note: 21] Her evidenc e as to the nature and sc ope of her work in Panweld was very general and when probed for supporting doc uments suc h as survey reports, broc hures and c atalogues for the new produc ts to 

establish her alleged nature of work, she was unable to produc e any. [note: 22] When asked what new 

produc ts she had introduc ed to Panweld, Mdm Lim initially referred to spray painting equipment. [note: 23] However, when she was reminded that spray painting equipment was already an _existing_ business, 

she had to c onc ede that she did not introduc e any _new_ produc t to Panweld. [note: 24] 

25     Two employees of Panweld, Mr Quek and Ms Choong Shu Fong (“Ms Choong”), testified that 

t hey had never seen Mdm Lim in Panweld’s offic e. [note: 25] Given that Mr Quek and Ms Choong had been working in Panweld sinc e the early 1990s, the likelihood of them not seeing her working in the offic e throughout her alleged 17 years of servic e in Panweld was highly improbable if she had in fac t worked in the offic e. When Mdm Lim was c ross-examined on whether anyone in Panweld had ever seen her doing typing and filing work, she ac c epted that no one had seen her in Panweld’s offic e as 

she was always “ _locked in [Mr Yong’s] office_ ”. [note: 26] Mdm Lim added that she had regularly visited Panweld’s offic e on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays and she further c laimed rather inc redulously that when she visited the offic e during working days, none of the staff ever saw her in the offic e for 17 years although she c laimed to have seen the staff members from inside the loc ked 

offic e of Mr Yong. [note: 27] In re-examination, when Mdm Lim was asked to identify a staff of Panweld whom she had met on Panweld premises, she c ould only name one Mr Sunny Ong of Sun Power 

Engineering who happened to be a tenant and not an employee of Panweld. [note: 28] He apparently met Mdm Lim at Panweld’s premises on a weekend in the c ontext of inviting Mdm Lim to his daughter’s 

wedding. [note: 29] This c ould hardly c onstitute evidenc e that she was “working” in Panweld’s offic e on weekends, as she alleged. It was only when she was reminded that Mr Sunny Ong was not a staff of Panweld when she said she also rec alled meeting Ms Choong, Mr Loh and one Alic e in the offic e. [note: 30] Mdm Lim was unable to c all any _independent_ witness to c orroborate her employment status 

in Panweld even though she c laims to have worked in Panweld for 17 years. 

26     When she was asked in re-examination to name some of Panweld’s c ompetitors in relation to her evidenc e that her job sc ope involved market researc h of the pric es of goods sold by Panweld’s 

c ompetitors, she rattled off a few names without explaining their relevanc e. [note: 31] Astonishingly, 

she identified Singapore Airlines as one of Panweld’s c ompetitors. [note: 32] It seems to me that she was merely repeating names, whic h she had memorised without understanding their signific anc e. I 


found her testimony about her alleged employment status and the nature of her alleged work to be entirely unsatisfac tory and wholly unreliable. It should not be overlooked that Mr Yong c laims that his 

wife was hired in 1992 bec ause he had diffic ulty finding suitable sec retarial assistanc e. [note: 33] If this was so, then there c an be no c onc eivable or ac c eptable explanation for suc h a pec uliar working arrangement. 

**_Mdm Lim’s salary structure_** 

27     The fac t that Mdm Lim c ould not have been a legitimate employee bec omes even c learer when Mr Yong’s and Mdm Lim’s evidenc e on the determination of her salary is c arefully sc rutinised. 

28     Mdm Lim c laims to have c ommenc ed her part-time work in 1992. [note: 34] It is perhaps helpful to begin this analysis by reviewing the c irc umstanc es of Mdm Lim’s first “ _pay cheque_ ”. Her salary payment for 1992 c an be trac ed to a handwritten doc ument dated 13 May 1992 wherein Mr Yong gratuitously dec lared for himself leave pay of $20,000, of whic h $15,000 was to be paid to Mdm Lim for her monthly salary of $3,000 from April to June, and sales c ommission ranging from $1,000 to 

$2,000 for the same period. [note: 35] This payment of $15,000 to Mdm Lim was in fac t reflec ted in the May 1992 payroll rec ord. Given that Mr Yong’s monthly salary at that time was only $4,500, leave pay of $20,000 would have been equivalent to about 4.5 months of leave. There is no evidenc e before the c ourt that he had ac c umulated or was entitled to suc h a generous leave when he dec lared the leave pay for himself. It is also extremely odd for a part-time employee to be paid in a lump sum for three months’ work in arrears. Further, there is no material to suggest that Mdm Lim had done any sales to justify any c ommission payments. Suc h an unusual pay arrangement leads me to the irresistible c onc lusion that she c ould not have been a _bona fide_ employee of Panweld. 

29     As stated earlier in [20] above, Mdm Lim c laims that her part-time salary was in fac t paid by Mr Yong from his unused leave and bonuses. From 1995 to 2009, she was paid on a full-time basis and her salary c uriously c hanged to inc orporate three c omponents, one being the fixed c omponent of $1,125 and the balanc e being transferred from Mr Yong’s bonuses and his alleged c ar allowanc e of 

$1,000. [note: 36] I shall refer to this as the “transfer salary” theory. The immediate observation I make about this rather bizarre salary arrangement is that if Mdm Lim was in fac t performing proper servic es as an employee of Panweld, there c ould be no legitimate reason why part or all of her parttime salary should be funded by her husband, Mr Yong, instead of Panweld. In addition, it would be a misnomer to desc ribe her “employment history” as _part-time_ from 1992 to 1995 and thereafter _fulltime_ from 1995 to 2009, given that she was never seen in the offic e by any staff member of Panweld throughout the 17 years. In my view, this is a wholly c ontrived explanation in a hopeless attempt to disguise the fac t that Mdm Lim was never truthfully an employee of Panweld. In her AEIC, Mdm Lim made her c ase even more unc onvinc ing by alleging that her “salary was being paid from [Mr Yong’s] 

salary and there was no loss to [Panweld]” [note: 37]. In c ross-examination, she c larified that she meant to say that her entire salary over the years was paid from Mr Yong’s bonuses and unused 

leave. [note: 38] She was in effec t saying that she was employed by Mr Yong at his own expense. Suc h an arrangement runs entirely c ontrary to her alleged _bona fide_ employment by Panweld. 

30     One of the building bloc ks of the “transfer salary” theory is that Mr Yong was entitled to a monthly c ar allowanc e of $1,000 whic h he had unselfishly transferred to Mdm Lim to make up for her 

“ _low pay_ ”. [note: 39] However, in his own AEIC, he c laimed, in the c ontext of justifying his c ar related 

expenses, that he did not rec eive any c ar allowanc e. [note: 40] Mr Yong’s alleged c ar allowanc e was also never stated in any of the payroll rec ords of Panweld. Further, the “transfer salary” theory is at best a _zero sum game_. If it was transferred from Mr Yong to Mdm Lim, suc h transfer should be 


evidenc ed by a c orresponding dec rease in his remuneration. Ac c ording to Mr Yong, this “transfer salary” started in 1995. However, both the payroll and CPF c ontributions rec ords for Mr Yong’s 1995 

inc ome do not show any c orresponding dec rease of $1,000 from his monthly salary. [note: 41] 

31     Mr Yong had to c onc ede that the payroll rec ords of Panweld also do not reflec t his c ar 

allowanc e entitlement. [note: 42] When c hallenged in c ross-examination, Mr Yong c hanged his evidenc e and c laimed that the $1,000 was paid for his “produc tivity bonus” instead of c ar allowanc e. [note: 43] 

32     As explained in [19] above, the fixed c omponent of $1,125 was allegedly based on 25 perc ent of the c ombined salaries of Mrs Loh and Sook Min. Mrs Loh was paid $2,500 while Sook Min was paid $2,000. If this was the arrangement, it would have been implemented from day one, and not three years after the c ommenc ement of Mdm Lim’s alleged part-time employment. This c ould not have been the arrangement from inc eption simply bec ause the c ommenc ement dates for their respec tive employment were different. That was prec isely the reason why Mr Yong and/or Mdm Lim had to c onc oc t this fallac ious wage c omputation (introduc ed by way of a further amendment to the defenc e) to fit in with Mdm Lim’s ac tual salary payments over the years. Further, as rightly pointed out by Counsel for Panweld, Mr Foo Maw Shen (“Mr Foo”), the c onduc t of Mr Yong and Mdm Lim belies any suc h agreement bec ause Mdm Lim c ontinued to rec eive this fixed c omponent up to the time she stopped rec eiving salary in 2009, even though Sook Min and Mrs Loh had c eased rec eiving salaries 

from Panweld sinc e 1999 and 2003 respec tively. [note: 44] If there was indeed suc h an agreement to benc hmark Mdm Lim’s salary, the fixed c omponent, being 25 perc ent of the c ombined salaries of Mrs Loh and Sook Min, would have c ommensurately dec reased. But this did not happen. There is some 

dispute over whether Mrs Loh c ontinued to rec eive her salary after 2003. [note: 45] This will be dealt with below, but even if this is c orrec t, it still does not add up bec ause there is no dispute that Sook Min had c eased rec eiving any salary after 1999. 

33     Mr Foo further submitted that there is no truth that Mdm Lim’s balanc e salary was funded from Mr Yong’s bonuses. He drew the c ourt’s attention to the fac t that ac c ording to the IR8A forms submitted by Mr Yong and Mdm Lim, both of them were paid not insignific ant bonuses for the years 

1995, 1996, 1997, 2000, 2001, 2006 and 2008. [note: 46] Spec ific ally, Mr Foo c ross-examined Mr Yong on the minutes of the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of Panweld for 2007 and 2008 in whic h the 

t ot al remuneration of Mr Yong was dec lared. [note: 47] Mr Yong c ould not provide any reasonable explanation as to why his dec lared inc omes for inc ome tax purposes for 2007 and 2008 were higher than the amounts approved at the AGM other than to allege that the AGM minutes were not 

ac c urate. [note: 48] He, however, c onc eded that he c ould not produc e any evidenc e to show that he 

was in fac t entitled to rec eive more remuneration than that stipulated in the AGM minutes. [note: 49] If so, how c ould there have been any transfer? He was already paid more than his entitlement. 

34     In his AEIC, Mr Loh stated that in c ontrast to his c onstant base salary of $2,000 from 1996 to 

2009, Mr Yong’s salary inc reased from $6,700 (as of 1998) to $9,500 (as of 2008). [note: 50] Mr Retnam relied on Mr Loh’s AEIC to support the transfer salary theory sinc e Mr Yong only rec eived $7,000 in 2009. Consequently, he argued, the differenc e of $2,500 must have been transferred to 

Mdm Lim as part of her salary. [note: 51] It was not c lear to me how Mr Loh derived Mr Yong’s 2008 monthly salary as $9,500. It was unfortunate that it was not put to Mr Loh that the balanc e $2, would therefore have been transferred to Mdm Lim. In any event, Mr Yong’s salary at $9,500 does not gel with the 2007 and 2008 AGM minutes, whic h approved Mr Yong’s annual salary as $82,816 and $89,074 respec tively. If, in fac t, Mr Yong’s monthly salary was $9,500 as at 2008, his annual salary 


 (a) 

 (b) 

would be at least $114,000. The evidenc e does not support suc h a sum. 

35     In the premises, I find that there is no truth whatsoever in any transfer of Mr Yong’s bonuses, salary inc rements or c ar allowanc e to make up Mdm Lim’s monthly salary payments. In fac t, the evidenc e is to the c ontrary. This finding is in addition to the inherent absurdity of the transfer salary theory. 

**Breach of fiduciary duties, knowing receipt and dishonest assistance** 

36     It was ac c epted that Mr Yong owed, _inter alia_ , the following duties to Panweld: 

 a duty to ac t in the best interest of the c ompany; and 

 a duty to use his powers for a proper purpose. 

37     Given my finding that Mdm Lim was paid salaries over 17 years even though she was never _in truth_ an employee of Panweld, it c annot seriously be disputed that Mr Yong, in c ausing the salaries to be paid to her under these c irc umstanc es, had ac ted in breac h of his fiduc iary duties to Panweld. 

38     It follows from my primary finding that Mdm Lim c ould not have had any expec tation to rec eive the monthly salaries from Panweld over the 17 years. The payments were made to her bank ac c ount. She would have known that she was not a legitimate employee of Panweld and that the only reason she has been rec eiving the salaries was bec ause her husband, Mr Yong, had wrongfully c aused Panweld to make the payments to her without any proper basis. On this basis, I find that liability based on knowing rec eipt has been made out, sinc e there was (a) a disposal of Panweld’s assets in breac h of Mr Yong’s fiduc iary duty; (b) benefic ial rec eipt by Mdm Lim of assets whic h are trac eable as representing Panweld’s assets; and (c ) knowledge on Mdm Lim’s part that the assets she rec eived are trac eable to a breac h of fiduc iary duty. See _George Raymond Zage III and anor v Ho Chi Kwong and anor_ <span class="citation">[2010] SGCA 4</span>; <span class="citation">[2010] 2 SLR 589</span> (“ _George Raymond Zage III_ ”) at [23]. 

39     Panweld also argued that Mdm Lim fac ilitated Mr Yong’s breac h of duty by ac ting as a 

c onvenient c onduit through whic h Mr Yong c ould siphon money out of Panweld with impunity. [note: 52] Based on my findings, the c laim based on dishonest assistanc e has also been made out given that 

(a) Mr Yong, as Panweld’s direc tor, was trustee _vis-a-vis_ Panweld’s assets; (b) Mr Yong breac hed suc h trust when he misapplied monies belonging to Panweld; (c ) Mdm Lim fac ilitated Mr Yong’s breac h by allowing her bank ac c ount to be used for suc h purposes; and (d) dishonesty on Mdm Lim’s part in that she knew full well that she was not entitled to the salaries paid to her over 17 years. See _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ , Vol _9(2)_ (LexisNexis, 2003) (“ _Halsbury’s Vol 9(2)_ ”) at [110.588] and _George Raymond Zage III_ at [20]. 

**_Approval by Mr Loh_** 

40     As I have explained in [22] above, the question of Mr Loh’s approval bec omes relevant for c onsideration if I find, as I have, that Mr Yong had breac hed his fiduc iary duties in c ausing Mdm Lim to be paid salaries over 17 years, even though she did not perform any meaningful servic e as an employee of Panweld. At the material time (the relevant date being 1992 or 1995 when the alleged agreement was reac hed), there were only two shareholders and two direc tors of Panweld, _ie_ , Mr Loh (80 perc ent) and Mr Yong (20 perc ent). Mr Loh’s approval _in his capacity as shareholder_ of Panweld is 


 (a) 

 (b) 

relevant on two fronts: 

 shareholders may by resolution prospectively release Mr Yong from his fiduc iary duty; and/or 

 shareholders may by resolution retrospectively exonerate Mr Yong from the c onsequenc es of his breac h of duty. 

 (a) See Halsbury’s Singapore , Vol 6 (2010 Reissue) (“Halsbury’s Vol 6”) at [70.275]. 

41     In this regard, it is not disputed that no shareholders’ resolution was ever passed to approve the salary payments to Mdm Lim. However, the lac k of suc h a resolution would not be fatal if all the shareholders, _ie_ , Mr Yong and Mr Loh, had in fac t assented to a partic ular c ourse of ac tion whic h a general meeting of Panweld c ould have c arried into effec t. In suc h a c ase, the assent is as binding as a resolution of the shareholders would be. See _Halsbury’s Vol 6_ at [70.203], _Jimat bin Awang and ors v Lai Wee Ngen_ <span class="citation">[1995] 3 SLR(R) 496</span>; <span class="citation">[1995] SGCA 77</span> at [30] and _In re Duomatic Ltd_ [1969] 2 Ch 365 (“ _Duomatic_ ”). This princ iple applies even if assent was given by different parties at different times. See _Tayplan Limited (in Administration) v Alan Smith and Lee Smith (also known as Lee Stow Smith)_ [2011] CSIH 8 (“ _Tayplan_ ”) at [28]. 

42     The _Duomatic_ princ iple was rec ently applied in _Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter and ors_ <span class="citation">[2010] SGHC 163</span> (“ _RTC_ ”) in c onnec tion with the approval of the c ompany in respec t of personal expenses of the direc tors’ relatives. Chan J made c ertain salient observations ( _RTC_ at [182]– [187]): 

 To the extent that these expenses are not reasonably inc idental to the business of RTC, the [direc tors] c an be said to have ac ted in breac h of their duty...However, I find that the [direc tors], ac ting in their c apac ity as shareholders of the c ompany and c ollec tively embodying the interests of the c ompany, had authorised and ratified the c harging of these expenses to the c ompany via the private ac c ounts. Even if there was no proper written shareholders’ resolution on the ratific ation or authorisation of suc h expenses, if all the shareholders with the right to attend and vote at a general meeting had assented to this matter whic h a general meeting of the c ompany c ould c arry into effec t, the assent was as binding as a resolution in a general meeting: see Re Duomatic Ltd ... 

 As I have found that all the [direc tors] had agreed to the system of private ac c ounts with full knowledge of how it was supposed to work, I find that the c harging of the impugned expenses to their private ac c ounts for squaring off later was c onduc t whic h they had, as shareholders, viewed as “fair game and ac c eptable”...As the [direc tors] were the only shareholders of RTC, they c ollec tively represented the interests of the...As RTC was solvent at all times when the [direc tors] c harged expenses to their private ac c ounts, the [direc tors] were “in substanc e the c ompany” and in adopting the ac ts of c harging expenses to their private ac c ounts in agreement with one another as shareholders, they had made those ac ts the Plaintiff’s ac ts. Thus, the Plaintiff c annot now c omplain that the expenses c harged were c harged in breac h of their duties t o RTC. As a result, the Plaintiff’s c laim in respec t of the direc tors’ remuneration and expenses must fail. 

43     Both c ounsel were _ad idem_ that the _Duomatic_ princ iple would apply if Mr Loh had in fac t approved the salary payments to Mdm Lim. However during oral c losing submissions, Mr Retnam further submitted that the _Duomatic_ princ iple would also apply even if Mr Loh was not aware of the 


salary payments sinc e Panweld’s ac c ountant, Mr Quek, was fully aware at all material times. I disagree. First, as a matter of pleadings, Mr Yong’s original defenc e was that the payments were approved by Mr Loh. It was subsequently amended on 13 May 2011 to state that the payments were _also_ approved by Mr Quek. There is, however, no alternative c ase that the payments were proper _even if_ Mr Loh had not approved them on the premise that Mr Quek was aware of the same. Sec ondly, as a matter of law, the _Duomatic_ princ iple is intended to regularise ac ts or payments on the basis that a shareholders’ resolution would have been passed to approve the ac ts or payments in question had it been tabled. It therefore has no applic ation if Mr Loh, as the majority shareholder, was unaware and would not have approved the payments. For this reason, the fac t that Mr Quek had all along prepared the IR8A forms for Mdm Lim and had arranged for the payment of her CPF c ontributions based on Mdm Lim’s salaries does not c hange the position in law. The inc ome tax dec larations and CPF c ontributions were merely ac ts c arried out _in furtherance of_ the salary payments to Mdm Lim. Suc h ac ts do not translate into c onsent or approval by Mr Loh if none otherwise existed. That is a separate and independent inquiry that I will address below. If Mr Retnam is right in his alternative submission, it would follow that a breac h of fiduc iary duty by a direc tor c an be “c ured” bec ause another employee of the c ompany was aware of it. That c annot be right. 

44     I should add that the mere fac t that Panweld might have been managed like a family-run business, in the usual sense of the phrase, should not make a differenc e. As was observed in _Tayplan_ at [24]: 

 This therefore was a family enterprise from whic h, had it remained solvent, the family, and only the family, would have been likely to benefit, the benefit being distributed in suc h way as the individual family members wished. However, the vehic le through whic h this family c hose to c onduc t its business was a registered c ompany. That brought with it c ertain advantages, most notably the inc orporation of a c ompany with a personality distinc t from its members and c onsequently limited liability, but also the requirement to observe c ertain disc iplines designed to protec t not only the members but also those who dealt with the c ompany. The Lord Ordinary found that the defenders, as direc tors and c ompany sec retary, and therefore the persons responsible, did not observe these disc iplines. In c ontravention of sec tion 221 of the Companies Ac t 1985 [similar to s 199 of the Singapore Companies Ac t (Cap. 50, 2006 Rev Ed)], they failed to keep suffic ient ac c ounting rec ords. 

45     In any event, there is no dispute that the burden to establish Mr Loh’s knowledge and approval rests with Mr Yong and/or Mdm Lim. I begin by examining the pleaded defenc e as regards this alleged approval. When the defenc e was first pleaded, Mr Yong c laimed that Mr Loh agreed to plac e Mdm Lim on the payroll in _reaction_ to Mr Yong’s c onc ern over Mrs Loh’s and Sook Min’s employment in Panweld. Although this has sinc e been amended, I have noted that there is no truth whatsoever in the “reac tion theory” bec ause Mdm Lim was plac ed on the payroll in 1992, long before Mrs Loh and Sook Min in 1995. If suc h an agreement had been reac hed, they would all have been plac ed on the payroll _together_ in 1992. This point was alluded to by Panweld in its Reply filed on 25 Marc h 2010, whic h led to the amendment to the defenc e _a year later_. 

46     During the investigations by BDO in Oc tober 2009, prior to the c ommenc ement of the ac tion, Mr Yong had provided his own handwritten note to BDO stating that “Mr Loh [had] employed his wife 

and his girlfriend in 1995 without [his] knowledge”. [note: 53] Clearly, the essenc e of any agreement must nec essarily entail both Mr Yong’s and Mr Loh’s knowledge of the salary arrangements of the three wives. In c ross-examination, Mr Yong c ould not provide any explanation for his c ontradic tory 

stanc e other than to say that he might have written it down wrongly on the handwritten note. [note: 54] 


47     In his amended defenc e, Mr Yong c laims that the payment of the three wives’ salaries was to reduc e the tax burden of Panweld. However, in c ross-examination, he again shifted his position, 

saying that it was instead to lighten his _own_ tax liability. [note: 55] 

48     Finally, when Mr Yong was first c onfronted by Mr Loh on or about 25 June 2009 about Mdm Lim’s salary payments, the transc ript of the taped rec orded c onversation appears to suggest that Mr Yong was informing Mr Loh for the first time. In response, Mr Loh told Mr Yong “[t]hat I don’t know _lah_ ”. Conspic uously, Mr Yong did not c laim that Mr Loh was aware of the payments all along and had in fac t approved them. This is in fac t c onsistent with Mr Yong’s own position that he was not aware of the salary payments to Mrs Loh and Sook Min. For the above reasons, I find that Mr Yong has failed to disc harge the onus of proving that Mr Loh was aware and had approved the salary payments to Mdm Lim. 

49     It leaves me now to c onsider the points raised by Mr Yong and Mdm Lim that the salary payments were properly approved by Mr Loh. As a starting point, Mr Yong relied on the salary 

payments to Mrs Loh and Sook Min. [note: 56] However, it is essential to bear in mind that the relianc e on the salary payments to Mrs Loh and Sook Min is to support the alleged agreement. It is not their defenc e that Mdm Lim was entitled to be paid merely bec ause Mrs Loh and Sook Min were likewise rec eiving salaries. For the reasons set out in [45] to [48] above, I have determined that Mr Yong has failed to prove the alleged agreement. Further, the c omparison of the flexible working arrangements of Mrs Loh and Sook Min with that of Mdm Lim is not partic ularly helpful bec ause that does not address the issue of whether suc h an agreement existed or whether Mdm Lim was in truth an employee. In the c ourse of the proc eedings, I had observed, on a number of oc c asions, to both c ounsel that “two wrongs do not make a right”. It may well be that the payments to Mrs Loh and Sook Min were not proper either. Although that issue is stric tly not before me, Mr Foo had informed the c ourt that Mr Loh is prepared to refund the salaries paid to Mrs Loh and Sook Min if ordered to do so by the c ourt. I do not believe this is the c orrec t forum for me to make suc h an order of refund, partic ularly sinc e neither Mr Yong nor Mdm Lim had made any suc h submission on the matter. They c ould not make suc h a submission before me sinc e it would undermine their defenc e based on the alleged agreement. That is a separate matter for Mr Yong, as 20 perc ent shareholder of Panweld, to take up if he is so advised. However, for c ompleteness, I should add that evidenc e was adduc ed in c ourt that, unlike Mdm Lim, 

staff members of Panweld had seen Mrs Loh and Sook Min on Panweld’s offic e premises. [note: 57] Further, both Mrs Loh and Sook Min testified that they did some administrative and sec retarial work in 

t he offic e and translation work for Mr Loh during meetings with Panweld’s c ustomers. [note: 58] I do not ac c ept that the three wives were employees of Panweld in any meaningful sense of the word. The distinc tions highlighted by Mr Foo as regards the nature of the work performed by Mrs Loh and Sook Min are not signific ant enough for me to arrive at a different c onc lusion from that reac hed with regard to Mdm Lim. 

50     Mr Retnam relied on various doc uments to establish that Mr Loh was aware of the salary payments to Mdm Lim. First, Mr Retnam referred to Panweld’s monthly payroll rec ords. However, there is no evidenc e that Mr Loh had ever examined the payroll rec ords of Panweld. In fac t, ac c ording to 

the evidenc e of Mr Yong, he too c laimed that he had never reviewed the payroll rec ords. [note: 59] Obviously, if Mr Yong, who was managing Panweld, whether as Managing Direc tor or General Manager, had never seen the payroll rec ords, it is not at all surprising for Mr Loh as the inac tive direc tor not to have read them. As regards the monthly management ac c ounts, although Mr Loh would have been provided with c opies, it does not advanc e the defenc e sinc e the ac c ounts on their fac e do not disc lose the names of the employees on the payroll. 


## Q: 

## A: 

## Q: 

## A: 

## Q: 

## A: 

51     The only doc ument whic h Mr Yong was able to identify, whic h c ould _possibly_ point to Mr Loh’s knowledge of the salary payments, was a handwritten monthly ac c ount dated 12 Marc h 1998 (“the ac c ount”) prepared by Mr Quek. Mr Retnam c ited Mr Quek’s testimony during c ross-examination to suggest that the ac c ount was provided to the “direc tors”, _ie_ , both Mr Yong and Mr Loh. The ac c ount stated, _inter alia_ , “[direc tors’] wives salaries (3 persons)”. In order to fully understand the evidenc e of Mr Quek in its proper c ontext, it is nec essary to set out his testimony on this point in its entirety [note: 60] : 

 This was a doc ument you prepared to show the monthly operating expenses of the plaintiff, wasn’t it? 

 It’s for Mr Yong. Mr Yong request what is the money as – 

 Please, Mr Quek. You seem to prefix all your answers as “ac c ording to Mr Yong”, “Mr Yong”. Here, did you prepare this to show to the directors what the monthly operating expenses are? 

 Yes. 

 There you have rec orded what the direc tors’ salaries are and the wives’ salaries, three persons, 6225, so the directors would have been aware of this, wouldn’t they? 

 Yes. 

 [emphasis added] 

52     From the above transc ript, it is c lear to me that the ac c ount was prepared at the behest of Mr Yong. When Mr Quek agreed with Mr Retnam that the ac c ount was provided to the _directors_ (in plural), it appeared to me that Mr Quek did not apprec iate that the question was expressed in plural. In any event, Mr Retnam did not c larify with Mr Quek that he was also referring to Mr Loh when he agreed that the ac c ount was provided to the “ _directors”_ , given his earlier answer that it was prepared for Mr Yong. This was, however, c larified by Mr Quek in re-examination when he c onfirmed 

that the ac c ount was _only_ provided to Mr Yong. [note: 61] I ac c ept Mr Quek’s evidenc e that the ac c ount was not provided to Mr Loh. I should add that it is odd that Mr Yong, having trawled through the voluminous doc uments disc losed in this ac tion, was only able to identify one solitary doc ument, the ac c ount, in his somewhat desperate attempt to pin knowledge and approval on Mr Loh. I say this is odd bec ause the salary payments to Mdm Lim were made over 17 years and yet he was only at best able to point to one doc ument. 

53     Next, although Mr Loh c laimed that Mrs Loh had stopped rec eiving salary from Panweld sinc e 2003, Mr Retnam explained that this was c ontradic ted by Panweld’s balanc e sheet from 1 July 2007 to 31 Oc tober 2007 (“2007 balanc e sheet”) whic h showed that Mrs Loh c ontinued to rec eive salary of 

$2,500 as at Oc tober 2007. [note: 62] Her salary was c redited to Mr Loh’s direc tor’s ac c ount with Panweld. The fac t that Mr Loh’s direc tor’s ac c ount was c redited with a monthly sum of $2,500 was not disputed. In fac t, it was ac c epted by Mr Foo that the $2,500 monthly c redits to Mr Loh’s direc tor’s ac c ount were made from at least January 2005. 

54     Mr Quek, in explaining the status of the direc tors’ ac c ounts in response to Mr Yong’s queries, ha d provided some handwritten remarks on the 2007 balanc e sheet that $2,500 was c redited into Mr Loh’s direc tor’s ac c ount representing Mrs Loh’s salary. Mr Quek admitted that the handwritten 


remarks were indeed his but c laimed that he was forc ed by Mr Yong to deliberately falsify the entry as representing Mrs Loh’s salary when it was ac tually reimbursement for Mr Loh’s China expenses. [note: 63] I did not believe his explanation. There was no reason in _2007_ for Mr Yong to “forc e” 

Mr Quek to falsify the nature of the payment given that the investigations against Mr Yong were only initiated in or around April _2009_. 

55     Mr Loh also sought to explain in c ross-examination that the desc ription by Mr Quek in the 2007 balanc e sheet was erroneous in that the payments were in fac t reimbursement of his monthly 

expenses inc urred for his China trips on behalf of Panweld. [note: 64] Likewise, I did not ac c ept Mr Loh’s explanation. There is no doc umentary evidenc e to support Mr Loh’s alleged monthly China expenses. Further, it is odd that the expenses were fixed at $2,500 every month for reimbursement purposes even though Mr Loh admittedly did not travel to China every month. Mr Loh’s explanation that this was rounded up for c onvenienc e does not address the c omplete absenc e of doc umentary evidenc e to support the reimbursement expenses. 

56     Although I did not ac c ept both Mr Quek’s and Mr Loh’s testimony on this point, ultimately, this finding offers no assistanc e to Mr Yong’s or Mdm Lim’s defenc e. For the reasons set out in [49] above, the fac t of the salary payments by Panweld to Mrs Loh and Sook Min in itself does not bear out the defenc e of an alleged agreement between Mr Yong and Mr Loh to plac e the three wives on Panweld’s payroll. All that it establishes is that Mr Yong was not alone in arranging unauthorised salary payments to his wife. 

**Can Mr Yong and/or Mdm Lim invoke the limitation defence** 

57     As mentioned at [16], Mr Retnam rightly ac c epts that, in the event that the salary payments are found to have been paid in breac h of Mr Yong’s fiduc iary duties, the c laims against Mr Yong would not be barred by the Limitation Ac t (whic h will be referred to as “the Ac t”, or “our Ac t” when disc ussed together with the English equivalents). Why Mr Retnam’s c onc ession is c orrec t will be explained below. 

58     With regard to the c laim against Mdm Lim, Mr Retnam argues that, given that Mr Loh had c onsented to Mdm Lim’s employment, Panweld is barred by ac quiesc enc e from maintaining their c laims 

against Mdm Lim. [note: 65] In light of my finding that Mr Loh did not know of Mdm Lim’s “employment”, the argument based on ac quiesc enc e bec omes moot. Mr Retnam also submitted that even if liability is made out, part of the c laim against Mdm Lim would be time barred pursuant to ss 6(1)(a), 6(1)(d) and 

6(2) of the Ac t [note: 66]. Sec tion 6 of the Ac t provides that: 

 Limitation of actions of contract and tort and certain other actions 

 6.—(1) Subjec t to this Ac t, the following ac tions shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on whic h the c ause of ac tion ac c rued: 

 (a) ac tions founded on a c ontrac t or on tort; 

 ... 

 (d) ac tions to rec over any sum rec overable by virtue of any written law other than a penalty or forfeiture or sum by way of penalty or forfeiture. 

 (2) An ac tion for an ac c ount shall not be brought in respec t of any matter whic h arose more 


 than 6 years before the c ommenc ement of the ac tion. 

 ... 

 (7) Subjec t to sec tions 22 and 32, this sec tion shall apply to all c laims for spec ific performanc e of a c ontrac t or for an injunc tion or for other equitable relief whether the same be founded upon any c ontrac t or tort or upon any trust or other ground in equity. 

59     In response, Mr Foo argues that no time bar applies bec ause the c laim against Mdm Lim falls 

within s 22(1) of the Ac t. [note: 67] Sec tion 22 of the Ac t provides that: 

 Limitations of actions in respect of trust property 

 22.—(1) No period of limitation presc ribed by this Ac t shall apply to an ac tion by a benefic iary under a trust, being an ac tion — 

 (a) in respec t of any fraud or fraudulent breac h of trust to whic h the trustee was a party or privy; or 

 (b) to rec over from the trustee trust property or the proc eeds thereof in the possession of the trustee, or previously rec eived by the trustee and c onverted to his use. 

 (2) Subjec t to subsec tion (1), an ac tion by a benefic iary to rec over trust property or in respec t of any breac h of trust, not being an ac tion for whic h a period of limitation is presc ribed by any other provision of this Ac t, shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on whic h the right of ac tion ac c rued. 

60     I should state at the outset that Mdm Lim’s relianc e on ss 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(d) of the Ac t appears misplac ed sinc e those provisions relate to c laims based on c ontrac t, tort or “an ac tion to rec over any sum rec overable by virtue of any written law.” Her relianc e on s 6(2) of the Ac t is also inappropriate, sinc e an “ac tion for an ac c ount” c an only be maintained where there is a fiduc iary relationship between the parties as to raise an obligation to ac c ount, and where the amount due is 

unc ertain and unliquidated ( _Black’s Law Dictionary_ , 9thEd, 2009 and _Attorney General v Cocke_ [1988] Ch 414, 420), _eg_ , s 6(2) of the Ac t was applied to an ac tion for an order for ac c ount and inquiry into a partnership’s financ es in _Toh Kim Chan v Toh Kim Tian_ <span class="citation">[2003] 1 SLR(R) 839</span> at [36]– [37]. The c laim for the return of salaries paid and rec eived by Mdm Lim is not an “ac tion for an ac c ount”. 

61     As will be disc ussed (at [65] to [74] below), there are, for purposes of limitation, two c lasses of c onstruc tive trusteeships. Class 1 c onstruc tive trusteeships fall within s 22(1) of the Ac t and are never time barred. Class 2 c onstruc tive trusteeships, on the other hand, are subjec t to the limitation defenc e. In a number of dec isions suc h as _Peconic Industrial Development Ltd v Lau Kwok Fai and ors_ [2009] HKCFA 16; [2009] 2 HKLRD 537 (“ _Peconic_ ”), _Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam and ors_ [2002] UKHL 48; [2003] 2 AC 366 (“ _Dubai Aluminium_ ”) and _Paragon Finance plc v D B Thakerar & Co (a firm)_ [1999] 1 All ER 400 (“ _Paragon Finance_ ”), where the c ourts have ruled that the c laims against Class 2 c onstruc tive trustees, _eg_ , dishonest assistants and knowing rec ipients, fall outside the equivalent of s 22(1) of the Ac t, they did not go on to identify the applic able limitation provision whic h operated to bar the c laims. 

62     In my view, c laims based on dishonest assistanc e and knowing rec eipt are c laims for equitable relief (see _Paragon Finance_ at p 413 and _Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd v Cradock and ors (No_ 


_3)_ [1968] 1 WLR 1555 (“ _Cradock_ ”) at p 1582), and are governed by s 6(7) of the Ac t: Report of the Law Reform Committee on the Review of the Limitation Ac t (Cap 163) (February 2007) (“ _LRC Report 2007_ ”) at p 8. Why suc h c laims do not fall under s 22(2) will be explained later (at [94] to [95]). As s 6(7) of the Ac t is expressly subjec t to s 22, the question that must ultimately be answered is whether s 22(1) of the Ac t applies, as Mr Foo argues, suc h that the whole of Panweld’s c laim against Mdm Lim remains alive notwithstanding the lapse of six years. Although s 6(7) of the Ac t was not spec ific ally pleaded by Mr Yong and/or Mdm Lim, in my view, there is no prejudic e to Panweld sinc e it was fully aware of the limitation defenc e and, more signific antly, the foc us on the limitation c ontest was on the applic ability of s 22(1) of the Ac t, to whic h both parties have made substantial submissions. 

63     Pursuant to s 2(1) of the Ac t, “trust” and “trustee” have the same meanings as under the Trustees Ac t (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed), whic h inc lude “implied and c onstruc tive trusts”. See s 3 of the Trustees Ac t (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed). Was Mdm Lim a “c onstruc tive trustee” within the meaning of s 22(1) of the Ac t? 

_“Constructive trusts” under the English equivalent of s 22_ 

64     What c onstitutes “c onstruc tive trust” for the purpose of limitation has been the subjec t of muc h jurisprudential disc ussion. As s 22 of our Ac t was modelled on s 19 of the Limitation Ac t 1939 (UK) (“the 1939 UK Ac t”) (see Sing _Parliamentary Debates_ , Vol 11, c ol 587 (2 September 1959) (Mr K M Byrne, Minister for Labour and Law) and _LRC Report 2007_ at p 4), English authorities on this point are highly relevant and will be disc ussed in some detail. 

65     The English authorities distinguish between two broad c lasses of “c onstruc tive trusts” for limit at ion purposes. The line is drawn based on whether the trust in question arose _before_ the oc c urrenc e of the transac tion impeac hed, or whether it arose _by reason of_ that transac tion. See _Soar v Ashwell_ [1893] 2 QB 390 (“ _Soar_ ”), _Isabella Taylor v Davies and ors_ [1920] AC 636 (Privy Counc il) (“ _Taylor_ ”), _Paragon Finance_ at pp 408–409, _Cradock_ at p 1579, JJ. _Harrison (Properties) Ltd v Harrison_ [2001] EWCA Civ 1467 (“ _JJ Harrison_ ”) at [25]–[30], _Dubai Aluminium_ at [139], _Gwembe Valley Development Co Ltd and anor v Thomas Koshy and ors_ [2003] EWCA Civ 1048 (“ _Gwembe Valley_ ”) at [86]–[88], _Halton International Inc and anor v Guernroy Ltd_ [2006] EWCA Civ 801 (“ _Halton International_ ”) at [10] and _Statek Corporation v Alford_ [2008] EWHC 32 (Ch) (“ _Statek_ ”) at [106]. The distinc tion was neatly stated by Ungoed-Thomas J in the following terms ( _Cradock_ at p 1579): 

 It is essential at the outset to distinguish two very different kinds of so-c alled c onstruc tive trustees: (1) Those who, though not appointed trustees, take upon themselves to ac t as suc h and to possess and administer trust property for the benefic iaries, suc h as trustees de son tort. Distinguishing features for present purposes are (a) they do not c laim to ac t in their own right but for the benefic iaries, and (b) their assumption to ac t is not of itself a ground of liability (save in the sense of c ourse of liability to ac c ount and for any failure in the duty so assumed), and so their status as trustees precedes the occurrence which may be the subject of claim against them. (2) Those whom a court of equity will treat as trustees by reason of their action, of which complaint is made. Distinguishing features are (a) that suc h trustees c laim to ac t in their own right and not for benefic iaries, and (b) no trusteeship arises before, but only by reason of, the ac tion c omplained of. 

 [emphasis added] 

66     While trusts falling under the former c ategory (“Class 1”) c ome within “trust” in s 22(1) of the Ac t, those falling under the latter c ategory (“Class 2”) do not, and thus, c ould be time barred. See JJ. 


_Harrison_ at [37], _Gwembe Valley_ at [111], _Dubai Aluminium_ at [141] and _Halton International_ at [10], [26]. 

67     The distinc tion between Class 1 and Class 2 c onstruc tive trusteeships was illustrated in the rec ent dec ision of _Halton International_ (at [13]–[15]) by juxtaposing two c ases involving breac h of direc tors’ duties: 

 In [ JJ Harrison (Properties) Ltd v. Harrison [2002] 1 BCLC 162], the c laimant was a family property c ompany, of whic h the defendant was a direc tor. In 1985 a property owned by the c ompany was valued at £8,400, but in a side letter the valuer said that it “may have some development potential” and that the valuation did not take this into ac c ount. The side letter was not disc losed to the c ompany, but the direc tor was aware of it. In 1986 he bought the property from the c ompany without disc losing the side letter. He later sold it for a very substantial profit. More than six years later the c ompany sued him for an ac c ount of the proc eeds of sale of the land. His limitation defenc e failed in the Court of Appeal on the ground that the c laim was within c lass 1. 

 In [ Gwembe Valley Development Co. Ltd v Koshy [2004] 1 BCLC 131], the defendant was managing direc tor of the c laimant c ompany, GVDC, and a shareholder in it. He also owned a majority of the shares in and c ontrolled another c ompany, Lasc o, whic h lent money to GVDC. He arranged the loans...The c ase against the defendant was that he did not disc lose to the board of GVDC his interest in Lasc o, or the profit that Lasc o made on the loans to GVDC. It was held that, apart from fraud, the c laim would have been time-barred, bec ause his liability to ac c ount for the sec ret profit was not within c lass 1, and therefore the exc eption provided by sec tion 21(1)(b) did not apply. (The c laim ultimately suc c eeded, on the basis that the defendant had fraudulently c onc ealed from GVDC his interest in Lasc o and the true c ost of the kwac ha lent to GVDC.) 

While the direc tor in JJ. _Harrison_ had a pre-existing “trustee-like” responsibility _vis-a-vis_ the property whic h was the subjec t of the ac tion, the liability of the direc tor in _Gwembe Valley_ to ac c ount for undisc losed profits did _not_ depend on any suc h pre-existing responsibility, and thus, c ould not be brought within the English equivalent of s 22(1)(b) of our Ac t. See _Gwembe Valley_ at [119] and _Halton International_ at [16]). Therefore, but for the fac t that the fraudulent nature of the nondisc losure brought the direc tor’s breac h in _Gwembe Valley_ within the English equivalent of s 22(1)(a) of our Ac t, the direc tor would have been able to plead limitation in defenc e. See _Gwembe Valley_ at [120], [136]–[138]). 

68     Indeed, Mr Foo relied on JJ. _Harrison_ to bring the c laim against Mr Yong within s 22(1) of the 

Ac t. [note: 68] Mr Retnam ac c epts this position, and I find, rightly so. Although there was no express trust, Mr Yong was a fiduc iary of Panweld, and as direc tor, stood in a trustee-like position _vis-a-vis_ Panweld’s assets (see _Cradock_ and _Halsbury’s Vol 9(2)_ at [110.588], fn 2), _ie_ , he was a trustee of the monies before he wrongfully paid them to Mdm Lim. This brought his breac h within Class 1 c onstruc tive trusteeship and thus disentitled him from raising the limitation defenc e. It follows that it is no longer nec essary for me to deal with Mr Foo’s alternative submissions that the limitation period for the c laim against Mr Yong had been extended pursuant to s 26(2) of the Ac t, due to Mr Yong’s 

ac knowledgment of Panweld’s c laim in May 2009 [note: 69] , and/or ss 29(1)(a) and 29(1)(b) of the 

Ac t, due to the c onc ealed nature of Mr Yong’s wrongdoing. [note: 70] 

_Background to the distinction between the two classes of “constructive trusts”_ 

69     The genesis of s 19 of the 1939 UK Ac t, on whic h s 22 of our Ac t was modelled, may be trac ed 


bac k to developments in England prior to the 1890s. Before 1890, when the Trustee Ac t 1888 (UK) (“the 1888 UK Ac t”) c ame into operation in England, the Court of Equity developed the general rule that, in the absenc e of lac hes or ac quiesc enc e, a c laim against an express trustee shall be perpetual. Se e _Soar_ at p 395. The rationale was not based on c ulpability, but _deemed possession_ ; the legal fic tion adopted was that the possession of an express trustee was never by virtue of any right of his own, but was deemed, from the outset, to be taken for and on behalf of his benefic iary, and thus, time did not run in his favour against the benefic iary. See _Taylor_ at pp 650–651, _Cradock_ at 1579, _Paragon Finance_ at pp 408–409 and _Halton International_ at [22]. 

70     To ameliorate the harshness visited on trustees who c ould remain liable indefinitely for innoc ent breac hes of trust, when even c ommon law ac tions for fraud were subjec t to a six-year time bar, s 8 of the 1888 UK Ac t (whic h sc heme was adopted by s 19 of the 1939 UK Ac t, and c onsequently, s 22 of our Ac t) introduc ed a six-year limitation period for c laims for breac h of trust. Two situations were, however, exc epted from s 8 of the 1888 UK Ac t, _viz_ , (a) where the c laim was founded on fraud; and (b) where the proc eeds were still retained by the trustee or had previously been rec eived by the trustee and c onverted to his use. See _Paragon Finance_ at p 410. 

71     Before this statutory sc heme c ame into plac e, however, c ourts developing the general rule that c laims against express trustees were perpetual, extended the meaning of “express trustee” to inc lude persons who were, tec hnic ally, implied or c onstruc tive trustees. Those who fell within this expanded meaning of “express trustee” were not allowed to raise the limitation defenc e. See Mic hael Franks, MA, _Limitation of Actions_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 1995) at p 64. In _Soar_ , trustees entrusted the trust fund to their solic itor, Ashwell, to be invested in an equitable mortgage by deposit of title deeds. Instead of ac c ounting to the trustees for the sums rec eived upon the mortgage being paid off, Ashwell retained a portion of the monies for himself. The English Court of Appeal held that Ashwell was an “express trustee” to whom no limitation period applied bec ause he was trustee of the funds _before_ he c ommitted the alleged wrong ( _ie_ , Class 1 c onstruc tive trusteeship). In other words, the c lassific ation of “express trustee” in _Soar_ also inc luded c ertain types of c onstruc tive trusts, spec ific ally, those falling within Class 1. Lord Esher MR held (at pp 393–395) that: 

 Was Ashwell...suc h a trustee as a Court of Equity will not allow to rely on the Statutes of Limitation? If there is created in express terms, whether written or verbal, a trust, and a person is in terms nominated to be trustee of that trust, a Court of Equity, upon proof of such facts, will not allow him to vouch a Statute of Limitation against a breach of that trust. Such a trust is in equity called an express trust ...If the breac h of the legal relation relied on, whether suc h breac h be by way of tort or c ontrac t, makes, in the view of a Court of Equity, the defendant a trustee for the plaintiff, the Court of Equity treats the defendant as a trustee bec ome so by c onstruc tion, and the trust is called a constructive trust; and against the breach which by construction creates the trust the Court of Equity allows Statutes of Limitation to be vouched ...There are c ases not falling stric tly within either of those thus enunc iated, some of whic h have been treated by the Courts of Equity as within the c lass in respec t of whic h a Statute of Limitations will not be allowed to be vouc hed, and some within the c lass in respec t of whic h suc h a statute may be vouc hed... 

 [T]he questions in this case are whether Ashwell was not, in view of a Court of Equity, a trustee of the money before the alleged breach by misappropriation, and, if he was, under which class of trust he was with regard to limitations. The moment the money was in his hands, he was in a fiduciary relation to the nominated trustees...he held the money in trust to deal with it for them as directed by them; he was a trustee for them. He was therefore a trustee of the money before he committed, if he did commit, the alleged breach of trust... 


 [W]here a person has assumed, either with or without c onsent, to ac t as a trustee of money or other property, i.e. to ac t in a fiduc iary relation with regard to it, and has in c onsequenc es been in possession of or has exerc ised c ommand or c ontrol over suc h money or property, a Court of Equity will impose upon him all the liabilities of an express trustee...and will c all him an express trustee... I am of the opinion that the present case is within the description of that which is treated as and is called in equity an express trust, and that the inquiry as to the alleged breach cannot be stopped by the Statute of Limitations. 

 [emphasis added] 

72     There is sound polic y underlying the distinc tion made between express trusts (in the expanded sense, whic h inc ludes Class 1 c onstruc tive trusts) and Class 2 c onstruc tive trusts for the purposes of limitation. Class 2 c onstruc tive trusteeships are c ontingent on proof of the defendant’s c ontemporaneous ac ts by reason of whic h the c onstruc tive trust arose. Suc h evidenc e may be more prone to c onflic ts and destruc tion over time, as c ompared to proof of the existenc e of an express trust or pre-existing fiduc iary relationship. As suc h, c onsiderations of fairness require that time should run in favour of suc h defendants. See _Soar_ at p 396 per Bowen LJ, and p 400 per Kay LJ. 

73     Following the enac tment of the 1888 UK Ac t, whic h by s 1(3) extended the definition of “trustee” to c onstruc tive and implied trustees, the judic ial exerc ise of distinguishing between the two c ategories of c onstruc tive trusts persisted. See _Taylor_ at pp 651–653. However, the label “express trust” need no longer be stretc hed to inc lude Class 1 c onstruc tive trusts as both express trustees and Class 1 c onstruc tive trustees c ould be prec luded from relying on the limitation defenc e where the requirements of s 8 of the 1888 Ac t are met. See JJ. _Harrison_ at [34]. Indeed, the distinc tion also survived the subsequent enac tment of the 1939 UK Ac t, upon whic h our Ac t was modelled. In c onnec tion with this, Millett LJ (as he then was) listed ten reasons justifying the distinc tion, _inter alia_ ( _Paragon Finance_ at pp 412–413): 

 (1) If [the 1939 UK Ac t] was intended to abrogate the former distinc tion between the two kinds of c onstruc tive trust...It c an hardly have done so merely by adopting the definitions of “trust” and trustee in the Trustee Ac t 1925, sinc e these are not materially different from those in [the 1888 UK Ac t]. If anything, the use of the definitions in [the Trustee Act 1925] points in the opposite direction, for that Act is concerned exclusively with the powers and duties of trustees properly so called. It is not concerned with persons whose trusteeship is merely a formula for giving restitutionary relief. 

 ...(4) As a matter of statutory c onstruc tion the question turns on the meaning of the opening words of [s 22(1) of our Ac t]...these are not apt to c over c onstruc tive trusts of the sec ond kind...bec ause they refer to “...an ac tion by a benefic iary under a trust...to whic h the trustee”... these words would appear to be prima facie applicable only to those whose trusteeship precedes the occurrence which is the subject of the claim against them and not those whose trusteeship arises only by reason of that oc c urrenc e. (5) ...[T]he distinc tion between the two kinds of c onstruc tive trusts... was the distinction between an institutional trust and a remedial formula – between a trust and a catch phrase. 

 ...(8) Although at first sight the distinc tion...appears to be merely c hronologic al, it marks a real difference between trustees (whether or not expressly appointed as such) who commit a breach of trust (however created) and persons who are not trustees at all but who are described as trustees for the purposes of enabling equitable relief to be granted against them. Ac tions founded on tort are barred after six years, and there is no exc eption for ac tions founded on fraud, though the start of the limitation period may be deferred in suc h c ases. There is no logic al 


 basis for distinguishing between an ac tion for damages for fraud at c ommon law and the c orresponding c laim in equity for “an ac c ount as c onstruc tive trustee” founded on the same fraud. 

 [emphasis added] 

74     It must be rec ognised that Class 2 “c onstruc tive trusts” are not, in fac t, “trusts” in the true sense of the word. It is nothing more than a formula for equitable relief; a c ourt applying equitable princ iples finds that the defendant ought to be made liable in equity, and thus, imposes a c onstruc tive trust for this purpose. See _Cradock_ at p 1582. In the words of Millett LJ in _Paragon Finance_ at p 409 (whic h were ec hoed in _Dubai Aluminium_ at [141]–[142] and _Cradock_ at p 1575): 

 In the first c lass of c ase, however, the c onstruc tive trustee really is a trustee...the plaintiff does not impugn the transac tion by whic h the defendant obtained c ontrol of the property. He alleges that the c irc umstanc es in whic h the defendant obtained c ontrol make it unc onsc ionable for him thereafter to assert a benefic ial interest in the property. 

 The sec ond c lass of c ase is different...In suc h a c ase [the defendant] is traditionally though I think unfortunately described as a constructive trustee and said to be “liable to account as constructive trustee.” Such a person is not in fact a trustee at all, even though he may be liable to account as if he were. He never assumes the position of a trustee, and if he rec eives the t rust property at all it is adversely to the plaintiff by an unlawful transac tion whic h is impugned by the plaintiff. In suc h a c ase the expressions “c onstruc tive trust” and “c onstruc tive trustee” are misleading, for there is no trust and usually no possibility of a proprietary remedy; they are “nothing more than a formula for equitable relief”: Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd. V Cradock [1968] 1 WLR 1555 at p 1582 per Ungoed-Thomas J... They were not in reality trusts at all, but merely a remedial mechanism by which equity gave relief for fraud. 

 [emphasis added] 

This use of “remedial” in relation to Class 2 “c onstruc tive trusts”, whic h restric ts the plaintiff to a _personal_ remedy must, of c ourse, be distinguished from “remedial” in the sense whic h is used in the United States and Canada, where a “remedial c onstruc tive trust” may be imposed as a _discretionary proprietary remedy_. Under English law, c onstruc tive trusts arise based on legal rules, and the c ourt’s role in this c onnec tion is purely dec laratory. See Hayton & Mitc hell, _The Law of Trusts and Equitable Remedies_ , 12th Ed (Sweet & Maxwell, 2005) (“ _Hayton & Mitchell_ ”) at [6–03]. 

_The position in Singapore_ 

75     The rec ent High Court dec ision of _Wong Chong Yue v Wong Chong Thai_ <span class="citation">[2011] 2 SLR 804</span> (“ _Wong Chong Yue_ ”) c onc erned a c laim that c ertain shares were held by the defendant on an _express trust_ for the plaintiff. Philip Pillai J, in determining the preliminary issue of whether the c laim for breac h of trust and for ac c ount had been time barred, held (at [9]) that: 

 The meaning and sc ope of s 22(1)( b ) was examined in Soar v Ashwell [1893] 2 QB 390. Lord Esher MR said (at 393): 

 If there is c reated in expressed terms, whether written or verbal, a trust, and a person is in terms nominated to be the trustee of that trust, a Court of Equity, upon proof of suc h fac ts, will not allow him to vouc h a Statute of Limitations against a breac h of that trust. Suc h a trust is in equity c alled an express trust...If the breac h of the legal relation relied on, 


 whether suc h breac h be by way of tort or c ontrac t, makes, in the view of a Court of Equity, the defendant a trustee for the plaintiff, the Court of Equity treats the defendant as a trustee bec ome so by c onstruc tion, and the trust is c alled a c onstruc tive trust; and against the breac h whic h by c onstruc tion c reates the trust the Court of Equity allows Statutes of Limitation to be vouc hed. 

 In the same judgment, Bowen LJ stated that (at 395-396): 

 ... That time (by analogy to the statute) is no bar in the c ase of an express trust, but that it will be a bar in the c ase of a c onstruc tive trust, is a doc trine whic h has been c learly and long established...A c onstruc tive trust is one whic h arises when a stranger to a trust already c onstituted is held by the Court to be bound in good faith and in c onsc ienc e by the trust in c onsequenc e of his c onduc t and behaviour...although but for suc h c onduc t and behaviour he would be a stranger to the trust ... [T]he liability of a stranger to the trust arises from his conduct and depends on the proof of his contemporary acts... 

 The above passages have been c ited with approval more rec ently by the English High Court in Cattley v Pollard [2007] Ch 353 at [43]-[47]. A c laim for ac c ounting under an express trust would ac c ordingly not be subjec t to any time bar, whether under s 6(2) or anywhere else in the Limitation Ac t. Sec tion 22(2) of the Limitation Ac t is subjec t to s 22(1) of the Limitation Ac t, and therefore does not apply. 

 [emphasis added] 

76     Mr Foo c orrec tly pointed out that _Wong Chong Yue_ is not direc tly applic able to the present 

c ase sinc e Pillai J was there c onc erned with the issue of limitation _vis-a-vis_ an express trust [note: 71] 

, and that c ontrary to Mr Retnam’s submission [note: 72] , _Wong Chong Yue_ did not suggest that a six

y e a r time bar applied to _all_ c onstruc tive trust c laims. [note: 73] The term “express trust”, as disc ussed, bore an expanded meaning in the pre-1890 era during whic h _Soar_ was dec ided. Furthermore, while Bowen LJ referred to a time bar in relation to c onstruc tive trusts, his desc ription of c onstruc tive trustees, being strangers to the trust, but for c ertain c onduc t giving rise to liability, was in effec t a desc ription of Class 2 c onstruc tive trustees. 

77     With the benefit of hindsight, drawn from the _Paragon Finance_ and _Dubai Aluminium_ line of 

c ases, it would c ertainly seem regressive for our c ourts to retreat to the pre-20th c entury English position of denying relianc e on the limitation defenc e only in c ases of express trusts. Indeed, the Court of Appeal had the opportunity to deal with a related point in _QBE Insurance Ltd v Sim Lim Finance Ltd_ [1987] SLR(R) 23 (“ _QBE Insurance_ ”) whic h was dec ided before _Paragon Finance._ The respondent, Sim Lim Financ e, entered into a hire-purc hase agreement with Highlight Industry whereby the latter ac quired on hire purc hase 74 sets of industrial sewing mac hines and agreed to pay Sim Lim Financ e monthly instalments totalling $105,000. Highlight also took out a fire polic y with the appellant, QBE Insuranc e, in relation to the mac hines. Following the destruc tion of the mac hines in a subsequent fire, Sim Lim Financ e wrote a letter to Highlight, c arbon-c opied to QBE, c laiming an interest in the mac hines, and requesting Highlight to instruc t QBE to pay the insuranc e proc eeds to Sim Lim Financ e. When QBE did not ac knowledge or reply to the letter, Sim Lim Financ e sued Highlight, its direc tors, and QBE for c ompensation and damages arising from c onspirac y, breac h of trust and negligenc e. After QBE filed its defenc e, the ac tion went to sleep for approximately four years before Sim Lim Financ e gave notic e of its intention to proc eed with its c laim. QBE then applied to dismiss the ac tion for want of prosec ution. 


78     QBE’s applic ation was dismissed in the High Court whic h held, _inter alia_ , that Sim Lim Financ e’s c laim based on fraudulent breac h of trust against QBE as c onstruc tive trustees had not been time barred. On appeal, QBE argued that Highlight insured the mac hinery on their own ac c ount, and not as trustees for Sim Lim Financ e, and that even if there was a c laim based on c onstruc tive trust, suc h ac tion did not fall within s 22(1) of the Ac t. In dismissing QBE’s appeal, the Court of Appeal held (at [28] and [32]) that: 

 28 The next submission of c ounsel for the appellants was that any c laim based on c onstruc tive trust would have been barred after six years on the ground that s 22(1) of the Limitation Ac t (Cap 10) had no applic ation to c onstruc tive trusts: he c ited Soar v Ashwell... a nd In re Robinson ... We do not think that this contention is supported by these authorities... [I]n support of his c ontention, [c ounsel] relied on a passage in the judgment of Bowen LJ (at 395–396) where his Lordship drew a distinc tion between an express trust ( ie one whic h arises between the cestui que trust and his trustee) and a c onstruc tive trust ( ie one whic h arises when a stranger to a trust already c onstituted is held by the c ourt to be bound in good faith and in c onsc ienc e by the trust in c onsequenc e of his c onduc t and behaviour) and that “time is no bar in the c ase of an express trust, but that it will be a bar in the c ase of a c onstruc tive t rust ...”. In our view, counsel’s argument was based on a partial reading of Bowen LJ’s judgment. His Lordship (at 396) rec ognised and drew attention to the “variety and inc onsistenc y both in the language used about c onstruc tive trusts and in the line of demarc ation that has been drawn between the c ases of express and c onstruc tive trusts”... 

 32 ...[C]ounsel’s c ontention that statutory limitation applies to all c onstruc tive trusts was again too wide. In the present ac tion... [w]hether or not [the claim based on constructive trust], if well-founded, would be barred after six years cannot therefore be decided until the nature of the constructive trust, if any, has been determined by the trial judge. 

 [emphasis added] 

79     Thus, it would appear from the observations by the Court of Appeal in _QBE Insurance_ that not _all_ “c onstruc tive trusts” fall within s 22(1) of the Ac t. Consistently with the subsequent line of English c ases inc luding _Paragon Finance_ and _Dubai Aluminium_ , the Court of Appeal rec ognised that whether a c laim is subjec t to a time bar depends on the _nature_ of the c onstruc tive trust in question. 

_Strangers to the Trust_ 

80     I have held (at [68]) that Mr Yong is a c onstruc tive trustee falling within s 22(1) of the Ac t as he is a Class 1 c onstruc tive trustee. The same may not be said of Mdm Lim. Given the foregoing, it seems quite c lear that dishonest assistants and knowing rec ipients, as strangers to the trust, are Class 2 c onstruc tive trustees who are not “trustees” within s 22(1) of the Ac t. As was observed in Charles Mitc hell, “Dishonest assistanc e, knowing rec eipt, and the law of limitation” (2008) 3 Conv 226 (“ _Charles Mitchell_ ”) at pp 230–231: 

 Claimants have [argued]...that [s 22(1) of the Ac t] applies to ac tions for dishonest assistanc e and knowing rec eipt. The [argument] turns on the fac t that dishonest assistants and knowing rec ipients are “personally liable to ac c ount as c onstruc tive trustees”...One might have thought that knowing rec ipients would find it harder to defeat this argument than dishonest assistants bec ause the former always rec eive property whic h c an be impressed with a trust and the latter do not. Paradoxic ally, however, knowing recipients have been held to fall outside the subsection...for a long time, whereas dishonest assistants have only been found to fall outside the subsection very recently. 


 [emphasis added] 

81     Even though knowing rec ipients and dishonest assistants are not “trustees” within the meaning of s 22(1) of the Ac t, is there any statutory basis to deny suc h Class 2 c onstruc tive trustees from pleading limitation? This issue shall be analysed with referenc e to dishonest assistants and knowing rec ipients separately to determine whether they should be treated in the same vein or differently. 

_Dishonest assistants_ 

82     When c ourts hold that a dishonest assistant to a breac h of trust is “liable to ac c ount as a c onstruc tive trustee”, they do not ac tually mean that he must ac c ount for property in his hands, whic h he holds on trust. Liability based on dishonest assistanc e is a _personal_ liability, and the defendant c an be liable whether or not he had rec eived and/or retained trust property; there is no real trust to speak of. See _Hayton & Mitchell_ at [11–06], AJ Oakley, _Constructive Trusts_ , 3rd Ed (Sweet & Maxwell, 1997) at pp 188–190, Hanbury & Martin, _Modern Equity_ , 18th Ed (Sweet & Maxwell, 2009) at [12–010]–[12–011] and _Charles Mitchell_ at p 229. 

83     Mr Foo argued that s 22(1) of the Ac t should apply to dishonest assistants bec ause liability of 

the dishonest ac c essory should be of the same measure as the wrongdoing princ ipal. [note: 74] This argument touc hes on a dilemma whic h has been disc ussed in the English c ases in relation to whether c laims based on dishonest assistanc e may be brought under s 22(1)(a) of the Ac t by c onstruing dishonest assistants as having been “a party or privy” to the fraudulent breac h of trust. The dilemma, as stated in _Charles Mitchell_ at p 235, is that between two anomalies: either dishonest assistants are never subjec t to the same rule as fraudulent trustees, even when the trustee and the ac c essory are fraudulent c o-c onspirators, or dishonest assistants are sometimes entitled to invoke the limitation defenc e where the breac h of trust was c ommitted innoc ently, but not where the breac h was c ommitted fraudulently, even though in both c ases, they may have behaved equally badly. In holding that dishonest assistants were Class 2 c onstruc tive trustees who may rely on the six-year limitation defenc e, Deputy High Court Judge Ric hard Sheldon QC held in _Cattley and anor v Pollard and anor_ [2007] 3 WLR 317 (“ _Cattley_ ”) at p 334 that: 

 Mr Godsmark also relied on the following passage in the judgment of Millett LJ in the Paragon c ase [1999] 1 All ER 400, 414: 

 “(10) A princ ipled system of limitation would also treat a c laim against an ac c essory as barred when the c laim against the princ ipal was barred and not before. There is, therefore, a c ase for treating a c laim against a person who has assisted a trustee in c ommitting a breac h of trust as subjec t to the same limitation regime as the c laim against the trustee: see J W Brunyate, Limitation of Actions in Equity (1932). But the borrowers, who obtained the money by dec eit and were the princ ipal wrongdoers, were neither trustees nor fiduc iaries. If guilty of fraud, they c an plead the statute. It would be extraordinary if the defendants were liable in equity as ac c essories or c o-c onspirators without limit of time when the c laim against the princ ipal wrongdoers was barred.” 

 Whilst this passage does provide some support for Mr Godsmark's argument, it is to be noted that Millett LJ is only postulating an argument (“There is ... a c ase”) whic h he then proc eeds to answer on the fac ts before him. I do not read this passage as indicating that Millett LJ is accepting that the same period of limitation should necessarily be applicable to a claim against the trustee and a claim against the accessory. It seems to me that there is an illogicality in making a dishonest assistance claim subject to the same period of limitation as a claim against the trustee. In the light of Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan [1995] 2 AC 378 (whic h was dec ided after the 


 Paragon c ase), a person dishonestly assisting in a breac h of trust is liable whether or not the trustee has been fraudulent. Where the trustee's breac h is not fraudulent a c laim against him would be subjec t to a six-year limitation period and, if fraudulent, there would be no applic able period of limit at ion. It would appear illogical for a dishonest assistance claim against the accessory to be subject to a six-year limitation period if the trustee's breach of trust is not fraudulent but subject to no period of limitation if the trustee's breach were fraudulent: the accessory, to be made liable, has to have been guilty of dishonesty in both cases and there is no readily apparent rationale as to why a different period of limitation should apply. 

 [emphasis added] 

84     To avoid the anomalous distinc tion between ac tions for dishonest assistanc e and knowing rec eipt, where the breac h of trust has been c ommitted fraudulently, and ac tions where it has not, even where the ac c essory has behaved equally badly in both c ases, the better view is that ac c essorial liability, in both instanc es, falls outside s 22(1)(a) of the Ac t, whether or not the breac h of trust by the princ ipal is dishonest. See _Charles Mitchell_ at p 235. 

85     Mr Foo sought to rely on _Statek_ to argue that _Cattley_ did not represent the c orrec t legal 

position in England. [note: 75] _Statek_ involved misappropriation of c ompany monies by its direc tors. The plaintiff c ompany (Statek) was purc hased by another c ompany (TCI II) in 1984. One Johnston and one Spillane bec ame direc tors of Statek. TCI II was the holding c ompany, and all its revenue c ame from the highly profitable trading ac tivities of Statek. From February 1984 to January 1996, Johnston and Spillane systematic ally looted Statek and TCI II, misappropriating more than $19.8 million from Statek and more than $10.5 million from TCI II. Between April 1988 and Dec ember 1995, a series of payments were made into the personal bank ac c ount of one Alford (the defendant), a businessman and longtime business assoc iate of Johnston and Spillane. Statek alleged that, in dishonest breac h of his duties to Statek, Alford fac ilitated the misapplic ation of Statek’s monies so rec eived by him for whic h Statek c laims, _inter alia_ , that he is bound to ac c ount as c onstruc tive trustee. EvansLombe J found that Alford was a _de facto_ direc tor and henc e breac hed his fiduc iary duties to Statek _ie_ , Class 1 c onstruc tive trustee ( _Statek_ at [107]). In _obiter dicta_ , he added (at [120]–[124]) that: 

 In arriving at his c onc lusion Mr Sheldon [in Cattley ] plac ed princ ipal relianc e on the judgment of Lord Millett as he had then bec ome in Dubai Aluminium Company Limited v Salaam [2003] 2 AC 366...[T]he House of Lords c onc luded that Mr Amhurst was c onstituted a c ategory 2 trustee having assisted in a fraud. At paragraph 141 in the speec h of Lord Millett he is rec orded as saying this:

 “Unlike HB in Mara v Browne [1896]1Ch199, Mr Amhurst did not assume the position of a trustee on behalf of others. He never had title to the trust funds or c laimed the right to deal with them on behalf of those properly entitled to them. He ac ted throughout on his own or his c onfederate’s behalf. The c laim against him is simply that he partic ipated in a fraud. Equit y gives relief against fraud by making any person suffic iently implic ated in the fraud ac c ountable in equity. In suc h a c ase he is traditionally (and I have suggested unfortunately) desc ribed as a “c onstruc tive trustee” and is said to be “liable to ac c ount as a c onstruc tive trustee”. But he is not in fac t a trustee at all, even though he may be liable to ac c ount as if he were...and he c ould plead the Limitation Ac ts as a defenc e in the c laim.” 

 ...Mr Sheldon desc ribes Lord Millett in this passage as “dealing with a c laim for dishonest assistanc e in a fraudulent breac h of trust”...and found that the Limitation Ac t c ould be pleaded as a defenc e to the c laim. 


 With respec t to Mr Sheldon, nowhere in his judgment does Lord Millett desc ribe the assistanc e given by Mr Amhurst to the fraud as being assistanc e to a fraudulent breac h of trust. He does not do so in the passage c ited ... [T]he c ase does not seem to proc eed on the basis that he or any of the other defendants were trustees or fiduc iaries of the assets of the c laimant whose fraud, in dealing with those assets, had been assisted by the ac tions of Mr Amhurst. 

86     EvansLombe J thus observed in _obiter dicta_ that s 21(1)(a) of the 1980 UK Ac t ( _in pari materia_ with s 22(1)(a) of our Ac t) applied to ac c essories to fraudulent breac hes of trust ( _Statek_ at [114]–[125]). This observation in effec t subjec ts a dishonest assistant in an innoc ent breac h of trust to a different limitation regime from that whic h applies where the breac h of trust is fraudulent, _ie_ , the very anomaly identified in _Charles Mitchell_. EvansLombe J’s c ritic ism of _Cattley_ was however diffic ult to follow sinc e the c laim in _Dubai Aluminium_ c learly related to dishonest assistanc e to a fraudulent misappropriation of c ompany funds, whic h was subjec t to the limitation defenc e (see _Dubai Aluminium_ at [85], [87], [141] and [143]), _ie_ , falling outside the ambit of s 21(1)(a) of the 1980 UK Ac t. 

8       7 _Statek_ must now be viewed in light of _Peconic_ , where the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal firmly held that dishonest assistants are allowed to plead the limitation defenc e. See _Peconic_ at [24]. The bank in _Peconic_ was fraudulently induc ed by one Chio to invest in a land spec ulation deal through a joint venture c ompany (Pec onic ), of whic h Chio bec ame a direc tor and 25 perc ent shareholder in 

1991\. The land was purc hased at HK$515 million, although the immediate vendor, whic h Chio benefic ially owned, only bought it for HK$151 million. Chio made a fortune of HK$350 million in the meantime. In 2002, the bank sued a solic itor (Lau) who had allegedly assisted Chio in the fraudulent breac h of his fiduc iary duties to Pec onic. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal had to deal with the issue of whether dishonest assistants fell within s 20 of the Hong Kong Limitation Ordinanc e, whic h is _in pari materia_ with s 22 of our Ac t, suc h that Lau was prec luded from raising the limitation defenc e. Referring to Class 1 c onstruc tive trustees as “fiduc iaries”, to whom the limitation defenc e is denied, and Class 2 c onstruc tive trustees as “non-fiduc iaries”, inc luding dishonest assistants who may plead the limitation defenc e, Lord Hoffmann, sitting in the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, held that ( _Peconic_ at [23]–[24]): 

 [N]on-fiduc iaries do not c ome within the definition of trustees in [s 22 of the Ac t]. It is nec essary however to deal with a different submission, whic h is that...one c ategory of nonfiduc iaries, namely, persons who dishonestly assist a trustee in a fraudulent breac h of trust, should be treated in the same way as the trustee and not allowed a limitation defenc e. 

 This argument has the high authority of some dic ta...in Soar v Ashwell [1893] 2 QB 390. These remarks have been subjec ted to minute analysis in the c ases and ac ademic writings but I am willing to ac c ept that they support the proposition that dishonest assisters c annot rely on a limitation defenc e. Nevertheless, I think that they are wrong in princ iple and unsupported by aut horit y. The principle is not that the limitation defence is denied to people who were dishonest...The principle is that the limitation period is denied to fiduciaries. But dishonest assisters are not fiduciaries. It might be surprising, as Millett LJ said in the Paragon Finance case (at p.414), if a person primarily liable was entitled to plead the Limitation Act when someone who assisted him could not. But there seems no reason in fairness or logic why the reverse should not be true. And in any case, Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan [1995] 2 AC 378 shows that the liability of a dishonest assister is independent of the dishonesty of the trustee or other fiduciary. [Counsel for the bank] plac ed some relianc e upon Millett LJ’s observation that “a princ ipled system of limitation would also treat a c laim against an ac c essory as barred when the c laim against the princ ipal was barred and not before”...That showed, he said, that if the fraudulent trustee is never entitled to plead limitation, the dishonest assister should not be entitled to do so. But I do not think Millett LJ could have meant this, which would be contrary to 


 most of his reasoning and to his subsequent clear statement in Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam [2003] 2 AC 366, 404 that a dishonest assister is not a fiduciary and can plead the Limitation Act. 

 [emphasis added] 

_Knowing Recipient_ 

88     The fac t that a “c onstruc tive trust” imposed on the knowing rec ipient arises by virtue of the relevant wrong also situates suc h c laims within Class 2. Notwithstanding the weight of authority to the c ontrary, Mr Foo argued that Mdm Lim’s liability falls squarely within s 22(1)(b) of the Ac t 

bec ause she c urrently holds the misappropriated monies in her possession. [note: 76] This argument may however be said to have been forec losed following _Taylor_ (at p 653), whic h c learly determined that “trust property” in the Ontario equivalent to s 22(1)(b) of our Ac t refers “not to a c ase where a person having taken possession of property on his own behalf, is liable to be dec lared a trustee by the Court; but rather to a c ase where he originally took possession upon trust for or on behalf of others”. 

89     While it is c lear that knowing rec eipt c laims do not fall within s 22(1)(b) of the Ac t, c an it nevertheless be brought within s 22(1)(a)? In _G L Baker Ltd v Medway Building and Supplies Ltd_ [1958] 1 WLR 1216 (“ _Baker_ ”), Danc kwerts J, whose judgment was disc harged by the Court of Appeal on a separate ground, observed, albeit tentatively, that s 19(1)(a) of the 1939 UK Ac t ( _in pari materia_ with s 22(1)(a) of our Ac t) applied to third parties who innoc ently rec eived monies trac eable to fraudulent breac h of trust, suc h that there was no time bar. _Baker_ involved a c laim by a c ompany (Baker) to rec over money entrusted to its auditor (Titley) who fraudulently paid some of it to a c ompany of whic h he was a direc tor (Medway). When judgment against Titley remained unsatisfied, Baker c laimed from Medway repayment of the said sum. Danc kwerts J held (at p 1221–1222) that: 

 This Ac t is one whic h I understand was drafted by a very eminent Chanc ery lawyer, but none the less it is one whic h gives c onsiderable diffic ulties of interpretation whenever the c ourt is c onc erned with its applic ation...[ s 22(1)(a) of the Act] does not in terms refer to actions against trustees, but the words used are “in respect of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust to which the trustee was a party or privy.” It seems to me that the words “in respect of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust” may be capable of referring to a case where the action of the plaintiffs is based upon the fact that their moneys were fraudulently paid away and have reached the hands of an innocent party. That is a possible construction, but whether or not it is the right one is not at all clear ...I am bound to say that I think that the words “in respec t of any fraud or fraudulent breac h of trust” are wide enough to c over the present c ase...It is bec ause they rec eived that payment by virtue of Titley's fraudulent breac h of trust that the plaintiff c ompany is able to bring this ac tion against them. Consequently, so far as those words are c onc erned, the provision seems to me wide enough. 

 [emphasis added] 

90     Like Mr Foo’s argument in relation to s 22(1)(b) of the Ac t (at [88]), any argument in relianc e on Danc kwerts J’s tentative suggestion, whic h was unsupported by authority and whic h ran c ounter to the _Paragon Finance_ and _Dubai Aluminium_ line of c ases ( _Cattley_ at p 338), is now forec losed, following _Peconic_ , where Lord Hoffmann NPJ held (at [25]) that: 

 It is true that in c ertain c ontexts the words “in respec t of” may have a very wide meaning and the possibility of such a meaning being given to the words in s.20 was tentatively considered by 


 Danckwerts J in G L Baker Ltd v. Medway Building and Supplies Ltd [1958] 1 WLR 1216, 1222. But I think that in the c ontext of s.20 of the Ordinanc e it simply means that the benefic iary must be c laiming against the trustee on the ground that he has c ommitted a fraudulent breac h of trust. If it had been intended to include claims against dishonest assisters or other non-fiduciaries on the ground that they were accessories to the breach of trust, the language would have been a good deal clearer. 

 [emphasis added] 

91     In oral c losing submissions, Mr Foo also relied on c ertain remarks made by Millett J (as he then was) in _Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson and ors_ [1989] 3 WLR 1367 (Ch) (“ _Agip_ ”) as being suggestive of the fac t that there are different c ategories of knowing rec ipients, some of whom should be disentitled from relying on the limitation defenc e. Millett J held ( _Agip_ at pp 1387–1388) that: 

 Knowing rec eipt 

 In Baden, Delvaux and Lecuit v. Société General pour Favoriser le Développement du Commerce et de l'Industrie en France SA [1983] BCLC 325, 403, Peter Gibson J. said: 

 "It is c lear that a stranger to a trust may make himself ac c ountable to the benefic iaries under the trust in c ertain c irc umstanc es. The two main c ategories of c irc umstanc es have been given the c onvenient labels...'knowing rec eipt or dealing' and 'knowing assistanc e'. The first c ategory of 'knowing rec eipt or dealing' is desc ribed in Snell...as follows: 'A person rec eiving property whic h is subjec t to a trust...bec omes a c onstruc tive trustee if he falls within either of two heads, namely: (i) that he rec eived trust property with ac tual or c onstruc tive notic e that it was trust property and that the transfer to him was a breac h of trust; or (ii) that although he rec eived it without notic e of the trust, he was not a bona fide purc haser for value without notic e of the trust, and yet, after he had subsequently ac quired notic e of the trust, he dealt with the property in a manner inc onsistent with the trust.' I admit to doubt as to whether the bounds of this category might not be drawn too narrowly in Snell. For example, why should a person who, having received trust property knowing it to be such but without notice of a breach of trust because there was none, subsequently deals with the property in a manner inconsistent with the trust not be a constructive trustee within the 'knowing receipt or dealing' category?" 

 I respec tfully agree... Without attempting an exhaustive classification, it is necessary to distinguish between two main classes of case under this heading. The first is concerned with the person who receives for his own benefit trust property transferred to him in breach of trust. He is liable as a c onstruc tive trustee if he rec eived it with notic e, ac tual or c onstruc tive, that it was trust property and that the transfer to him was a breac h of trust; or if he rec eived it without suc h notic e but subsequently disc overed the fac ts. In either c ase he is liable to ac c ount for the property, in the first c ase as from the time he rec eived the property, and in the sec ond as from the time he ac quired notic e. 

 The second and, in my judgment, distinct class of case is that of the person, usually an agent of the trustees, who receives the trust property lawfully and not for his own benefit but who then either misappropriates it or otherwise deals with it in a manner which is inconsistent with the trust. He is liable to ac c ount as a c onstruc tive trustee if he rec eived the property knowing it to be suc h, though he will not nec essarily be required in all c irc umstanc es to have known the exac t terms of the trust...The essential feature of the first c lass is that the rec ipient must have rec eived the property for his own use and benefit. This is why neither the paying nor the 


 c ollec ting bank c an normally be brought within it. In paying or c ollec ting money for a c ustomer the bank ac ts only as his agent. It is otherwise, however, if the c ollec ting bank uses the money to reduc e or disc harge the c ustomer's overdraft. In doing so it rec eives the money for its own benefit... 

 [emphasis added] 

92     Although Gibson J, in the passage endorsed by Millett J, does seem to suggest that there c ould be several c lasses of knowing rec eipt, depending on the quality of knowledge/notic e on the part of the rec ipient, the distinc tion Millett J drew “between two c lasses of c ase under this heading” seems to mirror the distinc tion between the two _general_ c lasses of c onstruc tive trusts, whic h he later set out more c learly in _Paragon Finance._ In any c ase, this passage from _Agip_ , whic h Mr Foo relied on, did not c onc ern the defenc e of limitation, and it is unc lear on its fac e, how the sub-c ategories of knowing rec ipients should differ in respec t of the availability of the limitation defenc e. No other authority was c ited to me to this effec t. 

93     Given the persuasive authority in favour of the position that knowing rec ipients, like dishonest assistants, are Class 2 c onstruc tive trustees, I am of the view that Panweld’s c laim against Mdm Lim falls outside s 22(1) of the Ac t, and is c onsequently partially time barred. 

_Section 22(2) of the Act_ 

94     It remains to be c onsidered whether the limitation defenc e in relation to dishonest assistanc e and knowing rec eipt c laims is rooted in s 22(2) of the Ac t. Although Sheldon QC in _Cattley_ (at [92]) seemed to ac c ept that c laims against dishonest assistants were governed by s 21(3) of the 1980 UK Ac t, whic h is similar to s 22(2) of our Ac t, his relianc e on _Gwembe Valley_ on this point might not be entirely ac c urate as the relevant disc ussion in _Gwembe Valley_ c onc erned c laims against _fiduciaries_ ( _Gwembe Valley_ at [111]): 

 Fiduc iary duties and limitation – summary 

111\. In the light of those c ases, in our view, _it is possible to simplify the court’s task when considering the application of the 1980 Act to claims against fiduciaries._ The starting assumption should be that a six year limitation period will apply – under one or other provision of the Ac t, applied direc tly or by analogy – unless it is spec ific ally exc luded by the Ac t or established c ase- law. Personal c laims against fiduc iaries will normally be subjec t to limits by analogy with c laims in tort or c ontrac t (1980 Ac t s 2, 5; see Seguros). _By contrast, claims for breach of fiduciary duty, in the special sense explained in Mothew, will normally be covered by section 21. The six-year time-limit under section 21(3), will apply, directly or by analogy, unless excluded by subsection 21(1)(a) (fraud) or (b) (Class 1 trust)_ [.] 

 [emphasis added] 

95     For c onsistenc y, “trust” under s 22(1) must mean the same thing under s 22(2). Consequently, while s 22(2) of the Ac t applies to trustees who parted with trust property negligently or innoc ently (see Oughton, Lowry & Merkin, _Limitation of Actions_ (LLP, 1998) at p 375 and Choong Yeow Choy, _Law of Limitation_ (Butterworths Asia, 1995) at [2.13.3]) it does _not_ apply to strangers to the trust suc h as Class 2 c onstruc tive trustees. Support for this may be drawn from JJ. _Harrison_ at pp 754 – 755, where it was observed that: 

 The answer to the question whether s. 21(3) of the 1980 Ac t has any applic ation to the present 


 c ase...is provided by Millett LJ's historic al analysis in Paragon Finance plc v Thakerar & Co [1999] 1 All ER 400...: 

 ‘...It was evidently c onsidered unduly harsh that trustees should remain liable indefinitely for innoc ent breac hes of trust when even c ommon law ac tions for fraud were barred after six years and s. 8 of the 1888 Ac t introduc ed a period of limitation (effec tively six years) for suc h c laims. Its purpose was to provide protec tion for trustees who would otherwise be liable without limitation of time (lac hes and ac quiesc enc e apart) where the breac h of trust was c ommitted innoc ently; see Re Richardson, Pole v Pattenden [1920] 1 Ch 423 at p. 440...’ 

 The position, therefore is that, since the coming into operation of s. 8 of the Trustees Act 1888, express trustees and constructive trustees within Millett LJ's first category have been able to rely upon the limitation period now prescribed by s. 21(3) of the 1980 Act , subjec t to the saving provisions now c ontained in s. 21(1) of that Ac t. 

 [emphasis added] 

**Conclusion** 

96     As the c laim against Mr Yong falls within s 22(1) of the Ac t, no limitation period applies. Mr Yong is therefore a c onstruc tive trustee of the full measure of the monies misapplied. As Mdm Lim is entitled to raise the six-year limitation defenc e under s 6(7) of the Ac t, the amount rec overable against her would be c apped at $338,410 instead of $873,959.20. The result may appear anomalous in that the princ ipal wrongdoer, Mr Yong, is not able to plead limitation while his ac c essory, Mdm Lim, is able to do so. However, it has also been said that it would be anomalous for an ac c essory (who is not a trustee) not to be entitled to plead limitation when a non-trustee who has c ommitted a fraud is entitled to do so. Ultimately, the outc ome is merely a func tion of the c ourt’s interpretation of whether Class 2 c onstruc tive trustees, either as knowing rec ipients or dishonest assistants, fall within the definition of “trustees” in s 22(1) of the Ac t. Sound judic ial reasoning from established c ase law dic tates that they do not bec ause they are, in truth, not really trustees. There is no reason why knowing rec ipients and dishonest assistants should be treated differently. In the words of Lord Millet in _Paragon Finance_ at p 409, they are “ _unfortunately described”_ as c onstruc tive trustees. In truth, they are “ _constructively treated, by a legal fiction_ ” as though they are trustees by their partic ipation in the breac h of trust by the princ ipal wrongdoer. See _Charles Mitchell_ at p 229. 

97     Mr Yong is therefore liable to Panweld for the full salary c laim of $873,959.20, while Mdm Lim is only jointly liable to the extent of $338,410 together with interest at 5.33 perc ent per annum on the respec tive judgment sums from 12 February 2010 till the date of judgment. As agreed, c osts of the four settled c laims shall follow the event of the salary c laim. However as Mdm Lim has suc c eeded on the limitation defenc e, I shall order one set of c osts at 80 perc ent of the entire ac tion to be paid by Mr Yong to Panweld to be taxed if not agreed and that Mdm Lim is jointly liable to the extent of 30 perc ent for suc h c osts. As I have noted at [7] that the third party ac tion is without merit, it is dismissed with c osts to be taxed if not agreed.
