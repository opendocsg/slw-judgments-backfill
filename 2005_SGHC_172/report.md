Lai Siu Chiu J: 

1       This Petition was an applic ation by Barbara Chong (“the Petitioner”), who is the administratrix of the estate of the late Tan Keng Siong (“the Estate”), under s 47(1) of the Estate Duty Ac t (Cap 96, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”). Sec tion 47(1) of the Ac t states: 

 An exec utor or other ac c ountable person aggrieved by — 

 ( a ) any c laim by a notic e of assessment by the Commissioner for payment of estate duty, interest thereon or penalty; or 

 ( b ) the refusal of the Commissioner to return any estate duty, interest thereon or penalty alleged to have been overpaid, 

 may, on payment of, or giving sec urity under subsec tion (5) for, the amount c laimed by the Commissioner or suc h portion of it as is then payable by him, apply to the High Court within 3 months from the date of the c laim or refusal, as the c ase may be. 

2       The dispute relates to the valuation of 200,000 shares in Siong Lim Pte Ltd (“Siong Lim”) and 20,000 shares in Chulin Pte Ltd (“Chulin”) (known c ollec tively as “the Companies”) as at 29 Marc h 2001, owned by the late Tan Keng Siong (“the Dec eased”). The Petition prayed _inter alia_ for the following reliefs: 

 (a) a dec laration that the estate duty payable assessed for the Estate’s shareholding in Siong Lim and Chulin was inc orrec t; and 

 (b) a dec laration that the Commissioner should give a disc ount of between 31% to 50% in his valuation of the Estate’s shareholding in Siong Lim and Chulin. 

**Background facts** 


3       The Dec eased died intestate on 29 Marc h 2001 and Letters of Administration were granted by the c ourt to the Petitioner and Kenneth Boon Beng Tan on 1 Oc tober 2001. On 26 July 2004, Kenneth Boon Beng Tan withdrew as the administrator of the Estate, leaving the Petitioner (who is the Dec eased’s widow) as the sole administratix of the Estate. 

**_The Companies_** 

4       The Dec eased had amongst his assets, the aforementioned 200,000 shares in Siong Lim and 20,000 shares in Chulin. The Companies are private limited c ompanies registered in Singapore, with their princ ipal ac tivity being the holding of investments. They are essentially family-owned c ompanies c ontrolled by the Dec eased’s father, Tan Sri Tan Chin Tuan (“Tan”). 

5       The Dec eased’s shareholdings in Siong Lim and Chulin formed only 14.7% and 4% of the issued c apital and only 3.5% and 4% of the voting rights respec tively, in the Companies. The detailed shareholding struc tures of the Companies, as at 29 Marc h 2001, were as follows:

6       It is not disputed that both Kambau Pte Ltd (“Kambau”) and Tiong Cheng Pte Ltd (“Tiong Cheng”) are c ontrolled by Tan. It is also worth mentioning that Tan Kheng Choo is the daughter of Tan. The shareholding struc tures of the Companies are reflec tive of Tan’s philosophy of keeping the Companies within the family. 

7       The Companies’ memorandum and artic les of assoc iation also maintained the status quo. To ensure that only the family members of Tan and/or other approved persons hold the shares, the Companies’ memorandum and artic les of assoc iation c ontain severe restric tions on the transfer of the shares. Not only do the artic les give the direc tors the right in their absolute disc retion, without assigning any reason, to refuse to register a transfer of shares, they also provide that where there is a refusal to register, but where there is an entitlement to the shares by transmission, the representative of the estate is only entitled to rec eive dividends but c annot rec eive notic es of or attend or vote at any meeting or exerc ise any of the other rights and privileges of a member. 

8       In addition, Siong Lim’s artic les of assoc iation entrenc h the c ontrol of Tan by c onferring on the holder of founder’s shares 20 votes for eac h founder’s share. This is to be c ontrasted with the one vote c onferred by eac h ordinary share. The effec t of this provision c an c learly be seen from the table above in [5], with Tan being entitled to 47.3% of the total votes of Siong Lim. The artic les also c onfer on Tan the right to demand that the remaining founder’s shares be issued to him at par. 

9       It should further be noted that, for the purposes of ac c umulating wealth in the Companies, the Companies are obliged to transfer the gains on the sale of investments in shares and properties to the c apital reserve ac c ount, and are not allowed to distribute the gains by way of dividends to the shareholders. 

**_Sale of shares of the Companies_** 

10     There have only been two transac tions eac h in the shares of Siong Lim and Chulin sinc e their inc orporation on 21 June 1957 and 9 January 1976 respec tively. The first transac tion oc c urred when the estate of Helene Tan (who is the Dec eased’s mother and Tan’s wife) disposed of its shareholdings of 175,000 shares in Siong Lim and 100,000 in Chulin to Tiong Cheng for $25.50 and $2.65 per share respec tively, on 22 April 1999 and 29 May 2000. The sec ond oc c urred when the Estate sold the Dec eased’s shares to Amberlight Pte Ltd (“Amberlight”) on 21 January 2003. The shares in Siong Lim and Chulin were similarly sold for $25.50 and $2.65 per share respec tively. 

**_The respondent’s valuation of the shares_** 

11     On 3 Oc tober 2002, the respondent valued the Estate’s shareholdings in Siong Lim and Chulin at $177.74 and $6.49 per share respec tively. This valuation was based on the audited ac c ounts of Siong Lim and Chulin as at 30 June 2001 and 31 Marc h 2001 respec tively, with adjustments being made to the value of immovable properties and quoted investments and allowing a 30% disc ount on the adjusted net assets value of eac h share for non-marketability. In total, the Estate’s shareholdings in Siong Lim and Chulin were valued at $35,548,000 and $129,800 respec tively. 

12     At the date of the valuation by the respondent, there were no audited financ ial ac c ounts of Siong Lim as at 31 Marc h 2001, whic h is the period just after the date of the death of the Dec eased. Pursuant to the Petitioner’s requests to Siong Lim to c arry out an audit of the c ompany as at 31 Marc h 2001, Siong Lim’s auditors, Ernst & Young, finally produc ed the audited ac c ounts on 1 July 2005, barely a week before this applic ation was heard. 

**The dispute** 


13     The Petitioner’s position was that the respondent’s valuation of the Estate’s shareholdings in the Companies was manifestly exc essive. The Estate had to pay estate duty on the shares at the respondent’s valuation of $35,548,000 and $129,800 on its shareholdings of Siong Lim and Chulin respec tively, when it only realised $5,100,000 and $53,000 from the sale of its shareholdings in Siong Lim and Chulin respec tively. 

14     The Petitioner c ontended that: 

 (a) the respondent’s method of valuation of the Estate’s shareholdings in Siong Lim and Chulin based on the net asset value of the respec tive c ompanies was not appropriate; 

 (b) a valuation based on the last transac ted pric es of the shares of Siong Lim and Chulin at $25.50 and $6.49 respec tively should have been used; and 

 (c ) a disc ount of 90% should have been applied to the valuation of the Estate’s shareholdings in Siong Lim and Chulin instead of the 30% disc ount applied by the respondent. 

**The law** 

15     At this junc ture, it would be useful to set out the relevant provisions for the valuation of shares under the Ac t. There were two main provisions raised by the parties as being helpful in this c ase, _viz_ ss 22 and 24 of the Ac t. Sec tion 22(1) states: 

 Where there pass on the death of any person dying after 22nd April 1940 any shares (not being preferenc e shares) in any c ompany to whic h this Part applies, then if either — 

 ( a ) there is deemed by virtue of the provisions of this Part to pass on the death a sum of money c omputed by referenc e to the value of the total assets of the c ompany; or 

 ( b ) the c ontrol of the c ompany was immediately before the death in the hands of the dec eased, 

 the princ ipal value of those shares for the purposes of estate duty shall not be ascertained in the manner provided by section 24, but shall be ascertained by reference to the value of the total assets of the company. 

 [emphasis added] 

16     Sec tion 24(1) of the Ac t states: 

 The princ ipal value of any property shall be estimated to be the pric e whic h, in the opinion of the Commissioner, that property would fetc h if sold in the open market at the time of the death of the dec eased. [emphasis added] 

17     It was c ommon ground that the Estate’s shareholdings in the Companies were minority shares and that the Dec eased did not have any influenc e or c ontrol in the Companies. Ac c ordingly, there was no disagreement between the parties that s 22 of the Ac t did not apply to the valuation of the Estate’s shareholdings in the Companies; it was agreed that s 24 of the Ac t was the applic able provision. 

18     However, the parties held differing views on the interpretation of s 24 of the Ac t and how it 


should be applied to determine the value of shares in a c ompany. This c onsequently formed the c rux of the dispute between the Petitioner and the respondent. It did not help that there is a dearth of authorities on this point. 

19     Before disc ussing this question further, there is a preliminary issue relating to the c orrelation of ss 22 and 24 of the Ac t that needs to be addressed. It was suggested by the Petitioner that s 22 of the Ac t exc luded the valuation of shares by referenc e to the value of the total assets of a c ompany under s 24 of the Ac t. However, the c ase of _Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Hong Kong (Trustee) Ltd v Commissioner of Estate Duty_ [1975] HKLR 696 states otherwise. Pic kering J c ommented (at 699) on the equivalent of s 22 of the Ac t in Hong Kong as follows: 

 Had the dec eased’s shareholding been a majority holding no c hoic e of method would have arisen for s 44 of the Estate Duty Ordinanc e (Cap. 111) provides that in suc h a c ase the valuation shall be made on what we have termed the assets bac king basis. That is not to say, however, that that basis may not be appropriate in any c irc umstanc es in the c ase of a minority holding. 

20     Furthermore, the Petitioner’s expert witness, Mr Kaka Singh (“Mr Singh”), c onc eded during c ross-examination that there was no prohibition in using any method to c ome up with the open market value, pursuant to s 24 of the Ac t. 

21     As suc h, I find that s 22 of the Ac t does not exc lude the valuation of shares by referenc e to the value of the total assets of a c ompany under s 24 of the Ac t. It is possible to determine the open market pric e of shares through the net asset value of a c ompany, pursuant to s 24 of the Ac t. 

**How section 24 of the Act should be applied** 

22     The parties’ expert witnesses (Mr Singh for the Petitioner and Mr Chan Ket Tec k (“Mr Chan”) for the respondent) had c ontrasting views as to how the value of the shares of a c ompany ought to be determined under s 24 of the Ac t. They were unable to agree on the manner in whic h one should estimate the pric e that the shares would fetc h if sold in the open market at the time of the demise of the Dec eased. Mr Singh was of the opinion that the valuation of the Estate’s shareholdings in the Companies should be done using the dividend yield method, whereas Mr Chan held the view that the valuation should be based on the net asset value of the Companies. Although both experts also made referenc es to other methods of valuation ( _viz_ the disc ounted c ash flow method and the c apitalisation of future maintainable profits method), I need not deal with those methods as ultimately, they were not applied by these witnesses in determining the value of the Estate’s shares in the Companies. 

**_The petitioner’s submissions_** 

23     Mr Singh was of the view that the dividend yield method should be used to value the Estate’s shareholdings in the Companies as he felt that the princ ipal reason that a purc haser would buy the Estate’s shares was for the inc ome whic h he would rec eive by way of dividends, rather than for any prospec t of realisable c apital gain. Although shareholders c an typic ally expec t to rec eive a c ash dividend payment and the c ash flow proc eeds of the eventual sale of the c ompany, a minority shareholder with little influenc e or c ontrol has relatively little c ertainty of being able to obtain the benefit of his or her _pro rata_ share of the c ompany as a whole. A liquidation of the Companies is also far more remote than the event of their paying dividends. Therefore, the only proc eeds that c an be expec ted with reasonable c onfidenc e to be rec eived are dependent upon the c apitalised value of future dividends. For these reasons, Mr Singh c onsidered that the level of dividends was the key fac tor in determining the value of minority shareholdings in private c ompanies. 


24     Mr Singh’s position was supported by Christopher G Glover, (“Glover”) the author of “The Valuation of Unlisted Shares”, _Accountants Digest_ No 132, (1983) (“ _Accountants Digest_ ”) at p 30 who states the following: 

 The assets basis alone should be used only to value c ompanies whic h have readily realisable assets with a value independent of the business. Property c ompanies, investment trusts and ship-owning c ompanies and, of c ourse, c ompanies in liquidation are examples of businesses whic h might well be valued on this basis. Nevertheless, the value of small minority holdings in suc h c ompanies, other than those in liquidation, should always be justifiable in terms of the dividend yield sinc e, barring a take-over or possibly a listing, the only way those assets are likely to represent a c ash return to the minority shareholder is in the form of future dividends. 

25     While he rec ognised that the Companies have not paid dividends sinc e their respec tive dates of inc orporation, Mr Singh opined that that in itself did not rule out the use of the dividend yield method. Ac c ording to Wayne Lonergan (“Lonergan”) in _The Valuation of Business Shares and Other Equity_ (Business & Professional Publishing, 3rd Ed, 1998) at p 129, the valuation of minority interests in profitable c ompanies whic h have not paid a dividend c an be assessed at the present value of the eventual return suc h shares might offer to a prospec tive purc haser, whic h will normally be the prospec t of a dividend at some time in the future. 

**_The respondent’s submissions_** 

26     Mr Chan on the other hand, valued the Estate’s shareholdings based on the net asset value method as he c onsidered that the princ ipal purpose of the Companies was the ac c umulation of wealth and not the produc tion of inc ome for distribution to their shareholders. While he ac knowledged that the general rule was that the net asset value basis was not appropriate for valuing uninfluential minority shareholdings (as they had no influenc e whatsoever to forc e the voluntary liquidation of the c ompany to release the full value of the shares to the rightful owners), Mr Chan opined that suc h a family investment c ompany whose princ ipal ac tivity was the passive holding of investments was a spec ial situation whic h fell outside the general rule. 

27     Furthermore, in dec iding on the appropriate method of valuing the Estate’s shares in the Companies, Mr Chan plac ed great emphasis on the fac t that the Companies had not paid any dividends sinc e their respec tive dates of inc orporation. He was of the view that it would be arbitrary to use the dividend yield method – a valuer who values a c ompany whic h does not pay any dividends at all, on a dividend yield basis, would have to impute a hypothetic al future maintainable dividend rate to c alc ulate what the value of a share in the c ompany would be. In c oming to this opinion, Mr Chan relied on the proposition by Glover in _Valuation of Unquoted Securities_ (Gee & Co (Publishers) Ltd, 1987) at p 203 that: 

 If the value of an asset is a func tion of its c ash return, any valuation based on an imaginary c ash return must itself be imaginary. The fac t that there is a substantial disc ount merely makes it a disc ounted imaginary valuation. It is no more logic al to value non-dividend paying shares on an imaginary dividend than it is to value shares in a loss-making c ompany on an imaginary profit, say, the profit it would earn if it were properly managed or if the industry prospec ts were different. Shares must be valued on the basis of their ac tual not their hypothetic al prospec ts. 

**The decision** 

28     Having reviewed the reports of both expert witnesses, I regret that I am unable to ac c ept either expert’s opinion c ompletely; both were only c orrec t in part. 


29     With regards to Mr Chan, it was erroneous of him to hold that this was a spec ial situation that fell outside the general rule that the net asset value basis was not appropriate for valuing uninfluential minority shareholdings. It was unequivoc ally stated by Glover in _Valuation of Unquoted Securities_ ([27] _supra_ ) at p 238 that the same general rule applied regardless of whether the c ompany was a family investment c ompany: 

 For this reason, the assets basis should never be used to determine the value of a c ompany, other than one whose assets have a readily realisable exc hange value, suc h as, property investment c ompanies, investment trust c ompanies and so-c alled “money-box” businesses. Suc h c ompanies are investment intermediaries and not ec onomic enterprises. These remarks apply to c ontrolling interests. Where minority interests are concerned, the assets basis should never be used, even where the company is an investment intermediary. This is bec ause the assets values are out of reac h of the minority shareholder. His interest in the c ompany is restric ted to dividends. [emphasis added] 

30     As regards Mr Singh, he was not entirely ac c urate either in saying that the fac t that the Companies had not paid out any dividends sinc e their respec tive dates of inc orporation had no effec t on the applic ation of the dividend yield method. Granted that Lonergan in _The Valuation of Business Shares and Other Equity_ ([25] _supra_ ) at p 129 did state that the valuation of minority interests in profitable c ompanies whic h have not paid a dividend in rec ent years may be assessed on the prospec t of a dividend at some time in the future, however, Lonergan also went on to say at pp 129–130: 

 Where no dividend payment is likely, a minority shareholder would only acquire the shares on the basis of some prospective capital gain. The nature of this gain and the likely timing and probability of its oc c urrenc e will vary ac c ording to the fac tual c irc umstanc es of the c ase. 

 ... 

 Ac c ordingly, the value attributable to a share in suc h c irc umstanc es will be very low and will be at a very large disc ount (at least 50 per c ent and frequently muc h higher) to the underlying asset backing of shares or the true market value of the shares c alc ulated on the basis of c omparison with listed c ompanies. 

 [emphasis added] 

31     As suc h, where no dividend payment is likely, as in this c ase of the Companies, a minority shareholder would foc us more on the prospec t of some future c apital gain rather than the inc ome that he would rec eive by way of dividends. Consequently, the valuation of the Estate’s shares in the Companies should be based on the net asset value method, instead of the dividend yield method proposed by Mr Singh. 

32     In addition, Glover in _Valuation of Unquoted Securities_ ([27] _supra_ ) doubted the value of using a _hypothetical_ dividend yield in the valuation of shares. It was stated (at p 402) that: 

 Lastly, before leaving this topic , we should perhaps turn to the hypothetic al dividend yield basis of valuation desc ribed in Chapter 9. This tec hnique is sometimes used to value minority shareholdings in non-dividend paying c ompanies. For the reasons given in Chapter 9 this method should never be used in c ommerc ial or legal valuation work. It has no realistic basis to it. It seems to be used in the valuation of shares for fisc al purposes (not by the author), and if it enables agreement to be reac hed on the c orrec t values it may serve a useful purpose. However, it should only be used to justify a valuation arrived at by c orrec t princ iples; it should never be used to 


 arrive at a value in the first plac e. 

33     Although Glover advoc ates the use of the dividend yield method to value minority shareholdings, as seen in [24] and [29] above, he does not advoc ate using it hypothetic ally. In fac t, on the fac ts of this c ase, Glover would not rec ommend the use of the hypothetic al dividend yield basis in the valuation of the Estate’s shares in the Companies. Mr Singh’s use of the dividend yield method for valuing the Estate’s shareholdings in the Companies is thus c ontrary to that expressed by Glover, sinc e no dividends have been paid by the Companies and all Mr Singh relied on were purely hypothetic al figures. 

34     At this junc ture, I turn to c onsider some of the more pertinent examples and c ases raised by the respondent in support of its position that the net asset value method should be used as the basis for the valuation of shares. Unfortunately, all of them c an be distinguished from the c ase at hand. 

35     The first illustration whic h the respondent used to show that the net assets value basis was appropriate for the valuation of shares of the Companies was the rec ent takeover of Raffles Investments Limited (“RIL”) by Aequitas Pte Ltd (“Aequitas”) in 2004, in whic h Aequitas ac quired 2,354,500 ordinary shares, whic h represented 49.83% of the issued share c apital of RIL, from Selec t Sec urities Limited, a subsidiary of OverseaChinese Banking Corporation, for a pric e of $51.70. This pric e was based on a 1.17% disc ount on the adjusted net asset value of RIL and its subsidiaries. The respondent argued that sinc e Aequitas ac c epted that the net asset value method was the appropriate basis for the valuation of the RIL shares, and Aequitas was a subsidiary of Siong Lim, with Siong Lim holding 38% of the shares in Aequitas, Siong Lim’s shares should similarly be valued using the net asset value basis. However, the problem with this parity of reasoning is that it was a majority shareholding of RIL that Aequitas ac quired. It is c learly distinguishable from our c ase given that the Estate’s shareholdings in the Companies are minority shareholdings. As already mentioned earlier, at [15], [24] and [29], there are different bases for the valuation of shares depending on whether it is a minority or majority interest in the c ompany. Moreover, RIL is a public c ompany. 

36     The respondent also relied on the c ase of _Wong Ser Wan v Ng Bok Eng Holdings Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2004] 4 SLR 365</span> (“ _Wong Ser Wan_ ”) in support of its position that the net asset value basis ought to be used for the valuation of the Estate’s shareholdings in the Companies. In that c ase, the plaintiff had alleged that her ex-husband was dissipating his assets, whic h inc luded his shareholdings in the defendant c ompany, by selling them at an undervalue, so as to deprive her of any share in them. In asc ertaining the value of the shares in the defendant c ompany, the c ourt held (at [55]) that: 

 As far as the NBEH shares were c onc erned, sinc e NBEH is a private c ompany tightly c ontrolled by the family, there really is no possibility of shares in the c ompany being sold to any third party and to that extent, there was and is no market value for the shares. The dividend method appears inappropriate to me as the c ompany had no regular polic y of paying dividends and everything depended on the whim of BB Ng or whoever was c ontrolling the c ompany at the time. The more appropriate method of valuing the NBEH shares was that adopted by Mr Chan, though the ac c urac y of that valuation depended on the ac c urac y of the values given to the assets of the c ompany. 

37     Although the struc ture and polic ies of NBEH are rather similar to that of the Companies, it is possible to distinguish that c ompany on the basis that the c ourt there was c onc erned with the fair value of the shares. Here, we are c onc erned with the open market value of the shares. Ac c ording to Glover, in _Accountants Digest_ ([24] _supra_ ) at pp 3–4, there is a distinc tion between market value and fair value. 


 The c entral idea in the c onc ept of market value is that of the most probable buy and sell pric e. The basis of market value is the assumption that if c omparable property has fetc hed a c ertain pric e then the subjec t property will realise the same pric e, or something near to it. 

 ... 

 The c onc ept of fair value is based on the desire to be equitable to both parties. The transac tion is not in the open market; the buyer has not been able to look around for the lowest pric e, nor has the seller been able to hold out for the highest pric e. 

38     Mr Chan also ac c epted, during c ross-examination, that the two c onc epts were different. As suc h, it would be inappropriate to assume that the same method of valuation c an be used to c alc ulate the two distinc t values. 

39     It is also possible to distinguish the c ase on the fac t that although the shares c onc erned were a minority shareholding, they belonged to a c ontrolling shareholder. A c ontrolling stake in a c ompany is valued differently from that of a pure minority interest as the c ontrolling shareholder would have a say in realising his _pro rata_ share of the c ompany. 

40     I c ome now to the final c ase c ited by the respondent, _In re Harry Charrington, deceased_ [1975] HKLR 81 (“ _Charrington_ ”). The c ourt there held (at 94) that: 

 I do not, therefore, c onsider it possible to plac e relianc e on either the basis of dividend yield or earnings yield. I am c onvinc ed that in the highly volatile atmosphere of Hong Kong the ordinary investor is attrac ted more readily by the possibility of c apital gain than by the probability of sec ure annual returns. This, as muc h as the fac t that there had been no dividends paid over the years but only the interest on shares whic h the board was obliged by the artic les to pay, or the fac t that its mounting land values was an important fac tor in giving its shares a high attrac tion, leads me to forsake the dividend yield and earnings yield methods of valuation. I am left with the “asset bac king” method and am c onvinc ed that any shrewd seller would refuse to c alc ulate a selling pric e on any other basis in the pec uliar c irc umstanc es of this c ompany. 

41     Apart from standing for the proposition that the net asset value method should be used for the valuation of shares, the above quoted passage also plainly shows why the c ase should be distinguished from ours. The c ourt had c onsidered the highly volatile atmosphere of and the mounting land values in Hong Kong to be pec uliar c irc umstanc es that warranted the applic ation of the “asset bac king” method in the valuation of the c ompany. This is quite distinc t from our c ase where the Companies are earning low but stable returns. The ordinary investors in our c ase would not be as attrac ted by the assets of the Companies. In addition, unlike the fac ts of the present c ase, there was no one c ontrolling shareholder in _Charrington_. The shares were held by four different families and three independent individuals. With no overarc hing polic y laid down by the patriarc h of the family to keep the c ompany within the family and to ac c umulate wealth, it would have been easier for the shareholders, even the minority shareholders, to obtain their _pro rata_ share of the c ompany as a whole through a sale of the c ompany. 

42     I did, however, find the c ase to be useful in assisting me to c ome to my dec ision. It foc used my attention on the fac t that “when unquoted shares in private c ompanies are to be valued what is to be asc ertained is what would be the pric e whic h a hypothetic al willing purc haser would pay to a hypothetic al willing seller for the right to stand in the shoes of the dec eased” ([40] _supra_ at 87). At the appeal of _Charrington_ , the c ourt in _Hong Kong & Shanghai Bank Hong Kong (Trustee) Ltd v Commissioner of Estate Duty_ ([19] _supra_ ) further elaborated by stating (at 702) that: 


 [I]n eac h c ase the most satisfac tory method [of valuation] was likely to be that in whic h the fac tors whic h would have the greatest weight with the hypothetic al purc haser are those whic h form the basis of valuation. 

43     Taking all of the above c onsiderations into ac c ount, I am of the view that the Estate’s shareholdings in the Companies should be valued on the basis of the net asset value method rather than the dividend yield method. Though none of the c ases c ited by the respondent to support its position are direc tly applic able, it is nonetheless my opinion that a hypothetic al purc haser of the Estate’s shares in the Companies would be attrac ted by the underlying value of the Companies rather than by the possibility of dividends. The Companies have almost $304m worth of assets in total, a large proportion of whic h is c ash. While a hypothetic al purc haser would rec ognise that the possibility of a liquidation of the Companies is rather slim, given Tan’s philosophy, there is no denying that the Companies do have a huge amount of underlying and valuable assets. The purc haser would still be buying into c ompanies worth a partic ular value. In addition, it should be noted that the Companies are investment-holding c ompanies. A hypothetic al purc haser would naturally be more interested in the underlying assets of suc h c ompanies, as c ompared to that of trading c ompanies, as they represent the entire worth of the c ompanies. 

44     In c ontrast, a hypothetic al purc haser has no basis for foc using on the possibility of the Companies distributing dividends. No dividends have been paid by Siong Lim and Chulin for 50 and 30 years respec tively, sinc e their respec tive dates of inc orporation. There is no figure that the hypothetic al purc haser c an rely on realistic ally as the potential dividends that he would be able to rec eive. Consequently, the possibility of dividends would not weigh as heavily as the underlying value of the Companies in the mind of a hypothetic al purc haser of the Estate’s shareholdings in the Companies. 

45     In addition, following the reasoning of Lonergan and Glover, as mentioned in [30] to [33] above, the net asset value method is undoubtedly the more appropriate basis for the valuation of the Estate’s shares in the Companies sinc e no dividend is likely in this c ase. 

**The effect of the last transacted prices of the shares** 

46     It was c ontended by the Petitioner that the sale of the shares in the Companies by the estate of Helene Tan to Tiong Cheng in 1999 and 2000, and by the Estate to Amberlight in 2003, reflec ted the open market value of the shares and should ac c ordingly form the basis of the valuation of the Estate’s shareholdings in the Companies. 

47     I am, however, unable to ac c ept this proposition. As stated by Reginald K Johns and Roy R Greenfield in _Dymond’s Death Duties_ vol 1 (Oyez Publishing Limited, 15th Ed, 1973) at pp 734–735: 

 In the c ase of shares in a c ompany for whic h there is no Stoc k Exc hange quotation or regular market, it is rarely possible to obtain reliable guidance as to the value of the shares for Estate Duty purposes from the prices at which actual sales may have taken place. Even if the artic les of assoc iation do not positively restric t the transfer of the shares, sales are usually infrequent and do not take plac e under open market c onditions. Unquoted shares tend, by their very nature, to be “loc k-up” investments, and sales tend to be forc ed realisations, and to be negotiated more or less privately; so that the pric es obtained at sales within a short time of the death (either before or after) usually indic ate no more than the minimum value. 

 ... 


 Yet it should not be thought that ac tual sales c an always be ignored. On the c ontrary, genuine sales under c onditions similar to those of the open market do sometimes oc c ur, and they are an important c hec k on theoretic al methods of valuation. 

 [emphasis added in bold italic s] 

48     It is therefore c lear from the above quoted passage that the basis of the valuation of the Estate’s shareholdings c annot possibly be the last transac ted pric es of the shares. 

49     The authors, however, qualified their position by stating that the ac tual sales c annot always be ignored. Even so, I am of the opinion that the last transac ted pric es c annot play a role in the valuation of the Estate’s shareholdings in the Companies. The sales c annot be ac c epted as genuine sales c onduc ted under c onditions similar to those of the open market. I am not, however, suggesting that there was any fraud or that there were any fac ts that impugned the validity of the transac tion. The sale to Amberlight, for instanc e, was negotiated by the patriarc h of the family and c ontrolling shareholder of the Companies, Tan. Pric es offered by him would naturally not be indic ative of the open market values of the Companies, as he already possessed the c ontrolling stake in the Companies and the additional shares would not affec t his position. It does not matter that it was ultimately found that Tan did not have any interest in Amberlight whatsoever. The fac t remained that the sale pric e only c ame about through Tan’s negotiations with the Estate. As suc h, I hold that the Estate’s shares of the Companies should be valued independently of their last transac ted pric es. 

**The discount to be applied** 

50     A disc ount is usually applied in the valuation of shares to reflec t the restric tions on and the disadvantages suffered by, the shareholders of a c ompany. As stated by Lonergan in _The Valuation of Businesses, Shares and Other Equity_ ([25] _supra_ ) at p 130: 

 [A] willing but not anxious purc haser of [a minority shareholding, with no dividend payment likely,] may be fac ed with 

- a long investment period 

- a high opportunity c ost in terms of alternative inc ome foregone 

- c onsiderable unc ertainty 

- a highly illiquid investment 

- the risk that the underlying assets may be dissipated, or substantially eroded by investment dec isions in the meantime. 

 Ac c ordingly, the value attributable to a share in suc h c irc umstanc es will be very low and will be at a very large discount (at least 50 per c ent and frequently muc h higher) to the underlying asset bac king of shares ... 

 [emphasis added] 

51     There are two main reasons why a disc ount should be applied to the net asset value of the Companies in the valuation of the Estate’s shareholdings. The first is the lac k of marketability. Sec ondly, the Estate’s shares were minority shareholding in the Companies. 


**_Discount for lack of marketability_** 

52     Ac c ording to Glover in _Valuation of Unquoted Securities_ ([27] _supra_ ) at p 209, unquoted shares lac k marketability in two ways: 

 First, most unquoted c ompanies have few shareholders. The resultant narrowness in the market for a c ompany’s shares makes it diffic ult, and sometimes impossible, to deal. Sec ond, many private c ompanies’ artic les of assoc iation c ontain share transfer restric tions. These typic ally provide that an intending seller must offer his shares to existing members who, if they do not like the intending seller’s offer pric e, c an elec t to have the fair value of the shares determined by the c ompany’s auditors. Only if there are no buyers among existing members is the intending seller free to find a buyer outside the c ompany. And in all private c ompanies the direc tors have the right to refuse to register a transfer of shares. 

53     The same sentiment was also shared by Leonard J in _Charrington_ ([40] _supra_ ) as he stated (at 91) that: 

 The narrower suc h a market is, the greater will be the diffic ulties fac ing the prospec tive purc haser when he c omes to sell so that almost invariably restric tions on transfer must materially [diminish] the pric e. 

54     I should also mention that although it was alleged by Mr Chan, in his report, that no disc ount of the value of shares needed to be given for restric tions on the transferability of the shares, he c onc eded during c ross-examination that he had made an error and that restric tions on transferability were very serious disc ounting fac tors on the pric e of the shares in a small, tightly-held private c ompany. 

55     Applying the above c onc epts, there is no doubt that a disc ount should be applied to the value of the Estate’s shareholdings of the Companies. The Estate’s shares, being unquoted shares of a private c ompany, have little liquidity and lac k marketability. It would c ertainly not be as easy for a shareholder to dispose of his shares in the Companies as c ompared to listed shares. Additionally, there are severe restric tions on the transferability of the Estate’s shares in the Companies. Not only do the Companies’ artic les give the direc tors the right in their absolute disc retion, without assigning any reason, to refuse to register a transfer of shares, they also provide that where there is a refusal to register, but where there is an entitlement to the shares by transmission, the representative of the Estate is only entitled to rec eive dividends but c annot rec eive notic es of or attend or vote at any meeting or exerc ise any of the other rights and privileges of a member. 

**_Discount for minority shareholding_** 

56     As a minority shareholder would not have any c ontrol or influenc e on the c ompany, nor have a say in the management of the c ompany, it is usually more diffic ult to dispose of minority shareholdings. Consequently, suc h shareholdings are typic ally disc ounted to reflec t this disadvantage. 

57     In this c ase, a disc ount should c ertainly be applied to the Estate’s shareholdings in Siong Lim and Chulin sinc e they represent only 14.68% and 4% respec tively, of the Companies’ issued share c apital. A purc haser of the Estate’s shares in the Companies would be in the minority and would effec tively be at the merc y of the c ontrolling shareholders. This disadvantage is further aggravated in the c ase of Siong Lim as its artic les of assoc iation entrenc h Tan’s c ontrol by c onferring on him, as a holder of founder’s shares, 20 votes for eac h founder’s share. This is to be c ompared to the one vote c onferred for eac h ordinary share. The artic les also c onfer on Tan the right to demand that the 


remaining founder’s shares be issued to him at par. A purc haser of the Estate’s shares in Siong Lim would thus additionally be subjec ted to the whims of holders of founder’s shares. 

**_Amount of discount to be applied_** 

58     Before proc eeding further, it is important to state at this junc ture that “the size of the disc ount is not a matter of c alc ulation, or even perhaps of c onvention, but rather of individual preferenc e” (Glover in _Valuation of Unquoted Securities_ ([27] _supra_ ) at p 209). 

59     A disc ount of 30% was applied by the respondents in the valuation of the Estate’s shareholdings in the Companies. Mr Chan c onsidered that this disc ount was fair. On the other hand, Mr Singh c ontended that a greater disc ount of between 87.07% and 93.54% and of between 84.05% and 92.01% should be applied to the valuation of the shares of Siong Lim and Chulin respec tively. 

60     Ac c ording to Glover in _Valuation of Unquoted Securities_ ( _ibid_ ), the most popular disc ount level, amongst those who felt strongly about liquidity being a valuable attribute of an investment and the lac k of it being a deprec iatory fac tor, is 25%, although it c an be as high as 50% for some institutions. This level of disc ount is deemed to be even higher for minority shareholdings. Glover stated (at p 212) that: 

 The minority shareholder, on the other hand, suffers c onsiderably from the lac k of marketability, and for this reason, disc ounts must be at their greatest for the small, uninfluential shareholding. As it would not be unusual when valuing suc h shareholdings to use a dividend yield at least double that available in the stoc k market, a marketability disc ount of 50% may well be justified. 

This disc ount of about 50% is in line with that stated in Lonergan at [30] above. 

61     Given that I have already dec ided that the dividend yield method is inappropriate for the valuation of the Estate’s shares in the Companies, little weight c an be plac ed on Mr Singh’s disc ount figures sinc e they were derived from his applic ation of the dividend yield method. Mr Chan’s opinion that a 30% disc ount is fair is also unreliable as he ac c epted during c ross-examination that no hypothetic al purc haser of the Estate’s shares in the Companies would offer 70% of its pric e. Sinc e the positions taken by both expert witnesses are doubtful, I have dec ided to adopt the middle ground and ac c ept the textbook authorities. I will therefore apply a disc ount of 50% to the net asset value of the Companies. 

**The actual value of Siong Lim’s assets** 

62     There were two main areas of c onc ern over the value of Siong Lim’s assets. First, there was the issue of whic h of Siong Lim’s financ ial ac c ounts to use. Sec ond, the parties disagreed as to whether deferred tax liability ought to be inc luded in the c alc ulation of the net asset value of Siong Lim. These were matters of c onc ern as it was important that the value of Siong Lim’s assets used in the valuation of the Estate’s shareholdings in Siong Lim was c orrec t. Ac c ording to the c ase of _Wong Ser Wan_ ([36] _supra_ ), the ac c urac y of valuations depended on the ac c urac y of the values given to the assets of the c ompany. 

**_Siong Lim’s financial accounts of 30 June 2001 and 31 March 2001_** 

63     As mentioned earlier at [11], the respondent’s valuation of the Estate’s shareholding in Siong Lim was based on its audited financ ial ac c ounts of 30 June 2001. Ac c ording to these financ ial statements, the value of Siong Lim’s net assets as at 30 June 2001 was $345,857,943, and the net 


asset value of eac h share was $253.91. The respondent then applied a further 30% disc ount to arrive at a value of $177.74 per share, upon whic h estate duty was levied. Although s 24 of the Ac t states that the shares should be valued as at the time of the death of the Dec eased, the respondent c ould only rely on the figures of 30 June 2001 as there were no audited ac c ounts of Siong Lim as at 31 Marc h 2001 provided to him. 

64     However, the Petitioner was subsequently able to persuade Siong Lim to c arry out an audit of the c ompany as at 31 Marc h 2001. As these ac c ounts were only produc ed on 1 July 2005, the respondent was not able to inc lude these figures in his c alc ulations of the value of Siong Lim’s shares. I am therefore relying on Mr Singh’s c alc ulations set out in his sec ond affidavit of 4 July 2005, whic h were based on the respondent’s method of valuation, to reflec t the values obtained from the 31 Marc h 2001 ac c ounts. Ac c ording to his c alc ulations, the net asset value of Siong Lim as at 31 Marc h 2001 was $325,960,000, and the value per share was $239.30. Again applying a disc ount of 30%, eac h of Siong Lim’s shares was valued at $167.51, bringing the total value of the Estate’s shareholdings in Siong Lim to $33,502,000. Considering that these values based on the ac c ounts of 31 Marc h 2001 are better able to reflec t the financ ial position of Siong Lim as at the time of the death of the Dec eased, being the period just after the death of the Dec eased, I am of the opinion that they should be used instead of the earlier values, whic h were based on the ac c ounts of 30 June 2001. 

**_The issue of deferred tax liability_** 

65     The audited financ ial ac c ounts of Siong Lim for 2001 did not rec ord deferred inc ome tax liability on the interest inc ome held overseas, nor did they reflec t the market values of the quoted investments and properties. The deferred inc ome tax liability was not reflec ted bec ause under the old Statement of Ac c ounting Standard (“SAS”) 12, a c ompany had a c hoic e or option of rec ording a liability in the ac c ounts, that is, depending on whether the c ompany opted for the “partial” or “all” method for timing or temporary differenc es that gave rise to the deferred tax liability. This provision was subsequently c hanged suc h that, for financ ial statements starting from 1 April 2001, full provision for all deferred tax liabilities, subjec t to some exc eptions whic h are not applic able to Siong Lim, was required. As the new SAS 12 also provided that the c hanges in the ac c ounting polic ies were to be applied retrospec tively, the deferred inc ome tax liability was c orrec ted in the June 2001 c olumn of the audited financ ial statements for June 2002, to reflec t an amount of $20,239,764 of deferred tax liability. 

66     The dispute between the parties was thus c onc erned with whether the $20,239,764 ought to be c onsidered a liability in c alc ulating the net asset value of Siong Lim as at the time of the death of the Dec eased. The respondent alleged that though there was a need to provide for deferred taxation due to the c hange in the SAS, that did not mean that there was a liability. Payment of the inc ome tax liability had yet to be due as at 29 Marc h 2001. I am, however, of the view that that is inc orrec t. The rationale for the c hange in the ac c ounting standard was to notify third parties of the c omplete financ ial position of the c ompany. This is surely indic ative of the fac t that third parties, inc luding a hypothetic al purc haser of the Estate’s shares in Siong Lim, do c onsider deferred inc ome taxation to be a liability, for otherwise, there would have been no need to c hange the SAS. Consequently, the deferred inc ome tax liability should be regarded as a liability in c alc ulating the net asset value of Siong Lim. 

67     Support for this position c an also be drawn from s 18 of the Ac t. The sec tion states that in c alc ulating the “value of the total assets of the c ompany”, there ought to be deduc ted therefrom “suc h sum as on a just and fair c omputation represents any future or c ontingent liabilities thereof whic h are unc ertain in amount”. Given that deferred inc ome taxation is a c ontingent liability 


dependent on when the inc ome held overseas is brought bac k into the c ountry, it ought to be ac c ounted for as a liability in the determination of the net asset value of Siong Lim. 

68     Finally, it is only fair that deferred inc ome tax liability be taken into ac c ount. The respondent c annot take into ac c ount the foreign dividends and interest earned and held overseas as assets of Siong Lim and ignore the related taxes. As mentioned above at [65], the audited financ ial ac c ounts of Siong Lim for 2001 did not rec ord the market values of the quoted investments and properties. However, the respondent did make adjustments to reflec t the market values in c alc ulating the net asset value of Siong Lim. As suc h, as a matter of fairness, he should have made similar adjustments to reflec t the deferred inc ome tax liability of Siong Lim. 

**Conclusion** 

69     For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the Petition in part. Although I am allowing the respondent’s method of valuation to stand, I am of the view that a higher disc ount of 50% ought to be applied to the net asset value of the Companies. Consequently, I grant the dec laration sought in para 8(1) and an order in terms of para 8(3) of the Petition with the disc ount fixed at 50%; para 8(2) of the Petition is dismissed. 

70     Neither party c an c laim to have suc c eeded in these proc eedings. Whilst the Petitioner did obtain a higher disc ount in the valuation of the Estate’s shareholdings in the Companies, it was based on the respondent’s method of valuation; the Petitioner failed in her applic ation to have the shares of the dec eased valued at their last transac ted pric es. Consequently, the most equitable order as regards c osts would be for eac h party to bear its own c osts and I so order. 

Order ac c ordingly.
