Yong Pung How CJ: 

1       This was an appeal against the dec ision of a distric t judge, wherein the appellant was c onvic ted under s 57(1)(d) of the Immigration Ac t (Cap 133, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”), and sentenc ed to seven months’ imprisonment for harbouring an overstayer who had ac ted in c ontravention of s 15(3)(b) of the Ac t. The appeal was against both c onvic tion and sentenc e. After c onsidering the evidenc e in the rec ord, the distric t judge’s Grounds of Dec ision and the Prosec ution’s c ase against the appellant, I dec ided to allow the appeal against c onvic tion and sentenc e. I now give my reasons. 

**The facts** 

**_The charge_** 

2       The appellant was c harged under s 57(1)(d) of the Ac t for harbouring an overstayer, Chen Shixian (“Chen”), between 26 and 27 February 2004 at the appellant’s flat. It was undisputed that Chen, a Chinese national, had ac ted in c ontravention of s 15(3)(b) of the Ac t by overstaying in Singapore for a period exc eeding 90 days after the expiration of his soc ial visit pass. 

3       The main issues in c ontention were: (a) whether the appellant had harboured Chen between 26 and 27 February 2004, and (b) if so, whether the appellant had reasonable grounds for believing Chen to be an overstayer. Ac c ording to s 57(7) of the Ac t, onc e it is proved that the appellant had harboured Chen, it shall be presumed, until the c ontrary is proved, that the appellant knew that Chen was an overstayer. 

**_The Prosecution’s case_** 

4       The Prosec ution essentially based its c ase on Chen’s testimony. Chen testified that he had 


met the appellant for the first time on 26 February 2004, while he was working as a rag-and-bone man. As Chen passed by the appellant’s flat, the appellant offered to sell him a television set. Chen wanted to leave after he realised that he was unable to buy the television set from the appellant as the gate to the flat was loc ked with c hains. However, the appellant c alled him bac k to ask for his help to deliver some doc uments to a lawyer. The appellant then handed Chen three doc uments in English. Chen was initially reluc tant to help the appellant. He told the appellant that his passport had expired and he was c onc erned that he might be arrested at the lawyer’s offic e. However, after the appellant assured him that there would be no polic e offic ers at the lawyer’s offic e, Chen dec ided to help the appellant as he felt sorry for the appellant. 

5       Chen asked the appellant for money for the taxi ride to the lawyer’s offic e, but the appellant said that he had no money. Chen dec ided to use his own money to take a taxi to the lawyer’s offic e. This taxi ride c ost him $12. When Chen reac hed the lawyer’s offic e, he was unable to find the lawyer. He therefore left the doc uments with a lady in the offic e. Chen then c alled the appellant to inform him of this. In response, the appellant told Chen to wait for the lawyer. After waiting for a while, the lawyer had yet to appear, so Chen c alled the appellant again. The appellant instruc ted him to leave the doc uments with the lady and to bring some newspapers bac k to him. 

6       After c ompleting the errand for the appellant, Chen again used his own money ($12) to take a taxi to return to the appellant’s flat, where the appellant thanked him for his help. Chen testified that he entered the flat bec ause the appellant had told him to do so. Although the gate was loc ked with c hains, the c hains were rather loose, so that he was able to squeeze into the flat through a gap c reated by pushing the gate. 

7       After Chen entered the flat, he saw that the flat was very messy and dec ided to help the appellant tidy the flat. The appellant asked Chen whether he knew of a lady who c ould help him to tidy the plac e. Chen said that there was a friend who would be able to help but that the appellant must be willing to pay for this. Chen testified that the appellant offered him $100 for the job. Sinc e Chen c ould not finish tidying the flat by himself, he dec ided to ask his friend, a Chinese lady known as “Little Sister” (“LS”) for help and he would split the money equally with her. 

8       Subsequently, Chen brought LS to the appellant’s flat. LS entered the flat in the same way Chen did, by squeezing through the gap c reated by pushing the gate. After Chen and LS had c ompleted the work, they asked the appellant for payment. The appellant told them that he had no money to pay them. Instead, he suggested that they stay the night at his flat. 

9       Chen next went out to buy dinner for LS, the appellant and himself. During dinner, the appellant offered to rent a room to them at $80 per person per month. Chen agreed to take up the offer as the rent offered by the appellant was lower than what he was paying for his plac e at Choa Chu Kang. Chen felt that he c ould take advantage of the low rent and simply forget about the $ owed to him by the appellant. Chen also testified that he had told the appellant at least twic e that his passport had expired. This was bec ause Chen believed that, if he did not inform the appellant at the outset of his immigration status, the appellant might c all the polic e to have him arrested should the appellant later disc over that he was an overstayer. Having assisted the appellant, Chen felt that he c ould trust the appellant not to inform the polic e. 

10     Chen and LS later spent the night in the living room. On the following day, 27 February 2004, the appellant passed them two piec es of paper and sent them on an errand to withdraw money from a bank. Chen was initially reluc tant to go to the bank as he felt that, due to his immigration status, he might be arrested. However, the appellant assured Chen otherwise, saying that he would speak to the manager of the bank. 


11     When Chen and LS reac hed the bank, one of the c ounter staff informed them that the two piec es of paper were for opening an ac c ount. Puzzled, they left the bank and Chen c alled the appellant to seek c larific ation. The appellant’s response was that he would inform the manager ac c ordingly and they should return to the bank. Bac k at the bank, the manager told Chen and LS to take a seat in the waiting area. Later on, LS managed to slip away. As for Chen, the polic e subsequently arrived and arrested him. 

12     The other witness for the Prosec ution was Aw Ann Beng (“Aw”), the operational manager of the bank. Aw gave evidenc e that the appellant spoke to him on the phone on 27 February 2004. The appellant c omplained that a Chinese c ouple had stolen a pre-signed withdrawal vouc her from him. When Aw informed the appellant that the Chinese c ouple was at the branc h, the appellant told Aw to c all the polic e as the c ouple were illegal immigrants and if Aw did not detain them, Aw would be c ommitting a c rime. 

13     Staff Sergeant Gan Ong Peng (“SSgt Gan”), the investigating offic er, also testified for the Prosec ution. He gave evidenc e that during his first visit to the appellant’s flat on 12 Marc h 2004, he saw three c hains with padloc ks on the gate. He further observed that the c hains on the gate c ould be extended, suc h that a person c ould squeeze through the gap c reated. SSgt Gan also testified that the appellant c laimed that he did not have the keys to the loc ks and was loc ked in with his (the appellant’s) c onsent. 

**_The defence_** 

14     The appellant’s defenc e was that Chen and LS had never entered the flat either on 26 or 27 February 2004. The appellant said that it was impossible for them to enter the flat as the gate to the flat was tightly sec ured with c hains and he did not have the keys to unloc k the c hains. The appellant testified that he did not see Chen and LS on 26 February 2004, but only on 27 February 2004 when they pestered him for a loan. Eventually, Chen threatened the appellant into signing a doc ument authorising them to withdraw money from the appellant’s ac c ount. Chen also stole two banking doc uments from the appellant. The appellant related these events to a c hurc h c ounsellor known as Mr Yeo, who then made the phone c all to the polic e. It was suggested that Chen was probably angry with the appellant for c ausing him to be arrested and, in revenge, c onjured up the allegation that the appellant had harboured him. 

15     The younger sister of the appellant, Yeo Siang Kiang Irene (“Irene”) and the appellant’s exwife, Lim Meng Hong (“Suzie”) also gave evidenc e for the Defenc e. They testified that they did not think that anyone c ould squeeze through any gap at the gate as it was tightly sec ured with c hains and the appellant did not have the keys to unloc k the c hains. 

**The decision below** 

16     The distric t judge observed that this was essentially a c ase of one man’s word against another. She went on to examine the testimony of Chen and the appellant. In assessing Chen’s evidenc e, the distric t judge was mindful that Chen might well have had an axe to grind against the appellant, and so she sc rutinised Chen’s evidenc e with great c are and c irc umspec tion. Nevertheless, having had the opportunity to observe Chen c losely on the witness stand, the distric t judge found Chen’s testimony to be generally c onsistent. At [55] of her Grounds of Dec ision ([2005] SGDC 1), the distric t judge held: 

 I also observed that Chen answered questions without hesitation and gave his testimony in a forthright manner. I assessed him to be a witness of truth. Though there were c ertain parts of his 


 testimony that may appear, at first glanc e, to be inc onsistent, I found these inc onsistenc ies (if at all) minor and immaterial. They did not undermine his evidenc e in respec t of the key issues relating to the c harge. 

17     On the other hand, the distric t judge found the appellant’s evidenc e to be riddled with inc onsistenc ies, replete with afterthoughts and peppered with outright lies. In short, the distric t judge rejec ted the appellant’s evidenc e in its entirety and ac c epted Chen’s version of events. 

18     The distric t judge was satisfied that Chen met the appellant at his flat on 26 February 2004 and assisted the appellant to deliver some doc uments to a lawyer. She also ac c epted the Prosec ution’s c ase that on 26 February 2004, the appellant allowed Chen to enter the flat by pulling the gate to fully extend the c hains thereon. The distric t judge found as a fac t that at the material time, the c hains used to loc k the gate were loose enough to allow Chen (and subsequently LS) to squeeze through the gap c reated. She dec ided to rejec t the Defenc e’s c ase that the c hains were utilised to tightly sec ure the gate of the flat on 26 and 27 February 2004. She further found that Chen and LS had assisted in tidying the flat. However, as the appellant had no money to pay them, he sought to appease them by allowing them to spend the night in the flat. To “sweeten” the deal, he even offered to rent them a room at the low rate of $80 per person per month. The distric t judge opined that the appellant probably realised that he would have to get rid of Chen and LS as soon as possible or he might get into trouble when the owner found out that he had allowed others to stay in her flat. As suc h, the appellant sent Chen and LS on an errand to the bank the next day. Thereafter, the appellant alerted the bank and the polic e so that Chen and LS c ould be arrested. 

19     Thus, the distric t judge found that at the c lose of the entire c ase, the Prosec ution had proved the c harge against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. Ac c ordingly, the appellant was found guilty and sentenc ed to seven months’ imprisonment. The sentenc e was bac kdated to 9 September 2004, the date on whic h the appellant had been remanded when he was first c harged with this offenc e. 

**The appeal** 

20     In this appeal before me, the appellant essentially c hallenged the distric t judge’s ac c eptanc e of Chen’s version of events. His main submission was that Chen was not a reliable, c redible or trustworthy witness as his testimony was full of c ontradic tions, inc onsistenc ies and irrationalities. In the appellant’s submissions, he raised various c ontradic tions in Chen’s testimony, but I will only deal with those that were material to the c harge. 

21     The Prosec ution premised its submissions primarily on the distric t judge’s Grounds of Dec ision. The Prosec ution argued that sinc e the judge had given c lear and c ogent reasons as to why she believed Chen and not the appellant, suc h findings of fac t that hinged on the judge’s assessment of the c redibility of the witnesses should not be lightly disturbed. 

**_Principles of appellate intervention_** 

22     Indeed, a perusal of the distric t judge’s Grounds of Dec ision would reveal that she had made various findings of fac t based on an assessment of the c redibility of the witnesses. In this regard, I agree with the Prosec ution that an appellate c ourt should be slow to overturn suc h findings unless they are plainly wrong or against the weight of evidenc e, espec ially when an assessment of the c redibility and verac ity of the witnesses has been made: _Lim Ah Poh v PP_ [1992] 1 SLR 713 at 719, [32], as c ited in _Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP_ [1998] 3 SLR 656 at [24] and in _Ang Jwee Herng v PP_ [2001] 2 SLR 474 at [62]. An appellate c ourt may reverse the trial judge’s dec ision only if it is 


c onvinc ed that the dec ision was wrong, and not merely bec ause it entertains doubts as to whether the dec ision was right: _PP v Azman bin Abdullah_ [1998] 2 SLR 704 at [21]. 

23     However, one must also bear in mind the princ iple that where the trial judge’s assessment of a witness’s c redibility was based not so muc h on his demeanour as a witness, but on inferenc es drawn from the c ontent of his evidenc e, the appellate c ourt is in as good a position as the trial c ourt to assess the same material: _PP v Choo Thiam Hock_ [1994] 3 SLR 248 at 253, [12], as c ited in _Awtar Singh s/o Margar Singh v PP_ [2000] 3 SLR 439 at [39]. 

24     I had said in _PP v Tubbs Julia Elizabeth_ [2001] 4 SLR 75 at [22], that the c ase of _PP v Choo Thiam Hock_ should not be read beyond its c ontext, in that there must be strong objec tive fac ts that weigh so strongly against the dec ision of the trial judge that intervention on appeal is required. Nevertheless, the princ iple remains that where instanc es permit, although the appellate c ourt might not be in a position to assess the witness’s demeanour, it should not refrain from evaluating the c onc lusions of the trial judge based on all the fac ts known to it. As I further stated in the c ase of _PP v Tubbs Julia Elizabeth_ at [23]: 

 In the normal c ase, a judge sitting on appeal should be sensitive to the impressionistic nuanc es whic h invariably c ontribute to the inferenc es drawn by the trial judge, who had the opportunity of observing and evaluating the evidenc e first-hand. This does not mean that a respondent, by invoking the spec tre of Lim Ah Poh (supra) and other like c ases, c an effec tively keep at bay the sc rutiny of an appeal c ourt over the findings at first instanc e. This is merely a guiding princ iple and should not be applied to usurp the power of the appellate c ourt to c orrec t errors of law and fac t made by a lower c ourt. Rather, it serves as a gentle reminder that an appellate c ourt should exerc ise c areful restraint and only intervene in the rare c ase where logic c learly militates against the findings of fac t made by the trial judge. 

25     The present appeal was c ertainly suc h an exc eptional c ase. It was highly questionable to me whether the Prosec ution had proved its c ase beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, the fac t that the c onvic tion of the appellant was based solely on Chen’s testimony was of spec ial signific anc e. I have to emphasise that in suc h c irc umstanc es, it was imperative to make a finding that Chen’s testimony was _so compelling to the extent that a conviction might be based solely on it_ : _Kuek Ah Lek v PP_ [1995] 3 SLR 252 at 266, [60]. Where the dec ision to believe Chen stemmed from what the distric t judge thought was the c ompelling logic of the situation, it is again open for this c ourt to examine that logic and reverse the findings of the c ourt below if the logic was flawed: _Lee Boon Leong Joseph v PP_ [1997] 1 SLR 445 at [46]. It bears repeating that although there is no prohibition against relying on the evidenc e of one witness, there is always a danger where a c onvic tion is based solely on one witness’s evidenc e. To warrant a c onvic tion on the testimony of one witness alone, the trial c ourt has to be aware of the dangers and subjec t the evidenc e to c areful sc rutiny: _Low Lin Lin v PP_ [2002] 4 SLR 14 at [49]. 

**_Whether it was safe to convict the appellant based on Chen’s testimony_** 

26     The Prosec ution had based its c ase primarily on Chen’s evidenc e, but a c areful examination of Chen’s testimony would reveal numerous weaknesses that rendered the c onvic tion of the appellant extremely unsafe. Chen’s testimony was riddled with material c ontradic tions and improbabilities, whic h I shall now set out. 

27     First, Chen’s evidenc e of his first enc ounter with the appellant on 26 February 2004, where he assisted the appellant to deliver some doc uments to a lawyer, revealed several improbabilities. Ac c ording to Chen, the appellant c alled him bac k to ask for his help to deliver some doc uments to a 


lawyer. The appellant then passed him three doc uments in English. In the first plac e, it was diffic ult to believe that the appellant would pass important doc uments meant for a lawyer to Chen, a rag and bone man he had met for the first time. 

28     In addition, Chen said that his initial response to the appellant was that he c ould not help the appellant as his passport had expired. I found it unbelievable that Chen, knowing that he would be sent bac k to China if he was c aught, would reveal his immigration status so readily to the appellant, a person he was meeting for the first time. This was espec ially so sinc e Chen had admitted in c rossexamination that he would not normally volunteer information about his immigration status to others. 

29     Further, Chen said that when he asked the appellant for money for the taxi ride to the lawyer’s offic e, the appellant said that he had none. Yet, out of pity for the appellant, Chen dec ided to take a taxi with his own money. This taxi ride c ost Chen $12. Ac c ording to Chen, he had c alled the appellant twic e to inform the appellant that he had left the doc uments with the lady at the lawyer’s offic e. As Chen did not manage to see the lawyer, he also told the appellant that he would not take the newspapers bac k. What I found unbelievable was the fac t that despite finishing his task and not having to deliver any newspapers to the appellant, Chen dec ided to use his own money ($12) to take a taxi to return to the appellant’s house. It seemed inexplic able why Chen, having finished his task, would find it nec essary to return to the appellant’s house. Chen’s explanation was that he had to inform the appellant that the doc uments had been delivered. To my mind, this explanation was illogic al, as Chen had already informed the appellant twic e over the phone that the task was c ompleted. There was no reason for Chen to spend his own money to return to the appellant’s flat when he had already relayed the information over the phone. 

30     When Chen was questioned during c ross-examination, he c laimed that talking to the appellant on the phone was not as c lear as talking to the appellant in person. Again, this explanation does not hold water in the light of the fac t that Chen had not only ac c epted instruc tions from the appellant over the phone, but had also told the appellant over the phone that the doc uments had been delivered. I found it highly unbelievable that the only purpose for Chen’s return to the appellant’s flat was to simply inform the appellant that the doc uments had been delivered. In the light of the illogic ality in Chen’s ac c ount of how he had helped the appellant to deliver doc uments on 26 February 2004, I found it diffic ult to agree with the distric t judge’s ac c eptanc e of this part of Chen’s testimony. 

31     I also found that there were far too many doubts in Chen’s ac c ount of how he had entered the appellant’s flat. The distric t judge found that the appellant had allowed Chen to enter the flat by pulling the gate to fully extend the c hains thereon. Chen also testified that he had pushed at the gate to c reate a gap. The distric t judge then found as a fac t that, at the material time, the c hains used to loc k the gate were loose enough to allow Chen (and subsequently LS) to squeeze through the gap c reated. 

32     In my view, not only was the idea of squeezing through a gap at the gate highly suspec t, the manner in whic h Chen allegedly squeezed through this gap was physic ally impossible. It was not disputed that the gate only opened outwards, and I would imagine most gates in flats open in a similar fashion. Logic ally, if the gate only opened outwards, it was ridic ulous how the appellant, by pulling the gate from inside the flat, and Chen, by pushing the gate from outside, c ould c reate a gap large enough for Chen to squeeze through. No matter how loose the c hains around the gate might have been, sinc e Chen was standing on the outside of the gate, his ac tion of pushing the gate inwards would make it impossible to c reate any gap. Instead, it would have c losed the gate shut. As suc h, it was impossible that Chen c ould have squeezed his way into the flat in the way he desc ribed. The logic al way to c reate suc h a gap, provided that the c hains were loose enough, would be for Chen 


to pull the gate, and for the appellant to push the gate. Although Chen’s testimony was sworn in Mandarin, I believe that suc h a material inac c urac y in his testimony, whic h was c ruc ial to the question of whether he had entered the appellant’s flat, c ould not simply be attributed to inadvertent mistakes made in translation. The Prosec ution’s c ase was gravely undermined by the inherent improbabilities in these fac ts before me. 

33     There was also little evidenc e to prove that the c hains were loose on the material dates. Although the distric t judge was entitled to rejec t the c hains admitted in evidenc e during the Defenc e’s c ase as proof of the c hains that loc ked the gate between 26 and 27 February 2004, on the basis that these c hains were found in August 2004 after the alleged offenc e, this did not mean that the testimony of SSgt Gan was immediately illustrative of how the gate was loc ked on the material dates. To begin with, SSgt Gan’s observations on 12 Marc h 2004 were likewise made after the alleged offenc e. Moreover, as highlighted by the appellant, SSgt Gan’s testimony, that he saw three c hains with padloc ks on the gate, was different from Chen’s testimony that there were four to five c hain loc ks on the material dates. Using the same line of reasoning, SSgt Gan’s observations on 12 Marc h 2004 c ould not, by themselves, be determinative of the way the c hains were used on the material dates. 

34     There was also c onflic ting testimony as to how the c hains were normally sec ured around the gate. I notic ed that SSgt Gan observed, during his visit to the appellant’s flat, that the c hains c ould be extended suc h that a person c ould still squeeze through the gate. On the other hand, Irene and Suzie testified for the Defenc e that they did not think that anyone c ould squeeze through the gate. Contrary to the Prosec ution’s submissions, the distric t judge was not justified in preferring the evidenc e of SSgt Gan to Irene’s and Suzie’s, for the same reason that all three of them were unable to testify as to the ac tual events on the material dates. In addition, I took note of the fac t that SSgt Gan did not ac tually attempt to squeeze through the gate, whic h c ould prove that all the c hains sec uring the gate were loose, but he only made an observation that he thought it was possible for a person to squeeze through the gate. Given that SSgt Gan’s evidenc e was based merely on observations and there was c onflic ting evidenc e, I was not inc lined to take the view that the distric t judge took, espec ially sinc e Chen’s ac c ount of how he entered the appellant’s flat already appeared highly improbable. With suc h c onfusing evidenc e, it was very diffic ult for me to affirm this c onvic tion. 

35     The c onsistent thread in Irene’s and Suzie’s testimony was that the appellant’s other sister, Jenny Yeo (“Jenny”), wanted to keep the appellant loc ked in for his own protec tion as he was medic ally unwell. This was also to prevent the appellant from bringing junk bac k to the flat. Sinc e the purpose of the c hains was to loc k the appellant in, it appeared to me to be highly improbable that the c hains, or at least, the partic ular c hain(s) used by Jenny, would be so loosely sec ured that a person c ould squeeze through a gap at the gate, as this would mean that the appellant c ould likewise leave the flat. Similarly, if Jenny wanted to keep the appellant loc ked in, it was improbable for the appellant to have the keys to the partic ular c hain(s) used by Jenny. Notwithstanding the possibility that the appellant c ould have added on other c hains, or might have the keys to the other c hains, I would imagine that so long as one or more of the c hains was tightly sec ured, it would be impossible to c reate a gap that was large enough for a man to squeeze through. The Prosec ution made the suggestion that the reason for the c hains being kept loose was for the appellant to esc ape in c ase of emergenc y. However, this suggestion flew against the fac t that one of the main reasons why the appellant was kept loc ked in was bec ause of his mental defec ts. It was therefore doubtful that Jenny would risk leaving a gap through whic h the appellant c ould leave the flat. Also, if there was a real emergenc y, the appellant c ould always ask for help through the open window or by making a phone c all. 

36     I would also like to add that I agreed with the distric t judge that Jenny would be the best 

## [1] 


person to give an ac c ount as to how the c hains were sec ured on the material dates. However, it must be stressed that the burden was not on the appellant to prove his innoc enc e by proving that the c hains were tightly sec ured on the material dates. Instead, the burden was on the Prosec ution to prove that the c hains were loosely sec ured on the material dates suc h that a gap c ould be c reated for Chen to enter the appellant’s flat, sinc e the nub of the Prosec ution’s c ase depended on whether Chen c ould enter the appellant’s flat. With suc h doubtful evidenc e, it was signific antly questionable whether the Prosec ution had proved its c ase beyond a reasonable doubt. 

37     I further found that Chen’s ac c ount of how he and LS were offered $100 to tidy the appellant’s flat was highly doubtful. Not only did I think that it was dubious for Chen to return to the appellant’s flat after delivering the doc uments to the lawyer’s offic e, I also c ould not understand why Chen would enter the flat of the appellant, a stranger, simply bec ause he was told to do so. The fac t that Chen allegedly entered the appellant’s flat by squeezing through the gap, instead of asking the appellant to unfasten the loc ks, made the entry into the appellant’s flat seem even more dubious. It begged the question as to why Chen would willingly enter the flat of a stranger in suc h a queer manner. 

38     When the appellant asked Chen whether there was anyone to help tidy the flat, Chen’s response was that there was someone who would be able to help, but the appellant must be willing to pay. Yet again, I found the fac t that Chen would ask the appellant for money at this stage to be highly suspec t. Chen knew for a fac t that the appellant had no money, sinc e Chen himself had to pay $24 for the taxi fares for the alleged journeys to and from the lawyer, yet Chen still asked the appellant for money for tidying the flat. Moreover, Chen’s behaviour seemed irrational. Chen c laimed that he had helped the appellant to deliver the doc uments and tidy the flat as he felt sorry for the appellant. However, in the next breath, he dec ided to ask the appellant for money for tidying the flat. 

39     With regard to the appellant’s offer of $100 to Chen for tidying the flat, Chen testified that he dec ided to ask LS for help and split the money with her as he c ould not finish the job. Onc e again, I found the behaviour of Chen to be irrational. Chen, knowing full well that the appellant had no money even to pay for his taxi fare, ac tually believed that the appellant would pay him $100 for c leaning up the flat and even dec ided to rope in his friend, LS, to help. When Chen was asked whether he was worried he would not be paid, his answer was simply, “I saw [the appellant] was quite pitiful.” This flew against the fac t that Chen was the one who ac tually asked the appellant for money for tidying the flat. If Chen truly felt sorry for the appellant, there was no reason for him to ask the appellant for money for tidying the flat. Chen’s version of events showed him to be, at one moment, altruistic , and at the next, opportunistic. The distric t judge ac c epted Chen’s explanation that as a worker, he would not ask his employer whether he had money to pay, but this did not detrac t from the fac t that Chen already knew for a fac t that the appellant had no money. 

40     Finally, in my opinion, Chen’s ac c ount that the appellant offered him and LS a night’s stay, as well as a low rental at $80 per month per person was also riddled with improbabilities. Chen testified that after he and LS had finished tidying the flat, the appellant said that he had no money to pay them. The distric t judge then made the inferenc e that, in order to appease Chen, the appellant offered Chen and LS a night’s stay. Although Chen told the appellant that his passport had expired, the appellant said that it was all right. Chen then allegedly went to buy dinner for the appellant, himself and LS. To begin with, I c ould not understand why Chen had to buy dinner for the appellant. Ac c ording to the medic al reports and the testimony of Irene and Suzie, the appellant was mentally defec tive and inc apable of taking c are of himself. Henc e, his meals were taken c are of by welfare offic ers, his relatives or his maid. Irene testified that for lunc h, people from soc ial welfare would usually bring food to the appellant and for dinner, a maid would usually bring food to him. If the maid usually brought food to the appellant at night, I found it to be too muc h of a c oinc idenc e that on the 


partic ular night of 26 February 2004, the maid did not bring food to the appellant, suc h that Chen needed to buy dinner for the appellant. 

41     Chen also c laimed that after dinner, he and LS spent a night in the appellant’s flat on 26 February 2004. This formed the c rux of the c harge that the appellant harboured Chen between 26 and 27 February 2004. The distric t judge made the inferenc e that the appellant offered Chen and LS a night’s stay to appease them, but this did not explain why Chen and LS would ac c ept the offer to spend the night at the appellant’s flat. In the first plac e, Chen testified that the appellant’s flat was very messy. I c ould not imagine that Chen, and maybe LS, having a rented plac e of his or her own, would ac tually spend a night in the appellant’s messy flat, espec ially when the appellant was a person that Chen had met for the first time. The Prosec ution offered another explanation for Chen’s overnight stay at the appellant’s flat, that is, the fac t that Chen’s lease at his plac e in Choa Chu Kang would be ending. However, even if Chen and LS were interested in the low rental allegedly offered by the appellant, there was no explanation as to why they had to spend a night there, sinc e they c ould have moved in the next day. 

42     Apart from the above, I also found that there were various inc onsistenc ies in Chen’s testimony whic h were material to the Prosec ution’s c ase. As mentioned by the appellant, Chen testified that it was over dinner that the appellant offered him a room at a low rental and Chen and LS dec ided to snap up the offer and forgo the $100 allegedly owed by the appellant. Yet, during c ross-examination, Chen said that the appellant only asked him to move in on the sec ond day, on the afternoon that Chen went to the bank, whic h was 27 February 2004. Furthermore, Chen testified that he and LS c ontinued to tidy the flat the next day (27 February 2004), although he had earlier testified that he had finished the job on 26 February 2004 and was not paid for his efforts. To me, it was doubtful that Chen, not having been paid for his efforts on 26 February 2004, would c ontinue to tidy the flat the next day.The greatest c ontradic tion in Chen’s testimony, as pointed out by the appellant, was that Chen initially c laimed that he and LS spent the night in the living room, but during c ross-examination, when Chen was asked where the appellant was when he and LS were tidying the flat, Chen’s reply was that the appellant was in the first room where Chen eventually stayed in. Chen’s inc onsistenc y as to the part of the flat that he ac tually stayed in was material bec ause, if Chen had ac tually spent a night in the appellant’s flat, I would imagine that he would have known at his fingertips where he had slept. 

4       3 Having observed the various inc onsistenc ies and improbabilities of Chen’s ac c ount, I believed that a c onvic tion in this c ase, solely on the basis of Chen’s testimony, was highly unsafe. For a safe c onvic tion, Chen’s testimony had to be c ompelling to the extent that it proved the Prosec ution’s c ase beyond a reasonable doubt. However, this was not the c ase. Instead, similar to my dec ision in _Khua Kian Keong v PP_ [2003] 4 SLR 526 at [26], Chen’s entire ac c ount lac ked persuasiveness due to multiple vac illations. His ac c ount of how he entered the appellant’s house was inherently improbable, and the other disc repanc ies further undermined the c redibility of his testimony whic h was, unfortunately, the only evidenc e relied on for c onvic tion. 

44     Besides, there was also the possibility that Chen might still have an axe to grind, as he was well aware that the appellant was the one who c aused him to be arrested. The possibility that Chen might have c onjured up these allegations against the appellant was very real in the light of his testimony, c ertain parts of whic h seemed to be targeted at imputing the appellant with knowledge of his illegal immigration status, as he kept stressing the fac t that he repeatedly told the appellant that he was an overstayer. The distric t judge quite rightly looked to the c ontent of Chen’s evidenc e. Unfortunately, in my opinion, she drew inc orrec t c onc lusions from her examination of that c ontent. Therefore, in the light of the tenuous evidenc e of Chen, I c ould not agree with the distric t judge’s inferenc es that Chen and LS had entered the appellant’s house between 26 and 27 February 2004, by 


squeezing through the gap at the gate. As suc h, the Prosec ution was unable to prove that the appellant had harboured Chen between 26 and 27 February 2004 and the c onvic tion must be quashed. 

**_Whether the appellant’s testimony should be rejected in its entirety_** 

45     I also c onsidered the Prosec ution’s submission that the appellant’s evidenc e was riddled with inc onsistenc ies, suc h that the distric t judge rightly dec ided to believe Chen and not the appellant. I had looked through these inc onsistenc ies upon whic h the appellant was disc redited, and observed that they were largely related to whether the appellant had knowledge that Chen was an overstayer and to the events that happened at the bank prior to Chen’s arrest. These were not partic ularly material to whether the Prosec ution had made out the _actus reus_ of “harbouring”. Moreover, the distric t judge had opined in her Grounds of Dec ision that there was no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must be believed in its entirety or not at all. So, notwithstanding the inc onsistenc ies, I found that this did not naturally mean that the appellant’s testimony must be rejec ted as a whole. I also found that the distric t judge, in assessing the inc onsistenc ies in the appellant’s testimony, should not have viewed these inc onsistenc ies so seriously in the light of the appellant’s mental defec ts, whic h she rightfully took into ac c ount in sentenc ing. 

46     At this junc ture, it must be reiterated that the distric t judge’s disbelief of the appellant’s testimony did not in any way lower the burden of proof on the Prosec ution. The onus was still on the Prosec ution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Chen did enter the appellant’s flat on 26 February 2004 and that he spent a night there. It was not for the appellant to disprove these events. Espec ially where the Prosec ution is relying on the sole testimony of a witness, the witness’s version of events must be watertight. If not, the c onvic tion would be extremely unsafe. 

**_Whether adverse inferences should be drawn against the Prosecution for failing to call upon certain witnesses_** 

47     I was not inc lined to draw adverse inferenc es against the Prosec ution for failing to c all the lawyer or the lady at the offic e to testify, as it is beyond dispute that stric t c riteria have to be met before suc h adverse inferenc es c an be drawn: _Khua Kian Keong v PP_ ([43] _supra_ ) at [34]. However, by not making these witnesses available to the Defenc e, the Prosec ution had plac ed the Defenc e in an invidious position of being unable to rebut Chen’s bare allegation that he had delivered doc uments on the appellant’s behalf to a lawyer. As a matter of prudenc e, the Prosec ution should have either c alled the lawyer or the lady at the lawyer’s offic e to testify as to whether Chen had paid a visit to their offic e on 26 February 2004 and had handed over some of the appellant’s doc uments to them, notwithstanding the fac t that there is no legal requirement for the c orroboration of Chen’s testimony (as stated c learly in s 136 of the Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed)). This was espec ially so in the present c irc umstanc es, where the events on 26 February 2004 were material to the Prosec ution’s c ase, at least to prove that the appellant did meet Chen on 26 February 2004. 

**_The appeal process_** 

48     On 26 November 2004, the appellant was sentenc ed to seven months’ imprisonment. His sentenc e was ordered to take effec t from his date of remand, 9 September 2004. The appellant lodged the Notic e of Appeal on 3 Dec ember 2004. Ac c ording to the prison authorities, the appellant’s earliest date of release was 29 January 2005. There was no evidenc e in the rec ords that the appellant had made any applic ation for bail pending appeal. On 4 January 2005, a signed c opy eac h of the Rec ord of Proc eedings and the Grounds of Dec ision was served on the appellant. The Petition of Appeal was then lodged on 13 January 2005, and the appeal was fixed for hearing on 1 February 


2005\. As a result, this appeal was rendered ac ademic , as the appellant had already served his sentenc e by the time this appeal was heard by me. 

49     I found this situation regrettable, to say the least. Although the rec ords showed that the proc edure for filing c riminal appeals was c omplied with, I believe that suc h a situation c alls for reforms to the c riminal justic e system so as to provide for suc h spec ial c irc umstanc es. I believe that, where possible, the c ourts should try to prevent suc h situations from oc c urring. 

**Conclusion** 

50     This was a situation where the c ourt was fac ed with an extremely unsafe c onvic tion as the sole testimony relied on to c onvic t the appellant was riddled with c ontradic tions and improbabilities. Based on the above reasons, I dec ided to allow the appeal. Ac c ordingly, the c onvic tion and sentenc e were set aside. 

Appeal against c onvic tion and sentenc e allowed.
