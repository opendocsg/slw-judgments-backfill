**V K Rajah JA:** 

**Introduction** 

1       The respondent in this appeal (“the Respondent”), a 57-year-old taxi driver, pleaded guilty to one c harge of outrage of modesty under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) before a distric t judge (“the Distric t Judge”) at a hearing in the Subordinate Courts on 4 May 2009. The vic tim was a 15-year-old female (“the Vic tim”). The c harge in question, _viz_ , DAC No 8259 of 2009, reads as follows: 

 You, [the Respondent] are c harged that you, on the 1s t day of November 2008, on a sec ond oc c asion sometime after 8.15pm, at Harvey Ave, Singapore, did use c riminal forc e on [the Vic tim] ..., to wit, by hugging her, knowing it likely that you would thereby outrage the modesty of [the Vic tim] ... and you have thereby c ommitted an offenc e punishable under Sec tion 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. 

The relevant provision, _viz_ , s 354(1) of the Penal Code, reads as follows: 

 Whoever assaults or uses c riminal forc e to any person, intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage the modesty of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term whic h may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with c aning, or with any c ombination of suc h punishments. 

2       The Distric t Judge sentenc ed the Respondent to a fine of $2,000 with one week’s imprisonment in default. A further c harge relating to the Respondent’s touc hing of the Vic tim’s hand was taken into c onsideration for the purposes of sentenc ing. The Prosec ution appealed against the sentenc e imposed. 

3       The Respondent also pleaded guilty to a sec ond c harge, _viz_ , DAC No 8260 of 2009, for an offenc e under the Moneylenders Ac t (Cap 188, 1985 Rev Ed) at the same hearing on 4 May 2009. The sentenc e imposed for this c harge, _viz_ , a fine of $20,000 with four months’ imprisonment in default, was not appealed against. 


**Facts of the case** 

4       At around 8.15pm on 1 November 2008, the Respondent, while driving his taxi, was hailed by the Vic tim along Bedok Road. When the Respondent pulled over, the Vic tim, a foreigner studying in Singapore, informed him that she was lost and had no money. She enquired if the Respondent would take her to Parbury Avenue where she lived. The Respondent agreed to give her a free ride home. 

5       However, the Respondent did not take the Vic tim to Parbury Avenue, and took her, instead, to Harvey Avenue (some 5km from Parbury Avenue). Sometime in the c ourse of the journey, the Respondent used his left hand to touc h the right hand of the Vic tim. The Vic tim eventually alighted from the taxi along Harvey Avenue. As soon as the Vic tim alighted from the taxi, the Respondent also got out of the taxi, and went over to her and hugged her. The Vic tim struggled and managed to break free from his grasp. The Respondent then left the sc ene in his taxi. Eventually, the Vic tim found her way home. 

**The decision below** 

6       The reasons for the Distric t Judge’s dec ision c an be found in his grounds of dec ision ( _ie_ , _PP v Heng Swee Weng_ <span class="citation">[2009] SGDC 339</span> (“GD”)). 

7       From the GD, it is apparent that the Distric t Judge had ac c epted that a fine was an appropriate starting point for an outrage of modesty offenc e involving the “intrusion of the vic tim’s body other than private parts ... exc ept in c irc umstanc es where there is aggravation in the manner of the intrusion” (see GD at [15]). Suc h an approac h was, in his view, supported by the sentenc ing dec ision in _PP v David Chee Dah Wei_ , DAC No 25570 of 2008 (22 July 2009) (unreported) (see GD at [16]). In that c ase, the ac c used, a former vic e-c hairman of the Paya Lebar Kovan Community Club Youth Exec utive Committee, had been fined $2,000 for hugging a 14-year-old girl whom he had brought to a room in a hotel after some c ommunity c lub ac tivities. The Distric t Judge observed that _PP v David Chee Dah Wei_ and the present c ase had an “almost similar fac tual matrix” (see GD at [16]). He c onc luded (see GD at [17]–[18]): 

17\. I am minded that it is a fundamental tenet of justic e that “like c ases should be treated alike” and that is one of the purposes of the sentenc ing benc hmark as a guideline in ensuring parity of sentenc es meted out to offenders in the Subordinate Courts. 

18\. Having c onsidered the fac ts disc losed in the [Statement of Fac ts], the mitigation plea of the [Respondent] (wherein the Prosec ution made no submissions against) and the c irc umstanc es of the present c ase, I find that justic e would be served against the [Respondent], a taxi driver and a first offender, by imposing a fine of $2,000 in default 1 week imprisonment [ _sic_ ]. 

**Summary of the submissions of the parties on appeal** 

8       The Prosec ution submitted that the Distric t Judge had failed to c onsider the aggravating c irc umstanc es in the c ase, suc h as the fac t that the Vic tim was a young girl alone at night and the fear and trauma that was likely to be suffered by the Vic tim. It was, in addition, submitted that the Distric t Judge had failed to c onsider that the c ases he c ited c ould be distinguished from the present c ase based on, _inter alia_ , the Respondent’s position of responsibility. It was also submitted that the Distric t Judge had failed to c onsider the position of responsibility of a taxi driver _vis-à-vis_ his passenger, and the need to deter offenc es against public transport users, espec ially women and young girls (c iting, _inter alia_ , _PP v Neo Boon Seng_ <span class="citation">[2008] 4 SLR 216</span>). The following was submitted in 


c onc lusion:[note: 1] 

 In the present c ase, it is respec tfully submitted that in view of the need for general deterrenc e to protec t users of public transport, and also that the vic tim was a vulnerable person, namely a young girl who was lost at night and who had sought the assistanc e and help of the [R]espondent, the sentenc e to be imposed ought to be one of several weeks’ to several months’ imprisonment. 

(In fairness to the Distric t Judge, I should point out that none of these submissions were made to him.) 

9       In response, the Respondent submitted that it is trite law that fines are meted out for c ases where there is a lac k of intrusion of private parts (c iting _Teo Keng Pong v PP_ <span class="citation">[1996] 3 SLR 329</span> and _Kwan Peng Hong v PP_ <span class="citation">[2000] 4 SLR 96</span>). It was also submitted that it was unnec essary to c onsider the signific anc e of the position of a taxi driver _vis-à-vis_ his passenger, as the ac t of molestation had oc c urred outside the taxi and the Respondent had been ac ting in goodwill by giving the Vic tim a free ride home. 

**Legal principles relating to appeals against sentence** 

10     The legal princ iples relating to an appellate c ourt’s revision of a trial c ourt’s dec ision on sentenc e are well-established, and need not be set out at length. Suffic e it to say that an appellate c ourt would c onsider revising a trial c ourt’s dec ision only if: 

 (a) the trial judge erred in respec t of the proper fac tual basis for the sentenc e imposed; 

 (b) the trial judge failed to apprec iate the material plac ed before him; 

 (c ) the sentenc e imposed was wrong in princ iple and/or law; and/or 

 (d) the sentenc e imposed was manifestly exc essive or manifestly inadequate, as the c ase may be. 

**Preliminary observations** 

11     The present fac ts painted a troubling pic ture with a number of patent aggravating features. The Vic tim here did not know the Respondent. Lost, distressed and penniless, she had plac ed her trust in the Respondent, a member of the public transport workforc e whom she was entitled to expec t would unhesitatingly ac t with rec titude and c ommon dec enc y. As the Vic tim was unfamiliar with the area, the Respondent had c omplete c ontrol of the situation, both in terms of the vehic le and the route. In these perturbing c irc umstanc es, he hugged the Vic tim against her will, and the Vic tim even had to struggle to free herself. The Vic tim’s situation c an be properly desc ribed as a textbook c ase of vulnerability and haplessness. In c ontrast, the Respondent was in a position of c omplete c ontrol, in respec t of the vehic le, the route c hosen, and, indeed, the entire situation. 

**The cases cited by the District Judge** 

12     It seemed plain to me that the Distric t Judge should have been slow to rely on _PP v David Chee Dah Wei_ ([7] _supra_ ). The fac ts in that c ase were somewhat unusual. Apparently, the ac c used had a 

prior friendship with the vic tim.[note: 2] The vic tim herself was a troubled teenager who unreservedly ac c ompanied the ac c used to the hotel, despite notic ing earlier that he had c ondoms in his 


bac kpac k.[note: 3] The vic tim was not restrained from leaving the hotel room. It also bears mention 

that the vic tim took ten days to report the offenc e initially.[note: 4] The lenient sentenc e imposed by the Distric t Court in that matter should perhaps be explained as one pec uliar to its own fac ts and ought not to be relied on as a sentenc ing prec edent by any c ourt. Consistenc y in sentenc ing is a worthy goal, but at times, partic ularly in c ases involving atypic al fac t situations, there is a very real danger that the exc eption might overwhelm the rule if one were to rigidly adhere to “prec edent”. The c ourts should be alert in guarding against this. 

13     The Distric t Judge had also relied on _Chandresh Patel v PP_ [1995] 1 CLAS News 323 as another prec edent pointing to the imposition of fines as the appropriate sanc tion for infrac tions not involving the touc hing of private parts. In that c ase, the ac c used had pleaded guilty to a c harge of outrage of modesty for touc hing the vaginal area of a sleeping female flight passenger. In enhanc ing the sentenc e from three months’ imprisonment to six months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the c ane, Yong Pung How CJ stated the following in his brief oral judgment ( _id_ at 324): 

 The offenc e of outraging modesty under s 354 c overs a wide spec trum of behaviour. But this is not a case of someone who is guilty of a seemingly innocent act, like stroking a woman's thigh on impulse, or making a naughty but harmless nudge. It is also not a case of someone who has had something to drink on the plane, and cannot resist pinching or smacking a passing woman passenger's bottom, in which case a fine of $4,000 or $5,000 in today's circumstances would probably be adequate punishment. [emphasis added] 

14     The importanc e of _Chandresh Patel v PP_ in sentenc ing jurisprudenc e was noted in _PP v QO_ <span class="citation">[2006] SGDC 250</span> by Distric t Judge Kow Keng Siong, who said (at [10]): 

 Chandresh Patel is undoubtedly invaluable – (a) in terms of the guidanc e that it provides and (b) as a sentenc ing prec edent for the purpose of parity and c onsistenc y in sentenc ing. 

Pertinently, however, Kow DJ did not stop there and went on to perc eptively observe ( _id_ at [11]): 

 Having said that, it is also important to note that sentenc ing prec edents and guideline judgements are ‘not binding authorities in the sense that dec isions of the [higher c ourts] on points of substantive law are binding ... on lower c ourts. Indeed they c ould not be, sinc e the c irc umstanc es of the offenc e and of the offender present an almost infinite variety from c ase to c ase’: De Havilland (1993) 5 Cr App R (S) 109, 114 (words in square brac kets added). It is trite law that ‘ each case depends on its own facts and circumstances when it comes to sentencing and ... no pre-established sentence can be applied in respect of a particular offence ’: DT v PP <span class="citation">[2001] 3 SLR 587</span> @ para 75. [emphasis added in original] 

15     _Chandresh Patel v PP_ would appear, at first blush, to be instruc tive and relevant to the present c ase. But a c loser inspec tion reveals a divergenc e in the present fac ts and c irc umstanc es from the examples c ountenanc ed in the passage from that dec ision (whic h is set out at [13] above) that Yong CJ had said would warrant a fine. The Distric t Judge found that there had been no aggravating fac tors present on the fac ts, stating that “[t]he [Statement of Fac ts] did not disc lose any aggravating fac tors exc ept the fac t that the [Respondent] had hugged the [V]ic tim outside the taxi and [touc hed] her hand” (see GD at [15]). With respec t, he had failed to properly apprec iate the fac ts. There were, as noted earlier (see [11] above), several outstanding features that aggravated the offenc e. In partic ular, it bears repeating that the Vic tim had to struggle in order to be free of the Respondent’s unwelc ome embrac e. This would be starkly dissimilar to the examples set out in the above passage from _Chandresh Patel v PP_ , as a “naughty but harmless nudge” and the “smac king [of ] 


a passing woman passenger’s bottom” would have been brief (although nonetheless offensive) and would not have plac ed the respec tive vic tims under any apprehension of any prolonged or great risk to their personal safety. 

**The need for a deterrent sentence** 

16     Public transport providers, suc h as taxi drivers, have a “spec ial position” _vis-à-vis_ their passengers. As was astutely observed in _PP v Neo Boon Seng_ ([9] _supra_ ) by Chan Sek Keong CJ (at [10]): 

 [A] taxi driver is in a spec ial position vis-à-vis his passenger. The taxi driver provides a transport servic e to the passenger for a fee and a passenger, in purc hasing the servic e, not only entrusts the safety of his person but also c ustody of his property to the taxi driver during the journey. 

17     In _Wong Hoi Len v PP_ <span class="citation">[2009] 1 SLR 115</span>, a taxi driver was assaulted by the ac c used, a passenger, after he had c hastised the latter for vomiting in his taxi. The taxi driver was subsequently pronounc ed dead at the sc ene by attending paramedic s. In inc reasing the sentenc e of the ac c used from one month’s imprisonment to three months’ imprisonment, I observed ( _id_ at [11] and [18]): 

 11 The reported inc rease in c riminal ac ts targeting persons working in the field of public transport is worrying. It should be nipped in the bud through, inter alia , deterrent sentenc ing of offenders. There is little doubt that public transport workers (this inc ludes bus c aptains) are more vulnerable to c riminal violenc e than their c ounterparts in most other professions. They are constantly exposed on the service frontline and, very often, are left to fend for themselves when confronted with difficult and/or unruly passengers. In Dunc an Chappell & Vittorio Di Martino, Violence at Work (International Labour Offic e, 2nd Ed, 2000) at p 67, the authors observed that, of lone workers, taxi drivers in many plac es were at the “greatest risk of violenc e”. At the same time, other public transport workers suc h as bus drivers were observed to be at “spec ial risk” ( id , at pp 68–69). The authors also noted that night time was the highest-risk driving period for taxi drivers, and that c ustomer intoxic ation appeared to play a role in prec ipitating violenc e. 

 ... 

 18 With the above in mind, I had no hesitation in agreeing with the distric t judge’s view that it would be in the public ’s interest to impose a c ustodial sentenc e. The c ourts must send a c lear message that all ac ts of c riminal violenc e against public transport workers will not be tolerated. These workers provide the larger c ommunity with an invaluable and essential servic e, and they have every right to work in a safe and sec ure environment. 

 [emphasis added] 

18     The c onverse is also true. Just as public transport workers deserve spec ial protec tion, those who abuse the trust plac ed in them must expec t the law to view their c onduc t as meriting partic ular denunc iation. The “servic e frontline” has two sides and the protec tion ac c orded to one side of the line must, as a matter of logic , be also extended to the other side. In this c onnec tion, I reiterate what I had stated in _Wong Hoi Len v PP_ (at [17]): 


 Likewise, in PP v Law Aik Meng <span class="citation">[2007] 2 SLR 814</span> at [24], I had stated unequivoc ally that where an offenc e involved a vulnerable victim or where a c riminal ac t affec ted the provision of a public service , general deterrenc e should then assume spec ial signific anc e and relevanc e. [emphasis added] 

19     In _PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">[2007] 2 SLR 814</span>, these two sides – both requiring protec tion – were identified in the c ontext of a disc ussion singling out c ategories of offenc es that warrant sentenc es of general deterrenc e. I stated ( _id_ at [24]): 


 General deterrenc e aims to educ ate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a partic ular offender: Meeran bin Mydin v PP <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 522</span> at 525, [9] ... Premeditated offenc es aside, there are many other situations where general deterrenc e assumes signific anc e and relevanc e. These may relate to the type and/or c irc umstanc es of a partic ular offenc e. Some examples of the types of offenc es, whic h warrant general deterrenc e, are: 

 ... 

 ( b ) Offences against vulnerable victims : Offenc es against vulnerable vic tims often c reate deep judic ial disquiet and general deterrenc e must nec essarily c onstitute an important c onsideration in the sentenc ing of perpetrators. In PP v NF <span class="citation">[2006] 4 SLR 849</span>, [42], I stated as follows: 

 [O]ur c ourts would be grievously remiss if they did not send an unequivocal and uncompromising message to all would-be sex offenders that abusing a relationship or a position of authority in order to gratify sexual impulse will inevitably be met with the harshest penal c onsequenc es. In such cases, the sentencing principle of general deterrence must figure prominently and be unmistakably reflected in the sentencing equation. [emphasis added] 

 Australian c ourts have taken a similar stanc e toward offenc es against vulnerable groups of vic tims suc h as the old, the young, the weak and the disadvantaged: see R v Kane (1987) 29 A Crim R 326. 

 ... 

 ( d ) Offences affecting public safety, public health, public services, public or widely used facilities or public security : ... The c ourt must show that suc h c onduc t, however well intended, c annot and will not be tolerated in the c ommunity. An example of an offenc e affec ting public safety is that of drunk driving, whic h puts other road users at a grave risk of danger. Conduct that hinders or impedes public or social policies must also be categorically denounced. For example, offenc es that may subvert the sec urity and c onvenienc e of elec tronic c ommerc e need to be firmly dealt with .... In fac t, all offenc es threatening to undermine or impair financ ial systems merit c onsideration under another c ategory of offenc es altogether presc ribing inexorably hard deterrent sentenc ing .... Suc h a broad head of public interest protec tion c an also embrac e any c onduc t that forebodes systemic risk or peril of any kind. 

 ... 

 [emphasis added in original] 

20     There was no doubt in my mind, therefore, that the present offenc e warranted a deterrent c ustodial sentenc e. A strong message has to be sent out to those working in the public transport servic e sec tor: behaviour taking advantage of more helpless c ommuters utilising these transport servic es will and shall not be tolerated by the c ourts. In _PP v Neo Boon Seng_ ([8] _supra_ ), Chan CJ had no qualms about imposing a c ustodial sentenc e for a property offenc e c ommitted by a taxi driver against a passenger. He explained ( _id_ at [10]–[11]): 


 In my view, the district judge was wrong in principle in regarding this case as not meriting a custodial sentence. Although the offenc e of c riminal misappropriation under s 403 of the Penal Code is c onsidered to be one of the less serious property offenc es in c h XVII of the Penal Code bec ause it does not require a positive ac t of taking as c ontrasted with a negative ac t of keeping something that belongs to another (Jasvender Kaur et al, Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) at p 414), this c onsideration, in my view, should not apply to a taxi driver. The reason is that a taxi driver is in a spec ial position vis-à-vis his passenger. The taxi driver provides a transport servic e to the passenger for a fee and a passenger, in purc hasing the servic e, not only entrusts the safety of his person but also c ustody of his property to the taxi driver during the journey. If the taxi driver finds lost property in the taxi, he should return it to the passenger if he knows who he is and where he lives. If he does not have suc h knowledge, he should plac e the goods within a reasonable time with the taxi c ompany. At the very least, a taxi driver has a legal obligation not to take his passenger’s property and, in my opinion, this duty should be enforc ed stric tly and vigorously. 

 For these reasons, I am of the view that the benchmark for a property offence committed by a taxi driver against a passenger is a custodial sentence unless there are c ountervailing mitigating fac tors (suc h as the nature and insignific ant value of the property) that would make a fine an appropriate sentenc e. In the present c ase, however, the value of the misappropriated items was not insignific ant ..., and the c ontents of the laptop c omputer (whic h might be of no value to the respondent) c ould be worth muc h more to the vic tim than the market pric e of the laptop itself. Even if the rec overed items were disregarded, the value of the unrec overed items was approximately $4,000 .... On these fac ts, it was diffic ult to justify a fine of $6,000 as being suffic ient punishment for a taxi driver in whom a passenger is entitled to repose some degree of trust as to the safety of any property he may have inadvertently left behind in the taxi. 

 [emphasis added] 

21     The present c ase involved the outrage of a 15-year-old girl’s modesty. This was an offenc e against the person, and was not merely a c ase of a passenger leaving property behind in a taxi and the taxi-driver failing to return the property (as had been the c ase in _PP v Neo Boon Seng_ , where the ac c used was eventually sentenc ed to three weeks’ imprisonment for c riminal misappropriation). The c irc umstanc es of the present offenc e are far more troubling and were far more traumatising than those established in _PP v Neo Boon Seng_. Ac c ordingly, I was of the view that the $2,000 fine imposed by the c ourt below is wholly inadequate for the purposes of both punishing the Respondent proportionately and sending out an unequivoc al deterrent signal to would-be offenders. 

**The appropriate sentence** 

22     In _PP v QO_ ([14] _supra_ ) at [14]–[15], Kow DJ helpfully set out the following c onsiderations as a guideline for sentenc ing in outrage of modesty c ases: 

 (a) Whic h part of the vic tim’s body did the offender touc h? (“Fac tor (a)”) 

 (b) How did the offender touc h the vic tim? (“Fac tor (b)”) 

 (c ) How long did the molestation last? (“Fac tor (c )”) 


 (d) Was the offenc e premeditated or c ommitted on the spur of the moment? (“Fac tor (d)”) 

 (e) Were the c irc umstanc es in whic h the offenc e was c ommitted inherently reprehensible? (“Fac tor (e)”) 

 (f) Is the offender rec alc itrant? (“Fac tor (f)”) 

 (g) Is the offender suffering from a mental disorder or intellec tual disability? (“Fac tor (g)”) 

23     While the above fac tors are far from exhaustive, they offer a useful framework for an analytic al sentenc ing dec ision. To begin with, it was not disputed by the Prosec ution that the Respondent had not molested the Vic tim’s private parts (Fac tor (a)). However, the Respondent had used forc e in order to initiate and maintain the unsolic ited hug, so muc h so that the Vic tim had to struggle to free herself (Fac tor (b)). In _Kwan Peng Hong v PP_ ([9] _supra_ ), it was held that an offender would be dealt with more leniently where “the ac t of molest was minor and neither forc e nor c oerc ion was used” (at [64]). This was not the c ase here. Furthermore, while the hug did not last for a long duration, it c ould have led to something else, but for the Vic tim’s resistanc e (Fac tor (c )). 

24     On the fac ts, the Respondent appeared to have already developed inappropriate intentions whilst in the taxi with the Vic tim, given that he had already used his left hand to touc h her right hand in the c ourse of the journey to Harvey Avenue. This c ould not have been a c ompletely spontaneous inc ident (Fac tor (d)). There must have been some degree of planning on the part of the Respondent, as it was a c onsc ious effort by him to emerge from the taxi and to walk over to the passenger’s side of the taxi to deliver his unwanted hug. Giving the benefit of the doubt to the Respondent, however, this fac tor would neither be to the Respondent’s favour nor disfavour. 

25     In c ontrast, there is no doubt that the c irc umstanc es under whic h the offenc e was c ommitted were entirely reprehensible (Fac tor (e)). The Vic tim, a girl lost at night with no money, had plac ed her trust in the Respondent to assist in helping her find her way home. Instead of doing his utmost to ensure the safety of this young female, the Respondent c hose to take advantage of her, under the c over of darkness, in a most odious manner. His ac ts must have left the Vic tim in a state of c onsiderable distress bec ause the polic e rec eived a c all at 8.45pm – barely half-an-hour after the Vic tim had first met the Respondent – from the Vic tim’s mother who informed them that her daughter “was assaulted by a taxi-driver”. 

26     In the light of the above, the fac t that the offender was neither a rec idivist (Fac tor (f )) nor mentally disabled (Fac tor (g)) did little to mitigate his position. 

27     Having c onsidered the overarc hing polic y c onc erns and individual features unique to this c ase, I was satisfied that a term of eight weeks’ imprisonment would be an appropriate sentenc e in the c irc umstanc es. 

**Conclusion** 

28     While taxi drivers and other public transport workers c ertainly ought to be protec ted from dangerous and or unreasonable c ommuters, partic ularly given the potentially risky nature of their jobs, vulnerable members of the public should likewise be protec ted from errant members of the transport sec tor workforc e. This rec iproc al protec tion is sensible, partic ularly in c ases suc h as this where the female vic tim was young, lost and helpless, and the male perpetrator was c ompletely in c ontrol throughout. I emphasise that all passengers travelling in taxis are entitled to expec t, at all times, that they c an do so in c omplete safety without being taken advantage of by taxi drivers regardless of 


whether they are fare paying passengers or not. 

29     For the foregoing reasons, the Prosec ution’s appeal was allowed and the sentenc e of the Distric t Judge was set aside. The Respondent was sentenc ed to eight week’s imprisonment. The fine of $2,000, whic h had already been paid by the Respondent, was ordered to be returned to him. Finally, I would like to thank c ounsel for their assistanc e. In partic ular, I would like to c ommend Mr Aedit Abdullah for having ably presented his c ase in an even-handed and c onc ise manner.
