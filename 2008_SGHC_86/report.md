Lee Seiu Kin J: 

1       Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd (“JSPL”) is a c ompany inc orporated in Singapore. It has been in the marine engineering business for four dec ades. In or around 2002, it ventured into rig building and this aspec t of JSPL’s business expanded rapidly. Today, JSPL is a renowned “one-stop” shipyard, offering a c omprehensive range of servic es in ship repair, shipbuilding, ship c onversion, rig building and offshore engineering, and employing almost 2000 workers. Rig building represents a substantial part of JSPL’s business. Its immediate holding c ompany is SembCorp Marine Ltd (“SCM”), a leading global marine engineering group. 

2       BNP Paribas (“BNPP”) is one of the world’s largest international banking networks with a strong position in Asia and a signific ant presenc e in the United States. In 2007, it was sixth in the banking industry and first out of the Frenc h c ompanies in the Forbes Global 2000 rankings. 

3       On 23 November 2007, JSPL took out the present originating summons No 1727 of 2007 (“the present originating summons”) for an injunc tion to restrain BNPP from c ommenc ing winding-up proc eedings subsequent to a statutory demand by BNPP for US$50,723,070 (“the alleged debt”), dated 20 November 2007. 


**Interlocutory applications** 

4       On 23 and 26 November 2007, I heard an opposed _ex parte_ applic ation in Summons No 5245 of 2007 for BNPP to be restrained from presenting any summons or other applic ation for the winding up of JSPL based on the statutory demand. This applic ation was settled by BNPP’s undertaking not to present any winding-up petition until the disposal of the originating summons or until further order of the c ourt. 

5       From 4 to 6 February 2008, I heard three applic ations regarding the admission of various affidavits: Summons No 329 of 2008 (“SUM 329/2008”); Summons No 294 of 2008 (“SUM 294/2008”); and Summons No 5493 of 2007 (“SUM 5493/2007”). 

6       In SUM 329/2008 JSPL sought, _inter alia_ , that “leave be granted to [JSPL] to file the fourth affidavit of Heinz Riehl and the sixth affidavit of Tan Cheng Tat” (“prayer 1”). Heinz Riehl is an expert witness for JSPL and his affidavit exhibited signed c opies of an expert report and supplemental expert report that had been annexed to his earlier affidavits but not signed due to an oversight. Tan Cheng Tat is the financ ial c ontroller of JSPL and his affidavit exhibited a press report whic h was published after JSPL’s affidavits were filed on 4 January 2008. BNPP did not objec t to the applic ation and I gave an order in the terms of prayer 1. 

7       In SUM 5493/2007, BNPP sought, _inter alia_ , to expunge and strike out c ertain paragraphs and exhibits in the affidavit of Tan Kwi Kin (a direc tor of JSPL) filed on 23 November 2007 on the grounds that they are sc andalous, irrelevant and/or otherwise oppressive (“prayer 1”); to expunge and strike out c ertain paragraphs in the affidavit of Tan Cheng Tat filed on 23 November 2007 on the same grounds (“prayer 2”); as well as to expunge and strike out c ertain paragraphs and/or words in the affidavit of Tan Cheng Tat filed on 4 Dec ember 2007, again on the grounds that they are sc andalous, irrelevant and/or otherwise oppressive (“prayer 3”). The evidenc e sought to be struc k out broadly pertained to negotiations between the parties on the proc edure to be used for the c lose-out on 31 Oc tober 2007 (see [24] and [25] below) and drafts of an agreement to be exc hanged and exec uted by the parties in respec t of this proc edure (“the Close-out Agreement”: see [25] below), as well as the fac t that BNPP had heard in the market that another bank, Soc iete Generale (“SG”), had rec eived a c onditional payment from JSPL and that a “without prejudic e” meeting between BNPP and JSPL had been held. BNPP submitted that the evidenc e pertained to privileged disc ussions that were expressly stated to be made without prejudic e. JSPL submitted that the evidenc e was admissible to show a c ollateral c ontrac t that JSPL would only pay after BNPP had brought an ac tion and obtained judgment against it for the alleged debt; that BNPP was estopped from c laiming privilege as it had represented to JSPL that it would not need to make an upfront payment of the alleged debt, whic h induc ed JSPL to enter into the Close-out Agreement; that the evidenc e was relevant for the purposes of rec tific ation, if the c ourt should find that the Close-out Agreement did not require JSPL to make suc h an upfront payment; and that the evidenc e was admissible if the c ourt should find that the Close-out Agreement was ambiguous on this issue. I ac c epted JSPL’s submissions in respec t of c ollateral c ontrac t and estoppel and dec lined to strike out the evidenc e relevant for the purposes of those arguments. Ac c ordingly, I granted an order in terms of prayer 1 only in respec t of para 90 of Tan Kwi Kin’s affidavit (pertaining to the c onditional payment to SG) and exhibits at pages 130 and 132 (pertaining to the without prejudic e meeting), and dismissed prayer 1 in respec t of the other evidenc e; I also dismissed prayers 2 and 3. 

8       In SUM 294/2008, BNPP sought, _inter alia_ , to expunge and strike out from the c ourt rec ords the affidavit of Ajaib Haridass (a direc tor of SCM and also a member of its Audit Committee and Chairman of the Board Risk Committee) and c ertain parts of the fourth affidavit of Tan Cheng Tat as well as the sec ond affidavit of Tan Kwi Kin, both filed on 4 January 2008 (“prayer 1”) whic h broadly pertained to 


negotiations between JSPL and BNNP leading up to the c lose-out on 31 Oc tober 2007 (see [24] and [25] below). This was on the grounds that they are sc andalous, irrelevant and/or otherwise oppressive. BNPP also sought leave to file an affidavit in response to c ertain parts of the sec ond affidavit of Tan Kwi Kin, the sec ond affidavit of Lee Yeok Hoon, the sec ond affidavit of Wong Weng Sun, the sec ond affidavit of Yu Ching Ong (all direc tors of JSPL) and the affidavit of Tan Boon Hoo (an expert witness for JSPL), all filed on 4 January 2008 (“prayer 2”) whic h pertained to an alleged BNPP suspense ac c ount (or sundry ac c ount) in whic h there was a c redit standing in JSPL’s name: see [45] below. As an alternative to prayer 2, in the event that leave was not granted to file an affidavit in response as prayed for in prayer 2, BNPP sought for the parts of the affidavits enumerated in prayer 2 to be expunged and struc k out from the c ourt rec ords on the grounds that they are sc andalous, irrelevant and/or otherwise oppressive (“prayer 3”). JSPL’s submissions were the same as for SUM 5493/2007. It had no objec tion to prayer 2 but sought the leave of c ourt to reply to BNPP’s reply affidavit. For the same reasons as for SUM 5493/2007, I dismissed prayer 1. I granted an order in terms of prayer 2, with no further order as to JSPL’s applic ation to file a further reply. No order was given in respec t of prayer 3. 

9       I now turn to the bac kground of the present originating summons. 

**Background facts** 

**_JSPL’s forex transactions with BNPP_** 

_The facility letters_ 

10     Under the c harge of its thenChief Financ ial Offic er, Wee Sing Guan (“Wee”), JSPL started forex hedging ac tivities in 2002 in line with the expansion of its rig-building business. As most of the rigbuilding c ontrac ts were denominated in US dollars (“USD”), JSPL’s primary foreign c urrenc y inflows or rec eivables were denominated in USD (and this remains the situation today). JSPL also had some foreign c urrenc y inflows or rec eivables in Euro. On the other hand, most of JSPL’s expenses were in Singapore dollars (“SGD”), USD, Japanese Yen (“JP Y”) and some Euro. Thus, the net USD foreign c urrenc y exposure was and is the largest financ ial risk that JSPL fac es. 

11     In order to hedge this risk, JSPL entered into forex transac tions with a number of banks, inc luding BNPP. It is not in dispute that BNPP and JSPL entered into various fac ility letters pursuant to whic h BNPP extended c redit fac ilities to JSPL in relation to these forex transac tions. JSPL has produc ed c opies of several of these fac ility letters (“the fac ility letters”): 

 (a) A fac ility letter dated 9 Oc tober 2002, whic h began: 

 We are pleased to inform you that BNP Paribas, Singapore Branc h (the “Bank”) has agreed to make available to Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd (hereinafter referred to as “the CounterParty”) an unc ommitted forward exc hange fac ility that shall be used for your hedging requirements subjec t to the c onditions stated herein and also the Standard Terms and Conditions Governing Bank Fac ilities...annexed thereto. 

 [emphasis added] 

 (b) A fac ility letter between JSPL and BNPP dated 26 August 2003 (“the 26 August 2003 fac ility letter”) whic h provided c redit lines for unc ommitted forward foreign exc hange and unc ommitted foreign exc hange options, and stated that “[t]he Fac ilities shall be used for hedging purposes”. 


 (c ) A fac ility letter between JSPL and BNPP dated on 26 July 2004 (“the 26 July 2004 fac ility letter”) whic h provided a $25m multic urrenc y line for a short term loan and/or banker’s guarantee, as well as lines of c redit for unc ommitted forward foreign exc hange, an unc ommitted foreign exc hange option and an unc ommitted interest rate swap. The 26 July 2004 fac ility letter c ontained a purpose c lause whic h stated: 

 PURPOSE 

 (a) The Short Term Loan Fac ility shall be used solely to financ e the Borrower’s working c apital requirements. 

 ( b ) The Forward Foreign Exchange Facility and Foreign Currency Option Facility shall be used for hedging the Borrower’s foreign exchange exposure only. 

 (c ) The Interest Rate Swap Fac ility shall be used for hedging the Borrower’s interest rate exposure on its medium term loan(s) (“MTLs”). 

 [emphasis added] 

 (d) A letter from BNPP dated 19 September 2005 whic h amended the terms of the 26 July 2004 fac ility letter suc h that the maximum tenor of forex options was extended to 12 months. Some of the standard terms and c onditions were also amended. However, it was not disputed that there was no amendment to the purpose of the fac ilities as stated above. 

It c an be seen therefore that eac h of the fac ility letters c ontained a provision that the fac ilities would be used for hedging. 

_The 1 November 2004 resolution and the Master Agreement_ 

12     Some time after the 26 August 2003 fac ility letter, BNPP and JSPL c ommenc ed negotiations on an International Swap Dealers Assoc iation (“ISDA”) Master Agreement. An ISDA Master Agreement is an international standard form agreement of the ISDA, used by derivative market partic ipants. As a matter of c onvention, where variations are negotiated and agreed between parties, these variations are enc apsulated in a sc hedule whic h would then be read together with the ISDA Master Agreement. 

13     For the purposes of entering into the proposed ISDA Master Agreement, BNPP required a board resolution of JSPL authorising the exec ution of the ISDA Master Agreement and approving the entry into forex transac tions under the ISDA Master Agreement. On 23 July 2004, one Saniza Othman from BNPP’s doc umentation department sent an e-mail to Hardy Saat, a former offic er with BNPP’s fixed inc ome division who was ac ting as a go-between for BNPP and JSPL, attac hing a draft ISDA sc hedule. Part 3(b) of this sc hedule stipulated that a board resolution of JSPL “in a form ac c eptable to [BNPP]” should be furnished to BNPP. Sample forms were attac hed as Exhibits Ia and Ib. From the e-mail c ommunic ations between Saniza Othman and Hardy Saat, it appears that although JSPL initially requested that the board resolution be in the form of Exhibit Ib, BNPP c larified that the c orrec t form of the board resolution to use was Exhibit Ia and JSPL ultimately ac quiesc ed to this. 

14     Thus, on 1 November 2004, a JSPL board resolution (“the 1 November 2004 resolution”) was passed, whic h read: 

 1992 ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT 


## IT WAS RESOLVED THAT: 

 1 The Company enters into the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement (Multic urrenc yCross Border) with BNP Paribas (“the Agreement”), a c opy of whic h together with its Sc hedule is annexed hereto. BNP Paribas may, as its dole [ sic ] disc retion, allow the Company to enter into Transac tions (as defined in the Agreement) under the terms of the Agreement. 

 2 It is in the interests of the Company to enter into the Agreement and the Transac tions. 

 3 The Company has full authority and c apac ity to enter into suc h Transac tions from time to time for the purpose of hedging or on a spec ulative basis. 

 4 The terms and c onditions of the Agreement be and are hereby approved and Mr Yu Ching Ong and Mr Wee Sing Guan are hereby authorized to sign the Agreement. 

 5 That any one of the following persons (“Authorised Signatories”) be the persons authorized and empowered to exec ute and deliver c onfirmations of any Transac tions entered into pursuant to the Agreement, on behalf of the Company. 

 Wong Weng Sun 

 Yu Ching Ong 

 Wee Sing Guan 

 Lee Yeok Hoon 

15     The 1 November 2004 resolution was duly signed by JSPL’s direc tors, namely Tan Kwi Kin, Yu Ching Ong, Heng Chiang Gnee, Wong Weng Sun and Lee Yeok Hoon. The proposed ISDA Master Agreement was then exec uted by Wee and Yu Ching Ong on the same day and, after the 1 November 2004 resolution was furnished to BNPP, exec uted by BNPP’s authorised signatories on BNPP’s behalf on 3 January 2005 (“the Master Agreement”). Ac c ording to BNPP, in ac c ordanc e with the c onvention for ISDA doc umentation, the Master Agreement was dated “as of” an earlier date of 29 April 2004 to ensure that it would extend to the earliest dated derivative transac tion whic h was still outstanding at the date of exec ution of the Master Agreement. 

_The transactions under the Master Agreement_ 

16     Pursuant to the 1 November 2004 resolution and the Master Agreement, Wee entered into various forex transac tions with BNPP. For eac h transac tion, Wee would exec ute a trade c onfirmation. It should be noted that ac c ording to Clause 1(c ) of the Master Agreement, eac h of these transac tions were entered into on the basis that these trade c onfirmations and the Master Agreement formed a single agreement between JSPL and BNPP and that the parties would not otherwise enter into any transac tions. Furthermore, some of these trade c onfirmations expressly inc orporated a provision stating: 

 This Confirmation supplements, forms part of, and is subjec t to the ISDA Master Agreement dated as of 29 April 2004 as amended and supplemented from time to time (the “Agreement”) between [BNPP] and [JSPL]. All provisions c ontained in the Agreement shall govern this Confirmation exc ept as expressively modified herein. 


17     The transac tions entered into by Wee in 2006 and 2007 (“the Alleged Unauthorised Transac tions”) inc luded exotic instruments c alled “extendable snowball deliverable forwards”, “target redemption forward strips” and “target dragon knoc k-out forwards”. In these transac tions there were also various knoc k-out features at various pric es, as well as straddles and strangles. By Oc tober 2007, the losses ac c umulated as a result of transac tions c onfirmed by Wee with BNPP amounted to some US$50 million, out of whic h US$49 million was c aused by a single pair of USD/Euro “snowball” transac tions (“the Key Transac tions”). 

**_Discovery of Alleged Unauthorised Transactions_** 

18     In or around Oc tober 2007, JSPL disc overed that substantial losses had been inc urred purportedly on its ac c ount, as a result of what they c laim were unauthorised transac tions c onfirmed by Wee with BNPP, inc luding the Key Transac tions. The disc overy was made in part due to the fac t that Wee had arranged for a payment of US$83 million to be made to SG, with whom Wee had also engaged heavily in alleged unauthorised forex transac tions. This payment sparked off a c hain of inquiry whic h eventually led to the disc overy of the Alleged Unauthorised Transac tions with BNPP. 

19     Shortly thereafter, JSPL and SCM appointed Drew & Napier LLC (“D&N”) jointly with Ernst & Young (“E&Y”) to investigate the Alleged Unauthorised Transac tions, their nature and the full c irc umstanc es under whic h they c ame to be transac ted and to work with a spec ial c ommittee of the SCM Board. 

20     On 22 Oc tober 2007, SCM announc ed _inter alia_ that Wee had entered into various unauthorised transac tions purportedly for the ac c ount of JSPL and had misled JSPL and SCM in relation to these transac tions. On the same day ( _ie_ , 22 Oc tober 2007), JSPL sent a letter (signed by Tan Kwi Kin) to eac h of its bankers, inc luding BNPP, _inter alia_ putting them on notic e that Wee had been relieved from all his positions in JSPL and that he was not authorised to represent JSPL in any c apac ity whatsoever. JSPL also revoked all instruc tions and standing instruc tions whic h Wee may have given to the banks in relation to forex transac tions whic h had not yet been c onc luded or effec ted. The banks were informed of JSPL’s position that Wee had c onduc ted unauthorised trades and the matter was being investigated. 

21     On 23 Oc tober 2007, JSPL sent a further letter (also signed by Tan Kwi Kin) to eac h of its bankers, inc luding BNPP, inviting them to c lose out the outstanding forex transac tions but without prejudic e to the banks’ and JSPL’s respec tive right to maintain their positions as to whether the forex transac tions were authorised or not. The letter to BNPP stated: 

 We refer to our letter of 22 Oc tober 2007. 

 As you are aware, it is JSPL’s position that the foreign exc hange transac tions purportedly effec ted by Mr Wee Sing Guan on JSPL’s ac c ount were unauthorised and are not binding on us. 

 We understand that you take the position that these transac tions are valid and binding on JSPL. We disagree. 

 It appears to us that it would be in both our interests, pending the resolution by the c ourts of the issue whether the said transac tions are binding on JSPL, to avoid any further deterioration of the positions and to therefore immediately c lose out all the outstanding said foreign exc hange transac tions whic h were effec ted by Mr Wee purportedly on JSPL’s ac c ount. 

 We therefore invite you to agree, without prejudic e to our respec tive positions set out above, to 


 immediately c lose out all the said foreign exc hange transac tions on the basis that the agreement will not under any c irc umstanc es be deemed or said to be an adoption or ratific ation of the said foreign exc hange transac tions by JSPL and will not affec t or in any way derogate from either party’s rights and ability to c ontinue to maintain its present position in Court. 

 The sole purpose of this proposal is to limit the loss to be inc urred by whic hever party is ultimately held to be liable. 

 Please let us urgently know whether you agree. 

22     On the same day ( _ie_ , 23 Oc tober 2007), BNPP replied to JSPL’s letters dated 22 and 23 Oc tober 2007, stating _inter alia_ that its position was that the transac tions were legally valid and binding on JSPL and purporting to agree to c lose out the outstanding forex transac tions, subjec t to BNPP rec eiving evidenc e of Tan Kwi Kin’s authority to give “instruc tions” for a c lose-out. JSPL replied on 25 Oc tober 2007 stating that it had given no suc h “instruc tions” and that its letter of 23 Oc tober 2007 merely c ontained the proposal that the parties agree: 

 [W]ithout prejudic e to their respec tive positions, to immediately c lose out all the said foreign exc hange transac tions on the basis that that agreement will not under any c irc umstanc es be deemed or said to be an adoption or ratific ation of the said foreign exc hange transac tions by JSPL and will not affec t or in any way derogate from any party’s right and ability to c ontinue to maintain its present position in Court. 

23     Also on 25 Oc tober 2007, SCM announc ed, _inter alia_ that, in the interests of good c orporate governanc e and to enable SCM and JSPL to obtain legal advic e with respec t to possible c laims against them, as well as any c laims by JSPL, it had appointed Pric ewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) as independent investigating ac c ountants, to work jointly with D&N to investigate all the unauthorised transac tions, their nature and the full c irc umstanc es under whic h they c ame to be transac ted. 

**_The Close-out Agreement and aftermath_** 

24     BNPP and JSPL then began negotiations for the c lose-out of the outstanding forex transac tions between them, inc luding the terms of the Close-out Agreement. On 30 Oc tober 2007, BNPP’s Tan Eng Cheok outlined the proc edure envisaged by BNPP. He stated that onc e JSPL c onfirmed to him that JSPL wished to c lose out all the outstanding trades at a pric e whic h he would provide based on the exc hange rate at that point in time, he would ask JSPL two questions, both of whic h its representatives had to answer in the affirmative. The two questions were: whether JSPL c onfirmed that it wished to c lose out the outstanding transac tions (whic h were to be listed in the sc hedule to the Close-out Agreement); and whether JSPL c onfirmed that there would be a payment by JSPL to BNPP of the sum arising from the c lose-out on 1 November 2007. 

2       5 JSPL’s representatives refused to agree to answer the sec ond question in the affirmative and thus the attempt to c lose out fell through. BNPP’s lawyers (“R&T”) and D&N then exc hanged e-mail through the wee hours of the morning of 31 Oc tober 2007, in whic h D&N c larified and R&T noted that JSPL would not agree to any request for c onfirmation that there would be payment by a c ertain date after the c lose-out. After more negotiations, at or around 12am on the morning of 1 November 2007, the parties exec uted and exc hanged the following Close-out Agreement: 

 Dear Sirs 

 FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS 


 We refer to the foreign exc hange transac tions listed in the Sc hedule attac hed hereto (“the Transac tions”). The parties hereby c onfirm that the following has been agreed between both parties. 

 Your position is that the Transac tions are authorised and that we are liable for the same under the ISDA Master Agreement made between BNP Paribas and Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd (“JSPL”) dated as of 29 April 2004 (“the Master Agreement”). Our position is that the Transac tions are unauthorised and that we are not liable for the same and that we are not bound by the Master Agreement. We have agreed, without prejudic e to our and your position, to c onsensually c lose out the Transac tions in the following manner: 

1\. Tan Cheng Tat is authorised and will be c alling you to give oral instruc tions for and on behalf of JSPL to terminate all the Transac tions; 

2\. You are authorised to ac c ept all oral instruc tions from Tan Cheng Tat to terminate the Transac tions; and 

3\. It shall be a c ondition of your ac c eptanc e of suc h oral instruc tions to terminate the Transac tions that: 

 (a) your representative and Tan Cheng Tat will, during their telephone c onversation, agree on our respec tive behalves an amount as your net in-the-money value of the Transac tions (the "Agreed Value"); and 

 (b) on and with effec t from your ac c eptanc e of suc h oral instruc tions in suc h telephone c onversations, the Transac tions shall be Terminated Transac tions for the purposes of the Master Agreement (as if an Early Termination Date had oc c urred on the date of suc h telephone c onversation and as a result of a Termination Event) provided that: 

 (i) there shall be no Affec ted Party or Non Affec ted Party; and 

 (ii) in plac e of the amount to be c alc ulated and stated or notified as c ontemplated in Sec tions 6(d) and (e) of the Master Agreement, suc h amount shall, for all the purposes of the Master Agreement be the Agreed Value, effec tive as of the date of suc h telephone c onversation. 

 The instruc tions in this letter do not c onstitute ratific ation or adoption by us of the Transac tions and the c arrying out by you of these instruc tions shall not be regarded or deemed by either party as a waiver, release, c ompromise, abandonment or extinguishment of either party’s rights and/or obligations under the Master Agreement and/or at law. These instruc tions as well as any ac ts or c onduc t pursuant to them will not affec t or derogate from either party’s right and ability to c ontinue to maintain its present position in c ommenc ing or defending proc eedings in c ourt in the event of non-settlement on the value date or otherwise at law or pursuant to the Master Agreement save that the parties agree that in any suc h proc eedings, no issue shall be raised as to the Agreed Value. 

 ... 

26     The Sc hedule attac hed to the Close-out Agreement listed the transac tions whic h were to be the subjec t of c lose-out (“the outstanding forex transac tions”). These c omprised 27 spot/outright/FX ( _ie_ , forex) swap transac tions; 14 vanilla FX option transac tions; and four FX struc tured transac tions. 


One of the four struc tured transac tions was a re-struc ture of one of the Key Transac tions mentioned above: see [17]. 

27     Tan Cheng Tat and Tan Eng Cheok proc eeded to c lose out the transac tions in a telephone c onversation. This was followed by an e-mail from Tan Eng Cheok at 1.57am on 1 November 2007 (“the 1.57am e-mail”), stating: 

 Dear Cheng Tat and Maureen [another of JSPL’s representatives], 

 as instruc ted and agreed, all outstanding transac tions between Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd and BNP Paribas have been terminated in ac c ordanc e with the letter of instruc tions dated 31 Oc tober 2007 [ ie , the Close-out Agreement] by you to us. 

 The “Agreed Value” for the termination is USD 50,723,070. 

 Settlement of the “Agreed Value” will be in ac c ordanc e with the letter of instruc tions dated 31 Oc tober 2007 [ie , the Close-out Agreement] by you to us. 

28     Another e-mail from Tan Eng Cheok followed at 2.41pm on the same day ( _ie_ , 1 November 2007), stating: 

 Dear Cheng Tat, Maureen, 

 following the termination of the transac tions below (email [the 1.57 am e-mail] below) please note the following settlement details of BNP Paribas Singapore’s USD agent ac c ount: 

 Agreed Value : USD 50,723, Value Date : 05 November 2007 To : BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK [Bank ac c ount details] 

 Our offic ial c onfo [ sic ] will follow. 

29     Finally, the offic ial c onfirmation was sent on the same day ( _ie_ , 1 November 2007) (“the 1 November 2007 c onfirmation letter”), stating: 

 Dear Sirs 

 TERMINATION OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN JURONG SHIPYARD PTE LTD AND BNP PARIBAS 

1\. We refer to your instruc tion letter dated 31 Oc t 2007. 

2\. Given that the telephone c onversation between our representative, Mr Kenneth Tan and your representative, Mr Tan Cheng Tat, took plac e on 1 November 2007, _the payment date, as determined in accordance with Section 6(d)(ii) of the Master Agreement, for payment of the Agreed Value of USD50,723,070 is 5 November 2007._ 

3\. For the purposes of settlement, details of the relevant ac c ount of BNP Paribas are as follows: .... 

 [emphasis added] 


30     On 6 November 2007, JSPL responded to the 1 November 2007 c onfirmation letter and stated: 

1\. We refer to your letter of 1 Nov 2007. 

2\. As we have indic ated to you in our previous c orrespondenc e, JSPL's position is that it is not responsible nor liable for the unauthorised foreign exc hange transac tions effec ted by [WSG] purportedly on JSPL's ac c ount ("the Transac tions"). We are therefore not liable to you for the sum of US$50,723,070. 

3\. In any event, there is no basis for you to ask that payment of the sum of US$50,723,070 be made to you before the Court has determined the issue. As our letter of 31 Oc t 2007 makes c lear, we have mutually agreed, without prejudic e to our respec tive positions, to c lose out the     Transac tions so as to c rystallise and fix the quantum of the loss and expense falling to the party whic h is ultimately held to be responsible or liable for the same. 

4\. All our rights are fully reserved. 

31     On 7 November 2007, BNPP issued a statutory demand pursuant to s 254(2)(a) of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) to JSPL, for the alleged debt to be paid within 21 days from the date of the statutory demand. This statutory demand was retrac ted on the same day in view of ongoing disc ussions between the parties but without prejudic e to BNPP’s right to issue a fresh statutory demand. 

32     On 19 November 2007, SCM announc ed that it had subsc ribed for 300 million redeemable preferenc e shares amounting to $300m in the c apital of JSPL and that part of the funds from the rec apitalisation would be used by JSPL to make an unc onditional payment to SG of US$115,450,000. This led to a response from R&T on the same day stating: 

 ... 

2\. Your c lients [ _ie_ , JSPL] were obliged to pay our c lients [ _ie_ , BNPP], the agreed net value arising from the c lose out, two loc al business days after the c lose out, in ac c ordanc e with the     ISDA Master Agreement entered into between our respec tive c lients and dated as of 29 April 2004. 

3\. We have understood your c lients’ position to be that all the transac tions entered into with all bank c ounterparties are “unauthorised” and henc e do not engage your c lients’ liability. We have further understood this to be a position c ommon to all bank c ounterparties. 

 ... 

4\. ... [O]ur c lients had, at all material times, and c ontinue now, to have a legitimate expec tation that they will be treated no less favorably than any other bank c ounterparty. 

 ... 

6\. In this regard, we note from the 19 November 2007 announc ement that payment will be made to one of the bank c ounterparties today. Our c lients welc ome this on the basis of the expec tation stated above. 

 ... 


8\. If, c ontrary to the impression c onveyed by the said statements and announc ements, it now emerges that the direc tors of SCM either did not or c ould not have believed that the positions of the bank c ounterparties were c ommon at the time of the 1 Nov 2007 statements, it would follow that the said statements and announc ements made on or about 1 Nov 2007 were, at the very least, false and misleading in material respec ts. 

9\. Our c lients would be surprised if this was found to be the c ase. 

10\. In the meantime, our c lients c ontinue to reserve all their rights. 

33     On 20 November 2007, in an effort to assure BNPP that it would be able to make payment if it was ultimately proved in c ourt that it was liable to pay BNPP the alleged debt, JSPL offered to put an equivalent sum in esc row, making it a c ondition of the offer of esc row that BNPP would have to c ommenc e legal proc eedings against JSPL to rec over the alleged debt. JSPL gave BNPP up to 23 November 2007 to c onsider the offer of esc row. BNPP rejec ted the offer on the same day. On 20 November 2007, BNPP served a fresh statutory demand on JSPL for the alleged debt, whic h _inter alia_ stated: 

 We are instruc ted by our c lients that, pursuant to the c lose out of all outstanding foreign exc hange transac tions between you and our c lients, c arried out in ac c ordanc e with your instruc tion letter [ ie , the Close-out Agreement] dated 31 Oc tober 2007 to our c lients, the sum of USD50,723,070 is due and owing by you to our c lients. 

On 23 November 2007, JSPL filed the present originating summons. 

**The applicable law** 

34     The law regarding the grant of an injunc tion to restrain a winding-up applic ation is not in dispute. It is well-established that it is an abuse of proc ess for a c reditor to try to use the winding-up proc ess to rec over a disputed debt and that suc h an attempt will usually be restrained by the c ourts. In _Woon’s Corporations Law_ **(** Walter Woon, LexisNexis 2006), the relevant princ iples are suc c inc tly laid out at [754], [755]-[800] and [854]: 

 [754] 

 S254(2)(a) disputed debts A c ompany has not ‘neglec ted to pay’ the debt if the debt is disputed on substantial rounds: Sec uric or (M) Sdn Bhd v Universal Cars Sdn Bhd [1985] 1 MLJ 84 (High Court, Malaysia). Where a c reditor bec omes aware that a debt is bona fide disputed, he should file an ac tion, obtain judgment and then make a winding-up applic ation....A winding-up applic ation is not an appropriate means of c ollec ting a disputed debt. It must not be used to bring improper pressure to bear on a c ompany. The proper c ourse is to have the matter adjudic ated upon in an ac tion for a debt. 

 [755]-[800] 

 Abuse of process by filing application to enforce debt A winding-up applic ation instituted for the purpose of enforc ing a disputed debt is an abuse of proc ess of the Court and will be dismissed with c osts: Re Ban Hong Co Ltd [1959] MLJ 100; Re Mec hanised Construc tion Pte Ltd [1989] 3 MLJ 9, 12. See also Apirami Sdn Bhd v Tamil Nesan (M) Sdn Bhd [1986] 1 CLJ 493 where the petition was dismissed with c osts as it was not a bona fide attempt to obtain the relief sought but was for the c ollateral purpose of embarrassing the defendant.” 


## [854] 

 Injunctions to restrain the making of an application, etc A winding up applic ation may damage a solvent c ompany’s reputation and the Court may order an injunc tion, stay or dismiss the proc eedings if it is not satisfied as to the bona fides of the applic ation: Ng Ah Kway v Tai Kit Enterprise Sdn Bhd [1986] 1 MLJ 58. A respondent c ompany may apply for an injunc tion even before the winding-up applic ation is made, if it rec eives a statutory demand for payment that it disputes: Instrumec h Engineering Sdn Bhd v Sensorlink Sdn Bhd [2001] 1 MLJ 127 (High Court, Malaysia); Dynaworth Shipping Sdn Bhd v Ling Chung Ann [2001] 3 MLJ 399 (High Court, Malaysia); Malayan Resourc es Corp Bhd v Juranas Sdn Bhd [2002] 3 MLJ 169 (High Court, Malaysia) 

35     Both parties ac c epted the authority of _Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and Anor Appeal_ <span class="citation">[2008] SGCA 1</span> (“ _Pacific Recreation_ ”) (though it should be noted that in that c ase the applic ation for winding up had already been made; still, the princ iples apply). In that c ase, the Court of Appeal agreed with the following statement of princ iple by the appellants (at [16]): 

 The appellants argued that the learned judge had wrongly applied the disc retionary princ iples relevant to the granting of a winding-up order. Case law, they argued, had clearly established that a winding-up petition was not an appropriate means of enforcing a disputed debt, and that it would be an abuse of the process of the Court to allow a creditor to wind up a company on the basis of a disputed debt. It was also submitted that a winding-up Court was generally not in the best position to adjudic ate on the merits of a c ommerc ial dispute without a proper ventilation of the evidential disputes through a trial. The appellants further stressed that a winding-up order was often the “death knell” for a c ompany and was a “drac onian order” to make. Thus, a Court should proc eed c autiously in dec iding whether to grant a winding-up applic ation.” 

 [emphasis added] 

36     The threshold test for determining the existenc e of a substantial and _bona fide_ dispute is that of a _prima facie_ c ase. In other words, the applic able standard is no more than that for resisting a summary judgment applic ation, _ie_ , the alleged debtor-c ompany need only raise triable issues. In _Pacific Recreation_ , the Court of Appeal c onfirmed (at [23]) that: 

 With regard to the applic able standard for determining the existenc e of a substantial and bona fide dispute, it was our view that the applic able standard was no more than that for resisting a summary judgment applic ation, ie , the debtor-c ompany need only raise triable issues in order to obtain a stay or dismissal of the winding-up applic ation. 

37     Several other princ iples should be borne in mind. First, a c ompany c annot merely assert that there is a substantial and _bona fide_ dispute but rather must adduc e evidenc e in support of it. As the Court of Appeal stated in _Pacific Recreation_ at [17]: 

 [A] c ompany [c annot] stave off a winding-up applic ation merely by alleging that there is a substantial and bona fide dispute over the debt c laimed by the applic ant-c reditor. It is up to the c ourt to evaluate whatever evidenc e the c ompany has raised and c ome to a c onc lusion on whether the alleged dispute exists. 

Similarly, at [19]: 

 We also found the following passage from Andrew R Keay, McPherson’s Law of Company 


 Liquidation (Sweet & Maxwell, 2001) at para 3.67, p 122 helpful: 

 Whether or not there is a dispute on substantial grounds is a matter to be dec ided in eac h c ase. The dispute envisaged is one where there is a dispute whic h involves to a substantial extent disputed questions of fac t whic h demand viva voce evidenc e. Of c ourse, there must be evidenc e adduc ed whic h supports the c ontention of the c ompany that there is a substantial dispute. The c ourts will be alive to the situation where a c ompany seeks to raise a c loud of objec tions to a petition in order to c laim that a debt is disputed if the objec tions are not able to be determined on affidavit evidenc e and without c ross-examination. 

38     Sec ondly, there is no obvious dividing line demarc ating when a c ourt has moved from merely asking itself whether a substantial and _bona fide_ dispute exists to ac tually dec iding the dispute itself: _Pacific Recreation_ at [20]. There the Court of Appeal at [20] referred approvingly to the following passage in _Brinds Ltd v Offshore Oil NL (No 3)_ (1985) 10 ACLR 419 (“ _Brinds_ ”) at 424: 

 It seems to me that in every c ase it bec omes nec essary for the c ourt to exerc ise its disc retion as to how far it will allow the question whether or not the dispute is bona fide to be explored. In some c ases it may be very easy to dec ide this question on the petition and affidavits in reply. In other c ases however it may be diffic ult to determine whether or not the dispute is bona fide without determining the merits of the dispute itself. In some suc h c ases c onvenienc e may require that the c ourt dec ide the question whether or not a debt exists, but in other suc h c ases it may appear better to allow that question to be determined in other proc eedings before the petition for winding up is heard. 

3       9 _Pacific Recreation_ is a useful example of how these princ iples apply in prac tic e. In that c ase, the respondent applied to wind up the appellant c ompanies for failure to c omply with statutory demands. The debt in the statutory demands arose out of financ ing arrangements whic h were based on various agreements entered into amongst the parties and the appellant’s managing direc tor. One of the material doc uments was a deed of indemnity whic h did not c ontain a c lause on the governing law. After the statutory demands had been issued, arbitration proc eedings were initiated by the appellant’s managing direc tor. The appellant argued that the outc ome of the arbitration would have an impac t on its liability under the deed of indemnity and that it was therefore premature and inappropriate for the respondent to pursue its purported c laim under the deed until after the arbitration had been resolved. The High Court did not agree with the appellants that there was a substantial and _bona fide_ dispute as to whether it was liable to pay the respondent the amount demanded and ordered the immediate winding up of the appellant. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. The appellant had failed even to satisfy the low threshold test of a _prima facie_ c ase that a dispute existed. This was bec ause the only substantial question was whether the governing law of the deed of indemnity was Chinese law or Singapore law. This was simply a matter of c onstruing the relevant doc uments whic h were before the learned judge. The c ourt held that as further evidenc e, apart from the doc uments themselves, would not have assisted the c ourt, it was in all the c irc umstanc es appropriate that the judge, having heard arguments from both sides on the applic able governing law, then proc eeded to dec ide the issue. 

40     I now turn to the parties’ submissions. 

**The parties’ submissions** 

**_In respect of the Master Agreement_** 

41     JSPL argued that there are triable issues in respec t of its obligation to pay the alleged debt under the Master Agreement. In partic ular, it highlighted various doc uments ( _viz_ , SCM annual reports, 


JSPL’s financ ial statements and the fac ility letters referred to in [11] above) evinc ing JSPL’s and SCM’s polic y of limiting forex transac tions to hedging and argued that further inquiry was needed into the c irc umstanc es under whic h, in spite of BNPP’s awareness of this polic y, the final form of the 1 November 2004 resolution authorising JSPL to enter into the Master Agreement and c arry out forex transac tions “for the purpose of hedging or on spec ulative basis” was dec ided upon. 

42     JSPL further submitted that, even if the 1 November 2004 resolution is proper and binding on its fac e, it does not c over the Key Transac tions as “spec ulative” transac tions do not enc ompass exotic instruments. Thus, even at this stage, a triable issue arises as to whether the Key Transac tions are c overed by the terms of the 1 November 2004 resolution. More importantly, the Key Transac tions are not binding on JSPL bec ause BNPP knew or ought to have known that Wee did not have authority to enter into those spec ific transac tions. JSPL painted two sc enarios: at best, there were c irc umstanc es that put BNPP on ac tual or c onstruc tive notic e that Wee did not have authority for suc h transac tions; at worst, BNPP’s offic ers were c olluding with Wee to c arry out transac tions beyond the sc ope of his authority. 

43     As evidenc e of these dual sc enarios, JSPL relied firstly on the fac t of the exotic or even “toxic ” nature of the Alleged Unauthorised Transac tions. As evidenc e of their “toxic ity”, JSPL pointed to the fac t that almost the entirety of the alleged debt was inc urred as a result of the Key Transac tions. JSPL also relied on Heinz Riehl’s evidenc e that the Alleged Unauthorised Transac tions basic ally allowed Wee to temporarily c over up losses on unauthorised spec ulative trades by the sale of a deep in-themoney option to BNPP for a large up-front option premium in c ash. If market c onditions did not c hange, the sale of the deep in-the-money option would at maturity c ause an additional loss to JSPL, on top of the losses from the spec ulative “long” position maintained. JSPL argued that BNPP must either have enc ouraged Wee to enter into these exotic transac tions in order to c apitalise on the fac t that he was effec tively a “c aptive c ustomer” so as to earn higher profit margins, or that the nature of these exotic transac tions should have put BNPP on notic e of Wee’s lac k of authority to enter into them. 

44     Sec ondly, JSPL relied on what they deposed was Wee’s unsigned statement (see details below in [62] _et seq_ ), in whic h he asserted that the Alleged Unauthorised Transac tions (see [17] above) were offered by BNPP’s offic ers (inc luding Hardy Saat and Tan Eng Cheok) when he indic ated, as far bac k as 2006, that he did not want to pay c ash on the c lose-out of a loss-making forex transac tion but desired to defer the loss instead. The statement details various meetings between himself and BNPP’s offic ers, inc luding one on 12 September 2007 in whic h Tan Eng Cheok persuaded him to switc h from an existing JP Y/USD struc ture into the pair of “snowball” transac tions whic h ultimately ac c ounted for the loss leading to the alleged debt (see [17] above). 

45     JSPL also relied on the existenc e of a suspense ac c ount (“the suspense ac c ount”) of whic h JSPL apparently only bec ame aware on 29 Oc tober 2007 when BNPP e-mailed a marked-to-market (“MTM”) statement (as at 26 Oc tober 2007) to JSPL whic h inc luded the following statement: 

 NOTE: We note that there is a balanc e of SGD513,469.61 c urrently standing to the c redit of the suspense ac c ount held in your name “Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd.” 

JSPL submitted that there was no direc tors’ resolution in respec t of the opening of the suspense ac c ount and BNPP did not disc lose its existenc e to JSPL’s external auditors. It argued that through the suspense ac c ount, BNPP provided Wee with a plac e to park the funds from his unauthorised trading ac tivities without being detec ted. 

46     JSPL further argued that there is evidenc e from various doc uments to show that BNPP worked 


with Wee to tailor the information and doc uments to be provided to the external auditors by sending information to Wee for his review before sending the information to the external auditors. Those doc uments show that Wee was giving instruc tions to BNPP as to the type of information to be given to the external auditors. In this regard, he instruc ted BNPP not to provide MTM information to the external auditors for the purposes of the 2006 audit c onfirmation proc ess but to give only notional values instead. These notional amounts showed only the fac e value of the transac tions but were meaningless as they did not show how muc h profit or loss had been made or inc urred at that partic ular point of time. (In c ontrast, a MTM valuation of a portfolio gives an indic ation of the fair value pric e of that portfolio if all the outstanding transac tions were c losed out at the market spot/forward/option pric ing rates at that point in time.) 

47     JSPL also highlighted the bac kdating of the Master Agreement and argued that BNPP’s own evidenc e (see [15] above) showed that this was done to c over up spec ulative trades that Wee had entered into with BNPP prior to the 1 November 2004 resolution. JSPL referred me to an e-mail dated 31 August 2004 in whic h Saniza Othman wrote to Hardy Saat: 

 Re: PROPOSED ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT BETWEEN BNP PARIBAS AND JURONG SHIP YARD PTE LTD 

 ... 

 Please be reminded that this has been plac ed this [ sic ] as a prioirty [ sic ] one file upon business’ [ sic ] request so I would be grateful for your assistanc e in finalising ISDA negotiations asap. 

JSPL argued that this showed that BNPP was in a rush to finalise the Master Agreement bec ause there were ongoing unauthorised spec ulative trades. I was also referred to an e-mail dated 12 Oc tober 2004 from Saniza Othman to Hardy Saat and Lisa Chang whic h stated: “Lisa. Please advise what the earliest trade date is for this name [ _ie_ , JSPL].” JSPL argued that the reason BNPP wanted this information was bec ause it wanted to bac kdate the Master Agreement to c over that date. 

48     JSPL submitted that the Key Transac tions were of suc h an exotic nature (see [43] above) that BNPP c ould not reasonably have believed that they were either in the c ommerc ial interests of the c ompany or that the c ompany c ould have understood those transac tions. BNPP had a duty to raise this with JSPL’s senior management. JSPL argued that the fac t that BNPP failed to do so raised a triable issue in respec t of whether the Key Transac tions were binding upon JSPL. 

49     BNPP submitted that the argument that Wee did not have authority to enter into the Key Transac tions c annot stand. BNPP argued that the present c ase is one where the ac tual and apparent authority of Wee to transac t on behalf of BNPP c oinc ided. The 1 November 2004 resolution embodied the ac tual authority c onferred on Wee (among others) in relation to his c apac ity to transac t with BNPP on behalf of JSPL. This was the same doc ument given by JSPL to BNPP whic h c ontained the representation JSPL gave to BNPP as to Wee’s authority. At all material times, this was the only doc ument or instrument that embodied Wee’s authority to transac t on JSPL’s behalf with BNPP. BNPP submitted that the terms of the 1 November 2004 resolution are indubitably c lear. Wee was authorised to enter on behalf of JSPL into any forex transac tions pursuant to the Master Agreement and this expressly inc luded transac tions entered into both “for the purpose of hedging and on a spec ulative basis”. Eac h of the c onfirmations for the forex transac tions entered into by Wee form a single agreement with the Master Agreement: see [16] above. R&T submitted that JSPL is ac c ordingly bound by eac h of these transac tions. 


50     BNPP also rejec ted JSPL’s submission that, even if ac c epted on its fac e, the terms of the 1 November 2004 resolution c annot be relied upon where the transac tions are alleged to be highly toxic or exotic. BNPP c ontended that JSPL is c ontrac tually estopped by the representations in the Master Agreement from arguing _inter alia_ that: 

 (a) The terms of the 1 November 2004 resolution were untrue, inc omplete or inac c urate or otherwise varied or qualified in any way by any other doc ument; 

 (b) BNPP had any duty to inquire into the purposes for whic h JSPL was entering into the Alleged Unauthorised Transac tions and whether they were appropriate or proper for JSPL; and 

 (c ) The Master Agreement or any of the Alleged Unauthorised Transac tions were entered into without proper authority or that JSPL had not taken all nec essary ac tion to authorise the exec ution or performanc e of the Master Agreement and the transac tions taking plac e thereunder. 

51     BNPP’s main arguments were: first, s 4(a)(ii) of the Master Agreement read with Part 3(b) of the sc hedule prec lude JSPL from denying the truth, c ompleteness or ac c urac y of the 1 November 2004 resolution. Sec tion 4(a)(ii) of the Master Agreement provides that: 

 Eac h party agrees with the other that, so long as either party has or may have any obligation under this Agreement or under any Credit Support Doc ument to whic h it is a party...[i]t will deliver to the other party...any other doc uments spec ified in the Sc hedule or any Confirmation. 

Turning to Part 3(b) of the Sc hedule, it spec ifies as one of the doc uments to be delivered by “Party B” ( _ie_ , JSPL) a “Board resolution of Party B authorising the exec ution of this Agreement and approving the entering into of the Transac tions hereunder in a form ac c eptable to Party A [ _ie_ , BNPP]”. It is expressly stated in Part 3 of the Sc hedule that the said board resolution would be “c overed by Sec tion 3(d) Representation”; and under sec tion 3(d), JSPL is taken to have represented to BNPP on eac h date on whic h eac h of the transac tions under the Master Agreement is entered into, that the information in the 1 November 2004 resolution is “true, ac c urate and c omplete in every material respec t”. 

52     Sec ondly, BNPP referred me to the representations in Part 5(e) of the sc hedule to the Master Agreement. The relevant parts read: 

 (e) Representations. Eac h party will be deemed to represent to the other party on the date on whic h it enters into a Transac tion that (absent a written agreement between the parties that expressly imposes affirmative obligations to the c ontrary for that Transac tion): 

 ( i ) Non-Reliance. It is ac ting for its own ac c ount and it has made its own independent decisions to enter into that Transaction and as to whether that Transaction is appropriate or proper for it is [ sic ] based upon its own judgment and upon advic e from suc h advisers as it has deemed nec essary. It is not relying on any c ommunic ation (written or oral) of the other party as investment advic e or as a rec ommendation to enter into that Transac tion; it being understood that information and explanations related to the terms and c onditions of a Transac tion shall not be c onsidered investment advic e or a rec ommendation to enter into that Transac tion. It has not rec eived from the other party any assuranc e or guarantee as to the expec ted results of the Transac tion. 

 (ii) Evaluations and Understanding. It is capable of evaluating and understanding (on its own behalf or through independent professional advice), and understands and accepts the terms, 


 conditions and risks of that Transaction. It is also capable of assuming, and assumes, the financial and other risks of that Transaction. 

 (iii) Status of Parties. The other party is not ac ting as a fiduc iary or an adviser for it in respec t of that Transac tion. 

 ( i v ) Acting as Principal. It is ac ting as princ ipal and not as agent or in any other c apac ity, fiduc iary or otherwise. 

 [emphases added] 

BNPP submitted that any assertion by JSPL as to the unsuitability of the Alleged Unauthorised Transac tions should be examined in the light of these representations. On a plain reading of these provisions, JSPL represented and agreed on eac h of the dates that it entered into the Alleged Unauthorised Transac tions that: 

 (a) BNPP owed it no duties, whether as a fiduc iary or as an advisor to it, as JSPL expressly represented that BNPP was not ac ting as a fiduc iary or an advisor; 

 (b) JSPL was c apable of evaluating and understanding the terms, c onditions and risks of eac h transac tion; 

 (c ) JSPL c annot and would not assert that it did not understand and ac c ept (or was not c apable of understanding) the terms, c onditions and other risks of eac h transac tion; 

 (d) JSPL was c apable of assuming and did in fac t assume the financ ial and other risks of eac h transac tion; 

 (e) JSPL made its own dec ision to enter into eac h transac tion; 

 (f) JSPL made its own dec ision as to the appropriateness or propriety of eac h transac tion; and 

 (g) JSPL did not rely on any c ommunic ation of any sort from BNPP. 

53     BNPP also relied on s 3(a)(ii) of the Master Agreement: 

**3. Representations** 

 Eac h party represents to the other party (whic h representations shall be deemed to be repeated by eac h party on eac h date on whic h a Transac tion is entered into...) that: 

 (a) Basic Representations. 

 ... 

 (ii) Powers. It has the power to execute this Agreement and any other documentation relating to this Agreement to which it is a party , to deliver this Agreement and any other doc umentation relating to this Agreement that it is required by this Agreement to deliver and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and any obligations it has under any Credit Support Doc ument to whic h it is a party and has taken all necessary action to authorise such execution, delivery and performance. 


 [emphases added] 

BNPP submitted that this representation applies in and of itself as an assuranc e of due authorisation in relation to eac h forex transac tion that was entered into by Wee on behalf of JSPL under the Master Agreement. Further, by virtue of the explic it representation by JSPL that it has taken all nec essary ac tion to authorise suc h exec ution and performanc e, this is a representation that the 1 November 2004 resolution whic h had been provided to BNPP was suffic ient in every respec t to authorise JSPL’s entry into the Master Agreement and into eac h transac tion under the Master Agreement. BNPP c onc luded that JSPL is prec luded from c ontending that it had not authorised the Key Transac tions, whether on the ground that they were not for hedging purposes, or on any other grounds. 

54     BNPP’s response to D&N’s theory that BNPP had c olluded with Wee to c over up losses from unauthorised spec ulative trades was _inter alia_ that there was nothing sinister about the bac kdating of the Master Agreement whic h had been done merely to c onfirm with ISDA c onvention and that, in any c ase, on JSPL’s own evidenc e, the earliest c onfirmed instanc e of spec ulative trading only took plac e in 2006. BNPP had disc losed the Alleged Unauthorised Transac tions to E&Y when E&Y approac hed BNPP to provide information for JSPL’s 2006 year-end audit c onfirmation (“the 2006 audit c onfirmation”). BNPP pointed out that it was nowhere suggested that E&Y did not understand the information given by BNPP in the 2006 audit c onfirmation and that E&Y itself had c ome bac k to say that it was satisfied with the information and found it in order. The data provided by BNPP made it c lear that JSPL had outstanding c ontrac ts with BNPP whic h c omprised (a) spot exc hange c ontrac ts; (b) forward exc hange c ontrac ts; and (c ) options c ontrac ts. The options c ontrac ts c omprised (a) options under a pivot target redemption forward transac tion and (b) options under a target redemption forward transac tion. R&T c larified that the suspense ac c ount (see [45] above) was an internal general ledger ac c ount of BNPP’s in whic h debit and c redit entries arising from forex transac tions with JSPL were booked as JSPL itself did not have a bank ac c ount with BNPP at the material time. It argued that there was no evidenc e whatsoever that the internal general ledger ac c ount c ould be or was used to assist Wee to c onc eal his gains or losses, as these moneys were in fac t paid out to JSPL’s bank ac c ounts or on its instruc tions on four separate oc c asions. 

**_In respect of the Close-out Agreement_** 

55     BNPP’s alternative c ase was that an independent obligation to pay the alleged debt arises from the Close-out Agreement. This is based on the paragraph numbered 3(b) in the Close-out Agreement, whic h provides that BNPP’s agreement to ac c ept JSPL’s instruc tions to terminate the outstanding forex transac tions was c onditional upon these transac tions being “Terminated Transac tions for the purposes of the Master Agreement (as if an Early Termination Date had oc c urred on the date of suc h telephone c onversation and as a result of a Termination Event)”. 

56     The effec t of the oc c urrenc e of an Early Termination Date is provided for by s 6(c )(ii) of the Master Agreement: 

 Upon the oc c urrenc e or effec tive designation of an Early Termination Date, no further payments or deliveries [required by the trade c onfirmations or any default interest payable] in respec t of the Terminated Transac tions will be required to be made, but without prejudic e to the other provisions of this Agreement. The amount, if any, payable in respec t of an Early Termination Date shall be determined pursuant to Sec tion 6(e). 

By the paragraph numbered 3(b)(ii) in the Close-out Agreement, the amount c alc ulated as being payable under s 6(e) of the Master Agreement was the Agreed Value, _viz_ , the alleged debt (see the 


1\.57 am e-mail in [27] above). 

57     Sec tion 6(d)(ii) further provides that: 

 An amount c alc ulated as being due in respec t of any Early Termination Date under Sec tion 6(e) will be payable ... two Loc al Business Days after the day on whic h notic e of the amount payable is effec tive (in the c ase of an Early Termination Date whic h is designated as a result of a Termination Event). 

Notic e of the amount payable was in fac t given in 1 November 2007 c onfirmation letter and two loc al business days after that was 5 November 2007. 

58     BNPP emphasised that the outstanding forex transac tions were Terminated Transac tions “on and with effec t from [BNPP’s] ac c eptanc e of [JSPL’s] oral instruc tions” in the telephone c onversation of 31 Oc tober 2007, _ie_ , triggering an independent obligation of JSPL to pay the alleged debt on 5 November 2007 (“the independent obligation to pay under the Close-out Agreement”), without the need for BNPP to first establish JSPL’s liability under the Master Agreement. This ec hoed the position that BNPP had asserted in its 1 November 2007 c onfirmation letter (see [29] above). It further submitted that, if there was no independent obligation to pay under the Close-out Agreement, the words “[i]t shall be a c ondition of [BNPP’s] ac c eptanc e of [JSPL’s] oral instruc tions to terminate...” would be superfluous. 

59     BNPP submitted that the “reservation provisions” ( _viz_ , the sec ond unnumbered paragraph from the top [“the first reservation provision”] and the penultimate paragraph [“the sec ond reservation provision”] of the Close-out Agreement) do not derogate from the independent obligation to pay under the Close-out Agreement. The first reservation provision merely reiterates the parties’ respec tive positions on JSPL’s liability for the alleged debt under the Master Agreement. In fac t, the sec ond reservation c onfirms the existenc e of the independent obligation to pay under the Close-out Agreement, bec ause it c ontemplates litigation in three sc enarios: “in the event of non-settlement on the value date”, “otherwise at law” and “pursuant to the Master Agreement”. BNPP argued that lit igat ion _“_ pursuant to the Master Agreement _”_ must refer to litigation brought by BNPP sinc e the position reserved by JSPL under the Close-out Agreement was that it is not bound by the Master Agreement and henc e JSPL c ould not have c ontemplated bringing proc eedings pursuant to the Master Agreement. Litigation “otherwise at law”, on the other hand, c learly inc luded proc eedings c ommenc ed by JSPL and this in turn would have inc luded proc eedings suc h as the present as well as proc eedings c ommenc ed by JSPL to rec over any money paid over to BNPP. Therefore, if JSPL is c orrec t that BNPP c ould only seek payment of the alleged debt pursuant to the Master Agreement, that would mean that the first sc enario “in the event of non settlement on the value date” would have to be regarded as wholly superfluous as the only sc enario in whic h BNPP c ould c ommenc e litigation is in “proc eedings in c ourt ... pursuant to the Master Agreement”_._ BNPP urged me to rejec t a c onstruc tion of the Closeout Agreement that would render any of its words meaningless or superfluous. 

60     JSPL’s primary position was that BNPP did not disc harge its burden of showing that the express terms of the Close-out Agreement c reated an independent obligation to pay under the Close-out Agreement. Its view was that the reservation provisions made c lear that both parties were preserving their respec tive positions with regard to liability, suc h that the issue of liability was very muc h alive. The purpose of the c lose-out was merely for quantum to be fixed so that proc eedings at a later stage under the Master Agreement would only be on liability. JSPL’s interpretation of the words “in the event of non-settlement on the value date” was perhaps unsurprisingly diametric ally opposed to BNPP’s – it submitted that this phrase c learly c ontemplated that JSPL had an _option_ of paying the alleged debt on the value date ( _ie_ , 5 November 2007) , but not an _obligation_. Should JSPL fail to do 


so, BNPP c ould c ommenc e proc eedings but its c laim would still be under the Master Agreement, in relation to whic h various triable issues had been raised by JSPL. 

61     JSPL further submitted that, even if the Close-out Agreement is interpreted as c reating an independent obligation to pay the alleged debt, it also expressly ac knowledges JSPL’s right to make a c laim against BNPP to rec over the alleged debt in subsequent proc eedings. In other words, JSPL and BNPP had agreed that JSPL has a c ross-c laim for the monies. JSPL argued that, if that is c orrec t, BNPP’s c laim under the Close-out Agreement is fundamentally flawed bec ause where a party has a genuine c ross-c laim against the potential petitioner based on substantial grounds, an injunc tion will be granted to restrain winding-up proc eedings. 

**The unsigned statement of Wee** 

**_Background facts_** 

62     Before proc eeding to my dec ision proper, I shall first deal with the issue of the admissibility of Wee’s unsigned statement (“the unsigned statement”), whic h as mentioned above was relied on by JSPL to show that BNPP had c olluded with Wee to c arry out the Alleged Unauthorised Transac tions. 

63     The fac ts regarding the provenanc e of Wee’s unsigned statement are as follows: Wee first met with Tan Kwi Kin, Chong Shee Sai (JSPL’s c ompany sec retary) and Wong Peng Kin (Direc tor, Group Human Resourc es of JSPL) on 23 November 2007 to disc uss a draft of the unsigned statement. After these disc ussions, Wee requested that some c hanges be made whic h were handwritten onto the draft by Wong Peng Kin and later inc orporated into the draft. Following a letter from Wee’s lawyers, M/s Lee & Lee, alleging that the draft of the unsigned statement as it then stood did not ac c urately reflec t Wee’s views and rec ollec tions in several material respec ts, Wee met with the same JSPL offic ers again on 2 January 2008. At this meeting, Wee made some handwritten amendments to the draft and c onfirmed that apart from these c hanges, he ac c epted the draft as true and ac c urate. I noted that these handwritten amendments had not been inc orporated into the unsigned statement whic h was sought to be admitted as evidenc e. M/s Lee & Lee sent a further letter to D&N on 21 January 2008 in whic h it registered its objec tions to JSPL’s initiation of the two meetings with its c lient Wee without its knowledge and asserted Wee’s position that his ac ts and forex transac tions were at all material times authorised and mandated by JSPL. 

**_The parties’ submissions_** 

64     BNPP submitted that the unsigned statement c onstitutes hearsay, whic h under O 41 r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322 R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) is inadmissible in affidavit evidenc e exc ept in the c ase of an affidavit sworn for the purpose of being used in “interloc utory proc eedings”: see O 41 r 5(2), set out below at [67]. 

65     BNPP argued that the present originating summons is not interloc utory in form as an originating summons should be distinguished from an ordinary summons; the former being a summons for c ommenc ement of proc eedings ( _ie_ , an originating proc ess) and the latter being a summons for a pending c ourse or matter. BNPP further submitted that it is settled law that proc eedings whic h seek an injunc tion to restrain a party from winding up a c ompany are not “interloc utory” in nature as they dec ide with finality the right of the c reditor to present the winding-up proc ess and do not merely seek to preserve the _status quo_ between parties. BNPP relied on _Bryanston Finance Ltd v De Vries (No 2)_ [1975] 2 WLR 41 (“ _Bryanston Finance [No 2]_ ”), whic h it c laimed was c ited with approval in _Tang Choon Keng Realty (Pte) Ltd v Tang Wee Cheng_ <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR 1114</span> (“ _Tang Choon Keng Realty_ ”). 


66     JSPL argued that the c ourt should not foc us on the form of the applic ation as an originating summons. I was referred to _Metalform Asia Pte Ltd v Holland Leedon Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2007] 2 SLR 268</span>, in whic h it was said that it is well-established that where a c ompany disputes a debt c laimed by a c reditor, 

 the c ourt will restrain a c reditor from filing a petition to wind up the c ompany, or if the petition has been filed, to [ sic ] stay or dismiss it on the ground that the locus standi of the petitioner as a c reditor is in question, and it is an abuse of proc ess of the c ourt for the petitioner to try to enforc e a disputed debt in this way. 

If JSPL had applied for a stay of winding up or summary judgment, the unsigned statement would be admissible bec ause those are interloc utory proc eedings. JSPL argued that the unsigned statement should not bec ome inadmissible simply bec ause it had instead filed the present originating summons, when the relief is in effec t the same and the test for whether the relief should be granted ( _ie_ , whether there is a disputed debt) is identic al. It submitted, relying on _Savings & Investment Bank v Gasco Investments (No 2)_ [1988] 2 WLR 1212 (“ _Savings Bank [No 2]_ ”), that the key test for an interloc utory proc eeding is whether the c ourt is being asked to keep matters in the _status quo_ until the final rights of the parties are dec ided. 

**_My decision_** 

67     The relevant provision in Singapore governing the admissibility of hearsay evidenc e by affidavit is O 41 r 5 of the Rules of Court, whic h states: 

 Contents of affidavit (O 41, r 5) 

 (1) Subjec t to the other provisions of these Rules, an affidavit may c ontain only suc h fac ts as the deponent is able of his own knowledge to prove. 

 (2) An affidavit sworn for the purpose of being used in interloc utory proc eedings may c ontain statements of information or belief with the sourc es and grounds thereof. 

68     There is no definition of “interloc utory proc eedings” in the Rules of Court. In the explanatory note to O 41 r 5(2) in para 41/5/2 of _Singapore Civil Procedure 2007_ (GP Selvam ed, Sweet & Maxwell Asia 2007), it is stated that: 

 Proc eedings are not “interloc utory proc eedings” within this rule merely because they are seeking an interloc utory order and not a final order. A distinction is drawn between interlocutory proceedings generally and interlocutory proceedings where an issue has to be determined, the latter class falling outside this rule. “For the purposes of this rule those applic ations only are c onsidered interloc utory which do not decide the rights of the parties , but are made for the purposes of keeping things in status quo till the rights c an be dec ided, or for the purpose of obtaining some direc tion of the c ourt as to how the c ause is to be c onduc ted, as to what is to be done in the progress of the c ause of [ sic ] the purpose of enabling the c ourt ultimately to dec ide upon the rights of the parties”: Gilbert v Endean (1878) 9 Ch.D 259 at 269. 

 [emphases added] 

69     It is important at this point to distinguish between the form and the substanc e or nature of an applic ation. After the amendments to the Rules of Court in 2006, all interloc utory applic ations are made in the mode of a “summons”, whic h is defined in O 1 r 4 of the Rules of Court to mean “every 


summons in a pending c ause or matter”. Thus, it appears that proc eedings are interloc utory in form if they are brought in the c ontext of a pending c ause or matter. I ac c ept that originating summonses are not interloc utory in form. As explained in _Singapore Civil Procedure_ at 28/0/2: 

 The originating summons should not be c onfused with an ordinary summons (suc h as a summons in c hambers). The ordinary summons is used for interloc utory applic ations in pending proc eedings whereas an originating summons, as its name suggests, is an originating proc ess ( ie , a mode for the c ommenc ement of proc eedings). Order 1, r.4 suc c inc tly c aptures this distinc tion: “originating summons means every summons other than a summons in a pending c ause or matter.” 

70     However, in my view, the more important questions are: first, whether the present originating summons whic h seeks to restrain a future winding-up applic ation based on an existing statutory demand is interloc utory in nature; and sec ondly, whether the exc eption in O 41 r 5(2) c an enc ompass suc h an originating summons. 

71     In respec t of the first question, a test for determining whether a given applic ation is interloc utory in nature must first be found. Unfortunately, most of the authorities c ited to me involved dec isions where the c ourt found that the applic ations were interloc utory in form but should not be treated as suc h for the purposes of admitting hearsay affidavit evidenc e bec ause they determined the rights of the parties whic h were the subjec t of the pending c ause or matter. In other words, they were c ases involving “interloc utory proc eedings generally”, but where the partic ular proc eeding “fell outside this rule [ _ie_ , O 41 r 5(2)]”: see para 41/5/2 of _Singapore Civil Practice_ (quoted in [68] above). However, where the applic ation in question is an originating proc ess, the test of whether the rights of the parties in the pending c ause or matter are being finally determined is c learly inapplic able. Thus, these authorities do not, exc ept in a most oblique manner, shed light on the question of whether the present originating summons, whic h is in form an originating proc ess, may in the light of the surrounding c irc umstanc es be of an interloc utory nature. 

72     For this reason, I did not share JSPL’s faith in _Savings Bank (No 2)_ as support for its submission that the present originating summons is interloc utory in nature. In _Savings Bank (No 2)_ , the plaintiff bank had brought two ac tions to rec over moneys lent to the five defendant c ompanies (“the main ac tions”). On the ac tions being stayed pending proc eedings in the Isle of Man, one of the c ompanies gave an undertaking that it would not dispose of its assets so as to leave less than £7 million in the United Kingdom. Subsequently, the bank by notic e of motion sought the sequestration of that c ompany's assets and the c ommittal of two of its direc tors for c ontempt of c ourt for proc uring, aiding and abetting the c ompany's breac h of its undertaking. The bank sought to introduc e affidavits referring to hearsay evidenc e in support of the motion under R.S.C., Ord 41, r 5(2) whic h is _in pari materia_ with O 41 r 5(2) of our Rules of Court. The judge ruled _inter alia_ that c ommittal proc eedings were not interloc utory proc eedings so that Ord 41, r 5(2) c ould not apply. The Court of Appeal allowed the bank’s appeal. Purc has LJ reasoned (at 1224-25) that: 

 In the present c ase the undertakings whic h were offered and ac c epted to preserve the assets in this c ountry c learly fell within the c onc ept of interloc utory proc eedings to protec t what would be the fruits of vic tory in the main suit if not the property whic h was the subjec t matter of the ac tion itself. I think that here lies the c ruc ial distinc tion between interloc utory and final proc eedings. The fac t that suc h an order c an be enforc ed by a motion to c ommit for c ontempt of c ourt in the breac h, if its true purpose is to enable the proper c onduc t of the trial and the final resolution of the issues between the parties, then it is nonetheless an interloc utory proc eedings [ sic ]. 

 [emphasis added] 


73     The motion for c ommittal, being brought in order to enforc e an undertaking whic h in turn was aimed at protec ting the potential fruits of vic tory in a pending c ause or matter (“the main suit”), was interloc utory in form: see [69] above. However, on the fac ts in the present originating summons, no suc h main suit exists, as no applic ation for winding up has yet been brought; indeed, the very purpose of the originating summons is to prevent suc h an applic ation from being brought. As suc h, _Savings Bank (No 2)_ provides little support for D&N’s submissions. 

74     The fac ts of _Bryanston Finance (No 2)_ bear more resemblanc e to those in the present originating summons and thus I propose to examine it at some length. The defendant, who held only 62 out of some seven million issued shares in the plaintiff c ompany and had a personal animosity against the c ompany's c hairman, was dissatisfied with the answers he rec eived to questions he had asked c onc erning loans made by the c ompany to the c hairman and c ompanies under his c ontrol. He wrote two letters to the c hairman seeking further information and stated that, if he rec eived no reply, he would present a petition, under s 222(f ) of the UK Companies Ac t 1948, for the winding up of the c ompany. The c ompany issued a writ (“the first ac tion”) for an injunc tion to restrain the defendant from petitioning to wind it up on the ground of failure to answer the questions or any ground c onnec ted therewith. The defendant filed two affidavits c ontaining allegations of fraud, misfeasanc e and impropriety on the part of the c ompany. On 18 Marc h 1975, the c ompany was granted an injunc tion pending trial of the first ac tion in terms of the injunc tion c laimed in the writ. Following an announc ement that another c ompany was to make an offer for the minority shareholders' shares in the plaintiff c ompany, the defendant served notic e of motion to disc harge the injunc tion in the first ac tion on the ground that the offer c onstituted a c hange of c irc umstanc es justifying disc harge of the order and he filed two further affidavits c ontaining allegations against the c ompany. On 30 April 1975, Oliver J dismissed the motion. On 1 May 1975 the defendant issued an abortive petition and on 2 May 1975 the c ompany issued a writ (“the sec ond ac tion”) for an injunc tion restraining the defendant from petitioning for the winding up of the c ompany on any of the grounds c ontained in the four affidavits filed in the first ac tion. In ac c ordanc e with the proc edural requirements of the time, the plaintiff c ompany then issued a motion for an interim injunc tion in the terms of the injunc tion c laimed in the writ in the sec ond ac tion and, although c ontending that the matter had to be dec ided on the balanc e of c onvenienc e and the evidenc e showed that a petition would be an abuse of the proc ess of the c ourt, c onc eded that the defendant might in the sec ond ac tion suc c eed in establishing that some of the grounds for presenting a petition were not an abuse of the proc ess of the c ourt. On 15 May 1975, Oliver J granted the interim injunc tion. The defendant appealed against the c ourt’s refusal to disc harge the injunc tion in the first ac tion and the granting of the injunc tion in the sec ond ac tion. I shall foc us on the sec ond appeal. 

75     It should be noted that _Bryanston Finance (No 2)_ was ac tually about the test to be used in dec iding whether to grant an injunc tion against winding up and not about whether proc eedings in respec t of applic ations for suc h injunc tions are interloc utory for the purpose of admitting hearsay affidavit evidenc e. However, in giving their reasons for the test to be applied, the judges had to c onsider the nature of the injunc tion in question and whether it c ould be c onsidered interloc utory (suc h that the balanc e of c onvenienc e test in _American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd_ [1975] AC 396 (“ _American Cyanamid_ ”) applied). Ultimately, the judges allowed the appeal bec ause the plaintiff c ompany had failed to show that the petition was _prima facie_ bound to fail. 

76     Turning first to Buc kley LJ’s reasoning, he stated (at 51 to 52): 

 The ac tion in the present c ase is of an exc eptional and rather different c harac ter. The only relief c laimed in the writ in this ac tion is the injunc tion whic h I have already mentioned. This is admittedly based on an assertion that the presentation of a petition of the kind sought to be restrained would be an abuse of the proc ess of the c ourt. Whether this would be so would be the 


 only issue to be determined in the ac tion. The issues whic h might arise for dec ision upon the hearing of suc h a petition, if the defendant were permitted to present it, would not arise as substantive issues and might not arise at all on the trial of the ac tion. In relation to such a petition the action as a whole is in the nature of an interlocutory proceeding. 

 If it be asked what legal right the plaintiff company relies on in the second action from a violation of which the plaintiff company is seeking temporary protection pending the trial of the action, the answer must be, it seems to me, the right not to be involved in litigation which would constitute an abuse of the process of the court. But the plaintiff c ompany c annot assert suc h a right in respec t of any partic ular antic ipated litigation without demonstrating that, at least prima fac ie, that litigation would be an abuse. 

 If it c ould now be said that, on the available evidenc e, the presentation by the defendant of suc h a petition as is desc ribed in the injunc tion would prima fac ie be an abuse of proc ess, the plaintiff c ompany might c laim to have established a right to seek interloc utory relief. Otherwise I do not think it c an. 

 [emphases added] 

The judge reasoned that the plaintiff c ompany c ould not be allowed to restrain the defendant from presenting his winding-up petition bec ause, first, it was c lear that some, if not all, of the allegations mentioned by the defendant, if they were to be substantiated, c ould lead to a winding-up order. Sec ondly, c ounsel for the plaintiff had c onc eded that the defendant might suc c eed in establishing that the presentation of a petition on grounds asserted in the four affidavits would not be an abuse of the proc ess. 

77     Buc kley LJ c onc luded (at 53) with a referenc e to _American Cyanamid_ : 

 In his speec h in the American Cyanamid c ase [1975] A.C. 396 Lord Diploc k rec ognised that there might be spec ial fac tors to be taken into c onsideration in the partic ular c irc umstanc es of individual c ases. In my judgment, the fac t that the sec ond ac tion is an ac tion designed to prevent the c ommenc ement of proc eedings in limine is suc h a spec ial fac tor. In suc h a c ase the c ourt should not, in my judgment, interfere with what would otherwise be a legitimate approac h to the seat of justic e unless the evidenc e is suffic ient to establish prima fac ie that the plaintiffs will suc c eed in establishing that the proc eedings sought to be restrained would c onstitute an abuse of proc ess. In the present c ase, in my opinion, this has not been ac hieved. 

78     Signific antly, Buc kley LJ’s reasoning is c ompletely c ontrary to the proposition for whic h BNPP c laims _Bryanston Finance (No 2)_ is authority. Buc kley LJ’s view was that, where an ac tion – _ie_ , inc luding an originating proc ess like a writ or originating summons – had been brought in whic h the sole relief sought is the restraint of a potential winding-up petition, the ac tion is viewed as int erloc ut ory _vis-à-vis_ the petition. Thus, Buc kley LJ did not c ast the sec ond ac tion out of the c ategory of interloc utory proc eedings to whic h _American Cyanamid_ applied. However, he reasoned t hat _American Cyanamid_ envisaged the presenc e of “spec ial fac tors”, in the instant c ase being that the sec ond ac tion would prevent the c ommenc ement of winding-up proc eedings _in limine_ , suc h that it was nec essary for the evidenc e to show _prima facie_ that the threatened winding-up proc eedings would be an abuse of proc ess. 

79     Stephenson LJ, on the other hand, reac hed his c onc lusion on the basis that _American Cyanamid_ did not apply to injunc tions against winding up, bec ause these were not interloc utory injunc tions at all. He stated (at 54): 


 [Counsel for the plaintiff c ompany] sought support for the judge's approac h and order in the c onc luding sentenc e of the judgment of Sir George Jessel M.R. in Niger Merchants Co. v. Capper (1877) 18 Ch.D. 557, 559. He c laimed support there for his submission that the injunc tion he prayed for was only interloc utory, that there was a serious issue to be tried after it had been granted or refused, and that at this stage the balanc e of c onvenienc e had therefore to be c onsidered and the American Cyanamid c ase applied. But the hearing to whic h the sentenc e in t he Niger Merchants c ase refers was c learly a hearing of c onflic ting evidenc e on the question whether Mr. Capper did threaten the c ompany with winding up, whic h he denied, and that c ase is no authority for the proposition that a plaintiff c ompany, whic h moves for an injunc tion to restrain the presentation of a petition to wind it up as an abuse of the proc ess of the c ourt, c an rely on a balanc e of c onvenienc e and reserve its evidenc e to prove the abuse until the question whether it is an abuse is finally dec ided at the trial of the ac tion. I agree with Sir John Pennyc uic k, whose judgment I have had the privilege of reading, that it is finally dec ided at this stage and there is nothing left to try. 

 This is not 

 “an application for an interlocutory injunction to restrain a defendant from doing acts alleged to be in violation of the plaintiff's legal right,” 

 but to restrain a defendant from exercising his legal right to present a petition. So Lord Diploc k's words in the American Cyanamid c ase whic h Buc kley L.J. quoted do not apply to suc h an applic ation as this. 

 [emphasis added] 

80     Finally, Sir John Pennyc uic k reasoned (at 55 to 56): 

 The issue between the intending petitioner and the c ompany whic h would arise upon presentation of the petition is whether or not the c ompany shall be c ompulsorily wound up. The motion seeks a summary order restraining the defendant from starting the proc ess whic h would raise this issue for litigation in the Companies Court. The order sought upon the motion, if made, will from its very nature c onc lude onc e and for all, so far of c ourse as c onc erns the ground upon whic h the petition is based, the summary issue raised by the motion: that is to say, the defendant is either free to present his petition or he is prohibited from doing so. It is no doubt procedurally necessary under the present practice to bring the application for an injunction before the court by way of motion in an action commenced by writ seeking the same relief, the order sought upon the motion being expressed in interlocutory form. But whether the application succeeds or fails, the order upon it is the end of the action. The only issue in the action has been determined once and for all upon the motion and there can be no question of the action itself being brought on for a hearing at some later date on the same issue. The notion of a full hearing with oral examination and c ross-examination of an applic ation to stop proc eedings in limine is altogether at varianc e with the princ iples upon whic h the c ourt ac ts. The dec ision in the American Cyanamid c ase was, as I understand it, addressed to interloc utory motions in the sense of motions seeking interim relief pending determination of the rights of the parties at the hearing of the ac tion: c f. per Lord Diploc k. He said, at p. 405: "The grant of an interloc utory injunc tion is a remedy that is both temporary and disc retionary." and at p. 406: 

 When an applic ation for an interloc utory injunc tion to restrain a defendant from doing ac ts alleged to be in violation of the plaintiff's legal right is made upon c ontested fac ts, the dec ision whether or not to grant an interloc utory injunc tion has to be taken at a time when 


 ex hypothesi the existenc e of the right or the violation of it, or both, is unc ertain and will remain unc ertain until final judgment is given in the ac tion. 

 I do not think that the dec ision should be read as applic able to motions whic h, though interlocutory in form, seek relief which will finally determine the issue in the action and more particularly motions seeking to stop proceedings in limine. 

 [emphases added] 

81     Sir John Pennyc uic k’s reasoning in fac t reveals two different arguments: the first is that sinc e the order sought upon the motion will determine onc e and for all the issue raised in the motion of whether the defendant is free to present his petition on the grounds in the four affidavits or not ( _ie_ , it seeks to stop proc eedings _in limine_ ), it is not an interloc utory proc eeding (see underlined portion of his reasoning above). The sec ond argument must be viewed in light of the proc edural requirement at the time, that a c ompany seeking relief of this kind must file a writ c laiming an injunc tion to restrain presentation of a petition followed immediately by a motion expressed to c laim an interloc utory injunc tion in the same terms. Sir John Pennyc uic k argued that the motion, though interloc utory in form, was in fac t not interloc utory in nature bec ause it determined the issue in the ac tion itself (see italic ised portions of his reasoning above). As explained above at [73], this line of argument does not shed muc h light on the question I have to determine, _viz_ , whether an originating summons seeking to restrain a future winding-up applic ation based on an existing statutory demand is interloc utory in nature. 

8       2 Far from demonstrating that it is settled law that proc eedings whic h seek an injunc tion to restrain a party from winding up a c ompany are not interloc utory in nature, therefore, _Bryanston Finance (No 2)_ evinc es differing judic ial opinions about the nature of suc h proc eedings. One view, propounded by Buc kley LJ, is that they should in fac t be viewed as interloc utory _vis-à-vis_ the petition for winding up. The sec ond, propounded by Sir John Pennyc uic k (though it is not c lear why he took two alternative lines of reasoning to reac h his c onc lusion) is that they should not be viewed as interloc utory bec ause they determine onc e and for all the would-be petitioner’s right to present his petition on the grounds threatened. There has been no determinative ruling on the issue as yet, either by the English House of Lords or by our c ourts. Although _Bryanston Finance (No 2)_ was c ited with approval in _Tang Choon Keng Realty_ , that c ase did not in fac t endorse the partic ular proposition whic h BNPP had c ited _Bryanston Finance (No 2)_ for. In fac t, the following reasoning by Buc kley LJ was c ited (in _Tang Choon Keng Realty_ at 1127): 

 If it be asked what legal right the plaintiff c ompany relies on in the sec ond ac tion from a violation of whic h the plaintiff c ompany is seeking temporary protec tion pending the trial of the ac tion, the answer must be, it seems to me, the right not to be involved in litigation whic h would c onstitute an abuse of proc ess of the c ourt. 

The c ourt then went on to c ite Stephenson LJ’s reasoning, without addressing the c onflic t between the two judges’ approac hes in respec t of the interloc utory nature (or otherwise) of the proc eedings. 

83     In my view, the nature of the present originating summons is interloc utory. The full c ontext must be c onsidered. By the statutory demand, BNPP has asserted its right to the alleged debt; BNPP argues that its right arises out of the Master Agreement and, in the alternative, the Close-out Agreement; JSPL, on the other hand, denies that BNPP has this right based on the arguments in [41] _et seq_ and [60] _et seq_ above. This is not a c ase like _Brinds_ (see [38] above) where there was extensive c ross-examination before the trial c ourt and all the evidenc e needed to dec ide the question before the judge was already adduc ed. This is a c ase involving the arc ane world of forex trading, and 


in whic h allegations and c ounter-allegations have flown thic k and fast. Thus, in the present originating summons, it is not for me to dec ide the merits of the parties’ arguments; all I need to dec ide is whether JSPL has raised triable issues in respec t of the alleged debt. If I should dec ide that there are triable issues, BNPP will have to bring an ac tion against JSPL for the alleged debt and the merits of the parties’ arguments will be dec ided at trial. If I should dec ide that there are no triable issues, BNPP will still have to file an applic ation for winding up and the merits of the parties’ arguments will again be dec ided in the winding-up proc eedings. Whic hever way it goes, my dec ision will not mean there is “nothing left to try”: see Stephenson LJ’s reasoning in [79] above – the merits of the parties’ arguments remain undetermined. 

84     In the meantime, JSPL wants to ensure that no winding-up applic ation is brought sinc e this would have severe c onsequenc es for the c ompany. It is diffic ult to imagine a c learer c ase of an applic ation being sought to preserve the _status quo_ in respec t of the parties’ rights and interests. It is true that the rights sought to be preserved are not in a pending c ause or matter; to borrow Buc kley LJ’s reasoning, JSPL is merely seeking to protec t its right to be protec ted from litigation whic h is an abuse of proc ess: see [76] above. However, this is more a result of the timing at whic h JSPL c hose to ac t, whic h also determined the form of proc eedings it had to use. As pointed out by JSPL, if it had waited for an applic ation for winding up to be presented and then applied for a stay on the same ground of a disputed debt, that applic ation would have had to be brought in the form of a summons and would have been interloc utory in form. I agree that the nature of the relief sought in the present originating summons is the same as that in the c ase of a stay. 

85     This leaves the question of whether the present originating summons may be c onsidered as an “interloc utory proc eeding” for the purposes of O 41 r 5(2). I note again that there is no definition of “interloc utory proc eeding” in the Rules of Court and thus there is nothing that expressly prec ludes an extension of the term to c over the present proc eedings. On the other hand, the polic y c onsiderations as well as the general justic e of the c ase weigh in favour of its inc lusion. The rationale for the admissibility of hearsay affidavit evidenc e in interloc utory proc eedings was artic ulated by Jessel MR in _Gilbert v Endean_ (1878) 9 Ch D 259 (at 266): 

 No doubt in the c ase of interloc utory applic ations the Court as a matter of nec essity is c ompelled to ac t upon suc h evidenc e when not met by denial on the other side. In applic ations of that kind the Court must ac t upon suc h evidenc e, because no evidence is obtainable at so short a notice, and intolerable mischief would ensue if the Court were not to do so. The object of these applications is either to keep matters as they are or to prevent the happening of serious or irremediable mischief, and for those purposes the c ourt has been in the habit of ac ting upon this imperfec t evidenc e. 

 [emphasis added] 

86     Similarly, Peter Gibson J stated in _Savings and Investment Bank v Gasco_ [1984] 1 WLR 271 at 282: 

 The purpose of [the exc eption] is to enable a deponent to put before the c ourt in interloc utory proc eedings, frequently in circumstances of great urgency , fac ts whic h he is not able of his own knowledge to prove but whic h, the deponent is informed and believes, c an be proved by means whic h the deponent identifies by spec ifying the sourc es and grounds of his information and belief. 

 [emphasis added] 

87     Eac h of these justific ations is present on the fac ts of the present originating summons. At the 


time of the applic ation, the investigations by JSPL, D&N and PwC were still ongoing. It was not possible to unc over all the fac ts pertaining to the c irc umstanc es under whic h the unauthorised transac tions were entered into by Wee between the time when they were disc overed and the time the alleged debt bec ame due under the statutory demand. It was not disputed that a winding-up applic ation might trigger “Event of Default” or “Potential Event of Default” c lauses in JSPL’s line of c redit fac ilities with various banks as well as its c urrent c ontrac ts with its c ustomers. Nor was it denied that a winding-up applic ation would c ause grave c onc ern among its c urrent c ustomers and undermine its ability to sec ure new c ontrac ts, with serious c ommerc ial implic ations on JSPL’s business and putting the livelihood of some 2,000 JSPL employees at stake. Thus, the present originating summons is a prime example of an applic ation where the c irc umstanc es are of great urgenc y and evidenc e is not obtainable at short notic e, and the objec t is either to keep matters as they are or to prevent the happening of serious or irremediable harm. 

88     The statutory demand c learly envisaged that an applic ation for winding up might be made if payment of the alleged debt was not made within 21 days from the date of the statutory demand. In my view there is no justific ation for making an alleged debtor wait for at least 21 days to and fac e an applic ation for winding up before it ac ts to protec t its interests, nor is there justic e in punishing him for c hoosing to take a more pro-ac tive approac h. For all these reasons, I admitted Wee’s unsigned statement into evidenc e in the present proc eedings. I have taken into ac c ount the doubts expressed by Wee’s lawyers, M/s Lee & Lee , as to its reliability although, as JSPL’s had pointed out, M/s Lee & Lee c ould be expec ted to do so in order to protec t their c lient’s position pending prosec ution by the Commerc ial Affairs Department. 

**The alleged obligation under the Close-out Agreement** 

89     I shall deal first with the alleged independent obligation to pay under the Close-out Agreement, sinc e if BNPP suc c eeds in establishing this it will no longer need to rely on the Master Agreement for its right to the alleged debt. BNPP’s c ase hinges on what is meant by the parties’ agreement that the outstanding forex transac tions would be “Terminated Transac tions for the purposes of the Master Agreement”. BNPP’s submission based on the phrase “[o]n and with effec t from your ac c eptanc e of suc h oral instruc tions” merely begs this question; as does its argument that, if there is no independent obligation to pay under the Close-out Agreement, the words “[i]t shall be a c ondition of [BNPP’s] ac c eptanc e of [JSPL’s] oral instruc tions to terminate...” bec ome superfluous. Essentially, this c ourt has been invited to infer from the parties’ agreement that the outstanding forex transac tions would be “Terminated Transac tions for the purposes of the Master Agreement” that the attendant c onsequenc es of termination ( _viz_ , obligation to pay in ac c ordanc e with ss 6(c )(ii) and 6(d) of the Master Agreement) follow. The provisions of the Close-out Agreement itself do not explic itly provide for this. They merely provide that the transac tions whic h were the subjec t of c lose-out should be terminated transac tions “as if” an Early Termination Date had oc c urred as a result of a Termination Event. This wording in fac t rec ognises that the c lose-out is not a termination ordinarily c overed under the Master Agreement. Furthermore, the phrase “for the purposes of the Master Agreement” equally supports JSPL’s proposition that the Close-out Agreement merely fixed the quantum of loss suffered in respec t of the transac tions whic h were the subjec t of the c lose-out, while JSPL’s liability in respec t of this sum ( _ie_ , the alleged debt) remained to be pursued under the Master Agreement. 

90     Further, s 6(d)(ii) of the Master Agreement, upon whic h BNPP relies to make its c ase that JSPL is obliged to pay the Agreed Value within two business days, is not unequivoc al. I set out the entire provision below: 

 An amount c alc ulated as being due in respec t of any Early Termination Date under Sec tion 6(e) will be payable on the day that notic e of the amount payable is effec tive (in the c ase of an Early 


 Termination Date whic h is designated or oc c urs as a result of an Event of Default) and on the day whic h is two Loc al Business Days after the day on whic h notic e of the amount payable is effec tive (in the c ase of an Early Termination Date whic h is designated as a result of a Termination Event). 

This provision c ontemplates two payment dates: (i) where an Early Termination Date is designated or oc c urs as a result of an Event of Default, payment shall be made on the day that notic e of the amount payable is effec tive; and (ii) where an Early Termination Date is designated as a result of a Termination Event, payment shall be made two business days after the day on whic h notic e of the amount payable is effec tive. BNPP relies on (ii). Sec tion 6(b)(iv) c ontemplates that situation where a Termination Event has oc c urred, in whic h situation a party, after giving not more than 20 days notic e to the other party, has the right to designate a day as an Early Termination Date. However the Close-out Agreement merely provides that “the Transac tions shall be Terminated Transac tions for the purposes of the Master Agreement (as if an Early Termination Date had oc c urred at the date of suc h telephone c onversation and as a result of a Termination Event)”. It does not provide for that Early Termination Date to be deemed to be “designated as a result of” the Termination Event. 

91     As for the reservation provisions, I find that they did not determine either way whether JSPL had an obligation or option to pay the alleged debt on 5 November 2007. It will be rec alled that BNPP had identified three independent c ategories of c auses of ac tion: “in the event of non-settlement on the value date”, “otherwise at law” or “pursuant to the Master Agreement”: see [59] above. This interpretation suffers from the somewhat odd arrangement in the phrase “proc eedings in c ourt in the event of non-settlement on the value date or otherwise at law or pursuant to the Master Agreement” (“the reservation c lause”). The c ategory “otherwise at law” bec omes nonsensic al when it follows the c ategory “in the event of non-settlement on the value date” and is linked by the word “or”. This is bec ause the one is simply not in opposition to the other, as is demanded by the word “otherwise”. BNPP’s interpretation would be more supportable if the c lause read instead: “proc eedings in c ourt in the event of non-settlement on the value date or pursuant to the Master Agreement _or otherwise at law_ [emphasis added]”. 

92     In my view, the only sensible reading of the reservation c lause is as follows: “proc eedings in c ourt _in the event of non-settlement on the value date or otherwise,_ at law or pursuant to the Master Agreement [emphasis added]”. JSPL would then argue that this shows that proc eedings may be brought regardless of whether settlement is made on value date or not; in other words, the words “proc eedings in c ourt” are to be read together with “at law or pursuant to the Master Agreement”, suc h that the Close-out Agreement envisaged the possibility of proc eedings in c ourt at law or pursuant to the Master Agreement, “in the event of non-settlement on the value date or otherwise”. However, another possible reading is for “proc eedings in c ourt” to be read with “in the event of nonsettlement on the value date or otherwise” (and indeed, this would be in ac c ordanc e with the grammatic al rule of proximity), suc h that the possibility of proc eedings being brought in the event of and as a response to the non-settlement itself is not prec luded. Ultimately, the only thing that c an be stated with c ertainty is that the reservation provisions were the result of hasty and haphazard draftmanship. I find that they c annot and do not determine the issue of whether JSPL has an obligation or option to pay the alleged debt on 5 November 2007. Any independent obligation to pay under the Close-out Agreement therefore depends on the interpretation of para 3(b), whic h I have already c anvassed above at [89]. 

93     Ultimately, the tussle over the existenc e or otherwise of an independent obligation to pay under the CloseOut Agreement boils down to whether suc h an important obligation ( _viz_ , to pay a sum of some US$50 million within two business days) has been imported into the Close-out Agreement on the basis of a few words in para 3(b) of the Close-out Agreement. It is diffic ult to imagine any 


c irc umstanc es under whic h suc h a major undertaking would not have been the subjec t of an express provision in the Close-out Agreement. Its absenc e in the c irc umstanc es c annot be explained by any other reason than the fac t that the parties had not c ontemplated it. The foc us of the negotiations between the parties had been to stop further losses and this is the primary theme of the CloseOut Agreement. On the other hand, BNPP has to rely on an obtuse argument to support its c laim that JSPL had undertaken suc h a large obligation. For these reasons, I find that no independent obligation to pay arises under the Close-out Agreement. It is thus unnec essary for me to deal with JSPL’s submission in respec t of its alleged c ross-c laim: see [61] above. 

**The alleged obligation under the Master Agreement** 

94     Turning to the parties’ submissions in respec t of the Master Agreement, I find that JSPL has raised no triable issues in respec t of the binding effec t of the 1 November 2004 resolution and the Master Agreement. The 1 November 2004 resolution was signed by no less than five of JSPL’s direc tors, eac h of whom averred that he had read the terms of the resolution before signing it. There was no evidenc e of any undue influenc e, duress or misrepresentation suc h as might vitiate these direc tors’ c onsent to the terms of the resolution. Nor did the argument that they thought the words “or on a spec ulative basis” did not apply to JSPL hold muc h water as the direc tors’ subjec tive intent at the time they signed the 1 November 2004 resolution is irrelevant if on an objec tive view they intended to be bound by its terms: see among numerous authorities _Consmat Singapore (Pte) Ltd v Bank of America National Trust & Savings Association_ <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR 828</span> at 838; _Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Hansen Tangen_ [1976] 1 WLR 989 at 996. 

95     However, even on the basis that the 1 November 2004 resolution and the Master Agreement are binding on their terms, I find that JSPL has raised triable issues in respec t of whether BNPP knew or ought to have known that Wee lac ked authority to c arry out the Key Transac tions, and the effec t of suc h ac tual or c onstruc tive notic e (if proved) on JSPL’s obligation to pay the alleged debt. 

96     The authorities relied on by BNPP to support their submissions based on c ontrac tual estoppel did not c ontemplate the two sc enarios posited by JSPL: _viz_ , BNPP’s offic ers c olluding with Wee to c arry out transac tions beyond the sc ope of his authority or BNPP having ac tual or c onstruc tive notic e that Wee was c arrying out suc h transac tions. The doc trine of c ontrac tual estoppel may be trac ed bac k to _Colchester Borough Council v Smith and others_ [1992] Ch 421 (“ _Colchester_ ”). In that c ase, a tenant (“T”) had oc c upied c ertain land adversely to the freehold owner, a borough c ounc il, for a period exc eeding 12 years. The c ounc il initiated c orrespondenc e with the T’s solic itors, seeking to regularise T’s oc c upation by granting him a lic enc e for a fee, but his solic itors initially maintained that he had ac quired the freehold title to the land by adverse possession. After threats by the c ounc il to institute proc eedings for possession, an agreement (“the agreement”) was c onc luded for a lease of the land by the c ounc il to T. In c l 4 of the agreement, T stated that he ac knowledged the c ounc il's title to the land and that he had not gained any right, title or interest to or in it by adverse possession. In subsequent possession proc eedings the c ounc il c laimed, _inter alia_ , dec larations that it was the freehold owner of the land and that T had no estate or interest in the land exc ept as a tenant pursuant to the agreement. The judge held, _inter alia_ , that T was estopped from asserting any title to the land exc ept that under the agreement. T’s appeal was dismissed. 

97     Dillon LJ referred with approval to _Binder v Alachouzos_ [1972] 2 QB 151 (“ _Binder_ ”), whic h c onc erned a moneylending dispute. The defendant had borrowed money from the plaintiff and in several ac tions by the lenders, he pleaded that the sums c laimed were in respec t of moneylending transac tions by unregistered moneylenders and so were irrec overable by virtue of the Moneylenders Ac t. Just before the original ac tions were due for trial, an agreement of c ompromise was made between the parties. That agreement was made between parties who had been advised by lawyers, 


and the defendant admitted that the Moneylenders Ac t did not apply to the transac tions whic h were the subjec t of the ac tions. By the c ompromise agreement the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff a spec ified sum with interest by agreed instalments and it was expressly provided that, in any ac tion on the c ompromise agreement by the plaintiff, it should not be open to the defendant to raise any defenc e other than as to the quantum of moneys paid. The defendant failed to keep the terms of the c ompromise agreement and the plaintiff issued his sec ond writ c laiming payment thereunder. The defendant again pleaded the Moneylenders Ac t and c ontended that bec ause the plaintiff was an unlic ensed moneylender the c ompromise agreement was unenforc eable and illegal. Summary judgment for the moneys due under the c ompromise agreement was granted to the plaintiff by the master and an appeal was dismissed by the judge. The defendant’s appeal was dismissed. 

98     Dillon LJ quoted Lord Denning MR’s reasoning (in _Binder_ at 158) (at 429): 

 In my judgment, a bona fide agreement of c ompromise suc h as we have in the present c ase (where the dispute is as to whether the plaintiff is a moneylender or not) is binding. It c annot be reopened unless there is evidenc e that the lender has taken undue advantage of the situation of the borrower. In this c ase no undue advantage was taken. Both sides were advised by c ompetent lawyers on eac h side. There was a fair arguable c ase for eac h. The agreement they reac hed was fair and reasonable. It should not be reopened. 

99     Dillon LJ then stated: “I see no reason why that reasoning should not also apply where the dispute was as to whether or not the defendant had ac quired a title to land by adverse possession.” He c onc luded (at 435): 

 In my judgment this was a bona fide c ompromise of a dispute and Mr. Tillson [the tenant], who had the advic e of his solic itors and signed the agreement through them, is estopped by the terms of the agreement he made from going behind it and litigating the antec edent dispute. That is as the judge held, and whether it be labelled estoppel by agreement or estoppel by c onvention is a matter of indifferenc e. 

100    Both _Colchester_ and _Binder_ pertained to a situation in whic h one party was dealing direc tly with another and had in the c ontrac t between them agreed to c ertain terms. In the absenc e of the normal vitiating fac tors suc h as duress, undue influenc e and misrepresentation, those terms were binding and c ontrac tually estopped the parties from advanc ing arguments in c ontradic tion thereof. _Colchester_ and _Binder_ provide no guidanc e on whether a party to the c ontrac t c ould rely on those terms to raise an estoppel if an agent had been given authority to ac t for the other party pursuant to the c ontrac t, and the first party had itself c olluded with the agent in ac ting beyond the sc ope of his authority or had ac tual or c onstruc tive notic e that the agent was doing so. 

101    BNPP sought to rely on _Peekay Intermark Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd_ [2006] EWCA Civ 386 (“ _Peekay_ ”). In that c ase, RB, an offic er of the defendant bank (“the bank”), asked the c laimant’s _alter ego_ , P, whether he would like to invest in a Russian struc tured deposit without telling him that it was linked to some Russian Government bonds c alled GKO or that in the event of sovereign default investors would have no c ontrol over how the investment would be liquidated. P replied that he was interested. RB then e-mailed an attac hment to P c ontaining the final terms and c onditions (“F TCs”) relating to a hedged Russian Treasury bill. The F TCs desc ribed the investment as a deposit and set out various terms relating to it, inc luding the maturity date and the projec ted rate of return. The F TCs were ac c ompanied by a doc ument desc ribed as an “Emerging Markets Risk Disc losure Statement”. Later, RB faxed c opies of all the doc uments to P for signature on behalf of the plaintiff. P looked over the doc uments but did not read them, assuming that they reflec ted what RB had told him about the investment. He signed the doc uments, returned them to the 


bank with instruc tions to buy US$250,000 “Russian GKO Note as per attac hed doc ument”. 

102    Subsequently, the Russian government announc ed a moratorium on its debt obligations under the GKO Notes, as a result of whic h the c laimant only rec overed US$5,918.06 from the deposit. The c laimant c laimed damages from the bank under s 2 of the Misrepresentation Ac t 1967 alleging that RB had misrepresented the nature of the investment by giving P the impression that it would have a proprietary interest of some kind in the GKO, and that P had been induc ed to invest in it on its behalf. The High Court found for the c laimant. However, the Court of Appeal reversed the dec ision on the ground that although RB had given P that impression, the terms of the F TCs were suffic ient to make it c lear to P, if he had read them, that the nature of the investment was fundamentally different from that whic h he had been given to understand. The Court of Appeal also held that P signed the doc uments by his own assumption that the investment produc t to whic h they related c orresponded to the desc ription he had previously been given, and not as a result of any induc ement by RB. 

103    More relevantly for our purposes, the Court of Appeal addressed an applic ation made by the bank’s c ounsel in the c ourse of the hearing of the appeal to amend the notic e of appeal to raise an alternative argument that the c laimant was estopped from alleging that it had been induc ed to enter into the c ontrac t by misrepresentation on the part of RB. The argument was based on the following two passages in the Risk Disc losure Statement: 

 You should also ensure that you fully understand the nature of the transac tion and c ontrac tual relationship into whic h you are entering. 

and 

 The issuer assumes that the c ustomer is aware of the risks and prac tic es desc ribed herein, and that prior to eac h transac tion the c ustomer has determined that suc h transac tion is suitable for him. 

whic h P on behalf of the c laimant c onfirmed by his signature that he had read and understood. Counsel for the bank submitted that as a result of having done so, P and the c laimant were estopped from asserting that they had not understood the nature and effec t of the F TCs and so c ould not maintain that they had been induc ed by misrepresentation to enter into the c ontrac t. Lord Justic e Moore-Bic k stated (at [56], [58] and [60]): 

 There is no reason in princ iple why parties to a c ontrac t should not agree that a c ertain state of affairs should form the basis for the transac tion, whether it be the c ase or not. For example, it may be desirable to settle a disagreement as to an existing state of affairs in order to establish a c lear basis for the c ontrac t itself and its subsequent performanc e. Where parties express an agreement of that kind in a contractual document neither can subsequently deny the existence of the facts and matters upon which they have agreed, at least so far as concerns those aspects of their relationship to which the agreement was directed. The contract itself gives rise to an estoppel : see Colchester Borough Council v Smith [1991] Ch 448, affirmed on appeal [1992] Ch 421. 

 ... 

 Insofar as the argument in this c ase turns on the true c onstruc tion and effec t of the c ontrac tual doc uments (inc luding the Risk Disc losure Statement) and is one to whic h no further findings of fac t might have been relevant, [the bank] should, in my view, be allowed to advanc e it. I would therefore grant the bank permission to amend its notic e of appeal to raise the issue of 


 c ontrac tual estoppel, but I would not allow it at this stage to c ontend that there was an estoppel by representation sinc e the judge was not asked to c onsider that question and did not make findings in relation to it. The question then is whether, in the light of [P’s] signature of the declaration at the foot of the Risk Disclosure Statement, the claimant is precluded as a matter of contract from contending that it did not understand the true nature of the investment. 

 ... 

 The purpose of the Risk Disc losure Statement was both to draw to the attention of the investor the need for c aution when investing in emerging markets and to make it c lear that [the bank] was only willing to enter into a c ontrac t with him on the assumption that he had satisfied himself that the transac tion was suitable for him. By c onfirming that he had read and understood the statement and returning it with his instruc tions to make the investment P offered to enter into a c ontrac t with [the bank] on behalf of [the c laimant] on those terms and that offer was ac c epted by [the bank] when it implemented his instruc tions. As a result it was part of the c ontrac t between them that [the c laimant] was aware of the nature of the investment it was seeking to purc hase and had satisfied that it was suitable for its needs. In those circumstances, and since it is not suggested that [the bank] misrepresented to [P] the effect of the documents, I do not think that it is open to [the claimant] to say that it did not understand the nature of the transaction described in the FTCs ; and if that is so, it c annot assert that it was induc ed to enter into the c ontrac t by a misunderstanding of the nature of the investment derived from what [RB] had said about the produc t some days earlier. 

 [emphases added] 

104    I do not doubt the logic of Lord Justic e MooreBic k’s reasoning, but have my doubts about whether he c ontemplated the extreme sc enarios propounded by JSPL in the present originating summons: see [42] above. In _Peekay_ , there was no question about P’s authority to enter into the c ontrac t with the bank on the c laimant’s behalf. Certainly, there was no suggestion that the bank had c olluded with P in any ac ts beyond the sc ope of his authority, or had ac tual or c onstruc tive notic e of suc h ac ts. Thus, in the absenc e of the normal vitiating fac tors suc h as duress, undue influenc e and misrepresentation, P’s signature on the Risk Disc losure Statement estopped the plaintiff from advanc ing arguments in c ontradic tion of the representations therein. The question remains open whether the bank would have been able to rely on those representations to raise an estoppel if, for instanc e, the bank had been c olluding with P in ac ting beyond the sc ope of his authority when entering into the c ontrac t, or had ac tual or c onstruc tive notic e that P was doing so. 

105    Another c ase relied on by BNPP was _Orient Centre Investments Ltd v Societe Generale_ <span class="citation">[2007] 3 SLR 566</span> (“ _Orient Centre_ ”), in whic h one Teo Song Kwang (“Teo”) and his nominee and _alter ego_ Orient Centre Investments Ltd (“Orient”) (“the appellants”) undertook a multitude of investments through an investment ac c ount (“the Investment Ac c ount”) they had opened with Soc iete Generale (“SG”). Later, the appellants c ommenc ed an ac tion against SG and one Kenneth Goh (“Goh”), their investment advisor and an employee of SG at the material time for losses suffered by Orient in the Investment Ac c ount. They alleged that they had been induc ed to undertake the investments by c ertain representations made by Goh, namely that: (a) SG was rated one of the top five banks in the world and (b) SG had a spec ial strategy that would ensure preservation of Teo’s c apital and a guaranteed return of 10% per annum on Teo’s deposits. SG applied to the c ourt to strike out the appellants’ c laims and the assistant registrar granted the applic ation in part. SG appealed; the judge allowed its appeal partially and struc k out the appellants’ c laim for losses arising from its investments in the struc tured produc ts and more spec ific ally the first four (the Bangkok Bank Equity Linked Deposit, the Tiger Note 2, the Tokyo Deposit and the Tokyo Plus Deposit) as the fifth (the USD/4 


Funds Deposit) was purc hased after Goh left SG’s employment. The appellants then appealed, whic h appeal was dismissed. 

106    The Court of Appeal referred to several representations and warranties c ontained in the general agreements exec uted by Orient when opening the Investment Ac c ount as well as the spec ific agreements governing the ac quisition of the individual produc ts. For example, c l 12 of the Standard Terms and Conditions Governing Foreign Exc hange Margin Trading/Option Investment (“the FX fac ilities”) provided that: 

 The Customer represents and warrants that: 

 ... 

 (f) it is exerc ising its own business judgment independently of the Bank in entering into the FX fac ilities and eac h Contrac t. ... 

 (h) the Bank is not ac ting as a fiduc iary for or as an advisor to it in respec t of the Contrac ts. 

107    The Bangkok Bank Equity Linked Deposit was purc hased subjec t to the terms of an Equity Linked Deposit Master Agreement, in whic h Art 4 provided that: 

 The Depositor hereby represents and warrants to SG that: 

 ... 

 4.11 it has not relied upon any representations (whether written or oral) of SG, other than the representations expressly set forth in the relevant fac ility letters and sec urity doc uments and in any guarantee or other c redits support doc ument and is not in any fiduc iary relationship with SG; 

 ... 

 4.13 it is aware that this is not a c apital guaranteed produc t. In a worse c ase sc enario, it c ould sustain an entire loss of its investment and should therefore reac h an investment dec ision on this produc t only after c areful c onsideration with its own advisers as to the suitability of this produc t in light of its partic ular financ ial c irc umstanc es. 

108    In the c ase of Tiger Note 2, it was subjec t to the Tiger Note 2 Indexed Deposit Agreement (“IDA”), Art 4.2 of whic h provided that the depositor represents and warrants for the benefit of SG that, _inter alia_ : 

 it has c onc luded the present transac tion after having c arried out its analysis of the transac tion, partic ularly in the light of its financ ial c apac ity and its objec tives; ... 

 [emphasis in bold in original] 

Artic les 4.2 of the Tokyo Deposit and the Tokyo Plus Deposit were in the same terms as Art 4.2 of the Tiger Note 2 IDA. 

109    The Court of Appeal c onc luded (at [50] to [51]): 

 In our view, the c ombined effec t of the express general and spec ific terms and c onditions applic able to the struc tured produc ts provides an insuperable obstac le to any c laim by the 


 appellants against SG based on the alleged breac h of representations or duties, fiduc iary or c ontrac tual or on negligenc e on the part of Goh. In the fac e of Orient’s own representations and warranties with respec t to eac h of the struc tured produc ts, it is not possible for the appellants to argue that Orient had relied on any alleged representation on the part of Goh that he would ensure that the appellants’ c apital would be preserved and that it would earn a return of 10% per annum on eac h deposit... 

 In our view, even if Goh had made the representation c onc erning c apital preservation and inc ome return, it would not have assisted the appellants in relation to the struc tured produc ts, as they have represented and warranted that they did not rely on any representation given by any of SG’s offic ers. Moreover, Teo c ould not have misunderstood the c lear and spec ific terms governing the struc tured produc ts. An analogous c ase is that of the English Court of Appeal in Peekay Intermark Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2006] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 511 (“ Peekay ”), whic h was rec ently affirmed in Bottin International Investments Limited v Venson Group plc [2006] EWHC 3112 (Ch). 

110    The fac tual resemblanc e between _Orient Centre_ and the present originating summons in respec t of the nature of the transac tions and the representations made should not blind us to the fac t that _Orient Centre_ was simply not on all fours with the fac ts in the present originating summons. My remarks in respec t of _Peekay_ apply in full to _Orient Centre_. 

111    Instead, we may find more guidanc e in the well-established princ iples of agenc y. Ordinarily, JSPL would be bound by any ac ts of Wee, its agent, within the sc ope of his ac tual or ostensible authority. The sc ope of Wee’s authority in turn depends on the sc ope of the 1 November 2004 resolution. I find that a triable issue already arises in respec t of whether the Key Transac tions c ould be viewed as transac tions “on spec ulative basis” under the 1 November 2004 resolution. This question, whic h involves an exegesis of the c omplex lexic on and prac tic es of the forex trade, is eminently a question of fac t whic h is best resolved at trial with the evidenc e and c ross-examination of expert witnesses. 

112    Furthermore, where an agent ac ts in exc ess of his ac tual authority and the third party has notic e that the agent is exc eeding his authority, the princ ipal is not bound by the ac ts of the agent: see Artic le 73 of _Bowstead & Reynolds on Agency_ (18th Ed, 2006) at 361. If the third party knows that the agent does not have ac tual authority to c arry out the ac t, any apparent authority is negatived as well: _Criterion Properties plc v Stratford UK Properties LLC_ [2004] UKHL 28. I find that JSPL has raised triable issues of fac t in respec t of whether BNPP knew or had notic e of Wee’s lac k of authority, _viz_ , by its arguments based on Wee’s unsigned statement, the suspense ac c ount and the evidenc e that BNPP was working with Wee to tailor the information to be provided to the external auditors. Several of BNPP’s responses did not prevent suc h triable issues from arising. For example, it was not enough to assert that the suspense ac c ount was an internal general ledger ac c ount and therefore not disc losed to the external auditors, in the absenc e of any evidenc e regarding the authorisation, setting up and operation of this ac c ount, and in the fac e of evidenc e that the risks assoc iated with suspense ac c ounts have resulted in regulatory guidelines on their authorisation, setting up and operation. It was also not explained why Wee would instruc t BNPP to disc lose only the notional values of the outstanding forex positions and not their MTM values whic h would have been a more ac c urate reflec tion of the profits or losses at the partic ular time. Furthermore, the c irc umstanc es under whic h the E&Y auditors ac c epted only a simulated spreadsheet of MTM profits and losses in the 2006 audit c onfirmation remained obsc ure. Barely any response has been given in respec t of JSPL’s allegations as to the exotic and even “toxic ” nature of the transac tions. Finally, the allegations made in Wee’s unsigned statement c learly raise a plethora of triable issues. 

**Conclusion** 


113    For the reasons above, I will allow the applic ation in the present originating summons. I will hear c ounsel on the question of c osts.
