: **_Introduction_** 

The appellant, a former polic e offic er, was c onvic ted in the distric t c ourt under s 6 (a) of the Prevention of Corruption Ac t (Cap 241) (`PCA`) on 14 c ounts of c orruption. He was sentenc ed to nine months` imprisonment on eac h c harge, with the first two sentenc es running c onsec utively. Being dissatisfied with his c onvic tion and sentenc es, he appealed to me. I dismissed his appeal, and I now set forth my reasons. 

**_Background_** 

The prosec ution alleged that on 14 oc c asions, between August 1995 and Marc h 1997, the appellant had c orruptly ac c epted gratific ation amounting to some $10,900 from one Roland Tay Hai Choon (`DW2`), in return for supplying the latter with c onfidential information whic h he had obtained in the c ourse of his duties as a polic e hearse driver. At the relevant times, the appellant was a c orporal in the Singapore Polic e Forc e, and also the designated polic e hearse driver. When the polic e hearse was required, the Polic e Ac tivation Division would radio him with the nec essary information relating to the loc ation of the dead bodies. His duties were to transport workers, engaged by the polic e to remove bodies, to the given loc ation, and then to c onvey the bodies to the mortuary. The c onfidential information whic h he had allegedly released to DW2 were the names and addresses of the dec eased 


persons that he transported in the polic e hearse, and the c ontac t numbers and names of those dec eased persons` next-of-kin (`the relevant information`). The relevant information enabled DW2, who owned an undertaking business, to solic it business from the next-of-kin. 

To establish their c ase, the prosec ution relied heavily on two pre-trial statements (`the statements`) whic h the appellant had made to the Corrupt Prac tic es Investigation Bureau (CPIB). The first statement, made on 17 May 1999, was rec orded by a CPIB investigating offic er, PW4. In that statement, the appellant gave the following ac c ount of his dealings with DW2: sometime in August 1996, he had fallen into dire financ ial straits, and had asked an ac quaintanc e, PW1, to introduc e him to DW2 in order to borrow money from the latter. On their first meeting, DW2 lent him $1,000. DW also asked to be supplied with information as to the loc ation, names and addresses of the dec eased persons that the appellant transported in the polic e hearse, as well as the c ontac t numbers and names of the dec eased persons` next-of-kin. DW2 wanted to solic it business from the dec eased persons` family members. The appellant agreed to this. On an average, he supplied DW2 with about two to three c ases a week. He c laimed that he had not rec eived any c ommission for the arrangement. In January or February 1997, he borrowed another $2,000 from DW2, and subsequently a further $2,000 between July to September 1997. In addition, during the 1997 Chinese New Year period, he rec eived a `red pac ket` of $200 from DW2. He supplied the relevant information to DW2 mainly bec ause DW2 did not press him to repay the loans. As of the date of the statement, the loans remained unpaid. 

A few days after making his first statement, the appellant attempted to retrac t that statement by making a statutory dec laration whic h stated: 

 On 17 May 1999 I made a statement to SSI Chin at CPIB Office (Rm 208). I was afraid and confused at that time and what Ive said in that statement is not true. In fact I did not take any loan or other gifts from one Roland Tay. I also did not provide any information that will benefit him in his business. 

About a month later, on 22 June 1999, the appellant made a sec ond statement to CPIB. The investigating offic er who rec orded this sec ond statement was PW5. In that sec ond statement, the appellant gave a more detailed ac c ount of his dealings with DW2. He stated that he had first been introduc ed to DW2 by PW1 as early as August 1995. On that oc c asion, DW2 gave him $500, but said that he did not want to `disc uss the details` with PW1 around. A few days later, DW2 c ontac ted him and they met up. DW2 proposed that he would pay the appellant $600 a month in return for the relevant information. The appellant ac c epted this proposal and started giving DW2 the relevant information soon after this. Under this arrangement, he rec eived sums of moneys from DW2 on 14 oc c asions ranging from $200 to $2,000 in the period between September 1995 and Marc h 1997. In early September 1995, he rec eived his first payment of $600. He gave details as to the plac es he rec alled meeting DW2 to c ollec t payments. He also gave details as to several dates whic h he c ould rec all rec eiving money from DW2, and the amounts that he had rec eived on eac h oc c asion. In addition, he referred to the `loans` whic h he had mentioned in his first statement, and stated that those sums of money were ac tually not `loans` at all, but payments from DW2 in February 1996 and September 1996 for the relevant information. 

The prosec ution c alled PW1 as a witness. PW1 had bec ome ac quainted with the appellant around 1995 in the c ourse of his employment as a mortuary attendant at Tan Toc k Seng Hospital and as a part-time undertaker in a private undertaking c ompany. He testified that sometime in 1995, the appellant was in financ ial trouble, and had asked him to approac h moneylenders on his behalf. At the appellant`s request, he had pointed DW2 out on one oc c asion at a c offee shop. At the trial, PW 


denied that he had any knowledge of the dealings or arrangements whic h took plac e thereafter between the appellant and DW2. However, the prosec ution suc c essfully impeac hed his c redit with a previous inc onsistent statement, in whic h he had stated: 

 It is true that Yusof had provided Roland Tay with information on location of dead body found or the address of the deceased family. I came to know this when I was working as a part-time undertaker for former boss Mr Ang of Tiong Aik Undertaker. ... When the police hearse was activated, I would follow the police hearse driven by Yusof to the scene. Sometimes I saw him making telephone calls after picking up the dead body. He told me that he was calling Roland Tay to provide him with the information so that his men could approach the decease family for business. 

At the trial, the appellant denied all the c harges against him. DW2 was c alled as a defenc e witness, and he also denied ever having extended monies to the appellant, or having rec eived any of the relevant information from the appellant. The defenc e c hallenged the admissibility of the appellant`s two pre-trial statements, on the basis that they had had been fabric ated and had not been made voluntarily. They maintained that the truth was to be found in the appellant`s statutory dec laration. 

The distric t judge c onduc ted a voir dire to determine the voluntariness of the statements. PW4 and PW5, the investigating offic ers who had rec orded the appellant`s two pre-trial statements, gave evidenc e in the voir dire as to the c irc umstanc es in whic h those statements had been rec orded. The distric t judge found no evidenc e to indic ate that the making of the statements had been c aused by a threat, induc ement or promise. Consequently, he admitted them as evidenc e in the trial. At the end of the trial, having c onsidered all the evidenc e before him, he found the appellant guilty of all 14 c harges, and sentenc ed him ac c ordingly. 

**_Issues in the appeal_** 

Counsel for the appellant raised four issues before me in the appeal. First, it was argued that the distric t judge should not have admitted into evidenc e the appellant`s two pre-trial statements, as these statements had not been given voluntarily; sec ondly, even if the statements were c orrec tly admitted, the distric t judge had erred in his assessment of the inherent reliability and ac c urac y of the statements; thirdly, the distric t judge had erred in his assessment of the verac ity and c redibility of the witnesses; fourthly, even if the appellant had supplied the relevant information to DW2, that did not c onstitute `a showing of favour in relation to his princ ipal`s affairs`, as was required under s 6(a) of the PCA. 

**_The appeal_** 

**The law on admissibility of statements made to non-police officers** 

I shall start with the admissibility of the appellant`s two pre-trial statements to the CPIB, sinc e those statements c ontained evidenc e that was c entral to both the prosec ution`s c ase, as well as the dec ision below. Notably, in this c ase, the statements had not been made to polic e offic ers but to CPIB offic ers. In addition, the CPIB offic ers in this c ase were investigating c orruption offenc es under the PCA, and not Penal Code offenc es. Therefore, they were not `deemed to be polic e offic ers`, as 


the proviso in s 17 of the PCA was not applic able. Being a c ase where the statements were made by an ac c used person to non-polic e offic ers, s 122 of the Criminal Proc edure Code (CAP 68) (`CPC`) did not apply ( **Sim Ah Cheoh v PP** [1991] SLR 150 ; **Tan Siew Chay v PP** <span class="citation">[1993] 2 SLR 14</span> ; **Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP** <span class="citation">[1999] 1 SLR 25</span> ). Instead, the Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97) (`EA`) governed the admissibility of the statements. As the law stands, the appropriate test for determining admissibility of a statement, made by an ac c used person to a non-polic e offic er, depends on whether that statement amounts to a c onfession or not. 

If the statement amounts to a c onfession, that statement must satisfy s 24 of the EA before it is admissible as evidenc e in the trial. This sec tion sets out what is c ommonly known as the `voluntariness test`. The same test is set out in s 122(5) of the CPC, in relation to statements made by an ac c used person to polic e offic ers. 

Neither s 122(5) of the CPC, nor s 24 of the EA, apply to a statement not amounting to a c onfession, made by an ac c used to a non-polic e offic er. There is, in fac t, no statutory provision subjec ting the admissibility of suc h a statement to the requirement of voluntariness: see **Choo Pit Hong Peter v PP** <span class="citation">[1995] 2 SLR 255</span>. Thus, if suc h a statement is relevant, it would prima fac ie be admissible (see ss 516 of the EA). In general, the question of whether that statement was made voluntarily goes towards the weight to be attributed to it, rather than its admissibility. However, the c ourt retains a residual disc retion to exc lude an illegally obtained statement if it is of the view that the prejudic ial effec t of that statement outweighs its probative value: **_Choo Pit Hong Peter v PP_**. Stric tly speaking, where a c ourt is fac ed with a statement made by an ac c used person to a non-polic e offic er, whic h is relevant and admissible, and the c ourt is c ertain that the statement does not amount to a c onfession, a voir dire need not be c onduc ted. In princ iple, the question of voluntariness of suc h a statement, going to its weight, c an be determined in the c ourse of the trial through examination-in-c hief and c rossexamination. However, as a matter of prudenc e and good prac tic e, a c ourt should still c onduc t voir dires to determine the voluntariness of suc h statements. The voir dire would assist the c ourt in dec iding whether or not to exerc ise its residual disc retion to exc lude the statement. 

It is pertinent, at this point, to repeat the observations whic h I made in the rec ent c ase of **PP v Heah Lian Khin** <span class="citation">[2000] 3 SLR 609</span>. In that c ase, I was c onc erned with a similar situation, of statements made by a witness (as opposed to an ac c used person) to a CPIB offic er investigating a non-Penal Code offenc e. The prosec ution in that c ase sought to adduc e previous inc onsistent statements of a witness for the purpose of impeac hment and c ross-examination. The witness in question was not a mere witness but an ac c omplic e who was not an ac c used person in those proc eedings. Those statements, being statements made by a witness to a non-polic e offic er, also fell outside the ambit of s 122 of the CPC and s 24 of the EA. I noted, per inc uriam, that there were no statutory provisions whic h subjec ted the admissibility of a witness`s statement to the requirement of voluntariness. However, as was rec ognised in **Cheng Swee Tiang v PP** [1964] MLJ 291 , although a statement whic h has been unlawfully obtained from a witness is admissible if relevant, there is still a judic ial disc retion to disallow suc h evidenc e, if its rec eption would operate unfairly against an ac c used. Thus, I observed in **_PP v Heah Lian Kin_** : 

 84 ... To be consistent with [the] policy consideration [in Cheng Swee Tiang v PP], and as a prudent measure, the court will generally have to be satisfied as to its voluntary nature before it allows the admission of previous inconsistent statements of such witnesses. 

 85 The practice of the courts in several previous cases has been to conduct voir dires to ascertain the voluntariness and admissibility of the witnesss statement: see Rajendran s/o Kurusamy & Ors v PP <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 225</span> at 


 [para ] 103-110 and Chua Poh Kiat Anthony v PP <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 713</span> at [para ] 12-14. In the latter case, I described the voir dire as being a preliminary examination by the judge to seek to discover if the witness is telling the truth. The voluntariness of the witness statements was also a consideration in Tang Keng Boon v PP <span class="citation">[2000] 1 SLR 535</span> and Tan Khee Koon v PP <span class="citation">[1995] 3 SLR 724</span> at p 740. 

 86 I fully recognise that there was no specific discussion in those cases, of the legal basis for the requirement of voluntariness, no apparent objection having been raised to the decision to convene a voir dire. In the ultimate analysis, however, I was not prepared, at this stage, to disturb what appeared to me to be an accepted practice in the absence of full arguments by parties. 

These observations apply equally when the c ourt is fac ed with a statement, made by an ac c used to a non-polic e offic er, whic h does not amount to a c onfession. 

**_Whether the appellant`s pre-trial statements to CPIB officers amounted to `confessions`_** 

During the trial, neither the prosec ution nor the defenc e c ounsel raised the issue of whether the pretrial statements made by the appellant to CPIB offic ers, PW4 and PW5, amounted to c onfessions. They assumed that the voluntariness test applied in determining the admissibility of those statements. The distric t judge also proc eeded on that assumption, and c onvened a voir dire. Whether the two statements amounted to c onfessions was an important question in their admissibility, and I will c onsider this issue first. 

Sec tion 17(1) of the EA states: 

 An admission is a statement, oral or documentary, which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact, and which is made by any of the persons and under the circumstances hereinafter mentioned. 

Sec tion 17(2) of the EA states: 

 A confession is an admission made at any time by a person accused of any offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence. 

The meaning to be attributed to the word `c onfession` was c onsidered in the loc us c lassic us c ase of **Anandagoda v R** [1962] MLJ 289 [1962] 1 WLR 817 where Lord Guest, delivering the judgment of the Privy Counc il, stated: 

 The term admission is the genus of which confession is the species. It is not every statement which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact which is a confession, but only a statement made by a person accused of an offence whereby he states that he committed that offence or which suggests not any inference but the inference that he committed that offence. 


### ... 

 The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether to the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstances in which it was made it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or which suggested the inference that he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts ... It is not permissible in judging whether the statement is a confession to look at other facts which may not be known at the time or which may emerge in evidence at the trial. But equally it is irrelevant to consider whether the accused intended to make a confession. If the facts in the statement added together suggest the inference that the accused is guilty of the offence then it is nonetheless a confession although the accused at the same time protests his innocence ... The appropriate test in deciding whether a particular statement is a confession is whether the words of admission in the context expressly or substantially admit guilt or do they taken together in the context inferentially admit guilt? 

The above dic ta has been c onsistently applied in Singapore (see **Chin Seow Noi v PP** <span class="citation">[1994] 1 SLR 135</span> ; **_Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP_** , supra). In the c ase of **PP v Abdul Rashid** <span class="citation">[1993] 3 SLR 794</span> (c ited with approval in **Lim Young Sien v PP** <span class="citation">[1994] 2 SLR 257</span> ), the c ourt applied the **_Anandagoda_** test, and went further to observe as follows: 

 ... what s 17(2) [of the Evidence Act] purports to import, and what Anandagoda purports to signify, is that a confession need not be an unqualified expression of guilt. Under our law, it is no more than a persons statement admitting to his involvement in the offence charged in any manner or form. Be it minor or major, direct or indirect, explicit or inferential and whether in exculpation or in earnest, irrespective of its object, so long as the statement connects the accused in some way with the offence charged, it would be deemed a confession under s 17(2). 

In the present c ase, the appellant fac ed c harges under s 6(a) of the PCA, whic h states: 

 If 

 any agent corruptly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to his principals affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principals affairs or business; 

 he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both. 

Applying the objec tive test enunc iated in **_Anandagon v R_** , eac h of the appellant`s two pre-trial statements would amount to a `c onfession` of the allegations against him only if it stated or 


suggested an inferenc e that he had c orruptly ac c epted gratific ation, as an induc ement or reward for releasing the relevant information to DW2. 

I found that the appellant`s first statement fell within the meaning of the word `c onfession`, for it c ontained an admission suggesting the inferenc e that he had c ommitted the offenc e for whic h he was c harged. In that statement, he admitted that he had released the relevant information to DW2. He c laimed that he had not rec eived any c ommission for doing so, but admitted that he had taken several loans from DW2, and also that he had rec eived a `red pac ket` of $200 from DW2 in February 

1997\. Moreover, he said that he had released the relevant information to DW2 mainly bec ause DW had not c hased him to repay the loans, and that those loans remained unpaid even at the date of the statement. The term `gratific ation`, as defined under s 2 of the PCA, inc ludes the following: 

 (a) money or any gift, loan, fee, reward, commission, valuable security or other property or interest in property of any description, whether movable or immovable; 

 ... 

 (c) any payment, release, discharge or liquidation of any loan, obligation or other liability whatsoever, whether in whole or in part; 

 ... 

Clearly, the benefits whic h the appellant admitted to having rec eived from DW2 fell within the definition of `gratific ation` under the PCA. Notably, a reasonable man reading the statement on its own, without regard to extrinsic fac ts, would not say that the statement stated that the appellant was guilty, for that statement did not c ontain an admission of the requisite mens rea for an offenc e under s 6(a) of the PCA, whic h was c orrupt intent. Nonetheless, the statement, taken as a whole without referenc e to extrinsic fac ts, still suggested the inferenc e that he had c orruptly rec eived gratific ation from DW2 in return for releasing the relevant information to the latter. In **_Anandagoda_** `s c ase itself, where the appellant was c harged with murder by running over the dec eased with a motor c ar, his statements, c onsidered by themselves, c ontained no admission that he was driving the c ar in question or that if he was driving it he ran over the dec eased deliberately. Nonetheless, they were held to amount to a `c onfession` as they suggested the inferenc e that he was guilty of the allegations against him. 

I also had no doubt that the appellant`s sec ond statement amounted to a `c onfession`. In that sec ond statement, he admitted that he had released the relevant information to DW2 in return for money. He gave details as to some dates when he met DW2, and the sums of money whic h he had rec eived from DW2, as well as some of the sec ret loc ations at whic h he had met DW2 to c ollec t the money. From an objec tive point of view, the statement c ontained an inferenc e that he had c orruptly ac c epted gratific ation from DW2 in return for releasing the relevant information to the latter. Clearly, it amounted to a c onfession. 

Given my finding that both of the appellant`s statements amounted to `c onfessions`, it followed that s 24 of the EA applied to both statements. Under that sec tion, the c ourt must determine, first, whether the c onfession was made as a c onsequenc e of any induc ement, threat or promise, and sec ond, whether in making that c onfession, the ac c used did so in c irc umstanc es whic h, in the opinion of the c ourt, would have led him reasonably to suppose that he would gain some advantage for 


himself or would avoid some evil of a temporal nature to himself. 

**_Voluntariness of the appellant`s first pre-trial statement_** 

In relation to the first statement, the evidenc e led by the prosec ution was as follows: the appellant had made the statement in the c ourse of an interview with PW4 on 17 May 1999. PW4 c ommenc ed the interview with the appellant at 11.50am. At 12.50pm, they stopped for a 20 minute break. They resumed at 1.10pm and stopped again at 1.25pm. At 1.44pm, they started rec ording the statement and ended at 4.45pm. The appellant was served with lunc h of Briyani ric e and Coke at 2pm in the c ourse of his statement being rec orded. 

Ac c ording to the appellant, he was subjec ted to persistent questioning by PW4, and he had made the statement when he was `stressed and down`, just to please PW4. Based on this, the appellant`s c ounsel submitted before me that the appellant had been threatened and oppressed into making the first statement, and that the distric t judge should not have admitted it. I did not ac c ept this submission. In my judgment, the interview c onduc ted by PW4 was c learly not oppressive, either in its duration or its intensity. In c oming to my c onc lusion, I was mindful of the princ iple that the test for voluntariness must be applied in a manner whic h is partly objec tive and partly subjec tive. A statement is c onsidered to have been made involuntarily if there is objec tively a threat, induc ement or promise, and, if the threat, induc ement or promise operates subjec tively on the mind of the partic ular ac c used through hope of esc ape or fear of punishment c onnec ted with the c harge: **Dato Mokhtar bin Hashim v PP** [1983] 2 MLJ 232 ; **Md Desa bin Hashim v PP** [1995] 3 MLJ 350 ; **_Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP_** , supra. In the present c ase, I found that the first statement was `voluntary` under the objec tive limb of the voluntariness test. There was no evidenc e that oppressive c ross-examination tec hniques had been employed during the interview whic h took plac e on 17 May 1999. The only allegation was that the appellant had been subjec ted to PW4`s `persistent questioning in a rough voic e`. However, the c ourts have c onsistently held that persistent questioning, or even robust interrogation, is nec essary for the polic e proc ess and does not, without more, amount to oppression ( **Sim Ah Cheoh & Ors v PP** [1991] SLR 150 ; **Seow Choon Meng v PP** <span class="citation">[1994] 2 SLR 853</span> ; **Panya Martmontree v PP** <span class="citation">[1995] 3 SLR 341</span> ). The same c an be said for investigations by CPIB. The first statement was also `voluntary` under the subjec tive limb of the voluntariness test. The appellant himself had served as a polic e offic er for some 16 years. I agreed with the distric t judge that it was hardly probable that the appellant, being well-ac quainted with the polic e proc ess and polic e investigations, would have been oppressed or threatened by PW4`s persistent questioning into making an involuntary statement. The burden was on the prosec ution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the c onfession was made voluntarily: **Koh Aik Siew v PP** <span class="citation">[1993] 2 SLR 599</span>. To do so, it was only nec essary for the prosec ution to remove a reasonable doubt of the existenc e of the threat, induc ement or promise. It was not nec essary for the prosec ution to remove every lurking shadow of influenc e or remnants of fear: **Panya Martmontree v PP** <span class="citation">[1995] 3 SLR 341</span>. 

Counsel for the appellant also made muc h of the fac t that the appellant had been given lunc h one hour after the normal lunc h hour, at 2pm, and `only after he had given favourable answers`. The suggestion made before me was that lunc h had been withheld from the appellant for an hour, and then only given as a sort of `reward` for the favourable answers given by the appellant. I saw no merit in this submission. There was no evidenc e to suggest that lunc h had been deliberately withheld until the appellant had given favourable answers. Whenever an allegation of this nature arises, the issue is whether a defendant was under suc h degree of disc omfort as to have c aused him to make an involuntary and unreliable statement ( **_Panya Martmontree v PP_** , supra). In the present c ase, I had no doubt that the appellant was not under that extent of disc omfort. The interview c ommenc ed at 11.55pm. Shortly after, at around 1.44pm, the appellant dec ided to provide information as to his 


ac tivities and dealings with DW2. Between 11.55am and 1.44pm, the appellant had no less than two breaks from the questioning, one lasting 20 minutes and the other 15 minutes. Clearly, it had not taken muc h effort on the part of PW4 to get the appellant to c o-operate. PW4 started rec ording the appellant`s statement at 1.44pm. At 2pm, the appellant was given lunc h. This was c learly not a c ase where the ac c used was subjec ted to prolonged and intense interrogation, and was deliberately deprived of food and drink until he broke down and gave favourable answers to the investigating offic ers. Counsel for the appellant failed to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant`s first statement had been made voluntarily. I agreed with the distric t judge that, in relation to the first statement, the voluntariness test had been satisfied and that the statement was admissible as evidenc e in the trial. 

**_Voluntariness of the appellant`s second pre-trial statement_** 

As for the sec ond statement, c ounsel for the appellant argued that the appellant had made it whilst labouring under an induc ement or promise held out by the investigating offic er, PW5, that he would not be prosec uted if he gave evidenc e against DW2. This allegation had already been denied by PW at the trial. PW5 maintained throughout his testimony and c ross-examination that he had never given suc h an impression to the appellant, whether expressly or by implic ation. Instead, he had told the appellant several times that he was likely to be c harged for c orruption by CPIB. 

Notably, the distric t judge found PW5 to be a truthful and reliable witness. Nonetheless, the appellant`s c ounsel argued before me that the appellant was induc ed to believe he would benefit when he saw PW5 in the period between making his first statement and his sec ond statement. Apparently, the appellant had sought PW5 and repeatedly asked for some `assuranc e` from CPIB. In partic ular, he had gone to PW5`s offic e on 27 May 1999 and had asked PW5 for an assuranc e that he would not be c harged for c orruption if he were to stand as witness against DW2. PW5 testified that he had told the appellant that he would be c harged, and it was not CPIB`s prac tic e to give a written assuranc e to anyone. PW5 also told the appellant to get his c ounsel to write formally to PW5`s superiors in CPIB to make any representations. The following day, PW5 rec eived a letter from the appellant (D2), whic h stated: 

 1 With reference to my statement dated 17 May 1999 and my discussion with you on 26 May 1999 and 27 May 1999, I am willing to assist you further in your investigation into the affairs of one Roland Tay. 

 2 As discuss with you, if you can assist me, from being prosecuted. If you can given me a letter saying that I will not be prosecuted for any offence in connection with this investigation, I am prepared to assist you as a witness. 

The appellant`s c ounsel argues that the above exc hange and letter indic ated c learly that the appellant had been induc ed by PW5 to believe that he would benefit from making a statement, and therefore that the sec ond statement had been made involuntarily. I did not ac c ept this argument. First, c onsidering the exc hange that had taken plac e between the appellant and PW5 from an objec tive point of view, I found that PW5 had not held out any induc ement or promise to the appellant. All that he did, was to tell the appellant to get his legal c ounsel to write formally to PW5`s superiors in CIPB. That was, at best, a neutral reply, and was too vague to amount to an induc ement rendering the subsequent statement involuntary and unreliable. Notably, in **Sim Cheng Yong v PP** <span class="citation">[1994] 1 SLR 722</span> , it was alleged that the polic e offic er had told the ac c used that if the ac c used c o


operated he would assist the ac c used. Even that was held to be too vague to amount objec tively to `induc ement`, bec ause it was not spec ified in what way the polic e would assist the ac c used. 

Sec ondly, the evidenc e indic ated that at the time he made the sec ond statement to CPIB, the appellant c ould not have held the subjec tive belief that he would benefit from making the statement. He had persistently sought some written assuranc e from CPIB that he would not be prosec uted if he gave evidenc e against DW2. He never rec eived suc h written assuranc e. All he had been told, was to make formal written representations to PW5`s superiors in CPIB. Other than that, he had been told nothing else that c ould have amounted to an oral assuranc e. He wrote to PW5 on 28 May 1999, but rec eived no reply. One month later, he gave his sec ond statement. Even if he had previously held the subjec tive belief that he would benefit from making that statement, that belief was c learly nonexistent at the time he made statement, for he stated in the statement itself that: 

 I am now giving the following detailed statement concerning my involvement of corrupt practices with Roland Tay. It is also understood that I may be prosecuted for the offences committed by me. 

The appellant did not dispute that he had read over the statement after it was rec orded. He had signed and verified the truth of its c ontents. As suc h, I did not believe that he was labouring under any subjec tive belief, that he would benefit from making the statement. 

Thus, having applied the objec tive and subjec tive limbs of the voluntariness test, I agreed with the distric t judge that the sec ond statement was voluntarily made. In my judgment, the sec ond statement was properly admitted as evidenc e in the trial. 

**_The weight accorded by the district judge to the pre-trial statements_** 

The next question was the weight whic h the distric t judge had ac c orded to the appellant`s pre-trial statements, and in partic ular, the sec ond statement. Counsel for the appellant c ontended that even if the statements had been rightly admitted, the distric t judge was wrong to have based his findings of fac t on the sec ond statement. He pointed out to me that the appellant`s two pre-trial statements were inc onsistent in material aspec ts, and that the appellant had also retrac ted his statements at the trial. In the light of this, he submitted that the distric t judge had erred in his assessment of the inherent reliability and ac c urac y of the sec ond statement. 

As a starting point, it is important to bear in mind that there are many reasons other than unreliability that makes an ac c used person retrac t his c onfession. Under the law, so long as the c ourt is satisfied of its truth, a retrac ted c onfession c an be relied upon for the truth of the fac ts stated therein. In fac t, it is not nec essary for a retrac ted c onfession to be c orroborated before it c an be relied upon: **Ismail bin UK Abdul Rahman v PP** SLR 232 [1974] 2 MLJ 180 ; **Mohamed Bachu Miah & Anor v PP** <span class="citation">[1993] 1 SLR 249</span>. Therefore, although the appellant had attempted to retrac t his statements at the trial, the distric t judge was entitled to rely upon the statements. 

After assessing all the evidenc e before him, the distric t judge dec ided that the appellant`s sec ond statement c ontained the true version of events, and should be ac c orded more weight than his other evidenc e. I fully agreed with him on this. In the first plac e, I did not see the two statements as being totally irrec onc ilable. In his first statement, the appellant said that he had only taken out loans from DW2, and that he had not rec eived any c ommission in return for supplying DW2 with the relevant information. In his sec ond statement, the appellant admitted that he did rec eive payment in return for 


releasing the relevant information to DW2. In that respec t, the sec ond statement c ould be said to be c ontradic tory to the first statement. Other than that, however, the sec ond statement merely c larified some inac c urac ies in the first statement, and c ontained a more detailed ac c ount of the appellant`s dealings with DW2, whic h he had already admitted to in his first statement. In partic ular, the sec ond statement c ontained details as to the amounts of money that he had rec eived from DW2, as well as the dates and the loc ations of his meetings with DW2. Like the distric t judge, I was of the opinion that the sec ond statement c ontained the true version of evidenc e. The appellant had neither reason nor motive to fabric ate suc h an elaborate and metic ulous story inc riminating himself. Moreover, he had never repaid the so-c alled `loans` that he had mentioned in his first statement, and DW2 never pressed him for repayment of the same. These fac tors indic ated strongly that he had not borrowed the moneys at all, but had in fac t rec eived those sums as payment for supplying the relevant information to DW2. Counsel for the appellant provided no explanation as to these issues. Thus, I saw no merit in their submission that the distric t judge was wrong when he ruled that the sec ond statement c ontained the true version of evidenc e, and there was no reason for me to disturb the findings of fac t that he made, based on the sec ond statement. 

**_The district judge`s assessment of the veracity of the witnesses_** 

The third issue raised before me was that the distric t judge had erred in his assessment of the verac ity of the witnesses. Counsel for the appellant argued that the distric t judge had wrongly impeac hed the c redit of PW1. He also said that the distric t judge had no c ogent reason to disbelieve the evidenc e given by appellant and DW2 during the trial. Furthermore, he submitted that the distric t judge had not given due regard to the evidenc e of a prosec ution witness, PW3, whic h c ounsel for the appellant felt was favourable to the appellant. I will c onsider eac h c omplaint in turn. 

**_PW1`s veracity_** 

In relation to PW1, the distric t judge had ample grounds on whic h to impeac h his c redit. In PW1`s pre-trial statement to CPIB, he had stated that the appellant had told him personally that he was supplying DW2 with information on the loc ation and address of dead bodies. Yet, in c ourt, PW c hanged his testimony and disc laimed any knowledge of the dealings between the appellant and DW2. The learned judge referred to this material inc onsistenc y in his written grounds, and he was entitled to impeac h PW1`s c redit. 

**_The appellant`s veracity_** 

Upon his two pre-trial statements being admitted, the appellant c ame fac e to fac e with the glaring inc onsistenc ies and disc repanc ies in his own evidenc e. Initially, in his first statement to CPIB, he admitted that he had supplied DW2 with the relevant information, but denied having rec eived any c ommission for the arrangement. He c laimed that he had taken loans from DW2. A few days after making that statement, he made a statutory dec laration retrac ting all that he had said previously in the first statement. Following this, he gave a sec ond statement to CPIB, giving a detailed ac c ount of the oc c asions when he had rec eived payment from DW2 in return for the information, as well as some of their meeting plac es and the amounts that he had rec eived. He also admitted that the two soc alled `loans` of $2,000 eac h ($4,000 in total) were in fac t payments whic h he rec eived in February 1996 and September 1996 for information that he had supplied to DW2. Finally, at the trial itself, he reverted to the stanc e in the statutory dec laration, and denied everything. He had fluc tuated between c onfessions and c omplete denials of the allegations against him his c redit was c learly 


c alled into question. Thus, the distric t judge had ample grounds to c onc lude that the appellant was an unreliable witness, and he was entitled to rejec t the appellant`s evidenc e in c ourt. 

**_DW2`s veracity_** 

At the trial, DW2 stated that the appellant had never given him any spec ific addresses or names of the dec eased persons, but had merely c onfirmed the loc ations of some of the dead bodies. He said that he had disc overed the loc ations of those bodies from other sourc es, and after c onfirming the same with the appellant, he would go to the loc ation and trac k down the next-of-kin through his own efforts. He also denied ever having extended monies to the appellant, whether by way of a loan or in payment for any information. 

At the appeal, c ounsel for the appellant raised a proc edural objec tion that the distric t judge had failed to make a c lear ruling as to DW2`s c redit at the trial. The prosec ution had made an applic ation under s 147 of the EA to impeac h DW2`s c redit. Following **Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP** <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 592</span> at p 604, the distric t judge should have made a ruling on the impeac hment, if not at the end of the impeac hment exerc ise, then at the c lose of the c ase together with the rest of the evidenc e tendered. Thus, the proc edural objec tion raised by the appellant`s c ounsel was well-founded. Nevertheless, this proc edural irregularity was a minor one, and it did not c ause any prejudic e to the appellant. Sec tion 396 of the CPC states: 

 Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained, no finding, sentence or order passed or made by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered on account of 

 (a) any error, omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant, charge, judgment or other proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other proceeding under this Code; 

 ... 

In addressing the question whether there was any failure or misc arriage of justic e or whether a c onvic tion was unsafe, the c ourt will ask itself the subjec tive question of whether it was c ontent to allow the verdic t to stand, or whether there was some lurking doubt that an injustic e had been done to the appellant: **Tan Choon Huat v PP** [1991] SLR 805. I had no doubt whatsoever that the proc edural irregularity had not oc c asioned a failure of justic e in the present c ase. As suc h, it was appropriate for me to overlook it. 

**_Evidence of PW_** 

Counsel for the appellant submitted before me that the distric t judge had erred, in that he had not given any c onsideration to the evidenc e of PW3. At the trial, PW3 testified as follows: her father had died at home on 21 Marc h 1997 and that she had c alled the polic e. Two polic e offic ers c ame to her plac e, followed by two medic al offic ers, then an inspec tor and a photographer. Shortly thereafter, two undertakers arrived, and then two more. She was unable to identify any of these persons at the trial, as they were all strangers to her and the inc ident had taken plac e so long ago. She had not been told how the undertakers had learnt of her father`s death so quic kly. All she c ould establish, 


was that she had met her friend, one Sally Ho, at the mortuary the following day, and had learnt from Sally that two of the undertakers who had sought her out ac tually worked for Sally`s c ompany. The link whic h the prosec ution was trying to establish via PW3`s evidenc e was simply that at the relevant time, Sally Ho was helping DW2 in his undertaking business, and that they had rec eived the requisite information pertaining to PW3`s father`s death and were able to quic kly solic it PW3`s business. The allegation was that the appellant had been the polic e hearse driver in c harge of transporting PW3`s father`s body, and that he had released the information pertaining to that polic e c ase to DW2. Beyond that, PW3`s evidenc e added nothing more to the c ase at hand. The fac t that she c ould not identify the appellant was, in my judgment, neither favourable nor unfavourable to him. Consequently, the distric t judge had not erred in not alluding to PW3`s evidenc e in his written grounds. Her evidenc e was largely superfluous anyway. 

**_Whether the supply of the relevant information constituted a `showing of favour in relation to the principal`s affairs`_** 

The last issue raised in the appeal was that the prosec ution had not shown an essential element of the c harges against the appellant, namely that he had `shown favour in relation to his princ ipal`s affairs`. To establish the c harges against the appellant under s 6(a) of the PCA, the prosec ution had to show (i) that there was an ac c eptanc e of gratific ation by the appellant, (ii) as an induc ement or reward, (iii) that there was an objec tive c orrupt element in the transac tion, and (iv) that there was a subjec tive c orrupt intent in the transac tion in that the appellant had ac c epted the gratific ation with guilty knowledge ( **Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP** <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 592</span> ; **Tan Tze Chye v PP** <span class="citation">[1997] 1 SLR 134</span> ; **PP v Har Su Meng** <span class="citation">[1997] 3 SLR 332</span> ). Based on the findings of fac t made by the distric t judge, the prosec ution had c learly established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had ac c epted gratific ation from DW2 as a reward in return for releasing the relevant information to the latter. Counsel for the appellant argued before me that, even if the appellant had supplied the relevant information to DW2 for a monetary reward, this ac t did not c onstitute the `showing of favour` in relation to the Polic e Forc e`s affairs. He argued that this ac t had nothing to do with the appellant`s job as a polic e hearse driver, and that the appellant had not thereby c ompromised his offic ial duties. 

In effec t, the point being c anvassed by the appellant`s c ounsel, was that there had been no objec tively c orrupt element in the transac tion. Whether a transac tion is tainted with an objec tively c orrupt element is an inquiry based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man, keeping in mind the natural and ordinary meaning of the word `c orrupt` ( **Chan Wing Seng v PP** <span class="citation">[1997] 2 SLR 427</span> ). Eac h c ase turns on its own partic ular fac ts. Counsel for the appellant drew my attention to the c ase of **PP v Low Tiong Choon** <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 878</span>. In that c ase, the ac c used, who was a polic e offic er on duty at the Subordinate Courts, had introduc ed a c lient to a lawyer (who happened to be an exdistric t judge), and had rec eived $500 in return. The c lient he introduc ed was a person c harged with drunk driving and whom he had met in the c ourse of his duties. The distric t judge found that the ac c used`s c onduc t was c learly improper and in breac h of the Polic e Code, and probably the subjec t of internal disc iplinary ac tion by the polic e. However she held that the c onduc t in question, although improper, did not c onstitute c orruption. Her dec ision was upheld on appeal. 

The c ase of **_Low Tiong Choon_** was c learly distinguishable from the present c ase on its fac ts. In the first plac e, that c ase involved a one-off inc ident. Sec ondly, it was the c lient who had approac hed the ac c used and asked the ac c used to help him by rec ommending a lawyer to him. There was no evidenc e to indic ate that the ac c used had ac tively solic ited c lients for the lawyer. Moreover, it was found that the ac c used had not ac tually c ompromised the performanc e of his offic ial polic e duties, for he had not shown either favour or disfavour to the c lient despite having introduc ed him to a lawyer. 


Thus, there was no objec tive c orrupt element in the ac c used`s ac tions, although his c onduc t involved the potential for abuse of his position. In c ontrast, the fac ts of the present c ase were very different. This was not a c ase where a polic e offic er c ommitted a one-off inc ident of `harmless moonlighting`, by merely seizing an opportunity to make money that had c ome his way. Based on the findings of fac t made by the distric t judge, the appellant had approac hed DW2 on his own ac c ord, and spec ific ally bec ause he was in need of financ ial aid. He had released the relevant information to DW2 on no less than 14 oc c asions, over a period of about one and a half years. By ac c epting money from DW2, he had plac ed himself in a position beholden to DW2. The information was c onfidential, and the appellant knew this he stated in the c ourse of his c ross-examination that he knew suc h information to be c onfidential. He had c learly abused his position and he knew it. Counsel for the appellant pointed out that the prosec ution had failed to adduc e any doc umentary evidenc e, in the form of internal rules or Polic e Standing Orders, to support their allegation that the relevant information was c onfidential. Notably, the distric t judge had believed the evidenc e of PW2, who was the offic er-inc harge of the Patrol Unit attac hed to Tanglin Polic e Division. PW2 testified that the information rec eived by hearse drivers in the c ourse of their duty, suc h as the names and addresses and loc ations of the dec eased persons and the c ontac t numbers and names of the next-of-kin, was all c onfidential information, and was not to be disc losed unless c learanc e from superiors had been obtained. He had no reason to lie on oath and his evidenc e was not c hallenged by the defenc e c ounsel at the trial. In any event, the appellant had himself admitted in the c ourse of his c rossexamination that he knew suc h information to be c onfidential. In the light of this, it was not open for the appellant`s c ounsel to say at the appeal that the relevant information was not c onfidential, or indeed, that the appellant had not been aware that he was releasing c onfidential information. 

In the c ase of **Mohamed Ali bin Mohamed Iqbal v PP** SLR 447 [1979] 2 MLJ 58 , the appellant, who was an Immigration Offic er attac hed to the Singapore Airport, was c harged and c onvic ted for offenc es under s 6(a) of the PCA. As an Immigration Offic er, his duties inc luded the c hec king of inc oming passengers` passports and their Disembarkation Forms. In return for a fee, he supplied two lists c ontaining c onfidential information about the name, plac e of stay and duration of stay of inc oming passengers to a sales promotion offic er employed by a shopping c entre. At the appeal, the argument was that the appellant`s ac ts, namely, c opying the information c ontained in the Disembarkation Forms and passing the information to a third party who had no dealings with the appellant`s princ ipal, the Government, c ould not amount to ac ts done by the appellant in relation to his princ ipal`s affairs. It was argued that what the appellant did was something wholly outside the affairs or business of his princ ipal, and that ac c ordingly he had been wrongly c onvic ted under s 6(a) of the PCA. This argument was rejec ted as being unsound, and his appeal dismissed. The former Chief Justic e, Wee Chong Jin, pointed out in his written judgment that the words `in relation to his princ ipal`s affairs` fell to be widely c onstrued, and for a c onvic tion under s 6(a) of the PCA, it need not be proved that the ac ts done by a person were done by him as an agent on behalf of his princ ipal. He stated that the c onditions prec edent to an offenc e under that sec tion was proof, inter alia, that the person c harged was an agent as defined and what he did was in relation to his princ ipal`s affairs or business. Reverting to the c ase before me, I found that the appellant fell squarely within the meaning of the word `agent`, whic h is defined in s 2 of the PCA to mean any person employed by or ac ting for another, inc luding, inter alia, a person serving the Government or under any public body. The appellant`s ac t of releasing c onfidential information obtained in the c ourse of his offic ial duties were c learly ac ts whic h were in relation to the Polic e Forc e`s affairs. I also found that the appellant had c learly shown favour to DW2 by releasing the relevant information in polic e c ases to DW2, he was in effec t supplying DW2 with a c onstant flow of c lients (ie the family members of dec eased persons in polic e c ases) in return for a fee. 

As a polic e offic er, the appellant`s duties were part of the whole polic e proc ess. The nature of polic e work, espec ially c ases involving dec eased persons, is extremely sensitive, and there is great public 


interest in ensuring that the information pertaining to the dec eased persons should remain c onfidential until suc h time as the polic e deems fit to release the information into the public domain. I had no doubt that the appellant had c ompromised his duties as a polic e offic er. By his c onduc t of trading c onfidential information for a fee, he enabled the undertakers to rapidly desc end on the sc ene of the polic e c ase, and this was surely detrimental to the polic e`s efforts to c arry out their tasks. For example, in the c ase of PW3`s father`s death, it had apparently taken only an hour for the undertakers to arrive at PW3`s home, and ac c ording to PW3, the undertakers had arrived at the sc ene when the polic e were still around. The appellant`s c onduc t undermined the investigative system of the Polic e Forc e. Without question, this was a c ase that went beyond mere internal polic e disc iplinary ac tion for improper c onduc t. Criminal sanc tion was warranted. Thus, I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against c onvic tion. 

**_Sentence_** 

Under s 6(a) of the PCA, the appellant c ould have been imprisoned for a term of up to five years, or fined up to $100,000, or both. The distric t judge sentenc ed him to nine months` imprisonment on eac h of the 14 c harges, with only the first two sentenc es running c onsec utively. 

I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against sentenc e, as the sentenc e passed by the distric t judge was not manifestly exc essive in the c irc umstanc es. Indeed, there were aggravating fac tors in this c ase, whic h justified the term of 18 months` imprisonment that he had rec eived. First, his c ulpability was exac erbated by the fac t that he was a law enforc ement offic er. Sec ondly, he had released information whic h he himself knew to be c onfidential, and whic h he had obtained in the c ourse of public duty, and whic h related direc tly to his offic ial duties as a polic e hearse driver. Thirdly, he had c ommitted the offenc es over a lengthy period of time, spanning some one and a half years. He had c eased to c ontinue c ommitting the offenc e, not out of a realisation of guilt, but bec ause he had been promoted to the rank of Polic e Sergeant and was no longer the designated polic e hearse driver privy to the relevant information. Fourthly, the amount of gratific ation involved was alleged to be in the range of about $10,900. This was a substantial amount. This sum was not ac tually proved c onc retely by the prosec ution, but it was based on the appellant`s own admissions in his sec ond pre-trial statement to CPIB. In view of these fac tors, an adequate term of imprisonment must be passed in order to deter other polic e offic ers from ac ts of the same nature. 

## Outcome: 

Appeal dismissed.
