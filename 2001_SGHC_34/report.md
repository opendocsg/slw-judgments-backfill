: The appellant was c harged with three c ounts eac h of harbouring an immigration offender under s 57(1)(d) of the Immigration Ac t (Cap 133). At the end of the trial, Distric t Judge Irene Wu c onvic ted the appellant of all three c harges and sentenc ed her to the mandatory minimum of six months` imprisonment on eac h c harge, with two of the sentenc es ordered to run c onsec utively. The appellant appealed against her c onvic tion only. After hearing c ounsel from both sides, I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons. 

**_Background facts_** 

On 18 Oc tober 1999, a polic e raid was c onduc ted at a two-storey shophouse situated at 78A Dunlop Street (`the premises`). Ten men were arrested during the raid, nine of whom were later asc ertained to be immigration offenders. Amongst the nine were Jayaram (PW1), Palani (PW2) and Elangovan (PW3), the three Indian nationals named in eac h of the three c harges against the appellant respec tively. The men were subsequently c onvic ted and duly sentenc ed for entering Singapore illegally. After serving out their prison sentenc es, they remained in Singapore temporarily on spec ial passes pending the disposal of the present c ase. 

The premises c omprised two levels. The upper level c ontained three bedrooms, a toilet, a bathroom and a kitc hen, while the rear portion of the lower level was used by the appellant for her beauty parlour business. The front portion, it appeared, was used as a hair dressing salon or barber shop at the material time. The legal tenant of the entire premises was one Sattish Chander (DW2) (`Sattish`), the appellant`s ex-husband whom she divorc ed in 1998. Sattish was ordered to pay the appellant maintenanc e following their divorc e but was unable to do so and as suc h allowed her to use the lower level for her business in lieu of maintenanc e payments from him. 

**_The prosecution`s case_** 

The thrust of the prosec ution`s c ase c ame from the testimonies of Jayaram, Palani and Elangovan, the substanc e of whic h was in all material respec ts similar. All three gave evidenc e that they had approac hed the appellant at her shop on the lower level of the premises some time in or around September 1999 and asked if she had rooms available for rent. On all three oc c asions, she replied that she had, and that the rent was $100 per month for eac h of them. Subsequently, the three men stayed in eac h of the three bedrooms on the sec ond level of the premises, and paid the monthly rent 


of $100 to the appellant direc tly. This arrangement c ontinued for around one and a half to two months until the men were arrested on 18 Oc tober 1999. 

The men further gave evidenc e that during their stay at the premises, the appellant would c ome up to the sec ond level oc c asionally to c hec k that everything was in order. She also told the men or their other roommates staying at the premises, who were mostly Indian nationals, what they c ould and c ould not do. In partic ular, she told them that they were not allowed to drink, gamble or bring friends bac k to the premises. Further, they were also told not to use the front entranc e on the lower level too frequently as that was meant for c ustomers. Instead, they were to use the bac k entranc e of the shophouse as far as possible. The appellant however gave them permission to c ook and to do their laundry in the c ommon kitc hen and bathroom on the upper level, whic h they did. 

The appellant never c hec ked nor did she ask to see the passports of any of the three men. She asked to see Jayaram`s work permit some 20 days after he had stayed at the premises in response to whic h he showed her a photoc opy of someone else`s work permit. With respec t to Elangovan, she asked for his work permit at the time when he first approac hed her for a room. Some days later, he handed a photoc opy of a forged work permit to a friend to show to the appellant but did not know if his friend ever did so. 

All three men denied knowing one Ramasanthern Annamalai Ramac handran or `Roc ky`, a man alleged by the defenc e to have sub-leased the whole of the upper level of the premises from Sattish. The men were adamant, when shown a photograph of `Roc ky`, that they had never seen or heard of him before. They also denied having ever seen Abdul Wahab (DW2) (`Wahab`), a man the defenc e alleged ran the barber shop situated in the front portion of the lower level of the premises at the material time. On the other hand, all three men rec ognised Sattish and were able to identify him as the appellant`s husband. This was either bec ause the appellant had c asually pointed him out to them during their stay at the premises, or they had learnt about his status from the other Indian nationals who stayed on the premises. Their evidenc e however was that they had seen Sattish at the premises on at most only two oc c asions and they had never spoken to him nor he to them. 

**_The defence_** 

The appellant was a 45-year-old divorc ee with four c hildren. After her divorc e from Sattish, he allowed her to utilise the lower level of the premises for her business. From there, the appellant operated a beauty parlour as well as prac tised homeopathy. She was also a part-time property agent. 

The mainstay of the appellant`s defenc e was essentially that it was `Roc ky` who had rented out the rooms on the upper level to the immigration offenders. She produc ed what she alleged was a tenanc y agreement between `Roc ky` and Sattish dated 20 July 1999 (`the tenanc y agreement`) in whic h the latter agreed to sub-let the upper level of the premises to the former for a period of two years c ommenc ing from 1 August 1999. The agreement was purportedly witnessed by Wahab. 

Ac c ording to the appellant, there were already three men oc c upying the rooms on the upper level before `Roc ky` sub-leased it from Sattish. They were a Singaporean c alled Mic hael, an Indian with a valid work permit c alled Farok, and a spec ial pass holder who stayed for only two weeks. 

The appellant denied knowledge of how the illegal immigrants c ame to reside at the premises. She also denied ever giving instruc tions to the three prosec ution witnesses as to what they c ould or c ould not do on the premises, or that she ever c ollec ted any rent from them. She said however that `Roc ky` had asked her to help him sourc e for tenants, as a result of whic h she had plac ed a notic e on the 


glass door outside the shop advertising rooms and offic e spac e for rent as well as her c ontac t numbers. In response, two Indian nationals whose names she c ould not remember approac hed her for rooms, and she c ollec ted a deposit from them whic h she passed to `Roc ky` who in turn paid her a c ommission. The appellant did not c hec k the men`s papers as she did not think it was her responsibility to do so. She told `Roc ky` to c ome and see the men on the date that they were moving in and thereafter had no further dealings with them. 

The appellant further alleged that she did not talk to the persons who lived on the upper level. No one knew of her relationship with Sattish exc ept `Roc ky` and the barber Wahab. She also insisted that she did not have c ontrol over the upper level nor c ould she dec ide who stayed there. Likewise she did not see or c hec k the passports and work permits of any of the persons living on the upper level save for Mic hael and Farok. During the relevant period from September 1999 to Oc tober 1999, she never went upstairs, even when she heard loud or unusual noises there, as it was not her duty to c hec k. With regard to the c ollec tion of rent, she stated that she c ollec ted rent only when `Roc ky` was not present, and even then only from Mic hael and Farok and no one else. At this point, the prosec ution applied to impeac h the appellant`s c redit on the ground that she had made a previous inc onsistent statement to the polic e to the effec t that `Roc ky` had given her permission to allow the Indian nationals to stay on the upper level, that she had c ollec ted rent on behalf of Roc ky, and that she had photoc opied and c hec ked their work permits. The appellant c hallenged the admissibility of the statement on the ground that she had given it under pressure. After a voir dire, the trial judge ruled that the statement was made by the appellant voluntarily. However, she held that the appellant`s c redit was not impeac hed as she was able to give a satisfac tory explanation of the material disc repanc ies between her statement to the polic e and her testimony in c ourt. 

The defenc e also c alled Wahab to testify. His evidenc e was essentially that he worked as a barber in the front portion of the lower level of the premises during the relevant period and that he had rented the spac e from Sattish. He did not know, however, if there was anyone living upstairs at that time. 

The third and last witness for the defenc e was Sattish. He gave evidenc e that prior to renting the upper level to `Roc ky`, he had rented it to three other persons introduc ed to him by the appellant. The appellant also subsequently introduc ed `Roc ky` to him and he paid her c ommissions for all the introduc tions. He asserted that the appellant did not help him to manage the premises nor did he authorise her to ac t on his behalf in his absenc e. When asked if he knew that the appellant allowed people to stay at the premises, he replied that she had to inform him as he was the legal tenant who had c ontrol. He later c larified that he meant c ontrol of the lower level only as the upper level had been rented to `Roc ky` and as suc h any dec ision to sub-let the rooms upstairs lay with the latter. 

**_The decision below_** 

The trial judge ac c epted the evidenc e of the prosec ution witnesses. She found that they had no reason or inc entive to frame or implic ate the appellant, and that their evidenc e was c lear and c onsistent throughout. On the other hand, she found the defenc e story about `Roc ky` to be unc onvinc ing. She did not ac c ept that Roc ky had rented the upper level as none of the prosec ution witnesses rec ognised him or had heard of him. Moreover, the tenanc y agreement purportedly made between `Roc ky` and Sattish and witnessed by Wahab was also of a dubious nature. 

The trial judge further held that the main issue in this c ase was who had c ontrol of the premises and the rent. In this regard, she again ac c epted the prosec ution witnesses` evidenc e that it was the appellant who had given them permission to stay, who had informed them of the rent and subsequently c ollec ted it from them, and who had laid down the rules for their stay. In addition, the 


appellant had also visited the upper level at least four to six times between September and Oc tober 1999 to c hec k on the number of persons sleeping there and to see that the plac e was neat. The appellant was thus ac tively involved in c ontrolling the number of persons oc c upying the upper level. In the c irc umstanc es, the trial judge had no hesitation in rejec ting the defenc e that she did not know that the prosec ution witnesses resided on the upper level. She held that the appellant had indeed given shelter to the three men, thus triggering the presumption under s 57(7) of the Immigration Ac t (Cap 133). On the evidenc e, the trial judge found that the appellant had not rebutted the presumption as she had failed to make further enquiries of the men, save for asking to see two of their work permits, and c onvic ted her ac c ordingly. 

**_The appeal_** 

Counsel for the appellant did not c hallenge the trial judge`s findings of fac t at the hearing before me. His only c ontention was one of law, namely, that the appellant was not a `harbourer` within the meaning of s 57(1)(d) of the Immigration Ac t as she was neither the owner nor tenant of the premises. As suc h, c ounsel argued that she c ould not have been the person who `in reality` gave shelter to the three men. This person c ould only either have been Sattish, or the owner of the premises. The appellant, c ounsel urged, was merely a property agent who had sourc ed for the tenants and, as suc h, c ould at most only be said to have been an abettor rather than the harbourer herself. As the c harge proffered against her was for the princ ipal offenc e, c ounsel argued that it was bad in law, and that it was now too late in the day to substitute the c harge with one of abetment for whic h the presumption in favour of the prosec ution in s 57(7) would not apply, as the defenc e at the trial had been wholly direc ted at attempting to show that the appellant had not harboured the three illegal immigrants. 

**_The law_** 

The main provisions I had to deal with in this c ase were ss 57((1)(d) and 57(7) of the Immigration Ac t (`the Ac t`), whic h state as follows: 

 57 (1) Any person who (d) harbours any person who has ac ted in c ontravention of the provisions of this Ac t or the regulations; shall be guilty of an offenc e and 


 (ii) subjec t to subsec tion (1A), in the c ase of an offenc e under paragraph (b), (d) or (e), shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 6 months and not more than 2 years and shall also be liable to a fine not exc eeding $6,000; ... (7) Where, in any proc eedings for an offenc e under subsec tion (1)(d), it is proved that the defendant has given shelter to any person who has remained in Singapore unlawfully for a period exc eeding 90 days after the expiration of any pass issued to him or who has entered Singapore in c ontravention of sec tion 5(1) or 6(1), it shall be presumed, until the c ontrary is proved, that the defendant has harboured him knowing him to be a person who has ac ted in c ontravention of the provisions of this Ac t or the regulations. 

The term `harbour` in s 57(1)(d) is in turn defined in s 2 of the Ac t as meaning: 

 to give food or shelter , and includes the act of assisting a person in any way to evade apprehension. [Emphasis mine.] 

In **Lee Boon Leong Joseph v PP** <span class="citation">[1997] 1 SLR 445</span> , I held that giving `shelter` means providing some form of habitation to the immigration offender. Before the presumption in s 57(7) c an the triggered therefore, the prosec ution has to show that the ac c used provided a plac e of habitation to the offenders with the intention or knowledge that they would inhabit that plac e and that they in fac t did so. I reiterated this view in the subsequent c ase of **Lim Dee Chew v PP** <span class="citation">[1997] 3 SLR 956</span> , in whic h I held that harbouring required a positive ac t of providing shelter or food. I stated further, at p 


965    of that c ase, that: 

 [t]he person who provides the shelter or food (the harbourer) may not necessarily be the owner of the premises. In many cases the owner of the premises may rent the premises to a tenant who in turn may rent it to a subtenant. If the sub-tenant turns out to be an illegal immigrant, it cannot be that in all cases the owner of the premises will be held as the person who harboured the illegal immigrant. In my opinion this would depend on the facts of each particular case and the agreement which the owner of the premises had with the tenant. 

And further down in the judgment, I said: 

 ... Therefore, on the whole, to determine who the harbourer is, we have to determine who is the person who in reality provides the shelter to the illegal immigrant. This would be by determining who was in control of the premises and the rent. 

**_Whether the appellant was a `harbourer`_** 

The only issue I had to deal with in this appeal was really the question of whether or not a non-owner oc c upier of premises c an be found guilty of harbouring illegal immigrants found on those premises. It is c lear from the above propositions derived from the earlier c ases that the person providing the shelter or food to the immigration offender need not nec essarily be the owner of the premises. While in **_Lim Dee Chew_** I referred only to landlords and tenants as the other c andidates who c ould potentially be found to be `harbourers`, c learly that referenc e was not meant to be exhaustive for there is nothing in the Ac t whic h c onfines the c lasses of persons who c ould potentially be found to be `harbourers` to persons who have proprietary interests in the property only. The definition of the term `harbour` in the Ac t as set out above is c lear and unambiguous. Where the wording of a statute is c lear and unequivoc al, any referenc e to the Parliamentary debates behind the passing of that statutory provision is unnec essary and in fac t, impermissible. As suc h, I found c ounsel`s lengthy disc ourse on Hansard and its purported dec larations that 57(1)(d) was intended to be targetted at owners and/or landlords only to be wholly inappropriate and of no help to his c lient`s c ase whatsoever. In my view, any positive ac t of giving shelter in the form of providing habitation to an immigration offender by any person whomsoever falls squarely within the c lear statutory definition of the word `harbour`, and there is nothing in that definition whic h restric ts the c lasses of persons intended to be c aught by it to owners, landlords and tenants, whic h words do not even appear in the definition. Indeed if it was thought that Parliament had meant for the sec tion to be limited to owners, landlords and tenants only, then it was open to them to simply state that this was the c ase, but they did not do so. As suc h, I am of the view that even mere lic ensees or oc c upiers like the appellant who do not have any proprietary interest in the property are c apable of being found to be `harbourers`, provided it c an be proved that they had done a positive ac t of providing habitation to the illegal immigrants in question. In my opinion, it is unnec essary to lay down fixed or c losed c ategories of persons to whic h the sec tion applies. In every c ase, it is a question of fac t whether or not the partic ular ac c used`s ac tions satisfy the plain meaning of the words `harbour` and `giving shelter` as set out in the Ac t. I see no c ompelling reason why the c ourts should unnec essarily narrow the sc ope of a piec e of legislation whic h was c learly intended by Parliament to operate as a stric t weapon to c ombat the rising trend of illegal immigration and its many attendant soc ial problems. In partic ular, the provisions in the Ac t on harbouring were aimed spec ific ally at making the proc urement of ac c ommodation by 


illegal immigrants extremely diffic ult, if not impossible. 

Returning to the fac ts of this c ase, I had no doubt that the appellant`s ac tions more than amply satisfied the definition of `harbour` in the Ac t. On the fac ts as found by the trial judge, it was c lear that the appellant was the one who had allowed or permitted the three prosec ution witnesses to stay on the upper level of the premises. They had approac hed her for ac c ommodation, and she had provided them with rooms to stay in, whic h they did for a period of some one and a half to two months. She further not only stipulated the rent amount but also c ollec ted the rent from them every month. Her evidenc e that she had c ollec ted the rent on behalf of `Roc ky` was disbelieved by the trial judge and no other evidenc e was produc ed by the defenc e to show that the appellant had c ollec ted the rent on behalf of any other person. Her position was thus different from that of the agent Goh See Hoc k in **_Lim Dee Chew_** `s c ase, who had been spec ific ally instruc ted to c ollec t the rent from the overstayer by the owner of the premises, ie the ac c used in that c ase. In the result, I was left with the only c onc lusion obvious to me in the present c ase that the appellant had in this c ase c ollec ted the rent for and on behalf of herself only. That she was c learly in c harge and in c ontrol of the premises was also not in doubt as she was the one who gave the men their instruc tions on what they c ould and c ould not do on the premises, inc luding whic h entranc e they c ould and c ould not use, as well as c hec ked on them regularly to see that everything was in order. In the light of all these c irc umstanc es, I c ould not see how the appellant c ould dispute that she had `in reality` provided shelter in the form of habitation, residenc e, oc c upanc y and ac c ommodation to the three men. 

A separate, rec urrent strand of argument tirelessly put forth by c ounsel at the hearing before me was that the appellant was but a mere agent for Sattish, who was the true harbourer in this c ase, and as suc h, the appellant c ould at most only be found to be guilty of abetment and not of the princ ipal offenc e of harbouring itself. Respec tfully, I c ould not agree with c ounsel. In the first plac e, there was no evidenc e whatsoever that the appellant was but a mere property agent who served as a c onduit or middleman between Sattish, the legal tenant of the premises, and the three Indian nationals, the sub-tenants. On the c ontrary, the evidenc e of the three prosec ution witnesses was that they only saw Sattish on one or two oc c asions throughout their entire stay at the premises and had never spoken to him. Further, the appellant did not at any time tell them that she was c ollec ting the rent from them on behalf of Sattish. More pertinently, Sattish himself, a witness for the defenc e, denied knowing that the three men resided on the premises during the relevant period. It was patently obvious to me therefore that the appellant was quite c learly muc h more than the equivalent of a mere desk-c lerk at a hotel as her c ounsel sought to make her out to be. While a mere desk-c lerk c ould not keep the rates paid by the hotel`s guests, it was plain that the appellant in this c ase kept the full rent of $100 whic h she c ollec ted from eac h of the three Indian nationals for herself. She thus obtained a profit and benefited direc tly from letting the men stay on the premises, typifying the form of self-enric hment that the stringent immigration laws were prec isely designed to avoid. Further, Sattish`s bare assertion that the appellant did not have c ontrol of the premises bec ause he retained c ontrol of it flew direc tly in the fac e of the evidenc e given by the prosec ution witnesses that the appellant c ould offer them rooms to stay, on the spot, without having to first c onfer with or seek the approval of Sattish or anyone else for that matter. Moreover, the appellant also laid the ground rules for the men staying on the premises, as well as c onduc ted regular c hec ks on the number of persons staying at any one time. Clearly her duties went way beyond that of a property or housing agent, whose duties one would realistic ally imagine, c eases the moment the tenanc y c ommenc es and its terms are finalised. In the c irc umstanc es, I c ould not ac c ept c ounsel`s argument that the appellant`s role was but that of a mere property agent. 

In any event, I was of the view that c ounse`s attempts to pin the blame on, or to impute liability for the harbouring of the immigration offenders to, Sattish were wholly ill-c onc eived. While Sattish may well satisfy the statutory definition of `harbour` and be found guilty of the offenc e of harbouring 


depending on whether or not he knew or was otherwise aware of the presenc e of the illegal immigrant tenants, this did not prevent the appellant from similarly satisfying the same definition and being found guilty of the same offenc e. There is nothing in the Ac t whic h states that there c an at any one time only be one `harbourer`. Nevertheless, whether or not Sattish qualifies as a `harbourer` within the statutory definition was not the issue in this c ase. Sattish was not the person on trial here and, as suc h, it was not the duty of the trial judge or myself to make a finding on whether or not he c ould be said to have harboured the three Indian nationals. What was pertinent was whether or not the appellant c ame within the statutory definition, and as I have said, there is nothing in the statute whic h prevents two or more persons from being harbourers of the same immigration offenders at the same time. As suc h, c ounsel`s attempts to shift the blame onto Sattish alone was c learly futile and not helpful to his c lient`s c ause. 

In the light of the above c irc umstanc es, I had no doubt that the prosec ution had more than amply proven that the appellant had given shelter to the three immigration offenders within the meaning of s 57(7) of the Ac t. The prosec ution was thus given the benefit of the presumption in that sec tion and was ac c ordingly absolved from having to prove mens rea. Instead, the burden now lay on the appellant to prove on a balanc e of probabilities that she did not know or c ould not reasonably have known that the three men were immigration offenders. This she c ould suc c eed in doing only if she c ould show that she had satisfied the test of due diligenc e in s 57(10) of the Ac t, whic h inter alia, requires the ac c used to c hec k the partic ulars c ontained in the immigrant`s original work permit against that in the original c opy of his passport. 

The appellant did not lead any evidenc e in the c ourt below to show that she had performed the due diligenc e c hec ks stipulated in s 57(10). She was c ontent at the trial stage to attempt to disprove only the fac t of harbouring, and the entire line of defenc e was thus never direc ted towards seeking to disc harge the presumption of knowledge in s 57(7). As suc h, I found that the appellant had c learly not suc c eeded in disc harging that presumption. Indeed it was plain from the prosec ution witnesses` evidenc e that the appellant had failed to c lear even the first hurdle of asking to see the men`s original passports and work permits. 

**_Conclusion_** 

In the light of the foregoing, I saw no reason to disturb the trial judge`s dec ision, and dismissed the appeal ac c ordingly. 

## Outcome: 

Appeal dismissed.
