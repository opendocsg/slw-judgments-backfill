3 January 2017 

**Valerie Thean JC:** 

1       These grounds of dec ision c onc ern matters anc illary upon divorc e. 

**Introduction** 

2       The plaintiff (“the Husband”), and the defendant (“the Wife”), were married on 12 Marc h 1980. [note: 1] The Husband is 63 years old, the Wife is 59 years old. [note: 2] On 14 September 2012, the 

Husband c ommenc ed divorc e proc eedings against the Wife and obtained an interim judgment (“IJ”) for 

divorc e on the ground of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour on 28 January 2013. [note: 3] Up to that point, parties had been married for some 33 years. The parties have a 19 year old daughter (“the 

Child”), [note: 4] who will be c ompleting her polytec hnic educ ation in 2017. 

3       This ac tion was c ommenc ed by the Husband on 14 September 2012. The Wife did not at that time partic ipate in proc eedings. The Husband obtained the IJ on 28 January 2013, and a first set of 

anc illary orders in the High Court on 26 June 2013. [note: 5] On 27 Oc tober 2015, pursuant to the Wife’s applic ation, the first set of anc illary orders were set aside by the High Court judge who made the first set of anc illary orders, with c osts reserved to the hearing of the anc illary matters. 

4       On 19 Oc tober 2016 I dealt with: (a) division of the matrimonial assets; (b) maintenanc e for the Wife; (c ) c ustody of the Child; and (d) c osts. The Husband has appealed and I furnish my grounds of dec ision. 

**Division of assets** 

**_The pool of matrimonial assets_** 


5       The agreed operative date used for determining the pool of matrimonial assets in this c ase was the date of interim judgment, 28 January 2013 (“the Operative Date”). 

6       In order to determine the asset pool, I first dealt with the following disputes: 

 (a) the c orrec t valuation of several of the parties’ assets whic h were agreed as part of the pool of matrimonial assets; 

 (b) whether some of the parties’ disc losed assets were part of the pool of matrimonial assets; 

 (c ) whether the Husband had further undisc losed assets or assets whic h he had wrongfully dissipated; and 

 (d) the extent of the Husband’s outstanding liabilities. 

_Disputed valuations_ 

7       The valuation of the following assets were in dispute: 

 (a) the parties’ joint properties; 

 (b) the Wife’s POSB Ac c ount XX-XXX26-9; 

 (c ) the Wife’s jewellery; and 

 (d) the Husband’s P Pte Ltd shares. 

8       The parties owned two real properties held in joint names. The first was an exec utive HDB flat at Marsiling (“the Marsiling HDB”). The Husband valued it at $603,500 while the Wife valued the same 

at $600,000. [note: 6] Given the _de minimis_ differenc e between the two valuations offered, I valued the Marsiling HDB at the more c onservative $600,000. The sec ond property was a c ondominium (“the Condominium”). The Husband valued it at $1.5m while the Wife valued the Condominium at $1.3m. Given the absenc e of c lear evidenc e either way, and in fairness to both parties, I asc ribed a value in the middle: $1.4m. 

9       The Wife’s POSB Ac c ount XXXXX26-9 (“POSB 26-9”) was $248,676.17 on the Operative Date. [note: 7] The Wife submitted that POSB 26-9 should only be valued at $100,000 bec ause the rest of 

the money c omprised gifts from her family and relatives. [note: 8] The Wife’s evidenc e was that she rec eived $42,711.98 as her share of the net sale proc eeds from her parents’ HDB flat; she also rec eived a gift of $60,000 from her brother as a token of apprec iation for the help she rendered him. 

10     In this c ase, I found that the moneys whic h the Wife rec eived from her brother and parents were likely intended as gifts to _both_ the Husband and the Wife. Her brother and her parents had been living in the parties’ matrimonial home for a long time. Further, both the Husband and the Wife had played a part in helping her brother with his educ ation. In the c irc umstanc es, there was no basis to exc lude those sums from the pool of matrimonial assets. I therefore asc ribed the full bank balanc e to the pool. 

11     Regarding the Wife’s jewellery, the Wife valued it at $8,500 whereas the Husband valued it at $150,000. The Wife gave detailed evidenc e of the value and weight of the three bangles and two 


nec klac es whic h she owned, and a photograph. [note: 9] The Husband’s assertion that the Wife’s jewellery weighed approximately 2kg and henc e was worth approximately $150,000 was a bare 

statement. [note: 10] I therefore valued the Wife’s jewellery at the more c onservative value of $8,500. 

12     Finally, there were various points of dispute regarding the Husband’s shares in P Pte Ltd. First, there was dispute as to the _number_ of P Pte Ltd shares owned by the Husband. The Husband 

asserted that he had 280,000 P Pte Ltd shares. [note: 11] The Wife asserted that the Husband had 

281,660 P Pte Ltd shares. [note: 12] Based on the doc umentary evidenc e, on 15 April 2011, the 

Husband owned 79,773 P Pte Ltd shares. [note: 13] By 3 May 2011, his shareholding went up to 

281,660 shares [note: 14] and stayed at 281,660 as at 31 Dec ember 2011. [note: 15] Apart from the Husband’s assertion, there was no further doc umentary evidenc e that his shareholding subsequently went bac k down to 280,000. Additionally, I noted that the Husband’s evidenc e on this issue had been inc onsistent throughout the c ourse of the proc eedings. He admitted in his affidavit dated 3 May 2013 

that he owned 281,660 P Pte Ltd shares. [note: 16] I found that the Husband owned 281,660 P Pte Ltd shares. 

13     The parties disputed, in addition, the _value_ to be asc ribed to eac h P Pte Ltd share. The Husband relied on a letter dated 13 Marc h 2014 from P Pte Ltd’s ac c ountant, stating that the _net assets_ of the c ompany based on the financ ial statements for the year ending 31 Dec ember 2012 were valued at $855,361 (total assets of $1,821,154 minus total liabilities of $965,793); the net asset 

value per share was thus $1.221. [note: 17] 

14     The Wife, however, referred to four share transfer forms showing that the Husband had purc hased P Pte Ltd shares on or around 26 April 2011 from four other shareholders at a signific antly 

higher pric e of approximately $5.33 per share. [note: 18] Her submission was that the Husband had not explained why the value of his P Pte Ltd shares had dropped so signific antly sinc e then. Further, she pointed out that although a valuation of the P Pte Ltd shares was c onduc ted in 2011, the Husband 

was unwilling to disc lose the valuation report on grounds of c onfidentiality. [note: 19] The Wife also submitted that P Pte Ltd’s investment properties, namely five c ommerc ial properties, were undervalued in P Pte Ltd’s financ ial statements as the ac c ountants reflec ted only the book value, but not the market value, of the properties. In the 2014 interrogatories, the Husband had answered that the value of the properties was $3.2m. 

15     I found that the fall in the value of the Husband’s P Pte Ltd shares sinc e 2011 plausible in light of the payment out of dividends of $2.95m to shareholders in 2011. The 2011 financ ial statements 

showed that the total net assets of the c ompany fell from $3,924,988 to $914,290. [note: 20] With a total asset value of P Pte Ltd at approximately $5.4m in 2010, a $2.95m dividend payout, whic h forms a signific ant portion of $5.4m, would explain the signific ant fall in the value of the P Pte Ltd shares. 

16     The financ ial statements showed that the c ompany’s c ommerc ial properties, however, were at an undervalue as c ontended by the Wife. These, reflec ted as “Investment Properties” in the c ompany’s ac c ounts, were only valued at approximately $1.27m in P Pte Ltd’s 2012 financ ial statements on the basis of the independent valuation of the properties _in 2009_ (of $1.59m), with 

assumption of deprec iation eac h year (henc e, the 2012 reduc ed value of $1.27m). [note: 21] The Husband had estimated the value in 2014 as $3.2m. The Wife obtained an independent valuation of the c ommerc ial properties from Colliers International Consultanc y & Valuation (Singapore) Pte Ltd. The 

c ommerc ial properties were valued at $3,725,000 as at the Operative Date. [note: 22] The Husband 


ac c epted this valuation. [note: 23] The Husband initially c laimed that the c ommerc ial properties were subjec t to a $1.4m term loan. Suc h a loan, if it existed, would have already been in the c ompany ac c ounts. 

17     Counsel for the Wife submitted that the value of P Pte Ltd was in fac t $1.8m, as the book value was a depressed value. The fac t that the c ompany rec eived substantial annual rentals (as evident 

from its 2010, 2011, and 2012 ac c ounts of $364,020, [note: 24] $412,346, [note: 25] and $444, [note: 26] ) showed that it was a valuable going c onc ern. [note: 27] The net tangible asset approac h 

would not have taken this into c onsideration. While there was logic in c ounsel’s argument, in absenc e of an expert opinion as to the extent of the additional margin, I nevertheless preferred a more c onservative approac h of using the book value as a base, and adding the enhanc ed valuation of the c ommerc ial properties to the book value, still following the initial approac h of the net tangible asset value. Thus, adding the enhanc ed value of the c ommerc ial properties to the net asset value of P Pte 

Ltd reflec ted in the 2012 ac c ounts, $2,454,430, c ame to $3,309,791. [note: 28] Dividing then by the number of shares, the value asc ribed to eac h share was $4.73. The Husband’s **_281,660 P Pte Ltd shares were therefore valued at $1,331,790_** (rounded down to nearest dollar). 

_Disputed assets_ 

18     This c ategory c onc erns (a) bank ac c ounts of the Husband; and (b) rental from the Marsiling HDB whic h the Wife had retained. 

19     Regarding the Husband’s bank ac c ounts, in this c ase, arising from the Wife’s requests for disc overy, the Husband furnished the Wife instead with a letter of authorisation to deal direc tly with his banks. Subsequently, in his submissions, the Husband objec ted to the inc lusion of c ertain bank ac c ounts belonging to him on the basis that the Wife had not disc losed more updated bank 

statements in respec t of the said ac c ounts whic h she had allegedly rec eived from the bank. [note: 29] These ac c ounts were: (a) Standard Chartered Ac c ount No XXXXXXX20-5 c ontaining $11,673.83 as of 2 January 2009; (b) Maybank Ac c ount No XXXXXXXX70-9 c ontaining $37,572.66 as of 15 January 2012; and (c ) OCBC Ac c ount No XX-XXX42-8 c ontaining $9,743.59 as of 19 April 1999. 

20     The Husband’s argument here turned the duty of disc overy on its head. In the _Husband’s affidavit of assets and means_ dated 9 April 2013, the above three bank ac c ounts were listed as 

belonging to him and c ontaining the exac t balanc es stated above. [note: 30] Given that these ac c ounts belonged to the _Husband_ , the onus was upon _him_ to obtain the relevant bank statements as at the agreed Operative Date. Not having done so, there was no basis for the Husband to then dispute that these ac c ounts c ontained the sums stated above on the footing only that the Wife had not disc losed more updated bank statements. Without updated bank statements before the c ourt, and given the above bank ac c ounts were disc losed by the _Husband himself_ as c ontaining the above sums, whic h the Wife ac c epted, I ac c epted the values proffered. 

21     Regarding the rental from the Marsiling HDB, this arose over a period of a year, and c ame to either $32,000 (c ontended by the Husband) or $25,000 (c ontended by the Wife). The Wife c ontended that she had the Husband’s permission to use this sum as additional money for the household. The rental was deposited into her POSB ac c ount, whic h showed various withdrawals of small amounts, supporting her evidenc e that she used the money to run the household. The remainder of the rental remained in her ac c ount whic h was part of the asset pool at the time of the asset division. In my view, it was not nec essary to add the differenc e into the asset pool as the money had been reasonably spent on the household. 


_Undisclosed assets and dissipation on part of the Husband_ 

22     The Wife alleged that the Husband had undisc losed assets and that he had been dissipating assets. Her submission was that these undisc losed and dissipated assets should be added to the matrimonial pool. These allegations related to: 

 (a) 300 shares in A Pte Ltd; 

 (b) c ash withdrawals totalling $313,180 at Marina Bay Sands lost through gambling; 

 (c ) substantial withdrawals and deposits made from and into two OCBC Moneymax Ac c ounts (“OCBC OO1”); and 

 (d) expenditure of $979,000 more than what would and should have been his reasonable expenditure. 

23     The Wife submitted that the Husband’s non-disc losures justified the c ourt drawing an adverse 

inferenc e against him. [note: 31] She submitted that a substantial sum should be added bac k into the asset pool. 

A Pte Ltd shares 

24     A Pte Ltd’s 2012 financ ial statements showed that the c ompany had a total share c apital of 

two shares, [note: 32] and that as of 31 Dec ember 2012, the Husband and Ronald eac h held one share 

in A Pte Ltd. [note: 33] The Husband thus had a 50% stake in A Pte Ltd. The 2012 financ ial statements 

also showed that A Pte Ltd’s net asset value was a negative figure ($27,923). [note: 34] For these reasons I did not asc ribe a value to A Pte Ltd for the purposes of the asset pool. Nevertheless, I noted that the Husband did not disc lose his shareholding in A Pte Ltd until very late in the day, following multiple queries from the Wife on his said shareholding. In my view, this lent support to the Wife’s submission that an adverse inferenc e should be drawn against the Husband given his lac k of full and frank disc losure about his assets. 

Husband’s gambling expenses 

25     The Husband admitted that he spent $310,180 gambling at MBS. [note: 35] The Wife asked for 

this sum to be added bac k to the pool. [note: 36] The Husband, however, submitted that the Wife knew about his gambling habit all along and had not objec ted to it. 

26     A useful preliminary point to note was that the evidenc e showed withdrawals from the ATM at MBS: the Husband may or may not have used the full sum for the purposes of gambling at MBS. Sec ondly, regarding the Husband’s c ontention that the Wife was aware he gambled, the Wife, while c onc eding that the Husband had a gambling habit, stated that she was not aware of its full extent. [note: 37] In light of the various c irc umstanc es, I found it equitable to add $150,000 bac k into the 

matrimonial pool, slightly less than half the amount in c ontention. 

OCBC 001 

27     The Wife asserted that from 2008 to 2014, the _total deposits_ (above $5,000) into OCBC 001 whic h c ould not be ac c ounted for (having exc luded moneys from CPF and the Husband’s disc losed 


salary) totalled $3,350,982.95. The total unac c ounted for withdrawals in the same time period, exc luding the sum of $1,546,249.84 the Husband estimated as his expenses (whic h assumed the Husband spent $19,000 per month), amounted to $2,506,079.39. The Wife submitted that the sourc e 

of these deposits, and the reasons for the withdrawals, were not known. [note: 38] 

28     In relation to the _deposits_ , the Husband’s evidenc e was that they c ome from (a) dividends from P Pte Ltd, (b) insuranc e payouts, (c ) 4D winnings, (d) CPF, (e) payouts from the Husband’s mother’s insuranc e polic y, (f ) sale of shares, (g) money borrowed (amounting to $971,303), (h) money repaid from others who borrowed money from him and (i) salary (inc luding direc tor’s fees and bonus). Most of these explanations were not c orroborated by any evidenc e. He also c ould not remember where 

$423,002.30 worth of deposits c ame from. [note: 39] 

29     The Wife submitted that 

 (a) the $423,002.30 whic h was unac c ounted for suggested he had inc ome from other sourc es; [note: 40] 

 (b) the Husband had signific ant wealth and he had given no c redible reason why he had to borrow sums amounting to $971,303; [note: 41] and 

 (c ) there were inc onsistenc ies in the Husband’s evidenc e regarding dividends rec eived. [note: 42] 

30     Regarding the _withdrawals_ , the Wife suggested that these were of even greater c onc ern as these showed the Husband’s dissipation of assets. The Husband c ould not remember the purpose of $50,000 worth of withdrawals. For the rest, he explained that the rest of the withdrawals above $5,000 went towards (a) repayment of debts and granting of loans extended to other people, (b) CPF withdrawals given to the Wife, (c ) payment of c ar loans, (d) payment for the purc hase of shares, (e) renovation of the Condominium, (f ) payment for the Condominium, (g) expenses (inc luding monthly 

allowanc es to the Wife) and (h) money spent gambling at Marina Bay Sands (“MBS”). [note: 43] 

31     The Wife’s main c omplaint regarding his explanations is that many of the Plaintiff’s explanations were not c orroborated by evidenc e. There was some merit to this c omplaint: 

 (a) Withdrawals totalling $891,667.87, [note: 44] whic h were allegedly loan repayments or loans extended to others by the Husband, were c ompletely unc orroborated by evidenc e. 

 (b) The Husband had refused to disc lose the sum outstanding in his share ac c ount nor did he give an ac c ount of the shares he held. Withdrawals were, however, explained away as share purc hases with “DBS Vic kers Ballas”. Only a few of these transac tions were supported with c orresponding doc umentation. The unsupported withdrawals allegedly for share purc hases amounted to approximately $300,000. [note: 45] 

 (c ) There were other misc ellaneous payments ( eg , “Payment to Ang Seah Hoe”) whic h were not explained by the evidenc e. [note: 46] 

The unexplained deposits support c ounsel for the Wife’s submissions that the Husband had inc ome from various sourc es that were not disc losed, suc h as rental from the properties owned by P Pte Ltd, other business dealings and so forth. The additional substantial unexplained withdrawals strongly 


suggested a pattern of dissipation by the Husband. 

Other expenses totalling $979, 

32     The Wife submitted that the Husband’s expenses of approximately $1.5m over the relevant period far exc eeded his reasonable expenses of $7,886 per month as stated in his affidavit of assets 

and means dated 9 April 2013. [note: 47] Compared to her frugal habits, the Wife asserted that the Husband’s high expenditure resulted in the matrimonial assets being rec klessly dissipated. Given that the Husband had not properly ac c ounted for his high expenditure, apart from asserting that muc h of it had been spent on gambling, this lent weight to the inferenc e that he had dissipated assets. 

Adverse inferenc e 

33     In _ANJ v ANK_ [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“ _ANJ v ANK_ ”) at [29], the Court of Appeal held that the c ourt had the power to draw adverse inferenc es against a party who had failed to make full and frank disc losure of his assets. In my view, it was reasonable, in this c ase, to draw a c onc lusion that the Husband had funds elsewhere. First, the pattern of disc overy showed that that the Husband was c hary of giving information unless required. The Husband did not disc lose his A Pte Ltd shares until c onfronted by the Wife. More importantly, his share ac c ount, while admitted in the c ourse of an interrogatory, was not disc losed: the Husband rather nonc halantly stated that it was “not relevant”. Sec ond, there were substantial unexplained withdrawals from OCBC 001, and third, unexplained high expenses. 

34     Regarding the spec ific sum, the Wife suggested adding bac k $1,979,000 for OCBC 001 and unexplained expenditure. The Husband’s c ase, however, was that he was “rolling money around”, through loans and their subsequent repayment, to meet his business needs. Counsel for the Wife pointed out, however, that between the deposits and withdrawals, a signific ant sum had been siphoned out: he estimated this as at least $1,019,479.30, over and above the dissipation of $979,000 in expenses and $313,180 for gambling. It was also c lear from the Husband’s notation of deposit and withdrawal for the purposes of his share ac c ount that his undisc losed share ac c ount would have at least $300,000. I dec ided to add a c onservative sum of $500,000 to the asset pool arising from the adverse inferenc e I had drawn against him. 

_Husband’s liabilities_ 

35     The Husband c ontended he was subjec t to the following liabilities: 

 (a) $200,000 owed to his friend Ronald; 

 (b) $137,582 owed to his friend Ramakrishnan; 

 (c ) $70,000 owed to P Pte Ltd; and 

 (d) $18,213.18 owed to DBS. 

36     I first c onsidered the alleged debt owed to Ronald. In the earlier affidavits, both the Husband and Ronald asserted that a sum of $268,642.50 was owed by the Husband to Ronald. In the light of OCBC bank statements showing the loan’s repayment, on 6 April 2015, Ronald filed an affidavit to say 

that the debt has been repaid [note: 48] and the Husband also filed an affidavit to retrac t the c laim 

that he owed Ronald $268,642.50 [note: 49]. Subsequently, in his sec ond affidavit dated 19 May 2016, the Husband c laimed for the first time that he owed Ronald a further sum of $200,000, whic h he

 Assets in joint names 

 1 Marsiling HDB $600,000.00Marginally lower value used 

rec eived into his ac c ount on 18 April 2011. [note: 50] Ronald filed an affidavit on 19 May 2016 to 

c orroborate the Husband’s c laim that a debt of $200,000 was still owing to him. [note: 51] The Wife pointed out that although it has been some 5 years sinc e the disbursement of the loan, no part of it has been repaid nor was there any evidenc e of any demand for repayment made by Ronald. At the same time, the Husband had prepared a ledger of alleged loans to various persons but there is no entry relating to Ronald; instead an 18 April 2011 movement of $200,000 is desc ribed as a dividend. [note: 52] In light of the unsatisfac tory nature of the evidenc e, I did not take ac c ount of this loan. 

37     Similarly, the c laim that a debt of $137,582 was owed to Ramakrishnan only surfac ed for the 

first time in the Plaintiff’s affidavit dated 19 May 2016. [note: 53] On the same day, Ramakrishnan filed 

an affidavit in support of the Husband’s c laim that the Husband owed him $87,530. [note: 54] This disc repanc y between the quantum of debt the Husband and Ramakrishnan c laimed was explained by referenc e to a differenc e in disbursement dates. Nevertheless, this allegation surfac ed for the first time only in May 2016. In two affidavits filed by the Husband earlier, on 6 May 2015 and 18 January 2016, this debt of $137,582 did not appear on the list of debts the Husband c laimed were owed by him as of 28 January 2013. To date, the debt remains unpaid and there is no evidenc e that Ramakrishnan has demanded repayment of it. In the c irc umstanc es, there was insuffic ient evidenc e for me to find that the Husband owed Ramakrishnan any money. 

38     As for the $70,000 debt allegedly owed to P Pte Ltd, the doc uments suggested that this loan was disbursed in two parts: a $50,000 loan and then a $20,000 loan. To first deal with the $20,000, the Husband had exhibited a payment vouc her of $20,000 dated 22 February 2012 made out to him and desc ribed as “staff loan”. This was supported by a c orresponding OCBC debit note dated 22 February 2012 showing a c orresponding $20,000 c heque deposit into his ac c ount and the debit note 

desc ribed the transac tion as “STAFF LOAN” under “Additional Details”. [note: 55] The only evidenc e supporting the alleged $50,000 loan was an OCBC debit note dated 10 January 2012 for $50,000. [note: 56] On balanc e, I found that the doc umentary evidenc e was insuffic ient to prove that the 

Husband did indeed owe P Pte Ltd $70,000. There was no evidenc e as to _why_ the money was borrowed, and the _terms_ on whic h it was borrowed, or that there was any intention to repay the debt. 

39     The $18,213.18 debt allegedly owed to DBS was supported by a bank statements dated 31 

Dec ember 2012 and 1 January 2013. [note: 57] However, the Husband was not able to provide an ac c ount of why this sum was borrowed and whether it was a valid expense for the benefit of the family. I therefore rejec ted this debt.

**_Division of the pool_** 

41     Having defined the pool of matrimonial assets, I now explain how I divided the pool. 

_Applicable legal principles_ 

42     The Court of Appeal set out a struc tured approac h in _ANJ v ANK_ (at [22]–[26], [28]) to work out a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets: 

 (a) express as a ratio the parties’ direc t c ontributions relative to eac h other, having regard to the amount of financ ial c ontribution eac h party made towards the ac quisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets; 

 (b) express as a sec ond ratio the parties’ indirec t c ontributions relative to eac h other, having regard to both financ ial and non-financ ial c ontributions; and 

 (c ) derive the parties’ overall c ontributions relative to eac h other by taking an average of the two ratios above, keeping in mind that, depending on the c irc umstanc es of eac h c ase, the direc t and indirec t c ontributions may not be ac c orded equal weight, and one of the two ratios may be ac c orded more signific anc e than the other. Adjustments c ould also be made in respec t of other relevant fac tors under ss 112 or 114(1) of the Women’s Charter. 

_Direct contribution ratio_ 

43     The Husband c omputed the Wife’s direc t c ontribution as 1.25% and his at 98.75%. The Husband only gave c redit to the Wife for her CPF c ontribution of $15,819.07 to the Marsiling HDB. [note: 58] The Wife c omputed her direc t c ontribution as 2.18%. She submitted that she should 

additionally be given c redit for her $15,000 c ontribution to renovations of the Condominium and for 

her $30,000 c ontribution to renovations of the Marsiling HDB. [note: 59] 

44     There was insuffic ient evidenc e to determine whether the Wife did indeed c ontribute to the renovations of the Condominium and the Marsiling HDB. On a “ _rough and ready approximation_ ” (see _ANJ v ANK_ (at [23])), I set the direc t c ontribution ratio for the pool at 2:98 in favour of the Husband. 

_Indirect contribution ratio_ 

45     This was a very long marriage that had lasted almost 33 years up to the date of the IJ. 


 Table 2: Adjusted Ratio Computation Husband Wife 

 Step 1 Ratio 98 2 

 Step 1 Ratio (35% weight) 34.3 0. 

 Step 2 Ratio 25 75 

 Step 2 Ratio (65% weight) 16.25 48. 

 The Step 3 adjusted ratio 50.55 49. 

46     The Wife proposed an indirec t c ontribution ratio of 90:10 in her favour. She asserted that she c ontributed to paying for the family’s expenses early on in the marriage before the Husband’s business took off. She also asserted that the Husband travelled overseas frequently and that she c ared for their daughter with little help from him. She had experienc ed three painful misc arriages prior to giving 

birth to their daughter. [note: 60] Further, the Husband was hardly by her side during her pregnanc y and she did all the household c hores. 

47     The Husband proposed an indirec t c ontribution ratio of 60:40 in his favour. He asserted that he was very supportive during the Wife’s pregnanc y and that he partic ipated in c aring for her family (her parents and brother). He also asserted that he took c are of their daughter when she was sic k and that he would fetc h her to and from sc hool at times. He c laimed that he would fix things around the 

house ( _eg_ , light bulbs, tap) and that he oversaw the renovations of their matrimonial house. [note: 61] Finally, he c laimed that the Wife neglec ted him and their daughter when her parents started living 

with them as her attention was solely on her parents. [note: 62] 

48     It was undisputed that the Husband was the sole breadwinner and that he spent most of his day working and travelled very frequently. As a result, the Wife was the main person maintaining the household. She also c ontributed to the household expenses at the beginning of the marriage, before the Husband’s business took off. While the Husband did make some effort to take c are of their daughter and the household, his c ontributions were limited given that he was busy with work most of the time. While the Wife did take c are of her family in their home, this was with the agreement of the Husband. In the c irc umstanc es, I set the indirec t c ontribution ratio at 75:25 in favour of the Wife. 

_Adjustment of the average ratio_ 

49     In _ANJ v ANK_ at [27], the Court of Appeal highlighted three c onsiderations that c an affec t the weightage of the ratios: the length of the marriage, the size of the assets and its c onstituents, and the extent and nature of the indirec t c ontributions made. Indirec t c ontributions feature more prominently in long marriages. Taking into ac c ount the 33-year marriage between the parties, I awarded the indirec t c ontributions ratio a 65% weight in this c ase. The adjusted ratio was thus c omputed as follows: 

50     Taking all the c irc umstanc es into ac c ount, I found that a **_50:50_** split of assets to be a just and equitable division, for reasons whic h follow. 

_Reasons for the final ratio_ 

51     It was c lear in this c ase that the Husband’ c ontribution was as the fee earner, and the Wife’s was in the home. It was, by all measures, a very long marriage. The c ouple started in humble 


c irc umstanc es, in one instanc e with the Wife having to pawn her jewellery to assist the Husband. Through their joint efforts in their respec tive spheres, all of the asset enhanc ement being divided was obtained during the marriage. As is usual in c ases of divorc e, there were expressions of dissatisfac tion on both sides with the other’s c ontribution to the marriage. The fac t of the matter is that, in this c ase, both parties had put in strong and equal effort into the marriage, over a very long period of time. 

52     Of relevanc e here is the guidanc e of the Court of Appeal that financ ial and non-financ ial c ontributions to the household should be equally respec ted: see _Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye_ [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520, _Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim Heng_ [2001] 2 SLR(R) 260 (“ _Lim Choon Lai_ ”), _Tan Hwee Lee v Tan Cheng Guan and another appeal and another matter_ [2012] 4 SLR 785. Also, in _NK v NL_ [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 at [41], the Court of Appeal affirmed the princ iple that the proc ess of matrimonial division of assets “must involve a mutual respec t for spousal c ontributions, whether in the ec onomic or homemaking spheres, as both roles are equally fundamental to the well-being of the marital partnership”. The Court of Appeal added that financ ial and non-financ ial c ontributions should be put “on an equal footing” (at [27]). In _ANJ v ANK_ (at [17] and [26]), the Court of Appeal reiterated the guidanc e of _Lim Choon Lai_ (at [14]) and _NK v NL_ (at [41]) that spousal c ontributions in both the ec onomic and home-making spheres are equally fundamental to the well-being of a martial partnership. 

53     In suc h c ases of long marriage where parties have ordered their lives where one party c onc entrates solely on the home and family, stric tly applying steps (a) and (b) of the _ANJ v ANK_ approac h without adjusting the ratio at step (c ) may lead to a greater emphasis on financ ial rather than non-financ ial c ontributions. In the first step of the direc t c ontribution ratio, parties’ direc t c ontributions are based on their _financial_ c ontributions _to the matrimonial assets_. The parties’ indirec t c ontributions c omprise _both_ their _financial and non-financial contributions_ to the welfare of the household, above and beyond their financ ial c ontributions to the matrimonial assets. Given that financ ial c ontributions feature in c omputing both the direc t and indirec t c ontributions ratio, the Court, in c ases suc h as the present, must adjust the final ratio suc h that there is no role disc rimination weighing in favour of the fee earner. Suc h a c onc lusion would be c ontrary to the well-established position that c ourts give equal respec t to the ec onomic and homemaking spheres given the fundamental importanc e of eac h role to the well-being and flourishing of the marital partnership. In following the three-part analysis in dividing parties’ assets, the Court’s singular statutory duty is to ensure that the final result brings a just and equitable c losure to parties’ joint lives. As stated by the Court of Appeal in _ANJ v ANK_ (at [30]): “The c ontrolling princ iple has always been and remains that the c ourt must approac h the exerc ise with broad strokes based on its feel of what is just and equitable on the fac ts of the c ase.” 

_Value of the Wife’s half share_ 

54     The total value of the matrimonial assets c ame up to $4,631,434.58. The Wife was entitled to 50% of that, whic h was $2,315,717.29. Deduc ting the assets held in the Wife’s name (whic h have been valued at $329,945.05), $1,985,772.24 remained payable to the Wife. 

**Maintenance for the Wife** 

55     In 2013, the Husband’s monthly inc ome was approximately $12,906.92. [note: 63] His c ounsel indic ated that his monthly inc ome was $12,000 at the time of the hearing. The Husband estimated 

that his monthly expenses amounted to $7,886. [note: 64] The Husband proposed to give the Wife 

$1,000 per month and the daughter $1,500 per month as maintenanc e. [note: 65] He objec ted to a 


lump sum maintenanc e award as he c laimed that he did not have enough savings and also submitted that the fac t he had been dutifully paying $2,500 to the Wife suggested he was unlikely to default. [note: 66] 

56     It was c lear from the evidenc e that the Husband enjoyed inc ome over and above his dec lared monthly inc ome. This explained why he c ould have suc h high monthly expenditures. His c ounsel c onc eded that his expenses of $1,073,004 for a period of 61 months c ame to $17,590 per month. ACRA searc hes c onduc ted by c ounsel for the Wife showed that the Husband was involved in many businesses. P Pte Ltd also seemed to be a sourc e of inc ome. He explained on affidavit that P Pte Ltd was resting on rental inc ome, and he rec eives a portion of that rental inc ome. Referenc ing his 40% share of the $444,408 obtained annually after deduc ting expenses, his rental inc ome would be $123,000 annually. This was a steady inc ome stream that was stable. From the Husband’s spending pattern, it was c lear that he had rec ourse to other sourc es of funds. 

57     The Wife was last a c lerk and would have diffic ulty re-entering the labour market after being a home-maker for many years. Sinc e June 2012 to the present, the Husband had been giving the Wife monthly maintenanc e of $2,500 for herself and the Child. The Wife c laimed that she had other expenses whic h she had been using her savings for and that the $2,500 from the Husband had been 

insuffic ient. [note: 67] She also c laimed that her financ ial situation was ameliorated by the fac t that from August 2012 to August 2013, the Husband had allowed her to keep the rental of $2,600 from the 

Marsiling HDB, whic h meant that she effec tively had $5,100 to spend eac h month. [note: 68] Her monthly maintenanc e c laim for herself and her daughter was $3,043.44 and $2,193.33 respec tively. [note: 69] 

58     A lump sum award was appropriate bec ause of the desirability of a c lean break between the spouses in this c ase, espec ially in light of the animosity between them. Affordability was not an issue for the Husband. The Wife asked for a lump sum based on a 12-year period. Bec ause the Wife had been awarded a substantial sum of assets pursuant to the division of matrimonial property and bec ause the Court’s power to order maintenanc e is supplementary to that to divide assets (see _ATE v ATD and another appeal_ [2016] SGCA 2 at [33]), I dec ided to award the Wife a small lump sum to ease the transition. I set this sum at $171,422, using a sum of $3,000 per month, disc ounted using the net present value formula over five years with an assumption of interest at 2% per annum. 

**Implementation of orders** 

59     Adding the sum the Wife was entitled to pursuant to the division of assets, namely, **_$1,985,772.24_** , and the lump sum maintenanc e of **_$171,422_** awarded to the Wife, a total sum of **_$2,157,194 (nearest dollar)_** was payable to the Wife. In the c irc umstanc es, I found that the best way of effec ting my dec ision on the division of matrimonial assets and maintenanc e was to order, _inter alia_ , that the **_Husband transfer the Condominium and the Marsiling HDB to the Wife_**. This addresses the needs of the family in ensuring that the Wife and their daughter would c ontinue to have stability. The Wife is also advanc ed in age and would be disadvantaged in the job market in the light of her many years as a home-maker. This would allow her a stable sourc e of inc ome from rental c ollec ted from the Marsiling HDB. While the Husband was living at the Marsiling HDB, he had previously rented property elsewhere for a year, allowing the Wife the benefit of the rental. His business interests indic ated that he was also experienc ed on the property market and given his various sourc es of funds, would be able to find alternative ac c ommodation easily. 

60     Given that the two properties were valued at $2m, the Husband was ordered to pay a further sum of **_$157,194_** to the Wife. Spec ific ally, I ordered that the Husband was to pay the Wife the first 


$100,000 in three months, and the remainder $57,194 within three months thereafter. Parties were to keep all other assets in their own names. 

**Child orders** 

61     The Husband and Wife were given joint c ustody of the Child, with c are and c ontrol to the Wife and liberal ac c ess to the Husband. 

62     The Child is 19 and will c omplete her polytec hnic educ ation in 2017. For the Child’s maintenanc e, in ac c ordanc e with the Husband’s prior proposal, I awarded the Child $1,500 per month until she c ompleted her educ ation. The Husband was ordered to c redit the monthly maintenanc e of $1,500 to the Child on the first day of eac h month with effec t from 1 November 2016. 

**Costs** 

63     In the c ase at hand, the Husband initially obtained anc illary orders in absenc e of the Wife’s partic ipation. Upon the Wife’s applic ation to set the judgment aside, the High Court previously dec ided that, while the order for the division of assets obtained in the Wife’s absenc e was regular, the orders made ought to be set aside. Costs of that setting aside were reserved to me. The Wife asked for those c osts as well as the c osts of the hearing on the anc illary matters before me. 

64     In general, c osts are not ordered in matrimonial c ases; nevertheless, the c ourt exerc ises its disc retion to do so in appropriate c ases: see rr 854(b), 856, and 857, Family Justic e Rules 2014 (GN S 813/2014), and _Cheung Kam Yi Betty v Liu Tsun Kie_ [2012] SGHC 213 at [79]. Costs remain an important tool in regulating the litigation proc ess in family c ases, in disc ouraging misc onduc t and inc entivising sensible behaviour on the part of litigants. 

65     Of relevanc e here was the Husband’s signific ant non-disc losure. In the Husband’s first affidavit filed for the anc illary matters, there were non-disc losures in the areas both of his salary in the previous proc eedings he stated it was $8,000 per month whereas later he admitted it was over $12,000 a month as well as his assets, where various businesses had not been disc losed. Even after that judgment was set aside, the Husband did not do muc h better on disc losure in the sec ond set of anc illary matters. The enhanc ed value of the properties held by P Pte Ltd c ame to light during his interrogatories and it was the Wife who sought and obtained an updated valuation of the properties held by the c ompany after queries from the Court. Another c ompany, A Pte Ltd, was disc overed by the Wife in the c ourse of litigation and the Husband c onc eded when c onfronted by the Wife. Disc losure of his bank ac c ounts, obtained by the Wife after a disc overy applic ation, led to information as to withdrawals and expenditure that were ill explained. As at the hearing of the sec ond set of anc illary issues, the Court still had not had sight of his share trading ac c ount, information he dismissed, in answer to an interrogatory, as “irrelevant”. 

66     Suc h c onduc t must be disc ouraged, for several reasons. Fundamentally, in family c ases, where there is no general proc ess of inspec tion and disc overy applic able to other kinds of c ivil litigation, parties’ disc losure of their assets is fundamental to the exerc ise of the c ourt’s disc retion. The princ iple of full and frank disc losure applies not only to c ontested proc eedings but also to exc hanges of information between parties and their solic itors leading to c onsent orders without further inquiry of the c ourt: see _Livesey (formerly Jenkins) Respondent and Jenkins Appellant [on Appeal From Jenkins V. Livesey (formerly Jenkins)]_ [1985] 1 AC 424. Thus, although the Wife did not partic ipate in the initial hearing of the anc illary matters and the judgment thereby obtained was regular, the onus was upon the Husband to give the Court full and frank disc losure even in his first affidavit. The c ourt’s ability to exerc ise its statutory disc retion under the Women’s Charter rests upon parties’ c omplianc e 


with their duty of disc losure and respec t for the proc esses of the Court. Sec ondly, the “c atc h-me-ifyou-c an” attitude leads to an inevitable sequenc e of requests for doc uments, interrogatories and disc losure by further affidavits. This inc reases the c osts and length of litigation, and is unhelpful to an orderly assessment of evidenc e and adjudic ation of issues. Finally, suc h c onduc t also inc reases emotional strain and c onflic t between parties, often with adverse impac t on any c hildren within the family. 

67     In the c irc umstanc es, I found it just to award the Wife the c osts of the setting aside and the subsequent hearing of the anc illary matters before me. I fixed these c osts, in the round, at $15, (inc lusive of disbursements). 

**Conclusion** 

68     In summary, I made the following orders: 

 (a) The Husband shall transfer his share, interest, and right in the Condominium and the Marsiling HDB to the Wife. The Wife to bear the c osts of both transfers. The Husband is to effec t the transfer of the Condominium within three months, and the transfer of the Marsiling HDB within six months, from the date of the judgment, with no reimbursement of the Husband’s CPF monies. 

 (b) The Registrar of the Family Justic e Courts shall sign the doc uments effec ting the above transfers if the Husband fails to do so within the stipulated time and upon the Wife giving the Husband seven days’ written notic e of her intention to effec t the transfer. 

 (c ) The Husband is to pay a further sum of $157,194 to the Wife. The first $100,000 was to be paid in three months, and the remainder $57,194 within three months thereafter. 

 (d) Eac h party is to keep the rest of the assets in his or her own name. 

 (e) With effec t from 1 November 2016, and on the first of eac h month thereafter, the Husband shall pay the Child $1,500 per month as maintenanc e until she c ompletes her educ ation. 

 (f ) Parties have joint c ustody of the Child, with c are and c ontrol to the Wife, and liberal ac c ess to the Husband. 

 (g) Costs, fixed at $15,000 (inc lusive of disbursements), to be paid by the Husband to the Wife. 

 (h) Liberty to apply.
