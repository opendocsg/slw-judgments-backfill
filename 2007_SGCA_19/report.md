**Judith Prakash J (delivering the judgment of the court):** 

1       This c ase c onc erns the division of matrimonial assets upon the end of a brief and c hildless marriage. The appellant husband (“the Husband”) and respondent wife (“the Wife”) were married on 1 July 2000. Slightly over two years later, on 29 November 2002, the Wife applied for leave under s 94 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”) to c ommenc e divorc e proc eedings before the expiration of three years from the date of marriage. Her applic ation was dismissed. Nevertheless, the parties did not rec onc ile and the Wife filed a sec ond divorc e petition on 17 July 2003. The dec ree _nisi_ was granted on 19 September 2003. The distric t judge in the Family Court found that, effec tively, the marriage lasted for only 19 months. 

2       This appeal c onc erns the division of two matrimonial assets, namely, the apartment known as 259 Onan Road (“the matrimonial home”) and the apartment situated at 373 Onan Road #01Malvern Springs (“Malvern Springs”). It is nec essary to elaborate on the manner in whic h these two properties were ac quired. 

3       The matrimonial home was jointly purc hased by the parties in July 2000. The Husband and the Wife made lump sum payments of $74,740.46 and $39,659.54 respec tively from their ac c ounts with the Central Provident Fund Board (“CPF”). The Husband made an additional c ash down payment of $137,600. The remainder of the purc hase pric e was financ ed by a bank loan. 

4       The parties agreed that the Wife would be responsible for the monthly loan instalments and would pay these from her CPF ac c ount. Thus, from August 2000 to August 2003, the Wife alone paid the monthly instalments of $1,837.90. From September 2003 onwards, however, when the instalments were inc reased, the Husband started to c ontribute to them. In February 2004, the Wife’s CPF c ontributions dec reased to $1,000.00 a month and the Husband thereafter c orrespondingly bore the remainder of eac h instalment. 

5       In February 2002, the parties entered into a sale and purc hase agreement to purc hase 


Malvern Springs in their joint names. The parties’ intention _at that point in time_ was for Malvern Springs to replac e their matrimonial home, whic h was by then in a state of disrepair. Given that the Wife’s funds were being used to financ e the loan for the matrimonial home, the parties agreed that the Husband would be solely responsible for financ ing Malvern Springs. As the Husband was unable to obtain financ ing in his sole name, the parties also agreed that the mortgage loan for Malvern Springs was to be applied for in their joint names. The Husband made the initial 10% down payment for Malvern Springs. 

6       Shortly afterwards, the parties’ relationship broke down and when the time c ame to sign the mortgage doc uments, the Wife refused to sign them unless the Husband agreed to enter into a deed of financ ial settlement (“the Deed”) with her to formally rec ord an agreement with regard to Malvern Springs. Under the Deed, the Husband was to undertake to be solely responsible for all monthly instalments, the sec ond 10% of the purc hase pric e, interest, stamp duty, penalty, outgoings, c osts, bank c harges and fees and legal c osts inc urred in relation to Malvern Springs. The Husband did not c onsent to the Deed and as a result the Wife pulled out of the purc hase in April 2003. Abortive c osts of $10,684.04 were thus inc urred. 

7       The Husband then proc eeded to purc hase Malvern Springs in his sole name in May 2003. The Wife had no knowledge of this until it was revealed in the Husband’s fourth affidavit filed for the purposes of the anc illary matters in the divorc e proc eedings. 

8       At this junc ture, it is important to note that the values of both properties have moved in opposite direc tions. While the matrimonial home has drastic ally dec reased in value, Malvern Springs has apprec iated in value. The matrimonial home was purc hased for $688,000 but a valuation obtained by the Wife in June 2005 showed its then value to be only approximately $550,000. A shortfall will thus be inc urred if the matrimonial home is to be sold now. On the other hand, Malvern Springs was purc hased for $804,155 and, ac c ording to the Wife’s estimate based on the sale pric e attained for a smaller unit at that time, was worth more than $1m in February 2005. The Husband disputed that estimate, but only as to the degree of c apital apprec iation, and not to the fac t that no c apital loss had been suffered in respec t of Malvern Springs. 

**Proceedings in the courts below** 

9       When the issue of division of matrimonial assets was first heard in the Family Court, the position of Malvern Springs was a hotly c ontested issue. The distric t judge c onsidered that Malvern Springs should be inc luded in the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided bec ause the parties had intended it to replac e their matrimonial home. The distric t judge made the following anc illary orders on 18 April 2005 (see _Chan Mei Lan Kristine v Ong Boon Huat Samuel_ <span class="citation">[2005] SGDC 187</span> at [3]): 

 (a) The [Wife] was entitled to 18.56% of the net total value [ ie , net profit of Malvern Springs – shortfall in the sale pric e of the matrimonial home – the Husband’s c ash loss – abortive c osts of Malvern Springs] of both properties at 259, Onan Road (the matrimonial home) and 373, Onan Road, #01-10 Malvern Springs (Malvern Springs property) whic h, using the [Husband’s] amended c alc ulations, amounted to $22,596.64. 

 (b) The [Husband] was given the option either to sell the Malvern Springs property or he c ould retain it upon paying the [Wife] the said $22,596.64. 

 (c ) The matrimonial flat was to be sold within 6 months. 

 (d) No order on other c laims of both parties. 


 (e) [The Husband] to pay $1 per month as maintenanc e to [the Wife]. 

 (f ) Costs of Divorc e Petition to [the Wife] fixed at $1,500 and c osts of $2,000 for the anc illary proc eedings. 

10     The Husband was dissatisfied and appealed against the orders made by the distric t judge. On appeal, the High Court judge reduc ed the Wife’s share of the net total value of the two properties from 18.56% to 15% after taking into ac c ount the unsatisfac tory state of the Husband’s financ ial affairs. The High Court judge left the distric t judge’s orders otherwise untouc hed. 

**The parties’ arguments and the findings of the lower courts** 

11     It was not disputed that the matrimonial home was to be divided. The brunt of c ontention instead arose from the Wife’s c laim to a share in Malvern Springs. 

12     The Husband’s main argument in this c ourt and the c ourts below was that Malvern Springs should _not_ be inc luded in the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided, _ie_ , the Wife should not be entitled to any share in Malvern Springs. The main reason he gave was that the Wife had, from the very beginning, maintained that she was not interested in the purc hase of Malvern Springs and that she should not be responsible for any liability that might arise from the same. That being so, she should not now be allowed to take advantage of the Husband’s astute investment dec ision in purc hasing Malvern Springs. 

13     The Wife argued that Malvern Springs should be inc luded in the pool of matrimonial assets bec ause it was purc hased during the marriage and was originally intended to replac e the matrimonial home. Further, the parties’ agreement was that the Wife would c ontinue to servic e the monthly loan instalments in respec t of the matrimonial home while the Husband financ ed the purc hase of Malvern Springs. The Wife argued that it would be unjust and inequitable to now deny her a share of Malvern Springs bec ause the arrangement resulted in her financ ing a negative asset (being the matrimonial home) while the Husband financ ed a profitable asset (being Malvern Springs). 

14     The distric t judge and the High Court judge both agreed with the Wife. They found that Malvern Springs should be inc luded in the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided bec ause it was ac quired during the marriage and was intended to c onstitute the parties’ new matrimonial home. Further, the High Court judge found that the Husband c ould only afford to purc hase Malvern Springs bec ause the Wife was helping to financ e the matrimonial home. She was, to that extent, financ ially strapped and unable to help financ e Malvern Springs. The Wife had thus c ontributed to the purc hase of Malvern Springs by relieving the Husband from the financ ial burden he would otherwise have borne with respec t to the matrimonial home. The High Court judge c onc luded that she was therefore entitled to a share in Malvern Springs: see _Chan Mei Lan Kristine v Ong Boon Huat Samuel_ <span class="citation">[2006] SGHC 108</span> (“the GD”) at [16]. 

**Our decision** 

**_Should Malvern Springs be included in the matrimonial asset pool?_** 

15     Having heard the submissions on appeal and having rec onsidered the evidenc e, we have c ome to a different c onc lusion from the c ourts below. With respec t, it is our determination that Malvern Springs should _not_ be inc luded in the matrimonial asset pool for division and c onsequently that the Wife should not get a share of Malvern Springs. This determination is, in our judgment, the only one that is c onsistent with the Wife’s position from the beginning that she was to have no part 


in the purc hase of Malvern Springs and all liabilities assoc iated therewith would be borne by the Husband. 

16     The Wife’s position _vis-à-vis_ Malvern Springs was c learly enunc iated in her affidavits. At para 11 of her first affidavit filed on 10 November 2003, the Wife said: 

 The [Husband] was the one who wanted to buy this property. I was already unable to afford buying another property as all my monies were already being used to financ e our matrimonial home’s outstanding loan. Therefore, it was agreed that the [Husband] would be the one fully financ ing the purc hase of Malvern Springs. However, for the [Husband] to obtain a mortgage loan from the bank for suc h a purc hase, the mortgage loan had to be applied for by both him and [me]. Therefore, the [Husband] asked me to be a joint owner of Malvern Springs and to apply for the mortgage loan with him so that he c an c ontinue with the purc hase but it was made very clear that I will not be paying anything for Malvern Springs. This is c onfirmed by the fac t that the [Husband] was the one who paid the initial 10% downpayment for the property. [emphasis added] 

17     She c ontinued at para 13: 

 The purc hase of Malvern Springs was then aborted and I believe that the developers and the bank are seeking c ompensation and damages for the non-c ompletion of the purc hase. I pray that the Court will order that any losses, damages, interest, payments are to be borne by the [Husband] as it was really his sole decision to buy Malvern Springs and he had agreed to finance it solely himself therefore I should not be liable for any of its losses or damages now. [emphasis added] 

18     In her sec ond affidavit filed on 5 Dec ember 2003, the Wife c ontinued to protest that she should not be liable for the abortive c osts assoc iated with Malvern Springs. She said at para 13: 

 I note that the [Husband] has made no mention of the Malvern Springs issue in his Affidavit but this is a matrimonial asset whic h should be divided during the divorc e proc eedings as well, even though it is in fac t a liability now. This liability should not be shared between the [Husband] and [me] but should be borne by him solely as this liability was not incurred for our joint benefit but for the [Husband’s] sole benefit. It was his intention to invest his monies into this property and had nothing to do with me. I was only to assist in obtaining a mortgage loan for him. It was understood that this property would belong wholly to him. Therefore, the liability should also be his solely. [emphasis added] 

19     Notably, these affidavits were filed before the Wife found out that the Husband had purc hased Malvern Springs in his own name. The Wife’s subsequent affidavits made no referenc e to Malvern Springs. 

20     In our view, it is evident that the Wife had from the beginning wholly dissoc iated herself from the purc hase of Malvern Springs. She testified in her first affidavit (see [16] above) that the purc hase of the property was the Husband’s idea and she had only agreed to be a party to the mortgage bec ause the Husband was unable to obtain financ ing in his sole name. At that time, the parties’ relationship had already deteriorated. 

21     After the parties’ relationship had c ompletely broken down, the Wife made her intentions exc eptionally c lear by seeking to enter into a legally binding agreement whic h would c onfirm that she would not be responsible for any liabilities arising from Malvern Springs. In a letter from the Wife’s 


solic itors to the Husband’s solic itors dated 4 April 2003 in whic h the Deed was proposed, it was made c lear that the Wife would exec ute the mortgage doc uments to avoid both parties being sued by the developers of Malvern Springs, but only on the basis that the Husband would be solely responsible for the financ ial c osts of the purc hase and would indemnify her against any c laims made in relation to that property. Her solic itors gave the Husband one day to ac c ept these terms and, in the absenc e of suc h ac c eptanc e, the letter stated that the Wife would reserve her rights to seek an indemnity from the Husband for any losses, c osts and damages sustained by her. When the Husband refused to enter into the Deed, the Wife put her intentions into effec t by c ompletely withdrawing from the purc hase. 

22     The Wife’s sec ond affidavit (see [18] above), filed before she found out that the Husband had purc hased Malvern Springs in his sole name, is c onsistent with this view of the fac ts and is partic ularly telling. Importantly, she testified that the liability should be borne solely by the Husband bec ause it was inc urred “for the [Husband’s] sole benefit” and that the parties’ understanding was for Malvern Springs to “belong wholly to [the Husband]”. 

23     Having realised that the Husband had gone ahead with the purc hase of Malvern Springs on his own, and that Malvern Springs had turned out to be a profitable investment, the Wife adopted a radic ally different position in these proc eedings and c laimed a share of Malvern Springs. We have no doubt that, had Malvern Springs turned out to be an imprudent investment, the Wife would have maintained her position that she should have nothing to do with the purc hase. In our view, the Wife c annot now c laim what she onc e rejec ted. If the Wife maintains that she has nothing to do with the liabilities assoc iated with Malvern Springs, then she similarly c an have no share in its profits. 

24     On the fac ts, the Husband went ahead to purc hase Malvern Springs in his sole name bec ause he was fac ing substantial financ ial loss and was in danger of being sued by the developers if the initial purc hase was aborted. Importantly, the purc hase took plac e at a point in time when the parties’ marriage had already c ompletely broken down. To rec all, the Husband purc hased Malvern Springs in May 2003 and the Wife filed the sec ond divorc e petition shortly afterwards in July 2003. The Husband paid for both the first 10% down payment and the sec ond 10% instalment of the purc hase pric e from his c ash savings, and has been paying the monthly loan instalments ever sinc e. 

25     In the light of all the c irc umstanc es, we see no reason why Malvern Springs should be inc luded in the matrimonial pool of assets to be divided between the parties. While it may be that Malvern Springs was ac quired _during_ the marriage, and therefore tec hnic ally falls under the definition of a matrimonial asset c ontained in s 112(10) of the Ac t, we must emphasise that the c ourt’s power to divide any matrimonial asset is a disc retionary power. This is obvious from ss 112(1) and 112(2) of the Ac t, whic h provide: 

 (1) The c ourt shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorc e, judic ial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any suc h asset and the division between the parties of the proc eeds of the sale of any suc h asset in suc h proportions as the c ourt thinks just and equitable. 

 (2) It shall be the duty of the c ourt in deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase ... 

 [emphasis added] 

26     Thus, it is not mandatory for the c ourt to exerc ise its powers of division under s 112 and the c ourt may generally dec line to do so where a valid reason is given: _Wong Kam Fong Anne v Ang Ann Liang_ <span class="citation">[1993] 2 SLR 192</span> at 200, [31]. For the reasons given above, the present c ase is one in whic h 


there is good reason for the c ourt _not_ to divide Malvern Springs. 

27     We would also add that, while it may have been the intention of the parties in February 2002 that Malvern Springs should replac e their matrimonial home, it was very c lear that by May 2003, when the Husband purc hased Malvern Springs in his sole name, suc h an intention no longer existed. In this regard, we must disagree with the approac h of the lower c ourts in plac ing emphasis on the parties’ original intention that Malvern Springs should bec ome the new matrimonial home. 

**_Division of the matrimonial home_** 

28     Having exc luded Malvern Springs from division, we now turn to c onsider the division of the matrimonial home. In a short and c hildless marriage, the division of matrimonial assets will usually be in ac c ordanc e with the parties’ direc t financ ial c ontributions as non-financ ial c ontributions will be minimal. Thus, in _Wang Shi Huah Karen v Wong King Cheung Kevin_ <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR 1025</span>, a c ase where the wife left home after a year, the High Court divided the matrimonial home solely in ac c ordanc e with the parties’ direc t financ ial c ontributions. In the present c ase, it has been established that the direc t financ ial c ontributions of the parties to the matrimonial home are in the proportions of 64:36 from the Husband and the Wife respec tively. The Wife rightly did not make a c laim for any non-financ ial c ontributions. 

29     As stated above at [8], the matrimonial home has drastic ally dec reased in value. On the basis of the figures we were given, the shortfall that will be inc urred if the property is to be sold for $550,000 is approximately $70,000 (after refunding the parties’ respec tive CPF c ontributions and repayment of the bank loan). It should be noted that the Husband had also obtained a lower valuation of $500,000 and if the property ac hieves a pric e c loser to that value then the shortfall would be even larger. Further, as the CPF has a first c harge on the property, the parties’ CPF c ontributions will have to be refunded in priority to the bank loan. This means that the parties are liable to be sued by the bank for the shortfall. 

30     The matrimonial home is presently in a bad state of disrepair and is infested with termites. It is c urrently unoc c upied. We were informed by the Husband during the hearing that the approximate c ost of repairing the property is $20,000 but no evidenc e was given in support of this. 

31     The order made by the c ourts below was that the matrimonial home should be sold within six months (see [9] above). The Wife c ontinued to press for an early sale whilst the Husband asked for a postponement. We are of the view that in the partic ular c irc umstanc es of this c ase, an immediate sale of the matrimonial home would be inequitable. As the parties’ CPF c ontributions will first have to be refunded, the Wife will get a _full_ refund of her direc t financ ial c ontributions. On the other hand, the Husband stands to lose his entire c ash down payment of $137,600. Indeed, the distric t judge made similar observations at [32] of his grounds of dec ision. In addition, given that the Wife is now residing in the UK, the Husband is, effec tively, the borrower who will, at least in the immediate future, have to shoulder the full burden of paying the bank the amount of the shortfall or fac e being sued by it. 

32     It therefore appears to us that the equitable thing to do would be to allow a postponement of the sale of the matrimonial home for a limited period to give him the c hanc e of selling it at a higher pric e. In the meantime, the matrimonial home c an be rented out and the rent rec eived c an be used to defray the c ost of repairs and to pay the loan instalments. It would, however, only be fair to grant the Husband’s prayer for a postponement for the sale if the Wife’s liability is not inc reased thereby. Therefore, for the period that the matrimonial home remains unsold the Husband must bear, solely, all the expenses relating to it inc luding the loan instalments, servic e c harge and property tax (though he may rec oup these from the rental proc eeds, if any) and suc h payments by him shall not affec t the 


proportions in whic h the parties own the property, namely, 64% to the Husband and 36% to the Wife (see [28] above). 

33     Ac c ordingly, we make the following orders with regards to the matrimonial home: 

 (a) The Husband shall be entitled to hold on to the matrimonial home for a period of up to three years from the date of the making of this order. During that period the Husband may, but shall not be obliged to, sell the matrimonial home. In the event the Husband dec ides to exerc ise his right of sale, he should give the Wife at least four weeks’ notic e of the c ompletion of the sale. Should the Wife fail to exec ute all doc uments nec essary to effec t the transfer within four weeks from rec eiving suc h notic e, the Registrar of the Supreme Court shall be empowered to exec ute the sale doc uments in the Wife’s stead. 

 (b) If the Husband does not sell the matrimonial home by the expiration of three years from the date of the making of this order, the Wife shall be entitled to effec t the sale. Similarly, she should give the Husband at least four weeks’ notic e. Should the Husband fail to exec ute the nec essary doc uments to effec t the transfer within four weeks from rec eiving suc h notic e, the Registrar of the Supreme Court shall be empowered to exec ute the nec essary doc uments to effec t the sale in the Husband’s stead. 

 (c ) The Husband shall bear the monthly loan instalments and all other expenses assoc iated with the matrimonial home until suc h time as the property is sold. 

 (d) Upon the sale of the matrimonial home, the net proc eeds of sale are to be divided between the Husband and the Wife in the proportions of 64:36 respec tively after deduc tion of the following: 

 (i) the refunds to both parties’ CPF ac c ounts of all moneys utilised for the ac quisition of the matrimonial home together with ac c rued interest; 

 (ii) the sum paid to settle the outstanding bank loan; 

 (iii) the Husband’s c ash c ontribution towards the initial down payment of $137,600. and stamp fees of $10,668.00 amounting to a total of $148,268.00; 

 (iv) the c osts of repair works c arried out to the extent that these have not already been rec overed from any rental proc eeds c ollec ted; and 

 (v) the c osts of sale inc luding legal c osts and housing agent’s c ommission. 

 On c ompletion of the sale, the Husband shall render to the Wife an ac c ount of the manner in whic h the sale proc eeds and the rental proc eeds, if any, have been applied and shall pay the Wife her proportionate share of any moneys that remain. 

 (e) If a loss is inc urred upon sale, the loss is to be apportioned between the Husband and the Wife in the proportions 64:36 respec tively. The Husband shall, if nec essary, be entitled to rec over from the Wife, as a debt due and payable to him, any amount whic h he has paid towards disc harging the loan that is in exc ess of the amount whic h the bank would have been able to rec over from him had it held him responsible for only 64% of the total outstanding amount, inc lusive of interest, payable to it. 


 (f ) Both parties shall have liberty to apply to the High Court, if nec essary, in c onnec tion with the implementation of these orders. 

**_Should the Wife be allowed a share in the Husband’s savings for indirectly contributing to them?_** 

34     We would like to address one final point. It appears that the c ourts below were strongly influenc ed by the c onsideration that, by paying the full amount of the monthly loan instalments for the matrimonial home, the Wife had indirec tly c ontributed to the Husband’s ability to financ e Malvern Springs. They c onc luded that this c onduc t entitled her to a share in Malvern Springs. Thus, the High Court judge observed at [16] of the GD: 

 In substance , however, the understanding between the parties never inc luded any partic ipation at all. But this did not mean that the Wife had relinquished her interest in the Malvern Springs property – or any of the matrimonial assets for that matter. It was a simple matter of division of financ ial labour, so to speak. Her contribution, in fact, to the purchase of the Malvern Springs property was in the form of relieving the Husband with respect to his otherwise heavier financial burdens vis-à-vis the matrimonial home. [emphasis added in bold italic s] 

35     We have already given our reasons above why the Wife should not be entitled to a share in Malvern Springs. The question remains: Should this c ourt on the other hand treat the Husband’s savings ac c umulated after the purc hase of the matrimonial home, whic h he used to partly financ e Malvern Springs, as a matrimonial asset that should be divided between the parties? 

36     We are of the view that the Wife should not get an additional sum on top of her direc t financ ial c ontributions for two reasons. Firstly, the monthly loan instalments paid by the Wife c onstituted direc t financ ial c ontributions and went towards inc reasing her perc entage share in the matrimonial home in the event of a divorc e. To allow her a sum in addition to her direc t financ ial c ontributions would be giving her an unnec essary bonus. It is indeed unfortunate that the matrimonial home has deprec iated in value, but this should not be a relevant fac tor for the c ourt to take into ac c ount espec ially when it divides matrimonial assets in ac c ordanc e with direc t financ ial c ontributions. It is also relevant to note that all these c ontributions c ame from her CPF ac c ount and therefore even if the property is sold at a loss, her c ontributions will be returned to her in full together with ac c rued interest. 

37     Sec ondly, allowing the Wife an additional sum would, in our view, be c ontrary to the parties’ original financ ial agreement. Let us relook the terms of this arrangement. When the matrimonial home was purc hased, the Husband paid a large initial c ash down payment of $137,600.00 from his savings. He additionally exhausted his CPF savings by making a lump sum payment of $74,740.46. Therefore, the most probable reason for the parties agreeing that the Wife should be responsible for the monthly loan instalments was simply that the Husband had exhausted the bulk of his c ash savings and his entire CPF savings. Notably, this arrangement subsisted long before the purc hase of Malvern Springs was c ontemplated. The basic point is that the parties would probably have c ontinued this financ ial arrangement _even if Malvern Springs had not been purchased_. Simply put, this appears to be the c rux of their arrangement – in so far as the matrimonial home was c onc erned, the Husband would make a large initial down payment and the Wife would pay the monthly instalments. 

38     This being so, we are unable to agree with the High Court judge’s observations reproduc ed at [34] above. In the first plac e, the parties’ financ ial arrangement never envisaged that the Husband should bear the financ ial burdens of c ontributing to the matrimonial home in so far as the monthly instalments were c onc erned. This being so, we find it somewhat artific ial to say that the Wife had, by 


her c ontributions, relieved the Husband of his financ ial burdens _vis-à-vis_ the matrimonial home. 

39     In any c ase, there was no evidenc e before us that the Wife had c laimed an entitlement to the Husband’s savings as a matrimonial asset. The only anc illary matters heard in the lower c ourts were with regards to maintenanc e and the division of the matrimonial home and Malvern Springs. 

**Conclusion** 

40     For the reasons given above, we allow the appeal and set aside the orders made below in relation to the division of matrimonial assets. They shall be replac ed by the orders set out in [33] above. The Husband shall be entitled to his c osts of the appeal before the High Court judge, to be taxed if not agreed. As regards the c osts of this appeal, as the Husband appeared in person he is not entitled to legal c osts but he shall be entitled to rec over reasonable disbursements in relation to this appeal. The sec urity deposit shall be refunded to him.
