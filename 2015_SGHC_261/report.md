**Lee Seiu Kin J:** 

**Introduction** 

1       This is a dispute arising out of payment for work done under a c onstruc tion sub-c ontrac t. 

**Background** 

2       In early 2010, the defendant appointed the plaintiff as its subc ontrac tor to c arry out ground improvement works by jet grout pile (“JGP”) method in the projec t titled proposed c ommon servic es tunnel (CST) at Downtown Marina Bay (“the MC01 Projec t”). The plaintiff was to install JGP c olumns with pre-set nominal widths at spec ified treatment depths, and would be paid $92 for every c ubic metre of soil treated. 

3       Signific antly, this was not the first time the parties had dealt with eac h other. Prior to the MC01 Projec t, the parties had worked on a projec t known as “Proposed Construc tion of C482 Marina Coastal Expressway Marina South – Sec tion 1” (“the C482 Projec t”). 

4       By way of bac kground, the JGP proc ess is a method of soil treatment involving the mixing of c ement grout into soil so that the resultant c emented soil forms a stable mass that c an support any struc ture above it, or form an impermeable layer against water ingress. The proc ess is c arried out in the following manner. A surveyor marks out the points at whic h JGP c olumns are to be installed. At eac h point, the JGP mac hine drills a hole to the required depth using a rod. Water is then injec ted at very high pressure through the rotating rod. This water pre-c utting erodes a c irc ular area of the soil and this is followed by injec tion of c ement grout. The rod is retrac ted at a predetermined rate so that a vertic al c ylinder of c emented soil to the required diameter and depth is left behind. The installation of multiple overlapping c olumns will eventually produc e an entire c onc rete bloc k of c emented soil. The overlaps between the c olumns ensure that there are no poc kets of untreated soil. 


5       The volume of soil treated by the installation of the first JGP c olumn would be the area of the c irc ular c ross sec tion of the c olumn multiplied by its length. This is the volume of the whole c olumn, or nominal volume. The volume of the JGP c olumn installed next to this first one will be less than the nominal volume. Onc e the first JGP c olumn has c ured, it will not be displac ed by the installation of an adjac ent c olumn. Therefore, the volume of soil treated in the sec ond JGP c olumn will be less than the nominal volume to the extent of the overlap of the two c irc les. Similarly a third c olumn would be reduc ed by two overlaps, and so on. A further c omplic ation arises where a JGP c olumn abuts sheet piles. These form a barrier to the soil treatment and the treatment would not go beyond the sheet piles. A JGP c olumn abutting sheet piles would therefore treat a smaller volume of soil than the nominal volume. 

6       The c ontrac t between the parties c alled for payment of $92 per c ubic metre of soil treated. In this suit, the defendant’s position was that payment would be based on the ac tual volume of soil treated and any overlap, whether with a neighbouring JGP c olumn or with sheet piles, would not be c ounted as otherwise there would be payment for untreated soil. The plaintiff’s position was that the overlaps should be rounded to a 10% deduc tion based on the nominal volumes of all JGP c olumns installed, and alternatively, that an 18% deduc tion should be used. 

**_The payment dispute_** 

7       The c ontrac tual works were c ompleted on 24 April 2012. Upon c ompletion, the plaintiff requested for the final ac c ount and release of retention monies. 

8       On the morning of 21 January 2013, the defendant put out a Statement of Final Ac c ounts (“1SOFA”) that valued the plaintiff’s work at $2,419,789.61. 1SOFA was prepared on the basis of a 17% deduc tion per c olumn ( _ie_ , regardless of ac tual overlaps). After deduc ting bac k c harges of $378,832.87 and previous payments of $1,841,920.64, 1SOFA indic ated that an outstanding balanc e of $199,036.10 was due to the plaintiff. 

9       Some six hours later, the defendant produc ed a revised Statement of Final Ac c ount (“2SOFA”), whic h valued the plaintiff’s work at $1,924,462.58. 2SOFA was purportedly prepared on the basis of the volume of the JGP c olumns installed by the plaintiff, nett of the ac tual overlaps ( _ie_ , not a fixed deduc tion). After deduc ting bac k c harges and previous payments, the revised doc ument showed a negative balanc e ( _ie_ , an overpayment) of $296,290.93. 

10     The plaintiff ac c epted the deduc tions made by the defendant for bac k c harges. However, it disputed the defendant’s valuation of the work done. Ac c ording to the plaintiff, the c orrec t valuation of the works was $2,670,818.74. This figure translated to an unpaid balanc e of $481,569.80 due to the plaintiff, after ac c ounting for the bac k c harges and previous payments. The plaintiff’s valuation was derived by deduc ting 10% (a fixed perc entage) from the nominal volume of the JGP c olumns installed by the plaintiff, and multiplying that figure by the unit rate of $92 per c ubic metre. 

11     On 9 September 2013, the plaintiff c ommenc ed the present ac tion, c laiming the unpaid value of its works. On 17 Oc tober 2013, the defendant filed its defenc e and c ounterc laimed for $62,886.07 for overpayment to the plaintiff, and $55,348.40 for outstanding mac hinery rental inc urred by the plaintiff. The plaintiff admitted liability for the outstanding mac hinery rental. 

12     Up to this point, the plaintiff was relying on its valuation of $2,670,818.74 (after applying the 10% fixed deduc tion). The defendant had at various points, produc ed different valuations: 

 (a) 21 January 2013 (at 10.25a.m.): $2,419,789.61. 


 (b) 22 January 2013 (at 4.27p.m.): $1,924,462.58. 

 (c ) 17 Oc tober 2013: $2,157,867.44. 

**_The versions of the Agreement_** 

13     There are two versions of the c ontrac t, one produc ed by eac h party, with slightly different terms. 

14     In the plaintiff’s version (“the Plaintiff’s Contrac t”), the term “triangle grid spac ing” is used in item 2 of Appendix A – Sc hedule of Pric es, as follows: 

2\. Supply and install nominal 1600mm, 1800mm & 2000mm diameter with _triangle grid spacing_ to the required treatment depth as per Civil Tec h’s Consultant design and drawing (quantities are provisional). 

 [emphasis added] 

15     In the defendant’s version (“the Defendant’s Contrac t”), the term “triangle grid spac ing” is not used. Item 2 of Appendix A – Sc hedule of Pric es in the Defendant’s Contrac t states as follows: 

2\. Supply & install jet grout piles, drilling c ommenc ing from existing ground level to required design depth varies from 17 to 36m, treatment depth varies from 1.5 to 4m, all in ac c ordanc e to Spec ific ation and drawing ( _Quantity shall measure nett on as-built drawing)_ 

 [emphasis added] 

16     There are two issues to be determined to resolve the dispute between the parties: 

 (a) Whether the Plaintiff’s Contrac t or the Defendant’s Contrac t represented the final agreement between the parties. 

 (b) How the plaintiff’s work should be measured. 

**Which version is the binding contract** 

17     The parties agree that there was an earlier version of the agreement and that it was revised at an unasc ertained date. This revised version c onstituted the c ontrac t between them. The sole question is whether this was the Plaintiff’s Contrac t or the Defendant’s Contrac t. 

18     The plaintiff’s sole witness was Chim Chee Kan (“Mr Chim”) who was its exec utive direc tor at the material time. He testified that he went to the defendant’s offic e and was provided with the Defendant’s Contrac t in duplic ate. He proc eeded to sign the ac c eptanc e page of both c opies. He then affixed the plaintiff’s c ompany stamp on every page of the doc ument and initialled eac h page of it, starting from the last page and proc eeding to the first. However he stopped initialling midway as he notic ed terms that were not in order. He requested for amendments to be made and returned the duplic ates to Dora Tay (“Ms Tay”), the defendant’s c ontrac ts manager. He testified that it was this amended version, whic h is the Plaintiff’s Contrac t, that was the one that the parties had agreed to. 

19     The defendant takes a diametric ally opposite position. The defendant submits that the Defendant’s Contrac t reflec ts the final agreement between the parties. The defendant’s projec t 


direc tor at the material time, Chua Thing Chong (“Mr Chua”) testified that, he re-read the Plaintiff’s Contrac t sometime after the doc ument was signed by all the relevant parties. It was at this point that he realised Appendix A – Sc hedule of Pric es of the Plaintiff’s Contrac t did not provide that the plaintiff would be paid on the basis of nett treated volume, as was agreed between the parties. Thus, he instruc ted Ms Tay to amend the Plaintiff’s Contrac t, and the Defendant’s Contrac t was the produc t of this amendment. 

**_Decision_** 

20     After c areful c onsideration of the evidenc e of the witnesses, I am satisfied that the Plaintiff’s Contrac t had c ome later in time. Unlike Mr Chua’s ac c ount whic h appears to be largely unc orroborated, I find Mr Chim’s ac c ount of events to be largely c onsistent with the c ontemporaneous evidenc e. I set out my reasons below. 

_Versions of the Defendant’s Contract_ 

21     I note that the defendant had produc ed two different c opies of the Defendant’s Contrac t _ie_ , with slight differenc es in the plac ement of the signatures and c ompany stamps on eac h c opy. This indic ates that the defendant had retained both c opies of the Defendant’s Contrac t after they were signed. This means that a c opy of the Defendant’s Contrac t was not handed to the plaintiff, whic h is c onsistent with the plaintiff’s position that this was not the final version of the c ontrac t between them bec ause if it was, then the defendant would not be in possession of both c opies as one would be handed to the plaintiff. Indeed in both versions of the c ontrac t it is stated that “the duplic ate c opy is for [the subc ontrac tor’s] retention”. I further note that this part of the evidenc e appears to c orroborate another aspec t of Mr Chim’s evidenc e – his c laim that he had returned to the defendant the duplic ates of the Defendant’s Contrac t for amendments to be made. 

_Discrepancies between both versions of the contract_ 

22     I shall now proc eed to examine other relevant disc repanc ies between both versions of the c ontrac t. 

Missing initials 

23     The parties had a prac tic e of initialling every page of c ontrac ts, aside from the enc losures. The c learest evidenc e of this prac tic e may be found in the main body of the Plaintiff’s Contrac t whic h bears the initials of Mr Chim, Mr Chua and Mr Tan Hang Meng (“Mr Tan”), the defendant’s managing direc tor. In c ontrast, some of these initials were c onspic uously absent from the main body of the Defendant’s Contrac t. Although Mr Tan’s full signature appeared near the end of the main body of the Defendant’s Contrac t, his initials were missing from the rest of the doc ument. It is also signific ant to note that Mr Chim’s initials were also missing from the first five pages of the Defendant’s Contrac t. 

24     On balanc e, I find that the missing initials lend c redenc e to Mr Chim’s ac c ount of events. The absenc e of Mr Chim’s initials on the first five pages of the Defendant’s Contrac t is c onsistent with his evidenc e that he started initialling the doc ument from bac k to front, but stopped when he realised that the terms of the Defendant’s Contrac t were not in order. 

25     The defendant, on the other hand, was unable to disc redit Mr Chim’s ac c ount of events. Mr Chua sought to downplay the signific anc e of the missing initials and insisted that the Defendant’s Contrac t was valid notwithstanding the missing initials sinc e the “c ruc ial part” of the doc ument _ie_ , the ac knowledgement and ac c eptanc e page, was signed. This argument c learly misses the point. The 


c rux of the dispute is whether the Plaintiff’s Contrac t or the Defendant’s Contrac t evidenc es the final agreement between the parties. The fac t that the ac knowledgement and ac c eptanc e page of the Defendant’s Contrac t was signed does not solve the c onundrum sinc e the same c ould be said for the Plaintiff’s Contrac t. 

26     Although Mr Chua also attempted to explain the absenc e of Mr Tan’s initial by suggesting that the latter might have been too busy to initial the Defendant’s Contrac t given the c ompany’s phenomenal growth from a $10mc ompany to a $400m c ompany within two years, his explanation did not stand sc rutiny bec ause Mr Tan had time to initial the Plaintiff’s Contrac t as well as the c ontrac t for the C482 Projec t. This fac t is c ertainly more c onsistent with the plaintiff’s position than that of the defendant. 

Numbering of sub-c lauses in c l 2 

27     The defendant took pains to stress that the sub-c lauses in c l 2 of the Defendant’s Contrac t were logic ally numbered whereas the same c lauses in the Plaintiff’s Contrac t were not. The defendant asserted that it would be illogic al that the c ontrac t would have been re-numbered in the manner shown in the Plaintiff’s Contrac t. 

28     I am not persuaded by this argument as it does not unequivoc ally lead to the c onc lusion that the Defendant’s Contrac t c ame later in time. It is equally possible that the numbering was disrupted when the Plaintiff’s Contrac t was amended to the Defendant’s Contrac t. I do not think that this point favours one version over the other. 

_Adverse inference for failing to call Ms Tay_ 

29     The reasons given above are suffic ient to support a finding that the Plaintiff’s Contrac t c ame later in time. However I would like to also address the plaintiff’s argument that an adverse inferenc e should be drawn against the defendant for failing to c all Ms Tay and Mr Tan as witnesses at the trial. Ac c ording to the plaintiff, Ms Tay is the person who would be in the best position to c larify matters suc h as the date on whic h the c ontrac t was amended and identify the version of the c ontrac t that evidenc es the final agreement between the parties, whereas Mr Tan would be best plac ed to explain why, c ontrary to what he did for previous c ontrac ts, he did not put his initials on the Defendant’s Contrac t. 

30     The defendant c ounters this submission by c ontending that the issue of c ontrac t amendment only arose during the trial and prior to that, it was not possible to tell that Ms Tay’s evidenc e would be relevant. However, there was no explanation offered for Mr Tan’s absenc e. 

31     I am of the view that an adverse inferenc e should be drawn against the defendant for failing to c all Ms Tay as a witness. However, it is not appropriate to do the same for the defendant’s failure to c all Mr Tan. 

32     In the proc ess of litigation, parties have the prerogative to c all all witnesses they deem nec essary to advanc e their c ase. While they may elec t not to exerc ise this prerogative, the c ourt is entitled to presume that “evidenc e whic h c ould be and is not produc ed would if produc ed be unfavourable to the person who withholds it”. Ac c ording to Newton and Norris JJ in _O’Donnell v Reichard_ [1975] VR 916 at 929: 

 [W]here a party without explanation fails to c all as a witness a person whom he might reasonably be expec ted to c all, if that person’s evidenc e would be favourable to him, then, although the jury 


 may not treat as evidenc e what they may as a matter of spec ulation think that person would have said if he had been c alled as a witness, nevertheless it is open to the jury to infer that that person’s evidenc e would not have helped the party’s c ase; if the jury draw that inferenc e, then they may properly take it into ac c ount against the party in question for two purposes, namely: (a) in dec iding whether to ac c ept any partic ular evidenc e, whic h has in fac t been given, either for or against that party, and whic h relates to a matter with respec t to whic h the person not c alled as a witness c ould have spoken; and (b) in dec iding whether to draw inferenc es of fac t, whic h are open to them upon evidenc e whic h has been given, again in relation to matters with respec t to whic h the person not c alled as a witness c ould have spoken. [emphasis in original] 

33     In Singapore, the sourc e of the c ourt’s power to draw suc h an inferenc e lies in s 116( _g_ ) of the Evidenc e Ac t, whic h relevantly provides: 

 Court may presume existence of certain fact 

116\. The c ourt may presume the existenc e of any fac t whic h it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the c ommon c ourse of natural events, human c onduc t, and public and private business, in their relation to the fac ts of the partic ular c ase. 

 ... 

 ( g ) that evidenc e whic h c ould be and is not produc ed would if produc ed be unfavourable to the person who withholds it; 

34     In _Cheong Ghim Fah and another v Murugian s/o Rangasamy_ <span class="citation">[2004] 1 SLR(R) 628</span> at [42], V K Rajah JC endorsed the following princ iples laid down by the English Court of Appeal in _Wisniewski v Central Manchester Health Authority_ [1998] 5 PIQR 324: 

 (1) In c ertain c irc umstanc es a c ourt may be entitled to draw adverse inferenc es from the absenc e or silenc e of a witness who might be expec ted to have material evidenc e to give on an issue in an ac tion. 

 (2) If a c ourt is willing to draw suc h inferenc es, they may go to strengthen the evidenc e adduc ed on that issue by the other party or to weaken the evidenc e, if any, adduc ed by the party who might reasonably have been expec ted to c all the witness. 

 (3) There must, however, have been some evidenc e, however weak, adduc ed by the former on the matter in question before the c ourt is entitled to draw the desired inferenc e: in other words, there must be a c ase to answer on that issue. 

 (4) If the reason for the witness’s absenc e or silenc e satisfies the c ourt, then no suc h adverse inferenc e may be drawn. If, on the other hand, there is some c redible explanation given, even if it is not wholly satisfac tory, the potentially detrimental effec t of his/her absenc e or silenc e may be reduc ed or nullified. 

 [ per Brooke LJ] 

35     Before an adverse inferenc e may be drawn against a party for the absenc e of a material witness, the c ourt must be satisfied of the availability and materiality of the evidenc e. I am of the view that both elements are satisfied _vis-à-vis_ Ms Tay for the following reasons: 


 (a) Availability: Under c ross-examination, Mr Chua said that Ms Tay remained in the employ of the defendant c ompany. He did not say that she was unavailable. 

 (b) Materiality: Ms Tay is the key person to shed light on the c irc umstanc es surrounding the signing of the c ontrac t. The failure to c all her as a witness resulted in the situation in whic h neither party c ould tell the c ourt when exac tly the c ontrac t was signed or amended. 

36     That said, I am not suffic iently c onvinc ed about the materiality of the evidenc e that Mr Tan would have given, had he been c alled to testify at the trial. Apart from the ac t of signing and/or initialling the c ontrac t, there is no suggestion by the parties that Mr Tan’s evidenc e would have been material to the other issues at the trial. The only real reason to c all him as a witness would be to c larify why he did not initial on all the pages of the Defendant’s Contrac t when he had done so for the Plaintiff’s Contrac t. His evidenc e appears to be of limited relevanc e. This is rather unlike the situation _vis-à-vis_ Ms Tay who was personally involved in the preparation and drafting of the c ontrac t. 

37     In view of the above, the adverse inferenc e drawn against the defendant for failing to c all Ms Tay added another string to the plaintiff’s evidential bow. For c ompleteness, I would like to address a few other points raised by the defendant whic h I c onsidered and rejec ted. 

_Additional observations_ 

Projec t manager 

38     The defendant c ontends that Mr Ong Kok Peng’s (“Mr Ong”)designation as the projec t manager in the Defendant’s Contrac t suggests that the Defendant’s Contrac t c ame later in time. The Plaintiff’s Contrac t states that Gan Kok Leong (“Mr Gan”) was the projec t manager, whereas Defendant’s Contrac t states Mr Ong as the projec t manager. Ac c ording to the affidavits of Mr Chua and Mr Ong, Mr Ong was eventually appointed the projec t manager of MC01 Projec t around July 2010, to replac e the original projec t manager, Mr Gan, who was reassigned. Therefore, the defendant argues that this fac tor alone shows that Defendant’s Contrac t c ame later in time bec ause it reflec ts an ac c urate update as to the identity of the projec t manager. 

39     I am not c onvinc ed. _First_ , there is no c lear evidenc e that Mr Ong was appointed the projec t manager of MC01 Projec t around July 2010; the objec tive evidenc e showed that Mr Ong was only appointed the projec t manager around July 2011. Mr Ong testified that he was appointed the projec t manager around July 2011. This is borne out by the doc umentary evidenc e sinc e he was only reflec ted as the projec t manager in payment c ertific ates issued after July 2011. 

40     _Second_ , it is impossible to draw the c onc lusion that the Plaintiff’s Contrac t was amended to reflec t Mr Ong’s updated designation. On the defendant’s own c ase, the c ontrac t was amended somewhere between late June 2010 (when the first interim valuation was issued) and Oc tober 2010 (when the sec ond interim valuation was issued). Thus, the amendment would have c ome quite a long way before Mr Ong was ac tually appointed the projec t manager. 

41     In this regard, it is equally important to note that the last payment c ertific ate, as well as 1SOFA and 2SOFA, were signed by Mr Gan bec ause Mr Ong was later reassigned to another projec t. If anything, this goes to show that there may be multiple c hanges of projec t managers over the c ourse of one projec t. Thus, Mr Ong’s designation in the Defendant’s Contrac t and his subsequent assignment as the projec t manager c ould be a mere fac tual c oinc idenc e. Seen in that light, the signific anc e of Mr Ong’s designation in the Defendant’s Contrac t is greatly reduc ed. 

Removal of “quantity shall measure nett on as-built drawing” 


Removal of “quantity shall measure nett on as-built drawing” 

42     The defendant argues that sinc e the phrase “quantity shall measure nett on as-built drawing” was more favourable to the defendant, it is inherently illogic al that Mr Chua would have amended the Defendant’s Contrac t to remove those words. However the same c ould be said about the Plaintiff’s Contrac t. Sinc e the plaintiff c laims that the term “triangle grid spac ing” favoured its c laim, it would be similarly illogic al for the plaintiff to agree to an amended c ontrac t that omits that term. Thus, the defendant’s argument is essentially self-serving and devoid of merit. 

43     Looking at the matter in the round, whilst there are indeed shortc omings in the plaintiff’s evidenc e, there remains suffic ient evidenc e to show on a balanc e of probabilities that the Plaintiff’s Contrac t c ame later in time, and therefore doc umented the final agreement between the parties. 

**How the contract should be interpreted** 

44     To re-c ap, following from my finding that the Plaintiff’s Contrac t evidenc es the final agreement between the parties, it leaves to be determined the method of measuring the work done by the plaintiff. The parties agree that the final sub-c ontrac t sum shall be asc ertained by re-measurement based on approved _as-built drawings_. This is provided for in c l 2.3 of both versions of the c ontrac t. 

**_Adequacy of plaintiff’s pleadings_** 

45     Before delving into the parties’ submissions proper, I shall deal with the defendant’s preliminary objec tions to the plaintiff’s c ase. The main thrust of the defendant’s objec tions is that the fixed deduc tions of 5.77%, 10% and 18% were never pleaded. 

46     Pleadings serve to define the dispute between parties: _Bullen & Leake and Jacob’s Precedents of Pleadings_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 17th Ed, 2012) vol 1, para 1-01. The func tion of pleadings have been summarised by the High Court of Australia in _Dare v Pulham_ (1982) 148 CLR 658 (at p 664): 

 Pleadings and partic ulars have a number of func tions: they furnish a statement of the c ase suffic iently c lear to allow the other party a fair opportunity to meet it ( Gould and Birbeck and Bacon v. Mount Oxide Mines Ltd. (In liq.) [(1916) 22 CLR 490, at p 517]; they define the issues for dec ision in the litigation and thereby enable the relevanc e and admissibility of evidenc e to be determined at the trial ( Miller v. Cameron [(1936) 54 CLR 572], at pp 576-577; and they give a defendant an understanding of a plaintiff's c laim in aid of the defendant's right to make a payment into c ourt. ... 

47     In _NEC Semi-Conductors Ltd v The Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs_ [2006] EWCA Civ 25, Mummery LJ added a further gloss to the issue (at [131]: 

 While it is good sense not to be pernic kety about pleadings, the basic requirement that material fac ts should be pleaded is there for a good reason—so that the other side c an respond to the pleaded c ase by way of admission or denial of fac ts, thereby defining the issues for dec ision for the benefit of the parties and the c ourt. Proper pleading of the material fac ts is essential for the orderly progress of the c ase and for its sound determination. The definition of the issues has an impac t on suc h important matters as disc losure of relevant doc uments and the relevant oral evidenc e to be adduc ed at trial. In my view, the fac t that the nature of the grievanc e may be obvious to the respondent or that the respondent c an ask for further information to be supplied by the c laimant are not normally valid exc uses for a c laimant’s failure to formulate and serve a properly pleaded c ase setting out the material fac ts in support of the c ause of ac tion. ... 


48     As pleadings form the bac kbone of a litigation, parties are stric tly bound by their pleadings and the c ourt may not dec ide on issues not raised therein: _Kiaw Aik Hang Co Ltd v Tan Tien Choy_ [1964] MLJ 99. Moreover, the defic ienc ies in pleadings may not be made good by affidavit evidenc e or other forms of evidenc e: Jeffrey Pinsler, _Supreme Court Practice 2014_ vol 1 (Lexis Nexis 2014) at para 18/19/4. 

49     More rec ently, in _Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2013] 4 SLR 193</span> (at [73]), the Court of Appeal highlighted the signific anc e of proper pleadings where parties attempt to introduc e c ontextual evidenc e to c onstrue a c ontrac t. 

 ... Therefore, to buttress the evidentiary qualific ations to the c ontextual approac h to the c onstruc tion of a c ontrac t, the imposition of four requirements of c ivil proc edure are, in our view, timely and essential: 

 (a) first, parties who c ontend that the fac tual matrix is relevant to the c onstruc tion of the c ontrac t must plead with spec ific ity eac h fac t of the fac tual matrix that they wish to rely on in support of their c onstruc tion of the c ontrac t; 

 (b) sec ond, the fac tual c irc umstanc es in whic h the fac ts in (a) were known to both or all the relevant parties must also be pleaded with suffic ient partic ularity; 

 (c ) third, parties should in their pleadings spec ify the effec t whic h suc h fac ts will have on their c ontended c onstruc tion; and 

 (d) fourth, the obligation of parties to disc lose evidenc e would be limited by the extent to whic h the evidenc e are relevant to the fac ts pleaded in (a) and (b). 

_Fixed deduction of 5.77%_ 

50     In the statement of c laim, the plaintiff pleaded that the “nett volume of eac h triangle grid” (the “triangle grid method”) was to be used to c ompute the work done by the plaintiff, and that the method was borne out by the c ourse of dealing between the parties as well as industry norms. However, the statement of c laim did not define the triangle grid method, and did not plead the quantity of work done. These details were only provided in the reply dated 8 November 2013 in the following manner: 

 (a) In Annex B of the reply, the plaintiff alluded to a 5.77% deduc tion by setting out an area ratio of 94.23%. 

 (b) At para 49 of the reply, the plaintiff stated the total quantity of work done to be 27, 943.682 c ubic metres. 

51     The defendant argues that the plaintiff has failed to plead the fundamental basis of its c laim, and that this defic ienc y is fatal to the plaintiff’s c laim. To this end, the defendant c ites the Court of Appeal dec ision in _Romar Positioning Equipment Pte Ltd v Merriwa Nominees Pty Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2004] 4 SLR(R) 574</span> (“ _Romar Positioning_ ”) for the proposition that the reply c annot be used to supplement the statement of c laim. 

52     I do not ac c ept the defendant’s c ontention. Whilst parties may not raise new c laims in the reply, the rule does not go so far as to prevent a party from further partic ularising or supplementing a point that has been raised in a previous pleading. The general rule is that a party may plead any 


matter whic h has arisen at any time, whether before or sinc e the issue of the writ: O 18 r 9 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed)(“ROC”). However, this right is qualified by O 18 r 10(1) of the ROC whic h provides: 

 A party shall not in any pleading make an allegation of fac t, or raise any new ground or c laim, inconsistent with a previous pleading of his. 

 [emphasis added] 

53     In the present c ase, the plaintiff did not seek to introduc e an inc onsistent plea in the reply. What it did was to partic ularise the triangle grid method whic h was pleaded in the statement of c laim. 

54     Furthermore, the c ase of _Romar Positioning_ does not quite assist the defendant. The c irc umstanc es in that c ase were very different. The respondent inc luded, in its amended reply, a position that was diametric ally opposite to that adopted in its statement of c laim. On that basis, the Court of Appeal found that the respondent had introduc ed an inc onsistent plea whic h should have been made in the alternative in the statement of c laim. 

55     Sinc e the plaintiff was entitled to supplement the statement of c laim in the reply, the failure to mention the 5.77% deduc tion in the statement of c laim is not fatal to its c ase. 

_Fixed deductions of 10% and 18%_ 

56     I am of the view that the plaintiff is not entitled to rely on the deduc tions of 10% and 18% bec ause these perc entages were not inc luded in its pleadings. It is trite that defic ient pleadings may not be c ured by the evidenc e in an affidavit and other form. This point is made abundantly c lear in _Abdul Latif bin Mohammed Tahiar (trading as Canary Agencies) v Saeed Husain s/o Hakim Gulam Mohiudin (trading as United Limousine)_ <span class="citation">[2003] 2 SLR(R) 61</span> MPH Rubin J said (at [7]): 

 ... It is a settled princ iple of law that parties stand by their pleaded c ase and any defec t in the pleadings c annot be c ured by any averments in affidavits, let alone an oblique referenc e in c ounsel’s c losing speec h ... 

57     Although the plaintiff c laims to have pleaded an estoppel on the basis of an 18% deduc tion, it c learly did not do so. The relevant parts of the statement of c laim read as follows: 

 10 ... The Plaintiffs aver that eac h payment invoic ed was without exc eption c ertified as due and owing by the Projec t Quantity Surveyor, and/or Manager, and/or Direc tor on the basis that the Plaintiffs were, pursuant to the terms of the SubContrac t Agreement, entitled to payment to be c omputed ac c ording to the volume of each triangle grid as opposed to the volume of the total treated area. The Plaintiffs will further aver that the Defendants are in the premises, estopped from denying that the payment was to be c omputed on that basis. Further or in the alternative, the Plaintiffs plead an estoppel by convention arises [sic] in this regard. 

 11 The Plaintiffs will further plac e relianc e on the previous c ourse of dealing between the parties and the industry norms to aver that the SubContrac t Agreement referred to c osting on the basis of nett volume of each triangle grid. 

 [emphasis added] 

58     As is c lear from above, the pleaded estoppel pertained only to the triangle grid method, whic h 


ac c ording to the plaintiff, entails a 5.77% deduc tion. In the c ourse of the trial the plaintiff realised its pleadings were defic ient in relation to the 10% and 18% deduc tions and applied to amend its statement of c laim to inc lude these perc entages. However that applic ation was withdrawn in the fac e of objec tions from the defendant. In my view, there is no pleading that states the plaintiff’s alternative c ase of 10% and 18% deduc tions. Therefore the plaintiff is not entitled to any findings in this regard whatever the state of the evidenc e. 

59     On a related note, the plaintiff attempts to rely on the same estoppel argument as a defenc e to the c ounterc laim. However, sinc e the point has not been pleaded in the statement of c laim _or_ the reply, the plaintiff may not rely on it. 

60     I ac c ept that the c ourt is free to depart from the pleaded meanings to c onstrue the c ontrac t sinc e an objec tive interpretation of a c ontrac tual term “is quite different from listening to the parties’ version of what they eac h meant”: _Quainoo v NZ Breweries Ltd_ [1991] 1 NZLR 161 at 165, line 18. However, parties are not permitted to put forth a c ase that is c learly inc onsistent with its pleaded c ase. 

61     In view of my findings, the only issues that fall to be determined are as follows: 

 (a) whether, upon a proper c onstruc tion of the c ontrac t, the parties intended to adopt the triangle grid method ( ie , 5.77% deduc tion) or the treated area method to c ompute work done by the plaintiff; or 

 (b) whether the defendant is estopped by c onvention from denying that the triangle grid method ( ie , 5.77% deduc tion) applies to c ompute work done by the plaintiff. 

**_Measurement of the plaintiff’s work_** 

62     The modern starting point of c ontrac tual interpretation may be found in Lord Hoffmann’s statement in _Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society_ [1998] 1 WLR 896 (at 912H) that: 

 Interpretation is the asc ertainment of the meaning whic h the doc ument would c onvey to a reasonable person having all the bac kground knowledge whic h would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in whic h they were at the time of the c ontrac t. 

63     The c ourt has no power to improve upon the instrument whic h it is c alled upon to c onstrue, whether it be a c ontrac t, a statute or artic les of assoc iation. It naturally follows that the c ourt may not introduc e terms to make the c ontrac t fairer or more reasonable: _Attorney General of Belize and others v Belize Telecom Ltd and another_ [2009] 1 WLR 1988 at [16]. 

64     Contrac tual terms must be c onstrued in the light of the _context_ in whic h they were drafted. The relevanc e of the c ontext c annot be overstated. As stated by Lord Hoffmann in _Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd_ [2005] RPC 169 at [64]: 

 No one has ever made an ac ontextual statement. There is always some c ontext to any utteranc e, however meagre. 

However, as I have earlier observed (at [49]), suc h c ontextual evidenc e may only be introduc ed if it has been properly pleaded. 

_5.77% deduction_ 


_5.77% deduction_ 

65     The sub-c ontrac t sum is derived from the produc t of the agreed unit rate and the quantity of work done. 

 ( a ) Agreed unit rate: The parties agree that the unit rate was fixed at $92 per c ubic metre. The issue of “per c ubic metre” of what is addressed in (b) below. 

 ( b ) Quantity of work done: The parties also agree that the quantum of work done was to be asc ertained through re-measurement on the basis of information provided by approved as-built drawings. However, the parties disagree as to how suc h re-measurement was to be c arried out. 

The plaintiff’s c ase 

66     The plaintiff c ontends that the _triangle grid method_ was to be used to ac c ount for the overlaps between the c olumns. A “triangle grid” refers to an arrangement of JGP c olumns within a group suc h that the c entres of three adjac ent c irc ular piles form a triangle, as shown in the figure below: 

67     In suc h a triangle grid (c omprising only of three c irc les), there are _three_ overlaps. This gives an average of one overlap per c irc le (and c onsequently, per JGP c olumn). This arrangement results mathematic ally in eac h overlap area to be 5.77% (rounded to the nearest 0.01%) of the area of eac h c irc le. On this basis, the plaintiff c ontends that 5.77% should be deduc ted from the total nominal volume of the JGP c olumns installed by the plaintiff. 

68     At the heart of the plaintiff’s c ase lies the term “triangle grid spac ing” whic h appears at Appendix A – Sc hedule of Pric es of the Plaintiff’s Contrac t: 

 Supply and install nominal 1600mm, 1800mm & 2000mm diameter with triangle grid spacing to the required treatment depth as per Civil Tec h’s Consultant design and drawing (quantities are provisional). 

 [emphasis added] 

The plaintiff c ontends that the term “triangle grid spac ing” means a fixed deduc tion of 5.77% per pile on the basis of the three c olumn c onfiguration illustrated in [66] above. This means that the plaintiff was entitled to payment for 94.23% of the nominal volume of its JGP c olumns. 

69     Ac c ording to the plaintiff, this interpretation of “triangle grid spac ing” is borne out by the _parties’ course of dealing_ and _industry norms_. To establish c ourse of dealing, the plaintiff relied on a previous c ontrac t between the same parties. This was the c ontrac t dated 23 Dec ember 2009 for the C482 Projec t. There, the same or similar terminology was employed, and the plaintiff c ontends that it was c learly understood by parties to refer to c osting on the basis of the nett volume of eac h triangle grid. 

70     The plaintiff brought in two expert witnesses to establish industry norms with respec t to the 


triangle grid method. The first, Mr Martin Anthony Riddett (“Mr Riddett”) gave evidenc e that besides “a method of work, [the triangle grid] c an also be a referenc e for pric ing purpose”. The sec ond, Mr Er Murthy Abhishek (“Mr Abhishek”) gave evidenc e that the triangle grid method is the “most c ommon method” of measurement. 

The defendant’s c ase 

71     The defendant c ontends that the triangle grid was a method of c onstruc tion, not a method used to c alc ulate work done. _First_ , the defendant argues that the triangle grid method does not make any allowanc e for ac tual further overlaps that would oc c ur in the c ourse of c onstruc tion. Sinc e the triangle grids will eventually form an entire c onc rete bloc k, the assumption of one overlap per JGP c olumn is _inaccurate_. The defendant c ites as example the situation of seven interloc king JGP c olumns, as shown below: 

72     In suc h a situation where Column X was installed after Columns 1–6, its volume would be reduc ed by six times of 5.77%, _ie_ , approximately 34.6%. At this point, it is worth noting that in the situation where there is a large number of c olumns, there would be an average of three overlaps per c olumn and the reduc tion in volume for eac h c olumn would be 3 x 5.77%, whic h works out to 17.3%. This figure is signific ant as it is c lose to the 18% deduc tion used by the defendant in making progress payments to the plaintiff. 

73     Besides that, the defendant asserts that the perc entage to be deduc ted per JGP c olumn c ould go up to 53.2% in a c ase where the JGP c olumn overlaps with four other c olumns as well as sheet piles as shown in the diagram below. 

7       4 _Second_ , the defendant c ontends that the triangle grid method fails to ac c ount for situations where an equilateral triangle has not been formed _eg_ , where the three-pile group c onsists of one pile of a different diameter. The formula operates on the assumption that the c entres of the three c olumns form an equilateral triangle. 

75     Furthermore, the defendant stresses the fac t that the 5.77% deduc tion was never mentioned until 25 June 2012, after the plaintiff’s works were c ompleted. On 25 June 2012, Mr Chim sent Mr Ong an email that reads: 


 We refer to our meeting on the 22nd June 2012 at your site offic e. 

 We are pleased to attac h the c omputation of effec tive area of treatment by JGP method using triangle spac ing as per our disc ussion last Friday. 

 We would like you to review the attac hment and we c an meet soon to finalized [ sic ] the subc ontrac t’s final ac c ount. 

76     The defendant argues that the above email did not refer to any pre-existing understanding of the triangle grid method, and that even then, it was not obvious to a reader how the plaintiff was c alc ulating its final c laim. 

77     In light of the aforementioned diffic ulties with the c onc ept of the triangle grid method, the defendant c ontends that the “nett volume of the total treated area” should be preferred (“treated area method”). This method takes into ac c ount the ac tual overlaps and deduc ts them from the nominal volume of the JGP c olumns. 

Dec ision 

78     I do not ac c ept that the plaintiff’s c onc ept of the triangle grid method was the c ontrac tually agreed method of re-measurement. Besides the inherent problems with the triangle grid formula, I am of the view that the plaintiff’s evidenc e failed to demonstrate c redibly that the term “triangle grid spac ing” entailed the applic ation of the triangle grid method. 

7       9 _First_ , c ontrary to what the plaintiff alleged, the C482 Projec t had nothing to do with the triangle grid method. In that projec t, the plaintiff had c onsistently c laimed on the basis of a 10% deduc tion but the defendant had c ertified those c laims on the basis of a 17%–18% deduc tion. It should be noted this is c lose to the figure of 17.3%, whic h is the average deduc tion per pile in the situation where a large number of piles are installed using the “triangle grid spac ing” set out in the MC01 Projec t. 

8       0 _Second_ , the plaintiff’s expert failed to c ast light on any industry prac tic e with respec t to the triangle grid method. Mr Abhishek made an _unsubstantiated_ c laim that the triangle grid method was the “most c ommon method” of re-measurement. He did not c ite in support of his opinion any related literature, industry guidelines or other sourc es. Notably, Mr Abhishek c onc eded during c rossexamination that although there would normally be deduc tions made, the prec ise amount of deduc tion was left to the parties. Like Mr Abhishek, Mr Riddett was also hard-pressed to c ite examples of subc ontrac t or industry guidelines applying the triangle grid method. 

81     Most signific antly, Mr Chim c onc eded under c ross examination that the 5.77% deduc tion was never disc ussed during his negotiations with the defendant. In the c irc umstanc es, it is quite likely that the 5.77% deduc tion was a mere afterthought c onjured by the plaintiff. 

82     How then should the plaintiff’s work be quantified? Although the plaintiff submits that the parties had intended to esc hew the treated area method by removing the phrase “quantity shall measure nett on as-built drawing” from Appendix A – Sc hedule of Pric es of the Defendant’s Contrac t, I am unable to agree. In my judgment, the removal of “quantity shall measure nett on as-built drawing” does not exc lude the defendant’s method of valuation. This is bec ause the following words in c l 2.3 of the Plaintiff’s Contrac t are suffic iently broad to enc apsulate the treated area method: 

 Payment and final SubContrac t Sum shall be asc ertained by re-measurement based on approved 


 as-built drawings. 

83     Apart from referring to the treated area method that the defendant relies upon, I c annot see any other meaning that these words c ould take. I ac c ept that a fixed deduc tion per c olumn c ould be another method of valuing JGP works. That said, the applic ation of a fixed deduc tion per c olumn is inc onsistent with c l 2.3 whic h requires “re-measurement based on approved as-built drawings”. Although as-built drawings c ontain suffic ient information for payment on the basis of a fixed deduc tion per c olumn, suc h information is also available from site rec ords whic h would c ontain information on the number of JGP c olumns installed and the depth of eac h one. More importantly, the fixed deduc tion method will not entail any “re-measurement” of the as-built drawings whereas this is c onsistent with the defendant’s treated area method whic h entails measuring ac tual overlaps between c olumns and with sheet piles. Finally, under the plaintiff’s method, there is absolutely no basis for deduc tions of 5.77% or 10%. The only number for whic h there is a rationale is 17.3% (see [72] above). But this number was not even used by the plaintiff in its interim c laim and its pleadings in this suit. Therefore, in my judgment, the method of valuation the parties agreed on, as disc erned from the c lear words of c l 2.3, is the treated area method. 

84     Finally, I am not persuaded by the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant is estopped from denying the applic ability of the triangle grid method. That said, before I proc eed to elaborate on the merits of the estoppel argument, I will first c onsider the plaintiff’s submission that “estoppels by c onvention are not restric ted to mere defenc es but may c reate a c ause of ac tion”. 

85     Metaphoric ally, it has been said that an estoppel c an only ac t as a shield, not a sword. This is traditionally understood to mean that an estoppel c annot itself c onstitute a new c ause of ac tion. However this sword/shield dic hotomy has been c ritic ised for being too simplistic. It suggests that an estoppel may c onc eivably be used in only two ways ( _viz_ , as a c ause of ac tion or a defenc e) when in reality “the use that c an be made of an estoppel c an be represented by a spec trum ranging from a defenc e to the c reation of a new c ause of ac tion”: Roger Halson, “The offensive limits of promissory estoppel” (1999) LMCLQ 256 at p 259. “Sword” and “shield” represent two opposite ends of that spec trum. Along this spec trum, it is unc lear how far an estoppel may assist in establishing a c ause of ac tion: _per_ Manc e LJ in _Baird Textile Holdings Ltd v Marks & Spencer Plc_ [2001] CLC 999 at [88]. 

86     This issue was explored in _Amalgamated Investment & Property Co Ltd (in liquidation) v Texas Commerce International Bank Ltd_ [1982] QB 84 (“ _Amalgamated Investment_ ”). A helpful summary of the c ase is provided in _Chitty on Contracts_ vol 1 (Hugh Beale gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 31st Ed, 2012) at 3-108. A had negotiated with X Bank for a loan to B (one of A’s subsidiaries) for the purpose of ac quiring and developing a property in the Bahamas. The loan was to be sec ured by a mortgage on that property and also by a guarantee from A. In the guarantee, A promised to pay all moneys due to X Bank from B. The words were inappropriate sinc e the loan to B was not made direc tly by X Bank but by one of its subsidiaries, Y Bank. Consequently, if the guarantee were read literally, it would not apply to the loan sinc e no money was due from B to X Bank. 

87     The Court of Appeal held that on a true c onstruc tion, the guarantee applied to the loan made by Y Bank. It took the view that the literal interpretation of the guarantee would defeat the intention of the parties. Even if the guarantee did not produc e this result on its true c onstruc tion, A was estopped by c onvention from denying that the guarantee c overed the loan by Y Bank, sinc e when negotiating the loan, both A and X Bank had assumed that the guarantee did c over it and sinc e X Bank c ontinued to ac t on that assumption in granting various indulgenc es to A. 

88     A argued that X Bank was seeking to use estoppel as a sword rather than a shield, whic h the law of estoppel did not permit. Brandon LJ thought otherwise (at 131): 


 In my view muc h of the language used in c onnec tion with these c onc epts is no more than a matter of semantic s. Let me c onsider the present c ase and suppose that [X Bank] had brought an ac tion against [A] before they went into liquidation to rec over moneys owed by [B] to [Y Bank]. In the statement of c laim in suc h an ac tion [X Bank] would have pleaded the c ontrac t of loan inc orporating the guarantee, and averred that, on the true c onstruc tion of the guarantee, [A was] bound to disc harge the debt owed by [B] to [Y Bank]. By their defenc e [A] would have pleaded that, on the true c onstruc tion of the guarantee, [A was] only bound to disc harge debts owed by [B] to [X Bank], and not debts owed by [B] to [Y Bank]. Then in their reply [X Bank] would have pleaded that, by reason of an estoppel arising from the matters disc ussed above, [A was] prec luded from questioning the interpretation of the guarantee whic h both parties had, for the purpose of the transac tions between them, assumed to be true. 

 In this way [X Bank], while still in form using the estoppel as a shield, would in substanc e be founding a c ause of ac tion on it. This illustrates what I would regard as the true proposition of law, that, while a party cannot in terms found a cause of action on an estoppel, he may, as a result of being able to rely on an estoppel, succeed on a cause of action on which, without being able to rely on that estoppel, he would necessarily have failed. That, in my view, is, in substanc e, the situation of [X Bank] in the present c ase. 

 It follows from what I have said above that I would rejec t the sec ond argument against the existenc e of an estoppel put forward on behalf of [A] as well as the first. It further follows, from my rejec tion of both arguments against the existenc e of an estoppel, that I would answer the sec ond of the two questions whic h I formulated earlier by holding that, if [A] did not, by the c ontrac t relating to the Nassau loan, undertake to [X Bank] to disc harge any indebtedness of [B] to [Y Bank], they are, nevertheless, estopped from denying that they did so by reason of the basis, ac c epted by both [X Bank] and [A], on whic h the transac tions between them were later c onduc ted during the period from 1974 to 1976. 

 [emphasis added] 

89     It may be disc erned from the above passage that a party may rely on an estoppel to prec lude its c ounterparty from questioning the interpretation of a c ontrac tual term. This is so even if the estoppel operated to assist that party to enforc e a c ause of ac tion whic h would otherwise fail. 

90     Further judic ial support for this approac h may be found in _Shoreline Housing Partnership Ltd v Mears Ltd_ [2013] EWCA Civ 639 (“ _Mears_ ”). In that c ase, Gloster LJ drew a distinc tion between the situation where a c laimant was seeking to set up a c ontrac t by estoppel, where there was no c ontrac t at all and the c ase where an estoppel is alleged to have qualified the terms of the c ontrac t and where it is alleged that the parties c onduc ted their c ontrac tual relationship on the basis of an assumed and shared state of fac ts or law (at [23]). It was held that the former fell afoul of the rule that an estoppel does not operate as a sword, but not the latter. 

91     To my mind, the c orrec tness of the approac h, as established in _Mears_ and _Amalgamated Investment_ , is fortified by examining the c irc umstanc es in whic h the sword/shield dic hotomy originated. The dic hotomy was first used in argument by c ounsel and then adopted by Birkett LJ in the oft-c ited English Court of Appeal dec ision of _Combe v Combe_ [1951] 2 KB 215. In that c ase, the issue was whether the plaintiff c ould rec over maintenanc e on her husband’s promise upon whic h she had relied. Relianc e was plac ed on promissory or equitable estoppel. The wife’s c laim was rejec ted. Whilst it was held that an estoppel never stands alone as giving a c ause of ac tion in itself, Denning LJ (in his opinion) ac c epted that an estoppel may nevertheless play a supplementary role in establishing a c ause of ac tion (at 220): 


 In none of these c ases was the defendant sued on the promise, assuranc e, or assertion as a c ause of ac tion in itself: he was sued for some other c ause, for example, a pension or a breac h of c ontrac t, and the promise, assuranc e or assertion only played a supplementary role—an important role, no doubt, but still a supplementary role. That is, I think, its true func tion. It may be part of a c ause of ac tion, but not a c ause of ac tion in itself. 

92     The above c ases show that the “sword” metaphor was intended to desc ribe situations where a party’s c ause of ac tion is simply a “naked” estoppel, _ie_ , where the estoppel itself is the c ause of ac tion. It was not meant to inc lude situations (like the present) where the estoppel merely supplements an existing c ause of ac tion. 

93     Here, the plaintiff seeks to estop the defendant from interpreting the sub-c ontrac t in a manner that is c ontrary to the parties’ understanding and c onduc t. The plaintiff asserts that the parties had, by their c onduc t, established a pric ing mec hanism to c alc ulate work done under the sub-c ontrac t. The plaintiff’s c ause of ac tion is founded on a c ontrac tual right to be paid, and the estoppel merely informs the interpretation of the payment terms. The estoppel itself is not the c ause of ac tion. There is therefore no legal impediment to the plaintiff’s relianc e on the estoppel to assist its c ontrac tual c laim. 

94     I turn now to examine the merits of the estoppel argument. 

95     To establish an estoppel by c onvention, the following elements must be present ( _Travista Development Pte Ltd v Tan Kim Swee Augustine and others_ <span class="citation">[2008] 2 SLR(R) 474</span> at [31]): 

 (a) The parties must have ac ted on “an assumed and inc orrec t state of fact or law ” [emphasis added] ( per Bingham LJ in The Vistafjord [1988] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 343 at 352) in their c ourse of dealing. 

 (b) The assumption must be either shared by both parties pursuant to an agreement or something akin to an agreement, or made by one party and ac quiesc ed to by the other. 

 (c ) It must be unjust or unc onsc ionable to allow the parties (or one of them) to go bac k on that assumption. 

96     Here, there is no evidenc e that the plaintiff assumed that a 5.77% deduc tion would apply. In the statement of c laim and the reply, the plaintiff averred that the interim c laims were c ertified on the basis of the triangle grid method whic h entails a deduc tion of 5.77%. This is not true. The plaintiff had c onsistently c laimed on the basis of a 10% deduc tion and the defendant had c ertified those c laims on the basis of an 18% deduc tion. In fac t, the triangle grid method was not invoked until 25 June 2012, approximately two years after the parties entered into the MC01 c ontrac t. Sinc e there is no evidenc e that the plaintiff had assumed that a 5.77% deduc tion would apply, there c an be no estoppel to speak of. 

97     In c ontrast, had the plaintiff pleaded an estoppel on the basis of an 18% deduc tion, I would have been prepared to find that the defendant was estopped from relying on the treated area method for the following reasons. 

9       8 _First_ , the defendant had c onsistently been applying an 18% deduc tion to the interim c laims. _Second_ , under c ross-examination, Mr Chua c onc eded that the final ac c ount of the C482 Projec t was settled at a fixed deduc tion of 18%. This settlement was reac hed despite c lear words in the c ontrac t for the C482 Projec t providing for measurement based on the “treated area of JGP works”. _Finally_ , the 


plaintiff appears to have relied on the assumption of an 18% deduc tion to its detriment, although I must state that the evidenc e, suc h as it is, is not c onc lusive. The plaintiff c ertainly was stunned with the large deduc tion that the defendant had made to its c laims and that was what triggered this suit. Pertinently, the defendant’s Mr Ong admitted that if the interim c laims had been c ertified on the basis of a muc h higher deduc tion (as opposed to the 18% deduc tion that was ac tually applied), the “subc ontrac tor will run”. 

**Whether counterclaim should succeed** 

99     The defendant values the plaintiff’s work at $2,097,867.44. This figure is the produc t of the unit rate of $92 per c ubic metre and the nett treated volume of 22,802.907 c ubic metres. The defendant also ac c epts that the plaintiff is entitled to another sum of $60,000 as a “mobilisation fee”. This gives a final sub-c ontrac t sum of $2,157,867.44. After deduc ting bac k-c harges of $378,832. and previous payments totalling $1,841,920.64, there is a negative balanc e of $62,886.07. On this basis, the defendant c ontends that the plaintiff has been overpaid $62,886.07 and seeks the refund of the same. 

100    Save for the nett treated volume, the rest of the figures are not in dispute. To suc c eed in its c ounterc laim, the defendant has to prove that the plaintiff has c ompleted works amounting to a nett treated volume of 22,802.907 c ubic metres. To establish the nett treated volume, the defendant relies on numbers c ontained in a table that appears in Mr Ong’s affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief (“AEIC”) (“the Table”). These numbers are stated to be derived from c alc ulations done using Autoc ad software, on the basis of information c ontained in as-built drawings. 

101    Save for the assertion that those numbers were c omputed using Autoc ad software, it is unc lear how they were derived. In his AEIC, Mr Ong gave evidenc e that he was familiar with Autoc ad, and that he had verified those c alc ulations. He did not explain in his AEIC how he had done so. At the trial, however, Mr Ong took a different position. Under c ross-examination, he said that the c alc ulations were done by the defendant’s employee, Ms Khaizar. He also admitted that he had only c onduc ted a random c hec k _ie_ , he did not c hec k all the numbers. 

102    It is c lear that Mr Ong was in no position to give evidenc e on the verac ity of the figures in the Table. Instead, Ms Khaizar is the best person to explain the numbers that the defendant is seeking to rely on. She is the only person with direc t knowledge of how the numbers were c alc ulated. However, Ms Khaizar was not c alled as a witness although she remains in the employ of the defendant c ompany. In view of Ms Khaizar’s absenc e at the trial, the defendant may not rely on the truth of the c ontents of the Table to establish its c ounterc laim unless the evidenc e falls within one of the exc eptions to the hearsay rule. 

103    Generally, the hearsay rule renders inadmissible a doc ument adduc ed to establish the fac ts it refers to in the absenc e of direc t evidenc e of the fac ts c ontained therein: Jeffrey Pinsler, _SC Evidence and the Litigation Process_ (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2013) at para 4.001. Direc t evidenc e would take the form of the evidenc e of someone who has personal knowledge of those fac ts. 

104    In my view, the information in the Table does not fall within any of the exc eptions to the hearsay rule. In partic ular, I am of the view that the defendant may not avail itself of the exc eption c ontained in s 32(1)( _b_ ) of the Evidenc e Ac t whic h permits the admission of statements “made by a person in the ordinary c ourse of a trade, business, profession or other oc c upation”. The rationale for this exc eption has been stated in M C Sarkar et al, _Sarkar’s Law of Evidence vol I_ (LexisNexis, 17th Ed Reprint, 2011) (“ _Sarkar’s Law of Evidence_ ”) at p 970: 


 The ground of admission is that a statement or entry made in the ordinary c ourse or routine of business or duty may be presumed to have been done from disinterested motive and may therefore be taken to be generally true. 

105    To qualify under this exc eption, the entry must have been in the way of business. This has been defined to mean a c ourse of transac tions performed in one’s habitual relations with others and as a material part of one’s mode of obtaining a livelihood: _Sarkar’s Law of Evidence_ at p 973. 

106    Here, it must be borne in mind that the Table exhibited in Mr Ong’s AEIC was prepared for the purposes of litigation. Furthermore, there is no evidenc e to show that the information c ontained in the Table was extrac ted from any doc ument that was prepared in the ordinary c ourse of trade, business, profession or other oc c upation. That being so, it is my view that the Table is inadmissible for the purposes of proving the quantity of work done by the plaintiff. 

107    There are also other diffic ulties with the admission of the figures c ontained in the Table. If Ms Khaizar had done the c alc ulations on the basis of information from the Autoc ad software, the question remains as to where that information had c ome from. Details suc h as the loc ation of the JGP c olumns and the sequenc e in whic h the c olumns were installed are out-of-c ourt statements that will similarly c onstitute hearsay evidenc e. 

108    The defendant’s c ounterc laim appears to be c onstruc ted on multiple layers of hearsay evidenc e. What is troubling is that the defendant does not seem to be c ognizant of the heavy, if not sole, relianc e on hearsay evidenc e. I further note that there is a c onspic uous absenc e of any safeguards or measures whic h would ensure a minimal degree of reliability of the evidenc e. As noted at [12] above, the defendant has proffered different valuations of the plaintiff’s work at different junc tures. 

109    In view of these shortc omings, I find that the defendant has not disc harged its burden of proof _vis-à-vis_ its c ounterc laim. Ac c ordingly, the defendant’s c ounterc laim must fail. 

**Conclusion** 

110    To summarise, I have made the following findings: 

 (a) That the Plaintiff’s Contrac t evidenc ed the final agreement between the parties. 

 (b) That the treated area method applies to quantify the plaintiff’s work. 

 (c ) That there is no evidenc e supporting the plaintiff’s c ase in estoppel vis-à-vis the 5.77% deduc tion. 

111    Ac c ordingly, the plaintiff’s c laim fails. That said, due to the evidential shortc omings in relation to the defendant’s c ounterc laim, I am also of the view that the c ounterc laim must fail. Both c laim and c ounterc laim in this suit are therefore dismissed. 

112    I will hear c ounsel on the question of c osts.
