: The plaintiff (`bank`) is a c ompany inc orporated in Germany and c arries on banking business by its branc h offic e in Singapore. It has been doing so for a number of years and it is not disputed that it is in possession of a lic enc e granted under the Banking Ac t to c onduc t suc h business. 

The defendant (`Mr Sng` or `c ustomer`) is a resident of Malaysia where the bank does not c arry on banking business. On 15 Marc h 1995 the bank issued a `fac ility letter` addressed to him in Malaysia. The fac ility letter was rec eived by him and he does not deny that he signed it and by doing so agreed to the terms and c onditions c ontained in it as stated in the ac knowledgement signed by him. 

The fac ility letter provided that the bank agreed to make advanc es of c redit to the c ustomer in United States Dollars and one or more optional c urrenc ies exc ept Singapore Dollars `on a revolving basis in an aggregate princ ipal amount at any one time outstanding not to exc eed USD7,000,000` or the equivalent. Mr Sng said in an affidavit filed in these proc eedings that he was then financ ially viable to the bank as he had a `reputation of a ric h businessman from Malaysia`. He said that he had a c ontrolling interest in a c ompany c alled SAAG Corporation Bhd whic h was listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stoc k Exc hange in Malaysia. 

The fac ility letter also provided for it to be read together with the bank`s standard terms and c onditions governing banking fac ilities and for a sec urity agreement relating to shares and other sec urities to be exec uted. A c opy of the standard terms and c onditions was attac hed to the fac ility letter. 

Interest was payable on eac h advanc e at the rate of `1.0% per annum above the Cost of Funds (COF) quoted by [the bank`s] Treasury Department`. There was also an `arrangement fee` of 0.125% of the loan amount to be paid. The interest period was one month or three months or six months at the elec tion of the c ustomer and the agreed interest was payable on the last day of the interest period. The default rate was 5.0% per annum above COF quoted by the bank`s treasury department. 

On 14 Dec ember 1998 the bank`s solic itors wrote two letters to Mr Sng. In one they alleged that JPY777,468,948 was due and owing as at 11 Dec ember 1998 and in the other they alleged that GBP300,663 was due and owing as at the same date. Both letters were expressed to be without 


prejudic e to other sums outstanding in other c urrenc ies and in both letters a demand was made for payment within 14 days. Payment was not made and on 21 January 1999 this ac tion was c ommenc ed. 

In its statement of c laim the bank referred to the arrangements for the multi-c urrenc y revolving c redit (as the c redit fac ility under and pursuant to the fac ility letter has c ome to be c alled) and said that it `extended c redit Japanese Yen and Great Britain Pound` to Mr Sng. I think it meant and was understood to mean that the bank lent money to Mr Sng in Japanese Yen and Great Britain Pounds. It is alleged that as at 11 Dec ember 1998 JPY777,468,948 and GBP300,663 were due and owing and the bank c laimed these amounts and interest. 

An appearanc e was entered for Mr Sng and a summons for judgment was issued. On 12 November 1999 assistant registrar Thian Yee Sze gave judgment for the bank for the two sums c laimed and for interest at 5% per annum above the COF quoted by the bank`s treasury department. Mr Sng appealed and on 19 January 2000 I dismissed his appeal. He has given notic e of appeal and these are my written grounds. 

A large number of affidavits filed in this ac tion and in another were referred to and in his affidavits Mr Sng frequently departed from making statements in relation to relevant fac ts only. In the c irc umstanc es I asked c ounsel for the grounds on whic h it was to be submitted that I should allow the appeal and dismiss the applic ation for judgment or make some other order under O 14 rr 3 and 4. She has provided me with a list and I will take eac h of the grounds in turn. 

**_Failure to comply with O 14 r 2_** 

Order 14 r 2 provides for affidavits to be rec eived in evidenc e and para (8) of this rule states: 

 An affidavit or affidavits for the purpose of this Rule must contain all necessary evidence in support of or in opposition (as the case may be) to the claim, or a part of the claim, to which the application relates ... 

Counsel submitted that the affidavits did not c ontain suffic ient evidenc e of the amount c laimed. 

I was referred to Mr Hansen`s first affidavit where he said in para 8: 

 As at 11 December 1998, the defendant had failed to settle outstanding credit payments on the Multi-Credit Revolving Facility to the extent of JPY777,468, and GBP300,663. On 14 December 1998, the plaintiffs had, through their solicitors, Messrs Allen & Gledhill, written to the defendant to demand payment within 14 days of the said outstanding credit payments due and owing from the defendant ... 

Counsel submitted that this evidenc e was insuffic ient. She referred to **Hong Leong Finance Ltd v Datuk Mohd Salleh bin Yusof** [1989] SLR 290 where LP Thean J (as he then was) said at p 292: 

 ... I was informed that the plaintiffs had since the commencement of the action sold all the shares held by them as security and credit had yet to be given for the net proceeds received by the plaintiffs. Clearly on that ground, the judgment then entered was not in order, and I adjourned the hearing to another date to enable a further affidavit to be filed by the plaintiffs giving particulars of 


 the sales, the net proceeds received and the balance of the amount owing. 

At the hearing of an applic ation for judgment all the affidavits whic h have been rec eived in evidenc e may be read and in c oming to a dec ision any evidenc e in support of or in opposition to the applic ation may be taken into ac c ount whether it be c ontained in an affidavit filed by one party or the other. In this c ase it is not even nec essary to refer to any affidavit other than Mr Hansen`s first affidavit as to the amount c laimed. In para 4 of Mr Hansen`s first affidavit he said: 

 Pursuant to the Facility Agreement, the plaintiffs extended credit Japanese Yen and Great Britain Pound to the defendant to the limit of USD7,000,000 or the equivalent thereof. 

This follows c losely the language used in the statement of c laim and as I have said earlier I think it means that the bank lent money to Mr Sng in Japanese Yen and Great Britain Pounds. Reading this with para 8 there c an be no doubt that the evidenc e is that the bank has granted loans to Mr Sng in Japanese Yen and Great Britain Pounds and that as at 11 Dec ember 1998 the amounts c laimed were outstanding and were due and payable. 

In **_Hong Leong Finance Ltd v Datuk Mohd Salleh bin Yusof_** the plaintiff c ommenc ed the ac tion c laiming about $2.1m and applied for judgment. Judgment was given for the amount c laimed but in fac t between c ommenc ement of the ac tion and the hearing of the applic ation for judgment the amount owing had been reduc ed by the sale of c ertain assets held as sec urity. It was in those c irc umstanc es that the learned judge allowed a further affidavit to be filed giving the partic ulars. 

I do not think that the passage c ited means that a c laim by a banker against its c ustomer and the evidenc e in support must give `partic ulars of the sales, the net proc eeds rec eived and the balanc e of the amount owing` in every c ase where property held as sec urity had been sold and that for an applic ation for judgment under O 14 suc h partic ulars must be given and verified by affidavit. In the c ase before me the partic ulars have not even been asked for. I do not think that the evidenc e is insuffic ient by reason only of the absenc e of suc h partic ulars. 

**_Amount claimed denied and no amount admitted due_** 

Mr Sng said in his affidavit that he took issue over the rate of interest c harged. He said he did not have a rec ord of his own position statement issued by the bank and he referred to those of some of his assoc iates. Counsel said that interest was c harged to the ac c ounts of these assoc iates at rates varying from 26.5% per annum to 40.77% per annum. She said that under the arrangements the bank `c ould deduc t any amount from other bank ac c ounts held by [Mr Sng] and that inc luded nominee ac c ounts whic h he had the power over` and that it was `highly possible that the amounts ac c rued in the nominee ac c ounts` were inc luded in the bank`s c laim. She did not say it but the argument must I suppose proc eed on the basis that the ac c ounts of these assoc iates were `nominee ac c ounts` whic h Mr Sng `had the power over`. 

My attention has not been drawn to the provision in the doc umentation of the arrangements between the bank and the c ustomer that c ounsel referred to but if there was a provision in the terms mentioned by her or in similar terms it would only mean that money in those ac c ounts c ould be transferred to Mr Sng`s own ac c ount to reduc e his own indebtedness and not that his own ac c ount 


c ould be c harged with any indebtedness under the other ac c ounts. There is also no evidenc e that he had any power over these ac c ounts. 

Mr Sng has not denied that loans had been made to him in Japanese Yen and Great Britain Pounds. The ground under this head is that ` **_it is highly possible_** ` the indebtedness of his assoc iates had been inc luded in the c laim against him and that suc h indebtedness inc luded interest at very high rates. Mr Hansen denied any knowledge of the nominees or assoc iates in his affidavit but for the purpose of this appeal I do not have to c ome to a finding on this. On the basis of c ounsel`s submission alone I do not see that the indebtedness c laimed has been denied or that the c laim inc ludes any other person`s indebtedness. 

**_Illegality_** 

Breac h of s 29 Banking Ac t (Cap 19) 

Sec tion 29(1) of the Banking Ac t (Cap 19) provides: 

 Subject to subsection (3), a bank shall not 

 (a) grant or permit to be outstanding to any one person or to any group of persons under the control or influence of any one person, any credit facilities if the aggregate amount of such credit facilities exceeds 25% of its capital funds or such other percentage not exceeding 100% of its capital funds as the Authority may approve; 

Subsec tion (3) provides for exc eptions whic h are not applic able in this c ase. The loans to Mr Sng were of the order of about USD91m in the aggregate as alleged by him and the c ase is that this exc eeded 25% of the bank`s c apital funds. 

No evidenc e has been adduc ed as to the c apital funds of the bank. Counsel was unable to say what the bank`s c apital funds were at any time. The onus is c learly on the c ustomer alleging the illegality and this has not been disc harged. 

Breac h of ss 4 and 8 Exc hange Control Ac t 1953 of Malaysia (`ECA (Malaysia)`) 

Counsel for Mr Sng c onc eded (and in my view quite properly) that the proper law of the c ontrac t between the bank and the c ustomer was the law of Singapore. Her argument was that performanc e of the c ontrac t meant lending on the part of the bank and repayment on the part of the c ustomer. She said that both the lending and the repayment took plac e in Malaysia. Sinc e the loans had not been repaid in full I think she meant that the c ontrac t provided for repayment to be made in Malaysia. She did not direc t my attention to any suc h provision and I have not c ome ac ross any suc h provision in the doc uments before me. 

Sec tion 4(1) of ECA (Malaysia) provides: 

 Except with the permission of the Controller, no person, other than an authorised dealer, shall, in Malaysia, buy or borrow any gold or foreign currency from, or sell or lend any gold or foreign currency to, any person other than an 


 authorised dealer. 

Mr Sng`s c ase is that he borrowed foreign c urrenc y and the bank lent him foreign c urrenc y and that all this took plac e in Malaysia. 

Counsel referred to the bank`s loan c onfirmation statements exhibited to Mr Sng`s first affidavit. She said that payment of the loan money was made to the c ustomer in Malaysia. There were four statements. Three related to loans in Malaysian Ringgit and only one related to a loan in Great Britain Pounds. Under s 2 of ECA (Malaysia) `foreign c urrenc y` did not inc lude Malaysian Ringgit and c ounsel did not attempt to submit that the three doc uments relating to loans in Malaysian Ringgit evidenc ed transac tions whic h she said were in breac h of s 4(1). They c learly did not. 

The bank`s loan c onfirmation statement as regards the loan in Great Britain Pounds stated: 

 We confirm our loan to you value 5 Feb 98 maturing 9 Mar 98 

 CCY Princ ipal Interest Rate Interest Total GBP 278,463.62 9.0000000 2,197.19 280,660. Payment at maturity date to our a/c with Barc lays Bank plc London 

 Payment at value date by Barc lays Bank plc London 

 Payment by Payment to We await your advic e We await your advic e 

All that Mr Sng said about this statement in his affidavit was that along with the three other statements `the nature of the transac tions with [the bank] is illustrated in the doc uments`. 

The statement shows on its fac e that the bank awaited Mr Sng`s advic e as to where payment of the loan money was to be made to him. He has given no evidenc e that payment was made to him in Malaysia. The c ontrac t did not provide where payment to him was to be made or that payment to him was to be made in Malaysia only or to be remitted to an ac c ount in Malaysia only. In his affidavit Mr Sng stopped short of saying in whic h c ountry or to whic h ac c ount payment to him was as advised by him to be made or in fac t made. 

Counsel has not made good the point that the foreign c urrenc y whic h was the subjec t of the loan was paid to the c ustomer in Malaysia or that the payment to him was made in Malaysia. However I should observe that the plac e of payment is only one of the matters whic h may be taken into c onsideration. The question in this c ase is whether the c ustomer did or did not `in Malaysia ... borrow any ... foreign c urrenc y` within the meaning of that provision in the law of Malaysia. 

Borrowing is really the other side of the same transac tion as lending and I think to borrow money (or foreign c urrenc y) is to enter into a c ontrac t with a lender whereby the lender pays or agrees to pay a sum of money (or foreign c urrenc y) to the borrower or to another person by the authority of the 


borrower in c onsideration of a promise by the borrower to repay on demand or at some future time. See **Nissho Iwai International (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Kohinoor Impex Pte Ltd & Anor** [1995] 3 SLR 268 at p 272 and the authorities c ited. 

The bank`s loan c onfirmation statement was c learly issued in Singapore where it c arried on banking business. The bank did not c arry on banking business in Malaysia. It c onfirmed payment by a London bank and the bank awaited the c ustomer`s advic e. I think it means that payment by the London bank would be made to a payee or ac c ount on the c ustomer`s advic e. Counsel did not say that this evidenc ed a borrowing having taken plac e in Malaysia but I should have thought that what this evidenc ed was a borrowing that took plac e in Singapore. 

Sec tion 4(2) of ECA (Malaysia) provides: 

 Except with the permission of the Controller, no person resident in the scheduled territories, other than an authorised dealer, shall, in Malaysia, do any act which involves, is in association with, or is preparatory to, buying or borrowing any gold or foreign currency from, or selling or lending any gold or foreign currency to, any person outside Malaysia. 

Mr Sng`s c ase is that as sec urity for the loans he mortgaged his shares and the mortgage took plac e in Malaysia. I assume for the purpose of this appeal that he was a `person resident in the sc heduled territories` although `sc heduled territories` does not appear to be defined. Counsel submitted that s 4(2) of the Ac t was infringed and she referred to the evidenc e of Mr Sugunasingam a Malaysian legal prac titioner. 

Mr Sugunasingam said in his affidavit: 

 ... even if one accepts the courts decision [in Keppel Finance Ltd v Phoon Ah Lek [1994] 3 MLJ 26 ] that a person is not prohibited from doing any of those things outside Malaysia (p.37D) the preparatory acts alone inside Malaysia are sufficient to cause the contract to be avoided. 

I assume for the purpose of this appeal but without dec iding the point as the evidenc e is not altogether c lear that Mr Sugunasingam`s opinion is that the mortgage of shares was an ac t whic h was in assoc iation with or preparatory to borrowing foreign c urrenc y. The real diffic ulty with Mr Sugunasingam`s opinion is that assuming that the mortgage is an ac t that is prohibited it appears to me that it is the mortgage alone that may be unenforc eable but not the loan. He has not addressed this issue. 

Mr Lazar, another Malaysian legal prac titioner, said in his affidavit: 

 As for Mr Sugunasingams point that in Keppel, the court held that s 4(2) had been contravened, what was actually said was: There is no doubt that it can be said that the defendant in the instant case, when he without the permission of the Controller applied as he did from Malaysia to Singapore for the borrowing, contravened s 4(2) ... It is not a contradiction for the court to then hold that the actual borrowing that took place in Singapore did not run foul of s 4(2). If therefore there was a contravention of the ECA in Keppel, it was the defendant who was in contravention, and a party cannot rely on his own act of default to avoid a contract. 


I think Mr Lazar`s opinion is that if the c ustomer c ontravened s 4(2) in the mortgage of the shares but did not c ontravene s 4(1) in the borrowing of foreign c urrenc y bec ause the borrowing did not take plac e in Malaysia then the loan was enforc eable. 

This is an issue whic h Mr Sugunasingam has not addressed as I have pointed out. Mr Lazar has and he has also referred to **_Keppel Finance Ltd v Phoon Ah Lek_** a dec ision of a superior c ourt of Malaysia. I have read the report of that c ase and I am satisfied that I c an ac c ept the opinion of Mr Lazar. There is no evidenc e to show that the mortgage of shares whic h ac c ording to c ounsel took plac e in Malaysia in breac h of s 4(2) of the Ac t rendered the loan for whic h the sec urity was given void or otherwise unenforc eable in the law of Malaysia but on the c ontrary the evidenc e is that notwithstanding any breac h of s 4(2) in this c ase the loan itself was not affec ted. 

Sec tion 8 of ECA (Malaysia) provides: 

 Payments in Malaysia 

 Except with the permission of the Controller, no person shall do any of the following things in Malaysia: 

### ... 

 (c) place any sum to the credit of any person resident outside the scheduled territories: ... 

Again I assume for the purpose of this appeal that the bank was `a person resident outside the sc heduled territories`. Counsel c onc eded that there was no evidenc e of any payment to (or of any sum having been plac ed to the c redit of) the bank. This ground must fail. 

Breac h of Bretton Woods Agreement Ac t (Cap 27) 

Counsel referred to the Bretton Woods Agreement and said that the effec t of the performanc e of the c ontrac tual arrangements between the parties was that Japanese Yen and Great Britain Pounds were exc hanged for Malaysian Ringgit. She was unable to point to any provision in the c ontrac tual arrangements whic h involved any exc hange of any c urrenc y for Malaysian Ringgit but on the materials before me there was no exc hange c ontrac t. See **Singapore Finance Ltd v Soetanto & Ors** [1992] 2 SLR 407. Counsel has not shown how an exc hange c ontrac t would arise. 

Breac h of Malaysian Code on Take-overs and Mergers 

Shares in SAAG Corporation Bhd were mortgaged to the bank and these shares as Mr Sng alleged amounted to more than 33% of the total issued shares of the c ompany. Counsel said that the bank bec ame the benefic ial owner of all these shares and under the Malaysian Code on Take-overs and Mergers the bank was obliged to make a general offer for the remaining shares. She went on to say that upon the bank`s failure to do so it was in c ontravention of the Sec urities Commission Ac t of Malaysia. She c onc eded that there was no evidenc e as to these matters of Malaysian law and this ground must also fail. 


**_Set-off and counterclaim_** 

Mr Sng said in his affidavit: 

 As a result of a new ruling imposed by the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange sometime in late 1998 which requires [the SAAG Corporation Bhd] shares to be deposited in the beneficial owners Malaysian Central Depository Account, I am advised and verily believe that the [bank] failed, refused and/or neglected to do and now these securities have been transferred to the Minister of Finance thus causing loss to me. 

Mr Sng did not disc lose the sourc e of the advic e whic h he said he verily believed and his evidenc e is inadmissible as regards the advic e he rec eived. 

Counsel referred to a letter from the bank dated 16 September 1998 in whic h the bank advised Mr Sng as regards disc losure of benefic ial ownership of the shares to Malaysian Central Depository. In that letter the bank said: 

 ... as per the telephone conversations between [Mr Sng] and Ms Kathy and our Mr Wayne Lau, we shall proceed with the said registration of shares to protect your interest. 

 Should you have any questions pertaining to this matter, please call Mr Wayne Lau at tel no: 3906691. 

There is no evidenc e of any further c ommunic ation in regard to this matter. 

On the basis of the materials before me this ground also fails. Counsel said that there were other reasons why this ac tion should proc eed to trial but she also said that all these other reasons related to a set-off and c ounterc laim arising out of a failure to realise the sec urity early and the transfer of shares to the Malaysian Minister of Financ e. No partic ulars as to these other reasons were given and there is no evidenc e pointing to these reasons. 

At the c onc lusion of the hearing I was satisfied that there was no issue or question in dispute whic h ought to be tried or that for some other reason there ought to be a trial. There is no ground for dismissing the bank`s applic ation. In my judgment the learned assistant registrar was right to have given judgment for the bank and the appeal is ac c ordingly dismissed with c osts whic h I fixed at $3,500. 

## Outcome: 

Appeal dismissed.
