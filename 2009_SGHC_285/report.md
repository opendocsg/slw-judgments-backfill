_Arbitration_ 

22     Dec ember 2009 Judgment reserved. 

**Tan Lee Meng J:** 

1       The appellant, Jiangsu Hantong Ship Heavy Industry Co Ltd (“Hantong”), owns a shipyard in China. The defendant, Sevan Pte Ltd, is a c ompany within a Norwegian offshore maritime group (c ollec tively referred to as “Sevan”). Hantong, whic h instituted Suit No 961 of 2008 against Sevan Pte Ltd to rec over monies owed to it, appealed against the dec ision of Assistant Registrar Lim Jian Yi (“AR Lim”) to stay the proc eedings in this suit in favour of arbitration proc eedings in London. 

**Background** 

2       On 27 May 2006, Hantong and Sevan entered into a c ontrac t, under whic h the former agreed to build a vessel c alled “Hull 21” for the latter (“the c ontrac t”). Under the c ontrac t, Sevan was required to make progress payments for the c onstruc tion of Hull 21 within 5 banking days following its rec eipt of Hantong’s invoic es. 

3       Hantong, whic h c ontended that by 12 Dec ember 2008, Sevan owed it USD 2,854,829.50 with respec t to progress payments that were due for the c onstruc tion of Hull 21, instituted legal proc eedings in the High Court (“the proc eedings”) to rec over the amount due to it. 

4       Sevan responded by applying for the proc eedings to be stayed in favour of arbitration proc eedings in London in ac c ordanc e with c lause 34 of the c ontrac t, whic h provides as follows: 

 Any dispute arising out of or in c onnec tion with this Contrac t, inc luding any questions regarding its existenc e, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the Rules of the London Maritime Arbitrators Assoc iation (LMAA), whic h rules are deemed to be inc orporated by referenc e into this Artic le. The arbitration shall be held in London, England, and the language of the proc eedings shall be English. 

5       Hantong, whic h opposed a stay of the proc eedings, argued that c lause 34 of the c ontrac t did not c ome into the pic ture as there is no “dispute” between the parties to be referred to arbitration. 

6       On 1 April 2009, AR Lim ordered a stay of the proc eedings. Hantong appealed against AR Lim’s 


dec ision. 

**The court’s decision** 

7       At the outset, referenc e may be made to s 6 of the International Arbitration Ac t (Cap 143A, 2002, Rev Ed) (“IAA”), whic h provides as follows: 

 Enforcement of international arbitration agreement 6. — (1) Notwithstanding Artic le 8 of the Model Law, where any party to an arbitration agreement to whic h this Ac t applies institutes any proc eedings in any c ourt against any other party to the agreement in respec t of any matter whic h is the subjec t of the agreement, any party to the agreement may, at any time after appearanc e and before delivering any pleading or taking any other step in the proc eedings, apply to that c ourt to stay the proc eedings so far as the proc eedings relate to that matter. 

 (2) The c ourt to whic h an applic ation has been made in ac c ordanc e with subsec tion (1) shall make an order, upon suc h terms or c onditions as it may think fit, staying the proc eedings so far as the proc eedings relate to the matter, unless it is satisfied that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or inc apable of being performed. 

8       As there is no allegation that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or inc apable of being performed, what is in issue is whether or not there is a “dispute” between the parties to warrant a stay of the proc eedings. 

9       Hantong, whic h insisted that it has no dispute with Sevan, c laimed that Sevan had already admitted liability for the sum c laimed by it and that Sevan’s c ounterc laim has no merit. 

10     To determine whether there is a dispute for the purpose of an applic ation for a stay of proc eedings under the IAA, it is immaterial that the defenc e or c ounterc laim of the party seeking a stay appears to be weak. In _Dalian Hualiang Enterprise Group Co Ltd v Louis Dreyfus Asia Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2005] 4 SLR 646</span>, Woo Bih Li J stressed at [75] that “if the defendant at least makes a positive assertion that he is disputing the c laim... then there is a dispute even though it c an be easily demonstrated that he is wrong.” 

11     In _Tjong Very Sumito and Ors v Antig Investments Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2009] SGCA 41</span> _(“Tjong”)_ , V K Rajah JA, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, reiterated at [29] that as the whole thrust of the IAA is geared towards minimizing c ourt involvement in matters that the parties had agreed to submit to arbitration, c onc urrent arbitration and c ourt proc eedings are to be avoided unless it is for the purpose of lending c urial assistanc e to the arbitral proc ess. He added at [69] that in line with the prevailing philosophy of judic ial non-intervention in arbitration, the c ourt will interpret the word “dispute” broadly and will “readily find that a dispute exists _unless the defendant has unequivocally admitted_ that the c laim is due and payable”. V K Rajah JA referred to _Hayter v Nelson Home Insurance Co_ [1990] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 265, where Saville J explained as follows: 

 Two men have an argument over who won the University Boat Rac e in a partic ular year. In ordinary language they have a dispute over whether it was Oxford or Cambridge. The fac t that it c an be easily and immediately demonstrated beyond any doubt that the one is right and the other is wrong does not and c annot mean that that dispute did not in fac t exist. Bec ause one man c an be said to be indisputably right and the other indisputably wrong does not, in my view, entail that there was therefore never any dispute between them. 

12     Although Lord Saville’s illustration was offered before the 1996 English Arbitration Ac t c ame into 


forc e, it remains relevant today for an eluc idation of what is a dispute for the purpose of staying c ourt proc eedings in favour of arbitration. 

13     In the present c ase, Sevan’s direc tor, Mr Ragnar Boe, stated in his affidavit as follows at [12]: 

 I am advised and verily believe that disputes between the Plaintiffs have arisen in that the Plaintiffs are seeking payment of sums under [the c ontrac t] when payment of these sums are being legitimately withheld by the Defendants in ac c ordanc e with their right of set-off on ac c ount of substantial c ounterc laims that the Defendants have against the Plaintiffs. 

14     Broadly speaking, Sevan alleged that Hantong c ommitted a number of breac hes, in respec t of whic h it made c ross-c laims. It c ontended, among other things, that Hantong is professionally and tec hnic ally ill-equipped to perform its obligations and c ommitments under the c ontrac t and that Hantong’s delayed performanc e of its obligations gives rise to c laims for liquidated damages. 

15     Sevan also denied having admitted liability for the amounts stated in Hantong’s invoic es. Hantong had relied on, among other things, the minutes of a meeting on 2 Dec ember 2008 and some c orrespondenc e between the parties to show that Sevan never expressly c hallenged its demand for payment of the invoic ed sums. Hantong also pointed out that Sevan had asked for more time to settle the invoic ed amounts. However, Sevan submitted that the minutes of the meeting of 2 Dec ember 2008 had merely rec orded Hantong’s view and not any admission of liability on its part. As for the c orrespondenc e referred to by Hantong, Sevan pointed out that it had been exc hanged in the c ontext of c ommerc ial negotiations to resolve the dispute between the parties amic ably. Furthermore, Sevan had not had the benefit of legal advic e at the material time. 

16     It is noteworthy that in _Tjong_ ( _supra_ , [11]), V K Rajah JA stressed at [61] that, generally speaking, the c ourt should not be astute in searc hing for an admission of a c laim, and would ordinarily be inc lined to find that a c laim is not admitted in all but the c learest of c ases. This is not one of the “c learest of c ases” where it c an be said that the defendant had unequivoc ally ac c epted that the amount c laimed is owed to the plaintiff. 

17     After taking all c irc umstanc es into ac c ount, I find that there is a dispute between Hantong and Sevan. As suc h, the dispute between the parties should be resolved through arbitration in ac c ordanc e with the terms of the c ontrac ts. I thus affirm AR Lim’s dec ision and dismiss Hantong’s appeal with c osts.
