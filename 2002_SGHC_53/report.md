## Judgment 

### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

**_Introduction_** 

1\. The Claimant Dermajaya Properties Sdn Bhd is a c ompany inc orporated in Brunei. 

2\. The First Respondent Premium Properties Sdn Bhd and the Sec ond Respondent CFE Holdings (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd are c ompanies inc orporated in Malaysia. 

3\. By an agreement dated 4 Oc tober 1996 (‘the Agreement’) the Claimant agreed to buy from both the Respondents 100% of the paid up c apital in another c ompany inc orporated in Malaysia, President Hotel Sdn Bhd, for RM297,000,000. 

4\. Clause 12.15 and 12.16 of the Agreement provides: 

‘12.15 Arbitration 

Any dispute or differenc e between the parties in c onnec tion with this Agreement shall be referred to a sole arbitrator under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law 

12\.15.1 the arbitration shall be held in Singapore; and 

12\.15.2 the arbitrator shall be appointed by the parties or, failing agreement, by the Direc tor, for the time being of the Regional Center for Arbitration at Kuala Lumpur. 


12\.16 Law 

This Agreement shall be governed by, and c onstrued in ac c ordanc e with, the laws of Malaysia.’ 

5\. Disputes arose between the parties subsequently. An ac tion was c ommenc ed in the High Court of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur by the Claimant naming both Respondents and President Hotel Sdn Bhd as Defendants. This ac tion was stayed by order of the High Court of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur on 3 September 1997. 

6\. About three and a half years later, by an agreement dated 9 Marc h 2001, the parties agreed to the appointment of Dato Mahadev Shankar as arbitrator. 

7\. On 17 August 2001, the Respondents applied for sec urity for c osts from the Claimant in the sum of RM500,000. This was reduc ed during submission to RM470,000. 

8\. After submissions, the arbitrator made an Interim Award dated 5 November 2001 under whic h the Claimant was to deposit S$200,000 as sec urity for the Respondents’ c osts in the arbitration. His dec ision rested on the applic ability of the International Arbitration Ac t (Cap 143A) (‘IAA’) and in partic ular s 12 IAA. This in turn depended on the interpretation of s 15 IAA. 

9\. The Claimant, being dissatisfied with the dec ision of the arbitrator, then appealed to the High Court. 

10\. The appeal c ame up for hearing before me on 19 February 2002. The primary issue is whether the arbitrator had jurisdic tion to order sec urity for c osts against the Claimant. 

11\. It is c ommon ground that: 

 (a) the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (‘the UNCITRAL Rules’) do not enable the arbitrator to order sec urity for c osts against the Claimant. 

 (b) Sec tion 12 IAA does enable the arbitrator to order sec urity for c osts against the Claimant. 

 (c ) The other legislation in Singapore applic able to arbitration is the Arbitration Ac t (Cap 10) (‘AA’). This Ac t is often desc ribed as applying to domestic arbitration. At the material time, the AA does not enable the arbitrator to order sec urity for c osts against the Claimant. However, the High Court of Singapore may do so. 

12\. I would add that it is also c ommon ground that the plac e, or seat, of the arbitration is Singapore. 

**_Section 15 IAA_** 

13\. Sec tion 15 IAA has been amended rec ently. However it is the pre-amendment s 15 and not the c urrent s 15 whic h is applic able. 

14\. The pre-amendment s 15 states: 

 ‘15. If the parties to an arbitration agreement have (whether in the arbitration agreement or in any other doc ument in writing) agreed that any dispute that has arisen or may arise between 


 them is to be settled or resolved otherwise than in ac c ordanc e with this Part or the Model Law, this Part and the Model Law shall not apply in relation to the settlement or resolution of that dispute.’ [Emphasis added.] 

15\. The IAA is: 

 ‘An Ac t to make provision for the c onduc t of international c ommerc ial arbitrations based on the Model Law on International Commerc ial Arbitration adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law and c onc iliation proc eedings and to give effec t to the New York Convention on the Rec ognition and Enforc ement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and for matters c onnec ted therewith.’ 

16\. Part II of the IAA is the main part. It c omprises ss 2 to 26 of the IAA. Under s 3, the Model Law, with the exc eption of Chapter VIII thereof, is to have the forc e of law in Singapore. 

17\. Under s 5, Part II and the Model Law shall not apply to an arbitration whic h is not an international arbitration. However, the parties before me agreed that their arbitration is an international arbitration for the purpose of the IAA. Thus, prima fac ie, Part II and the Model Law apply to the arbitration in question. 

18\. The Model Law is set out in the First Sc hedule to the IAA. It c overs various matters suc h as the c omposition and jurisdic tion of the arbitral tribunal and the c onduc t of arbitral proc eedings, the making of the award and termination of proc eedings. It also provides for rec ourse against an award and rec ognition and enforc ement of awards. 

19\. However Part II IAA provides for other powers of an arbitral tribunal inc luding, as I have mentioned, the power to make orders for sec urity for c osts under s 12. 

**_Claimant’s position_** 

20\. The Claimant’s position is as follows: 

 (a)The UNCITRAL Rules were published by UNCITRAL in 1976. The Model Law was published in 1985. Although the Agreement is dated 4 Oc tober 1996, the parties had adopted the UNCITRAL Rules and not the Model Law. (b)(i)Although the UNCITRAL Rules and the Model Law were promulgated by the same body, i.e UNCITRAL, they are inc ompatible. (ii) For example, where there is to be one arbitrator, and if parties c annot agree to the appointment of the arbitrator and if there is no agreement on the appointing authority, Artic le 6 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that either party may request the Sec retary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague to designate an appointing authority. (iii) However, in a similar situation, Artic le 11(3)(b) read with Artic le 6 of the Model Law, provides that eac h State adopting the Model Law is to designate the appointing authority. In the c ase of Singapore, the appointing authority is designated under s 8(2) IAA as the Chairman for the time being of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (‘SIAC’), or suc h other person as the Chief Justic e may appoint. 


21\. I would digress to say that, in the c ase before me, the Agreement does spec ific ally identify the authority to appoint the arbitrator, if the parties should fail to agree on the arbitrator. However, this is immaterial to the argument before me bec ause my c onc lusion about s 15 IAA must be the same whether an arbitration agreement does or does not have an express provision on the appointing authority. 

22\. Coming bac k to the Claimant’s position, Mr Christopher Chuah, for the Claimant, submitted that sinc e the UNCITRAL Rules are inc ompatible with the Model Law, then both the Model Law and Part II do not apply. The parties have by implic ation opted out of the Model Law and Part II and this is suffic ient for the purpose of s 15 IAA. The word ‘agreed’ in s 15 inc ludes agreement by implic ation and is not restric ted to an express agreement to the c ontrary. 

23\. Mr Chuah also submitted that: 

 (a) The heading to every pleading referred only to the UNCITRAL Rules. 

 (b) The Respondents had initially relied solely on Artic le 15 of the UNCITRAL Rules. ‘This shows that the Respondents were not aware of the IAA at that time nor did they intend to rely on the IAA’ (para 14 of Claimant’s Submission). 

 (c ) The parties had not referred to the IAA in the arbitration provision. ‘It was never the intention of the parties to be governed by the IAA and the Model Law’ (para 24 of Claimant’s Submission). 

 (d) Malaysia and Brunei have not adopted the Model Law. 

24\. Mr Chuah referred to two c ases. The first was _Coop International Pte Ltd v Ebel SA_ <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 670</span>, a dec ision by Chan Seng Onn JC. 

25\. In that c ase, the first agreement whic h inc orporated an arbitration provision provided that the Rules of Arbitration of the Chamber of Commerc e and Industry of Geneva Switzerland (‘the Geneva Rules’), were to apply. It also provided that ‘The arbitral tribunal shall have its seat in Geneva’. This agreement was terminated by a termination agreement whic h did not have an arbitration provision. Subsequently, the parties entered into a third agreement whic h was in the nature of a settlement agreement. A dispute arose under the third agreement and a question arose whether the arbitration provision in the first agreement applied. 

26\. Chan JC held that it did not. However he also gave his views, though obiter, on the arbitration provision and s 15 of the IAA in relation to a mandatory stay of c ourt proc eedings. 

27\. As the arbitration provision had provided for arbitration outside Singapore, Chan JC was of the view that s 15 IAA was not applic able and henc e it c ould not and need not be used to oust the applic ation of the Model Law and Part II. Chan JC then rendered his view on the hypothetic al situation whereby parties had c hosen Singapore as the plac e of their arbitration but agreed to abide entirely by the Geneva Rules. 

28\. In his view, the Geneva Rules were inc ompatible with the Model Law as applied in Singapore and he referred to the Geneva Rules on an appointment of a sole arbitrator as an illustration. He c onc luded thus: 

 ‘143 Artic le 19 does not help muc h as the selec tion of the arbitrator is not simply a rule of 


 proc edure that has to be followed by the arbitral tribunal in c onduc ting proc eedings. It is substantive in nature. In this hypothetic al c ase, the parties had selec ted a proc edure whic h is c ontrary to the mandatory provision in the IAA and the Model Law. 

 144 In my opinion, it is not nec essary to have an explic it agreement stating that the Model Law or Part II will not apply, as c ounsel for the respondents had c ontended. Sec tion 15 itself does not appear to require a c lear express term of exc lusion. On a plain and literal reading of that sec tion, it c an c over both express and implied exc lusions. If the intention is to limit s 15 to an express ouster only, Parliament c ould easily have provided for it. 

 145 Sec ond, the transition provision in s 26 of the IAA provides that Part II shall not apply to an international arbitration that was c ommenc ed before 27 January 1995, the date the IAA c ame into forc e. It would appear that the IAA c overs international arbitration agreements c onc luded before the IAA was in forc e. Parties c ertainly c ould not be expec ted to know that there is a need under s 15 to expressly opt out of the Model Law or Part II. I do not think that Parliament c ould have intended that these parties should be prec luded from opting out and that they should be forc ed to adopt proc edures for arbitration in Singapore that are c ontrary to what the parties had agreed between themselves. As with international arbitration agreements c onc luded on or after 27 January 1995, they should also have the same fac ility to opt out and the only way this c an be done is to c onstrue s 15 suc h that opting out by implic ation is allowed. 

 146 By c hoosing proc edures whic h are alien and c ontrary to the mandatory provisions in the Model Law or Part II for arbitration in Singapore , I think parties would have suc c essfully opted out by implic ation. 

 147 What then is the legal regime to govern that arbitration in Singapore after the parties had by implic ation opted out? Having regard to s 5(4), I am of the view that if Part II is no longer applic able, then the legal regime reverts to the Arbitration Ac t (Cap 10) (AA). The definition of arbitration agreement in s 2 of the AA is extremely wide and would c over all arbitration agreements, whether domestic or international in nature. When Part II and the Model Law in the IAA applies, the AA is not applic able. So when Part II and the Model Law are inapplic able, the AA must apply. I c annot envisage a lac una here. 

 148 I do not think I should go further to deal with the question how the arbitration is going to be c onduc ted having regard to the fac t that the Geneva Rules are not exac tly in line with many of the provisions in the AA. It may well be easier if the parties, after realising the c omplexities, simply agree to go to Geneva to arbitrate rather than have it done in Singapore if they still want to follow the Geneva Rules. But the point remains that they c an arbitrate in Singapore using proc edures other than the Model Law.’ 

29\. In summary, where the plac e of international arbitration is Singapore, Chan JC’s view was that the adoption of rules inc ompatible with the Model Law or Part II would mean that the parties had opted out under s 15. Furthermore, his dec ision indic ated that onc e there is an opting out of either the Model Law or Part II, both are exc luded. Lastly, he dec ided that if the Model Law and Part II do not apply, then the AA applies. 

30\. The appeal against Chan JC’s dec ision was dismissed but it was not suggested by either side that the dismissal of the appeal had any bearing on the pre-amendment s 15 IAA. 

31\. The sec ond c ase referred to by Mr Chuah was _John Holland Pty Ltd (fka John Holland Construction & Engineering Pty Ltd) v Toyo Engineering Corp (Japan)_ <span class="citation">[2001] 2 SLR 262</span>, a dec ision by 


Choo Han Tec k JC. 

32\. In that c ase, the parties had expressly agreed to refer disputes to arbitration for settlement under the rules of Conc iliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerc e (‘the ICC Rules’). Ac c ording to para 1 of Choo JC’s judgment, the arbitration c lause stipulated that the arbitration was to be held in Singapore ac c ording to the laws of Singapore. However the hearing ac tually took plac e in Vanc ouver although the final submissions were c onduc ted in Singapore. A preliminary question arose as to whether Part II and the Model Law of the IAA applied. 

33\. Choo JC said: 

 ‘9 It will be helpful to begin by c onsidering some general princ iples, and perhaps, take into ac c ount the philosophies of the domestic and international arbitration that both c ounsel believe have a material bearing on the way the statutory provisions are to be interpreted. It is obvious from the Singapore Hansard reports, whic h both c ounsel referred to, that the IAA was enac ted to provide expedienc y and flexibility to parties who wish to c onduc t an international arbitration in Singapore or have Singapore law apply. Thus, s 15 permits the parties to exc lude Pt II or the Model Law (or both) by agreement. It is also c ommon ground that there are material differenc es between the ICC Rules and the Model Law. But in spite of these differenc es, the two sets of rules purport to perform the same func tion, whic h is, to provide the proc edural struc ture for the arbitration. In any form of dispute resolution, the func tion of the proc edural struc ture is to fac ilitate the resolution proc ess by freeing the parties to c onc entrate on the real and substantive issues of fac t and law. If one shares this view, then it bec omes plain that the adoption of two different c odes only serves as a distrac tion and will dissipate the energy and time of the protagonists in unnec essary c larific ation of c onflic ting rules. 

 10 Mr Hwang and Mr Wong used the term ‘implied opting out’ as a c onvenient way of expressing whether the adoption of the ICC Rules had that effec t on the Model Law. That is one way of looking at it, but on my part, I am not c omfortable with the term ‘implied opting out’ in the c ontext of s 15. In my judgment, s 15 requires the parties to be c lear in selec ting another set of rules if they do not wish the Model Law to apply by default. I think that it may not be the c orrec t approac h to argue that there was an implied opting out (as Mr Hwang did), or that the entire c irc umstanc es and fac ts must be sc rutinized to see whether an opting-out may be implied (as Mr Wong suggested). I should add that Mr Wong wishes me to take into ac c ount the fac t that c ounsel for JHPL ac tually made submissions on two oc c asions (one in the final submissions here in Singapore) in relianc e on the provisions of the Model Law. Thus, he said that the relianc e militates against any implic it opting-out. .... However, the c irc umstanc es reveal a different pic ture to me altogether. By agreeing to have the arbitration c onduc ted in ac c ordanc e with the ICC Rules, the parties have thereby, in my view, agreed that the Model Law will not apply, or in the words of s 15, ‘that the arbitration be settled or resolved otherwise than in ac c ordanc e with the Model Law’. If they should subsequently at the proc eeding itself, by c onsent or without objec tion, rely on the Model Law (or any other set of rules) at the arbitration they will be regarded as having agreed to do so on an ad hoc basis. That arrangement will end when either party wishes to revert to the c hosen rules; and any dispute as to whether they would be permitted to do so will be determined by the arbitrator. The arbitrator is perfec tly entitled to determine whether any issue of estoppel arises and whether there is a need to revert to the c ontrac tually c hosen rules in writing. Therefore, in this c ase, the ICC Rules remain the governing rules to the exc lusion of the Model Law. There are two anc illary points whic h I ought to deal with. The first c onc erns the question whether Pt II of the IAA must be applied in tandem with the Model Law suc h that both are exc luded whenever the parties have exc luded either of them. The sec ond c onc erns the question whether the AA applies, as the default legislation as it were, 


whenever the IAA has been exc luded. 

_Pt II and the Model Law as one_ 

11     In the _Coop_ c ase (supra), the judge assumed that when the parties have selec ted a set of rules other than the Model Law, they have thereby implic itly opted out not only of the Model Law but the IAA as well. The issue whether the two are c onjoined did not appear to have been argued before the c ourt in that c ase. The c ourt’s assumption elic ited the following c ommentary by the editors of _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_. They say at p 18 of vol 2 ([20.012] note 14): 

 Often c ontrac tual rules of arbitration are c onfused with the applic able law of the arbitration ( lex arbitri ). While parties may adopt c ertain rules of arbitration, the law of the arbitration is normally determined by the law of the situs or the seat of the arbitration. For this reason, rules of international arbitral institutions do not normally spec ify the applic able law of arbitration ( lex arbitri ). Many arbitrations in Singapore are c onduc ted in ac c ordanc e with institutional rules of arbitration suc h as the International Chamber of Commerc e (ICC) and the UNCITRAL Rules. Whether or not the law of the arbitration is the Arbitration Ac t or the International Arbitration Ac t should be dec ided upon the fac tors set out in the International Arbitration Ac t s 5(2). In Coop International Pte Ltd v Ebel SA <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 670</span>, Chan Seng Onn JC said at 142 146, in relation to a hypothetic al situation where if the parties had c hosen Singapore as the plac e of arbitration and adopted the Rules of the Chamber of Commerc e and Industry of Geneva, then the parties would have suc c essfully opted out of the International Arbitration Ac t by implic ation. He illustrated his view with the example that under the Geneva Rules, the arbitrators are to be appointed by the Chamber of Commerc e and Industry of Geneva, whereas under the International Arbitration Ac t, the Chairman of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre is the appointing authority. It is submitted that the c ourt’s view on this point is erroneous and the illustration inappropriate. Choic e of institutional rules of arbitration has been c onfused with the applic ation of lex arbitri. 

12     The express wording of s 15 permits the parties to exc lude either Pt II or the Model Law (or both). That is the princ ipal right that the IAA c onfers on them. It will not stand to reason to interpret the word ‘and’ (in ‘... this Part and the Model Law shall not apply ...’) in the sec ond part of s 15 literally bec ause that would have c astrated what was intended to be a potent right of c hoic e, without so muc h as the intervention of a semi-c olon. If, for example, the parties had elec ted to apply Pt II but not the Model Law, it c annot follow that c onsequently, both Pt II and the Model Law bec ome inapplic able. In my view, one must naturally read the words ‘as the c ase may be’ in ellipsis before the words ‘shall not apply’. In arriving at this c onc lusion, I gathered support from the wording of s 5 of the IAA whic h has a reversed image of s 15. Sec tion 5 allows parties to a domestic arbitration to adopt Pt II of the IAA or the Model Law. When one looks at the wording of s 5, it will at onc e be c lear that the legislature c ould not have intended the domestic AA to be substituted by the IAA if the parties had c hosen the Model Law without c hoosing Pt II. Sec tion 5 reads: 

 This Part and the Model Law shall not apply to an arbitration whic h is not an international arbitration unless the parties agree in writing that this Part or the Model Law shall apply to that arbitration. 


 The words ‘as the c ase may be’ should similarly be inc orporated after ‘this Part or the Model Law’. It will also be seen that all the provisions of Pt II are c apable of applic ation on their own without the Model Law. Sec tion 5(4) emphasizes the point. ‘Notwithstanding anything to the c ontrary in t he Arbitration Ac t, that Ac t shall not apply to any arbitration to whic h this Part applies.’ The omission of ‘the Model Law’ provides the emphasis. 

 13 I would state an obvious point at the risk of appearing tautologous, but I think that it is important to do so in this c ase. The point is this. When parties selec t Pt II of the IAA, without spec ifying the Model Law as well, the Model Law is naturally inc luded bec ause it is part of Pt II, as it is by means of the First Sc hedule to the IAA. However, the c onverse is not so. When parties selec t the Model Law without spec ifying Pt II of the IAA, the latter does not apply. When the beast is slain, its tail is slain; when its tail is slain, the beast is not. 

 14 Thus, the only issue in the c ase before me, was whether the ICC Rules fall into the same genus as the Model Law. It may not be disputed that the ICC Rules are different from legislative provisions suc h as Pt II of the IAA, but ought we to hold that the Model Law being part of a statute be similarly regarded? In the present c ontext I think not. The Model Law was c reated as an optional set of rules to be utilised like any other set of c ontrac tual rules suc h as the ICC Rules. It follows, therefore, that the parties had elec ted to apply the ICC Rules in plac e of the Model Law, thereby exc luding the Model Law only. The elec tion did not inc lude Pt II of the IAA. It may be helpful if I issue the reminder that parties ought to express their intention without ambiguity. Parliament enac ted the IAA to govern international arbitration, but c onfers upon the parties the liberty of c hoic e. When the parties make their elec tion, they must remember that by exc luding the IAA they may have invoked the AA by default (if the c hoic e of law c lause spec ifies Singapore law, as in this c ase). There is no reason why the AA c annot apply to an international arbitration, but parties ought to be sure and c lear as to what they want when making a s 15 elec tion. 

 15 The approac h I had taken in c oming to this finding is based on the princ iple that statutory provisions must be read plainly, and interpreted stric tly and faithfully; but when parties have, by sheer ingenuity or fortuity, c reated a set of c irc umstanc es not envisaged by the draftsman, then the c ourt ought to apply the law with suffic ient latitude to give effec t as c losely as possible to the agreement of the parties. This is espec ially so in matters c onc erning international arbitration in whic h the attrac tiveness of resolving c ommerc ial disputes between international parties ac c ording to the manner and law of their c hoic e, by arbitrators of their c hoic e, and unfettered by domestic rules (designed in part, to c ater to domestic needs) are some of the fac tors that have led to the asc endanc y of international arbitration in rec ent times.’ 

34\. Ac c ordingly, Choo JC was also of the view that the c hoic e of a set of rules inc ompatible with the Model Law meant that the parties had agreed that the arbitration be settled or resolved otherwise than in ac c ordanc e with the Model Law. I will refer to this as ‘an implied opting out’ although Choo JC was not c omfortable with that term. 

35\. However, Choo JC held that even though the Model Law was exc luded, Part II was not. He then went on to deal with s 24 of the IAA whic h was relevant in the c ase before him but irrelevant to the c ase before me. Apparently, there was no appeal against his dec ision. 

36\. Mr Chuah relied on both _Coop_ and _John Holland_ for the proposition that a selec tion of an inc ompatible set of rules like the UNCITRAL Rules is suffic ient to c onstitute the agreement of exc lusion under s 15 IAA. 


37\. He also relied on _Coop_ for the proposition that onc e an inc ompatible set of rules is adopted, then both the Model Law and Part II do not apply. On this point, he submitted that _John Holland_ was inc orrec tly dec ided bec ause the Model Law and Part II are inextric ably intertwined. 

38\. After these two c ases, the IAA was amended. In partic ular, the old s 15 was repealed and substituted. The c urrent s 15 states: 

 ‘15. (1) If the parties to an arbitration agreement (whether made before or after the date of c ommenc ement of the International Arbitration (Amendment) Ac t 2001) have expressly agreed either 

 (a) that the Model Law or this Part shall not apply to the arbitration; or (b) that the Arbitration Ac t 2001 or the repealed Arbitration Ac t (Cap.10) shall apply to the arbitration, 

 then, both the Model Law and this Part shall not apply to that arbitration but the Arbitration Ac t 2001 or the repealed Arbitration Ac t (if applic able) shall apply to that arbitration. 

 (2) For the avoidanc e of doubt, a provision in an arbitration agreement referring to or adopting any rules of an arbitral institution shall not of itself be suffic ient to exc lude the applic ation of the Model Law or this Part to the arbitration c onc erned.’ [Emphasis added.] 

39\. Counsel for the parties agreed that the c urrent s 15 IAA is c lear in that the mere adoption of any set of arbitration rules will not exc lude the applic ation of the Model Law. Furthermore, it is also c lear under the c urrent s 15 IAA that if the parties have expressly agreed that the Model Law or Part II shall not apply to an arbitration, then both the Model law and Part II shall not apply. Having said that, it seems to me that the c urrent s 15(2) IAA, should read, ‘... shall not of itself be suffic ient to exc lude the applic ation of the Model Law and this Part to the arbitration c onc erned’. 

40\. 1 November 2001 is the date of c ommenc ement of all the rec ent amendments to the IAA. However, the transition provision states that the amending Ac t shall not apply to arbitration proc eedings c ommenc ed before the date of c ommenc ement of the amending Ac t. The arbitration before me was c ommenc ed before the date of c ommenc ement of the amending Ac t. 

41\. The question is whether the c urrent s 15 IAA effec ts a c hange to s 15 prior to the amendment or merely re-affirms what was already the intention behind and the meaning of the pre-amendment s 

15\. It was not disputed that I c ould have regard to Parliamentary Reports on any relevant Bill to assist me. Indeed this is provided in s 9A of the Interpretation Ac t (Cap 1). 

42\. When the Bill in respec t of the IAA was read in 1994, Assoc iate Professor Ho Peng Kee (the then Parliamentary Sec retary to the Minister for Law) said, on 31 Oc tober 1994: 

 ‘The Bill will mainly implement the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on International Commerc ial Arbitration on an "opt-out" basis ....’ 

43\. Subsequently, on 5 Oc tober 2001, Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee, who had then bec ome the Minister of State for Law, said, in respec t of the amending Ac t: 

 ‘ Sir, this Bill is related to the Bill whic h was just passed [ i.e the Bill to amend the Arbitration Ac t]. This Bill makes c onsequential and related amendments to the International Arbitration Ac t 


to ensure its c onsistenc y with the Arbitration Bill whic h we have just moved earlier. Another objec tive is to c larify c ertain provisions in the International Arbitration Ac t. This Bill is another produc t of the work of the AttorneyGeneral’s Chambers’ Law Reform and Revision Division. Indeed, c onsultation on this Bill was done jointly with those that took plac e on the Arbitration Bill. 

Sir, this Bill effec ts the following c hanges in order to harmonise it with the proposed Arbitration Ac t: 

First, the stay of proc eedings provisions will be streamlined. I think I have mentioned this already just now. Bec ause under the existing International Arbitration Ac t, all stay of proc eeding applic ations must be filed in the High Court, regardless of whether the ac tion was originally c ommenc ed in the Subordinate Courts or the High Court. This Bill will remove this inc onvenienc e bec ause now the parties need not submit the matter for determination by the High Court. 

Sec ond, the Bill amends the International Arbitration Ac t to allow the Court on its own motion to disc ontinue c ertain stayed ac tions if at least two years have elapsed sinc e the order of stay has been made. As I have explained just now, this amendment follows from that in the first Bill, bec ause two years is a long enough time for the ac tion to proc eed if the parties have so intended and, in any c ase, even if disc ontinued, they c an take up an ac tion to restart it. 

Thirdly, the Bill provides limited immunity to the default appointing authority and arbitral institutions. This states that arbitral institutions are not liable for anything done or omitted in respec t of the disc harge of their func tions in appointing or nominating arbitrators unless there is shown to have been bad faith involved in the ac t or omission. The provision also c larifies that the appointing authority or arbitral institution is not liable for the ac ts of the arbitrator appointed or nominated by it. 

Sir, apart from the foregoing, two main amendments are made to provide c larific ations, so that there will be greater c ertainty as to the operation of the International Arbitration Ac t. Firstly, c lause 14 provides c larific ation on the finality of an interim award. Under UK arbitration law and our domestic Arbitration Ac t, an interim award, onc e given, is binding and c annot be reviewed by the arbitrator. The Model Law says nothing about the finality of an interim award but prac titioners have long assumed that the position is the same as well. The AttorneyGeneral, the Chairman of the SIAC and leading arbitrators, inc luding members of the Singapore Institute of Arbitrators, have rec ommended that legislation be passed to c larify this position to avoid unc ertainty in the law. Thus, c lause 14 of the Bill amends the Ac t to state c learly that the position in Singapore for international arbitrations is that interim awards are final and binding. 

Sec ond, c lause 12 of the Bill amends sec tion 15 of the International Arbitration Ac t to c larify its sc ope. Sec tion 15 was intended to allow parties who desire a greater degree of judic ial int ervent ion to opt out of the Model Law regime into the domestic Arbitration Ac t as the applic able law of arbitration. In its existing form it has c reated some unc ertainty in the industry and requires c larific ation. The first question to be resolved is whether parties to an arbitration agreement should be regarded as having opted out of the Model Law if the arbitration agreement c ontains a referenc e to the use of institutional arbitration rules, eg, ICC rules, without more. A new sec tion 15(2) is therefore added to c larify that a referenc e in an arbitration agreement to any institutional arbitration rules would not, by itself, be regarded as an agreement to opt out of the Model Law. 

The sec ond question to resolve is whic h legal regime will apply in the event that parties to 


 an international arbitration c onduc ted in Singapore opt out of the Model Law. For the avoidanc e of doubt, sec tion 15 is amended to state that Singapore’s domestic arbitration law under the Arbitration Ac t would apply to the arbitration if parties expressly c hoose to opt out of the International Arbitration Ac t or the Model Law.’ [Emphasis added.] 

44\. On the first issue i.e whether the pre-amendment s 15 allowed an implied opting out, Mr Chuah submitted that the plain reading of the pre-amendment s 15 c learly allowed an implied opting out. Therefore, he submitted, the amendment to s 15 was to c hange the law. 

45\. However, as regards the sec ond issue i.e whether an opting out of the Model Law or Part II would nec essarily mean that both have been exc luded, he submitted that the amendment to s 15 did not c hange the law as it was the law, as enunc iated in _Coop_ , that the opting out of one would exc lude both. 

**_Respondents’ position_** 

46\. Mr Sundaresh Menon appeared for both the Respondents. His primary position was that as regards the first issue, both _Coop_ and _John Holland_ were inc orrec tly dec ided. In other words, there c an be no implied opting out. 

47\. Mr Menon stressed that the parties had c hosen Singapore as the plac e of arbitration. Ac c ordingly, the question was whether the IAA or the AA applies. The parties c annot c hoose to opt out of both the IAA and the AA as the plac e of arbitration is Singapore. He submitted that the parties did not intend for the AA to apply as this was an international arbitration. 

48\. Mr Menon relied on the speec h of Assoc. Prof. Ho regarding the amendments to s 15. He submitted that Assoc. Prof. Ho had stressed that they were to c larify the position whereas in respec t of amendments to some other provisions, Assoc. Prof. Ho had said that they were c hanges. He submitted that Mr Chuah was pic king and c hoosing when Mr Chuah submitted that, as regards the first issue, the amendments to s 15 c onstituted a c hange to the law but, as regards the sec ond issue, the amendments to s 15 merely reflec ted what was already the law. 

49\. Mr Menon submitted that if I did not agree with his primary submission, then his alternative position would be that although there c ould be an implied opting out of the Model Law, an implied opting out of the Model Law would not mean that the parties had opted out of Part II as well. This related to the sec ond issue for whic h he submitted that Choo JC’s dec ision was to be preferred to that of Chan JC’s. 

50\. On the sec ond issue, Mr Menon submitted that there is a distinc tion between the c urial law and the rules governing the c onduc t of arbitration proc eedings. For example, ss 2 to 8, 10, 19 and 20 and 24 IAA relate to the c urial law. Aspec ts like the avenue for an appeal to a c ourt of law, if any, would c ome under the c urial law but would not be c overed under rules on the c onduc t of arbitration proc eedings like the UNCITRAL Rules or the ICC Rules. 

51\. Ac c ordingly, while the Model Law would not apply under his alternative submission, the other provisions of the IAA would still apply. As the enabling provision for sec urity for c osts, s 12, is not part of the Model Law but the IAA, the arbitrator would still have jurisdic tion to make an award for sec urity for c osts to be provided. 


**_My decision_** 

52\. It seems to me that in _Coop_ and _John Holland_ , both Chan JC and Choo JC were of the view that there should not be two inc ompatible sets of rules applying to the c onduc t of the arbitration. As parties had expressly c hosen a set of rules inc ompatible with the Model Law, that would mean that the parties had opted out of the Model Law. 

53\. While I agree that there should not be two inc ompatible sets of rules applying to the c onduc t of an arbitration, I am of the view that attention should be foc ussed first on whether the parties have c hosen Singapore as the plac e of arbitration. 

54\. If Singapore is the plac e of arbitration, the c urial law of Singapore applies. As the speec h by Assoc. Prof. Ho on 5 Oc tober 2001 shows, the question then is whether the IAA or the AA applies. The question of opting out was to allow parties to opt out of the IAA into the AA and not to opt out of the IAA into a set of rules of an arbitral institution governing the c onduc t of the arbitration. I would add that the c urial law, or the lex arbitri as it is sometimes c alled, is not nec essarily restric ted to a set of proc edural rules governing the c onduc t of the arbitration. 

55\. For example, Redfern and Hunter on Law and Prac tic e of International Commerc ial Arbitration 

3       rd Edition, p 83 states: 

 ‘ (d) The lex arbitri a procedural law? 

 It is sometimes said that the lex arbitri is a law of proc edure. It is true that the lex arbitri may deal with proc edural matters suc h as the c onstitution of the arbitral tribunal where there is no relevant c ontrac tual provision but the authors suggest that the lex arbitri is muc h more than a purely proc edural law. It may stipulate, for instanc e, that a given type of dispute over patent rights, for instanc e, or (as in some Arab states) over a loc al agenc y agreement is not c apable of settlement by arbitration under the loc al law. It is suggested that this is a matter of substanc e rather than of proc edure. Or again by way of example, an award may be set aside on the basis that it is c ontrary to the public polic y of the lex arbitri ; onc e more, this would seem to be a matter of substantive law rather than of proc edure.’ 

56\. I would also refer to the c omments in Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore Vol 2 p 18 footnote 14, most of whic h were c ited by Choo JC in para 11 of his judgment. 

57\. If the c urial law of Singapore applies and the arbitration is an international one, then, prima fac ie, the IAA applies. Sinc e the IAA inc orporates the Model Law, the Model Law has also effec tively been c hosen by the parties, even though they might have been unaware of it. Ignoranc e of the law is no exc use. The question is whether the Model Law and Part II IAA have been exc luded under s 15. 

58\. I ac c ept the point that the Respondents were not aware of the IAA at the time the Agreement was exec uted. The Claimant was also not aware. 

59\. The thrust of Mr Chuah’s submission was that as the parties were not aware of the IAA at the material time, they c ould not have intended for the IAA to apply. However, I am of the view that the IAA applies bec ause the parties had agreed that Singapore is the seat of arbitration and not bec ause the parties had expressly adopted the IAA. 

60\. Given that the seat of arbitration is Singapore, it seems to me that the c orrec t approac h is not 


to c onsider whether the parties intended to inc lude the IAA but whether they intended to exc lude the IAA and henc e the Model Law and Part II. Ac c ordingly, the fac t that the parties were not aware of the IAA at the material time militates against, rather than supports, the Claimant’s position. 

61\. I agree with the observation in para 38 of the arbitrator’s Reasons for the Dismissal of the Claimant’s Applic ation for a Stay of Exec ution on his order on sec urity for c osts. He said: 

 ‘38. In this c ase I find that at all material times and until the parties entered into their submissions before me as to whether I had the power to order sec urity, the issue of whether the IAA applied did not c ross their minds at all. One c annot opt-out of a statute whic h is not in one’s c onsc iousness anymore than one c an elec t not to jump over a hurdle whic h is not in the line of one’s vision.’ 

62\. I should mention that often parties do not apprec iate the c onsequenc es of c hoosing a state as the plac e of arbitration. Also, the venue of the hearing of the arbitration is often taken to be synonymous with the plac e of the arbitration. Indeed this may well have been the situation before me but there is no dispute that Singapore is the plac e of arbitration. 

63\. In _Naviera Amazonica Peruana S.A. v Compania Internacional De Seguros Del Peru_ [1988] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 116 (the _Peruvian Insurance_ c ase), Kerr LJ said at p 120 and 121: 

 ‘Finally, as I mentioned at the outset, it seems c lear that the submissions advanc ed below c onfused the legal "seat" etc of an arbitration with the geographic ally c onvenient plac e or plac es for holding hearings. This distinc tion is nowadays a c ommon feature of international arbitrations and is helpfully explained in Redfern and Hunter at p.69 in the following passage under the heading "The Plac e for Arbitration": 

 The prec eding disc ussion has been on the basis that there is only one "plac e" of arbitration. This will be the plac e c hosen by or on behalf of the parties; and it will be designated in the arbitration agreement or the terms of referenc e or the minutes of proc eedings or in some other way as the plac e or "seat" of the arbitration. This does not mean, however, that the arbitral tribunal must hold all its meetings or hearings at the plac e of arbitration. International c ommerc ial arbitration often involves people of many different nationalities, from many different c ountries. In these c irc umst anc es, it is by no means unusual for an arbitral tribunal to hold meetings or even hearings in a plac e other than the designated plac e of arbitration, either for its own c onvenienc e or for the c onvenienc e of the parties or their witnesses.... It may be more c onvenient for an arbitral tribunal sitting in one c ountry to c onduc t a hearing in another c ountry for instanc e, for the purpose of taking evidenc e .... In suc h c irc umstanc es eac h move of the arbitral tribunal does not of itself mean that the seat of the arbitration c hanges. The seat of the arbitration remains the plac e initially agreed by or on behalf of the parties.’ 

 [Emphasis added.] 

A similar passage is found in p 86 and 87 of the 3rd Edition, 1999, of Redfern and Hunter. 

64\. Ac c ordingly, parties and their professional advisers would have to be familiar with the c onc ept of the plac e of arbitration and the c onsequenc e of c hoosing a state as the plac e of arbitration. As 


the c urial law of any state may c hange from time to time, they would also have to be familiar with the c urial law of the plac e of arbitration at the time the agreement to arbitrate is entered into as well as at the time when arbitration is c ontemplated and when it c ommenc es. 

65\. I would also add two other points. First, if parties do not wish the IAA or the AA to apply, then they should not c hoose Singapore as the plac e of arbitration although they may have Singapore as the venue of the hearing. Sec ondly, the governing law of the substantive dispute is a different c onc ept from the plac e of arbitration and the c urial law. 

66\. The fac t that the parties before me have c hosen another set of rules to govern the arbitration proc eedings does not in itself negate their c hoic e of Singapore as the plac e of arbitration. Furthermore, it is more probable than not that they were also unaware of the AA and/or in any event did not intend the AA to apply to their international arbitration. 

67\. As for the amendments to s 15, it is my view that Assoc. Prof. Ho had made it c lear that the amendments thereto were to c larify Parliament’s intention behind the original s 15 and not to c hange it. This is reinforc ed by the following phrase, ‘For the avoidanc e of doubt’ in the c urrent s 15(2) IAA. 

68\. Ac c ordingly, as regards the first issue, I am of the view that the requirement for parties to agree to exc lude the Model Law or Part II was and is a requirement for an express opting out in that the mere adoption of the rules of an arbitral institution would not be suffic ient to c onstitute suc h an exc lusion. 

69\. The question then is, if the Model Law applies, does this mean that the other inc ompatible set of rules is totally exc luded or is it exc luded only in so far as it is not inc onsistent with the Model Law? From what I have said above, my view is that the other set of rules is c ompletely exc luded. Likewise, if the other set of rules applies, then the Model Law is c ompletely exc luded. 

70\. I would add that in _Coop_ , Chan JC dec ided that the Model Law and the IAA would not have applied bec ause of inc ompatibility with the Geneva rules but held that the AA would then apply in plac e of the IAA, to avoid a lac una. However if the then AA (before the c urrent amendments to the AA) had applied, it too would have at least one provision inc ompatible with that of the Geneva Rules i.e s 8(2) of the then AA provides that it is the High Court (as the c ourt is defined under s 2) who may appoint an arbitrator whereas the Geneva Rules provide for the Chamber of Commerc e and Industry of Geneva to be the appointing authority. Therefore, that inc ompatibility would still not have been resolved by the exc lusion of the Model Law and the IAA. Indeed, Chan JC rec ognised in para 148 of his judgment that ‘the Geneva Rules are not exac tly in line with many of the provisions in the AA’. 

71\. As an aside, I would mention that the AA has also been amended rec ently with a new AA c oming into forc e on 1 Marc h 2002. The new AA also has its own set of provisions governing the c onduc t of an arbitration. For example, s 28(2) thereof gives the arbitrator power to make an order for sec urity for c osts. 

72\. As for the sec ond issue, Mr Menon’s argument that there is a distinc tion between the c urial law and the rules governing the c onduc t of arbitration proc eedings is neither here nor there. The question is whether Parliament intended for both the Model Law and Part II to be read and applied together under the pre-amendment s 15 IAA. 

73\. Although Choo JC dec ided that Part II would still apply even if the Model Law did not, Choo JC’s dec ision on the sec ond issue would give rise to further questions. For example, s 8(2) IAA (whic h is under Part II) stipulates that the Chairman of the SIAC, or suc h other person as the Chief Justic e may 


appoint, ‘shall be taken to have been spec ified as the authority c ompetent to perform the func tion under Artic le 11(3) and (4) of the Model Law’. If the Model Law is exc luded, would s 8(2) IAA apply or not? 

74\. If s 8(2) IAA still applies, the inc ompatibility regarding the appointing authority would still be present. However, if s 8(2) IAA does not apply, then whic h other provisions of Part II of the IAA also do not apply? 

75\. For c onvenienc e, I set out the pre-amendment s 15 again. It reads: 

 ‘15. If the parties to an arbitration agreement have (whether in the arbitration agreement or in any other doc ument in writing) agreed that any dispute that has arisen or may arise between them is to be settled or resolved otherwise than in ac c ordanc e with this Part or the Model Law, this Part and the Model Law shall not apply in relation to the settlement or resolution of that dispute.’ [Emphasis added.] 

76\. I note the use of the c onjunc tion ‘or’ initially between Part II and the Model Law and then the use of the c onjunc tion ‘and’. In my view the use of ‘and’ was deliberate as the draftsman c ould have easily used ‘or’ again if that was the intention. The use of ‘and’ was therefore not an oversight. 

77\. I would respec tfully add that I do not think that reading into s 15 the words ‘as the c ase may be’ in ellipsis before the words ‘shall not apply’, as suggested by Choo JC, will work. To illustrate with the additional words inserted, the c lause would then read, 

 ‘... this Part and the Model Law, as the c ase may be, shall not apply in relation to the settlement or resolution of that dispute.’ 

78\. As Choo JC also relied on s 5(1) IAA to reac h his c onc lusion, I set out s 5(1) IAA: 

 ‘5(1) This Part and the Model Law shall not apply to an arbitration whic h is not an international arbitration unless the parties agree in writing that this Part or the Model Law shall apply to that arbitration.’ 

79\. Choo JC was of the view that under s 5(1), parties were allowed to adopt Part II or the Model Law. I do not disagree that parties to a domestic arbitration agreement c an c hoose whether to adopt Part II or the Model Law provided this is expressed c learly and the nec essary qualific ations are made to avoid ambiguity. However, I do not think that it is c orrec t to say that this was the meaning or intention under s 5(1). I am of the view that if parties to a domestic arbitration agree that Part II or the Model Law applies, without more, then, under s 5(1) IAA, both Part II and the Model Law will apply. 

80\. With respec t, a similar inc orporation of the words ‘as the c ase may be’ after ‘this Part of the Model Law’ in s 5(1) will not advanc e Choo JC’s view that c hoosing Part II or the Model Law will mean that only Part II or the Model Law will apply. To illustrate, the provision would then read: 

 ‘5(1) This Part and the Model Law shall not apply to an arbitration whic h is not an international arbitration unless the parties agree in writing that this Part or the Model Law, as the c ase may be, shall apply to that arbitration.’ 

81\. To put the question in another way, if parties in a domestic arbitration agree in writing that 


Part II or the Model Law shall apply, what will apply? The answer, it seems to me, is found in the first part of s 5(1) IAA i.e ‘This Part and the Model Law’ [emphasis added]. I agree with Choo JC that s 5(1) is the reverse of s 15 IAA but not in the manner stated by him. 

82\. Choo JC also relied on s 5(4) IAA whic h he said emphasizes his point. Sec tion 5(4) IAA states: 

 ‘(4) Notwithstanding anything to the c ontrary in the Arbitration Ac t, that Ac t shall not apply to any arbitration to whic h this Part applies.’ 

 He was of the view that the omission of ‘the Model Law’ provides the emphasis. 

83\. With respec t, I do not think s 5(4) helps. As Choo JC rec ognised in the next paragraph of his judgment, i.e para 13 thereof, a referenc e to Part II, without spec ifying the Model Law, naturally inc ludes the Model Law whic h is part of Part II. Ac c ordingly, it is not nec essary for s 5(4) IAA to expressly state that the Arbitration Ac t shall not apply to an arbitration to whic h this Part ‘and the Model Law’ applies. 

84\. It is my view that Parliament’s intention and preferenc e was and is that, where Singapore is the plac e of arbitration and the arbitration is an international one, both the Model Law and Part II should be read and be applied together. Even if the arbitration were a domestic one and the parties agree that the Model Law or Part II is to apply, then both the Model Law and Part II should be read and be applied together. 

85\. In addition, as I have said, it is my view that Assoc. Prof. Ho had made it c lear that the amendments to s 15 were to c larify and not to c hange the law. 

86\. Ac c ordingly, as regards the sec ond issue in respec t of s 15, if the Model Law or Part II is expressly exc luded, both will not apply. This was and is the position under s 15. 

87\. In summary, I hold that the Model Law and Part II apply to the arbitration in question. The inc lusion of the UNCITRAL rules in the Agreement does not oust their applic ation. The UNCITRAL rules do not apply but it is open to the parties to now agree that suc h rules will apply to fill any vac uum in the Model Law and Part II or to apply suc h rules on an ad hoc basis. 

**_Secondary issue_** 

88\. A number of sec ondary issues were also raised by the Claimant but eventually Mr Chuah pursued only one. 

89\. The sum of RM500,000 initially c laimed as sec urity for c osts c omprised the following items: 

 (a) Arbitrator’s fee RM 100, (b) Legal fees RM 300, (c ) SIAC c osts RM 50, (d) administrative c osts (hotel, transport, subsistenc e) 

### RM 50, 

During submissions, the amount for SIAC c osts was reduc ed to RM20,000. As I have mentioned, the arbitrator made an award for sec urity to be provided in the sum of S$200,000. 

90\. Mr Chuah submitted that even if the arbitrator had jurisdic tion to make an award for sec urity 


for c osts, he had exc eeded his jurisdic tion under s 12(1)(a) IAA when his award for sec urity for c osts inc luded the arbitrator’s fee and SIAC c osts. Ac c ordingly the quantum awarded should be reduc ed. On the other hand, Mr Menon submitted that s 12(1)(a) IAA was wide and unlimited. 

91\. Sec tion 12(1)(a) IAA states: 

 ‘12. (1) Without prejudic e to the powers set out in any other provision of this Ac t and in the Model Law, an arbitral tribunal shall have powers to make orders or give direc tions to any party for 

 (a) sec urity for c osts; ...’ 

92\. I do not see why this provision should be read in the restric tive manner suggested by Mr Chuah. 

93\. In the c irc umstanc es, the appeal is dismissed with c osts to be paid by the Claimant to both the Respondents.
