## Judgment: 

1\. The ac c used is a 36 year old unemployed man who was arrested together with his girl-friend Siti Rohaya at 8.20pm on 11 Oc tober 2000 at the ground floor of Bloc k 251 Tampines Street 21 by offic ers of the Central Narc otic s Bureau ("CNB"). The ac c used was searc hed and two foils c ontaining some loose heroin were rec overed from his left trouser poc ket as well as $660 in c ash, $650 of whic h were in an envelope, from his right trouser poc ket. The ac c used and Siti were taken up to his room in flat #04-454 in the same bloc k. 98.71g nett of heroin was found in a blac k briefc ase (P44) in his room. An Instant Urine Test was c onduc ted on Siti and the ac c used at the CNB headquarters at 1am on 12 Oc tober 2000 and they tested positive for opiates. The flat at Bloc k 251 belongs to the unc le and aunt of the ac c used. Another c ouple (Emran and his wife Suriani) together with one Ruzaini Bin Ajis were subsequently arrested in c onnec tion with the c harge against the ac c used. Siti was c harged together with the ac c used; the other three shortly thereafter. Siti, Emran, Suriani, and Ruzaini were later given a disc harge not amounting to an ac quittal. 

2\. The blac k briefc ase (P44) in the room was seized from the ac c used. The briefc ase was loc ked and the ac c used told the arresting offic ers that he "did not know where the key was". One of the arresting offic ers, Sgt Goh San, opened the briefc ase by forc e. It transpired at the trial that the briefc ase was loc ked by a c ombination loc k and no key was required. Inside the briefc ase were two pac kets of heroin wrapped in c ellophane, three brown envelopes two of whic h had handwriting on them, two digital weighing sc ales, one brown envelope c ontaining eight sac hets of heroin, and one marker pen. The CNB offic ers also found a plastic box c ontaining a sac het of heroin together with several empty sac hets. This box was found in a drawer of the ac c used persons wardrobe. Another offic er, Insp Herman, asked the ac c used to whom the drugs in the room belong and the ac c used said that they were his. He was asked what sort of drugs they were and he said "heroin". He also said that all the drugs were "for smoking". When asked, he said that he did not know how muc h he smoked a day. Various investigation statements were rec orded from the ac c used, four of them were admitted in evidenc e without c hallenge. The statements inc riminated the ac c used direc tly and substantially. 

3\. A "doc ument expert" from the Health Sc ienc es Authority (formerly Department of Sc ientific Servic es), Ms Lee Gek Kwee, was c alled by the prosec ution to give an opinion as to the authorship of the writing on two of the brown envelopes (P49 and P50) found in the blac k briefc ase (P44). She was given two sheets of spec imen writing of the ac c used written on the direc tion of the investigating offic er Insp. Abdul Halim when the ac c used was in c ustody. Ms. Lee c onc eded that the material was not suffic ient to give a more definitive view, but it was nevertheless suffic ient for her to c onc lude that the ac c used c annot be ruled out as the person who wrote on the two envelopes. The prosec ution also c alled Siti Rohaya who testified that a substantial part of P50 was written by her. A fresh set of handwriting by the ac c used, written after Ms. Lee was c alled, was then given to her. 


Under c ross-examination she c onc eded that the fresh set of handwriting differs substantially from that on the two brown envelopes. Mr. Masih produc ed a letter written by the ac c used some time before his arrest whic h was written in the same handwriting as that produc ed by the ac c used in c ourt. Ms. Lees response was that it is not unc ommon for a person to have more than one style of writing. The one on the brown envelope was written as a sc ribble and at some speed. The two other doc uments produc ed at trial were written slowly and deliberately. She held the view that despite the apparent differenc e in style, so far as the writing on the envelopes were c onc erned it c annot be ruled out as being written by someone other than the ac c used. 

4\. The defenc e dec lined to make any submission at the c lose of the prosec ution c ase, and on the evidenc e adduc ed, I was satisfied that a c ase had been made out and c alled the ac c used to enter his defenc e. He elec ted to testify. 

5\. The evidenc e of the ac c used was brief. He denies that the blac k briefc ase belongs to him. He said that it was Emrans bag whic h the latter left with him on the morning of 11 Oc tober. The bag was loc ked and he did not know the c ombination to unloc k it. He had no knowledge as to what the bag c ontained save what Emran told him, namely that it had pornographic video tapes. Emran told him that he (Emran) was under surveillanc e and therefore wanted to leave the bag with the ac c used for safe-keeping. The ac c used admitted, however, that the small sac hets of heroin found in the c upboard in his room belonged to him. He also admitted that on that day he had delivered some small portions of heroin to a friend. 

6\. The ac c used also denied that the handwriting on the brown envelopes were his. He said that the spec imen he provided to Insp. Halim ("HW-1") was written by him on Insp. Halims instruc tions to "c opy" the writing on the brown envelopes whic h the inspec tor had plac ed on the table. He testified that he understood the inspec tor to mean "c opy" by way of imitation as opposed to c opy by way of reproduc tion. Therefore, he wrote out HW-1 to resemble the writing on the envelopes. 

7\. The ac c used testified that the person to whom he delivered a small quantity of drugs to was Mohd Idris. This was c orroborated by the evidenc e of Mohd Idris who was c alled as a prosec ution witness. The ac c used also testified that this delivery was made on the instruc tions of Emran. The ac c used went to meet Siti at the nearby playground after he gave the drugs to Mohd Idris. There Sitis handphone rang and it was Emran on the line, asking the ac c used whether the delivery had been made. The ac c used and Siti were arrested before the ac c used c ould c omplete his c onversation with Emran. 

8\. In the c ourse of his evidenc e-in-c hief the ac c used denied that he had given the inc riminating answers to Insp. Herman that he (Insp. Herman) had rec orded in his poc ketbook. Insp. Herman testified that he invited the ac c used to make c orrec tions and then sign the rec ord but the ac c used dec lined to do so. The ac c used denied at trial that the answers rec orded were what he had said, but he c ould not rec all what he ac tually said to Insp. Herman. The inc ontrovertible evidenc e was that an interview did take plac e in whic h Insp. Herman questioned the ac c used. I have not been persuaded by the ac c used that Insp. Hermans ac c ount was wrong or inac c urate. The ac c used also denied that the four investigation statements (admitted as P32, P33, P34 and P35) made to Insp. Abdul Halim are true. He c laimed that virtually all the inc riminating parts were c onc oc ted by him in order to protec t his unc le in whose flat he stayed. 

9\. He said that whilst they were still in his unc les flat on the evening of the arrest, he heard some offic ers say that the flat would be c onfisc ated if the drugs were found in the flat. At one point he also said that the offic ers said that his unc le might also be c harged. At that junc ture, the DPP Mr. Han hesitated bec ause he was not sure whether the ac c used was raising the issue of the 


voluntariness of the statements. Mr. Masih c onc eded on behalf of the ac c used that voluntariness was not in issue, and the ac c used himself retrac ted his assertion that the CNB offic ers told him that his unc le might be c harged. I therefore did not require a trial-within-a-trial to determine the voluntariness of those statements. 

10\. In my opinion, the inc ontrovertible fac ts based on evidenc e of the prosec ution as well as the evidenc e-in-c hief of the ac c used, are that the ac c used was a heroin traffic ker having delivered heroin to Mohd Idris shortly before his (ac c useds) arrest on 11 Oc tober 2000. He also had heroin in his possession on his person as well as in his c upboard. 

11\. The only issue is whether the heroin in the blac k briefc ase belonged to him or was in his possession with knowledge that it c ontained heroin. In this regard, I do not ac c ept the evidenc e of the ac c used that he did not know what was in the blac k briefc ase. On his own evidenc e, the briefc ase was handed to him by his friend Emran together with a seemingly gratuitous largesse of $650 on the morning of the day he (the ac c used) was direc ted by Emran to deliver heroin to Mohd Idris. And even on his own ac c ount, the briefc ase c ontained illegal material. His girl-friend Siti and himself were also heroin c onsumers. In these c irc umstanc es, I do not believe the ac c used that he did not know what was in the briefc ase. 

12\. Some time was spent over the handwriting found on the two brown envelopes P49 and P50. The prosec utions expert evidenc e was simply that the ac c used c annot be ruled out as the author. I note that Siti c laimed authorship over some parts of the writing. I find Siti to be a truthful witness although I suspec t that she might have erroneously admitted one of the words "pc kt" in P49 to be hers when it seems to me otherwise, but in my view, the evidenc e of the handwriting is not c ruc ial. Although the ac c used said that the writing c onc erned the c alc ulations for his "dodol" business and the envelopes were handed to Emran in early Oc tober, that does not explain Sitis handwriting on them. No evidenc e was led as to whether Siti had already written on them when the ac c used gave one of the envelope (P49) to Emran. It also does not explain where P50 c ame about or how Emran obtained it sinc e it was also found in the briefc ase that Emran handed to the ac c used. 

13\. The ac c used though unemployed, appears to be an intelligent person c apable of reading English as he indeed read all his four investigation statements in c ourt without assistanc e from the c ourt interpreter. Emran was offered to the defenc e but was not c alled. The question is, was the defenc e obliged to c all Emran to c orroborate the ac c used, or, was the prosec ution obliged to c all Emran as a rebuttal witness? I ac c ept that there is no obligation on either party to c all Emran, but the failure of the defenc e to do so in the present c irc umstanc es reduc es the value of the c laims made by the ac c used, espec ially those that attributed the briefc ase and drugs to Emran. It is true that on the fac e of it, an assertion by the ac c used invariably invites rebuttal, but it is not an invitation that must be taken up. At this stage of the trial, the burden is on the ac c used to raise a reasonable doubt. If there is any adverse inferenc e to be drawn, on the fac ts and c irc umstanc es of this c ase, it would have to be drawn against the failure by the defenc e to c all Emran as a witness. It would be wrong to draw an adverse inferenc e against the prosec ution as Emrans testimony was never part of its c ase. It is obvious that the approac h most favourable to the ac c used is to draw no inferenc e whatsoever, but there is no sound or rational basis for that in this c ase. The obvious inferenc e that I must draw is that Emran was unlikely to c orroborate the ac c used; but is not diffic ult to apprec iate why - if he saves the ac c used he c ondemns himself. In these c irc umstanc es, I regard the drawing of the said inferenc e to be of muc h lower value than it otherwise might have, and henc e, I have merely taken the failure of the ac c used to c all Emran as another point to be weighed in the pot of evidenc e against him. 

14\. The ac c used made no attempt to explain why he had not adduc ed his c autioned statement in 


evidenc e to support the story upon whic h his defenc e was based. In taking this omission into ac c ount, I have c onsidered his evidenc e that he made up stories to Insp. Halim in order to prevent his unc les flat from being c onfisc ated by the authority. However, I do not find his testimony to be suffic iently c redible to entertain any reasonable doubt on its ac c ount. 

15\. On the evidenc e before me, I am not satisfied that the ac c used had rebutted the presumption against him. The evidenc e of his unc le that he (the unc le) never saw the briefc ase before does not assist the ac c used if, as he said, Emran only handed the briefc ase to him that morning. Given the c irc umstanc es and his relationship with Emran, I do not think that the ac c used was entitled to say that he did not know and had no reason to suspec t that the briefc ase c ontained drugs. On his own evidenc e, it c ontained illegal pornographic tapes whic h Emran wished to hide from the polic e. There was no question in this c ase as to whether the ac c used had sole and exc lusive possession of the room he oc c upied at bloc k 251, Tampines sinc e the ac c used admitted in c ourt that he was in possession of the briefc ase. The only issue being his knowledge of the heroin in that bag. 

16\. I therefore find that the prosec utions c ase had not been rebutted. The ac c used was ac c ordingly c onvic ted and sentenc ed to suffer death.
