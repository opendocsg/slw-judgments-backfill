**Introduction** 

1       The plaintiff in this c ase seeks to resist the enforc ement of an adjudic ation determination dated 1 Oc tober 2014 made pursuant to the Building and Construc tion Industry Sec urity of Payment Ac t (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the SOPA”). What is unusual, however, is that the plaintiff’s applic ation is not made pursuant to O 95 r 3 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) whic h requires the plaintiff to provide sec urity for the unpaid portion of the adjudic ated amount that he is required to pay in c onsequenc e of the adjudic ation determination at the time of the filing of the applic ation. 

2       Instead, the plaintiff, without providing sec urity, seeks a dec laration that the adjudic ation determination is null and void and, in the alternative, a dec laration that the adjudic ator lac ked jurisdic tion to adjudic ate the matter under the SOPA. He alleges, _inter alia_ , that the payment c laim issued by the defendant on 31 July 2014 whic h triggered the adjudic ation is not a valid payment c laim under the SOPA and that there was a breac h of natural justic e during the c ourse of the adjudic ation. 

3       Lastly, in the event that the c ourt refuses to grant the dec larations sought, the plaintiff requests for an order to stay the enforc ement of the adjudic ation determination. 

**Facts** 

**_Background_** 

4       The plaintiff and the defendant were engaged in an employer-c ontrac tor relationship under a building and c onstruc tion c ontrac t entered into on 10 Dec ember 2008 whic h inc orporated Singapore Institute of Arc hitec ts’ Artic les and Conditions of Building Contrac t (Lump Sum Contrac t) (7th Ed, April 

2005) (“the SIA Conditions 2005”). [note: 1] The agreed fee was $1,906,891.31 and 5 Dec ember 2009 

was the stipulated date for c ompletion. [note: 2] 

5       The defendant was unable to c omplete its works by the c ompletion date and the arc hitec t for 


the building projec t issued a delay c ertific ate on 10 Dec ember 2009. The arc hitec t thereafter only issued the c ompletion c ertific ate on 3 Marc h 2011, c ertifying that the defendant had c ompleted its 

works. [note: 3] Prior to this, the defendant had issued 15 progress payment c laims and c orresponding interim arc hitec t’s c ertific ates were issued pursuant to the mec hanism provided for under c l 31 of the SIA Conditions 2005. The fifteenth progress payment c laim and c orresponding interim c ertific ate were 

issued on 23 June 2010 and 6 July 2010 respec tively. [note: 4] The plaintiff paid the amounts c ertified in all of the 15 interim c ertific ates issued. 

**_Payment claims leading up to the adjudication_** 

6       On 22 February 2012, the arc hitec t reminded the defendant to submit its “final c laim” [note: 5] pursuant to c l 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2005 whic h provides as follows: 

 Final Claim Documents 

 31.(11) The Contrac tor shall before the end of the Maintenanc e Period submit a final c laim to the Arc hitec t with a c opy to the Quantity Surveyor. Suc h c laim shall c ontain details of all quantities, rates and pric es and any adjustment of the Contrac t Sum or additional payments or c ompensation c laimed by the Contrac tor under the terms of the Contrac t, together with any explanations and supporting vouc hers, doc uments or c alc ulations, inc luding doc uments relating to the ac c ounts of Designated or Nominated SubContrac tors or Suppliers, whic h may be nec essary to enable the Final Ac c ount to be prepared by the Quantity Surveyor. 

7       The defendant thereafter served on the arc hitec t a payment c laim whic h it referred to as 

“Progress Claim No.16A (FINAL ACCOUNT)” on 27 February 2012. [note: 6] I shall henc eforth refer to this payment c laim as “Payment Claim 16A”. Payment Claim 16A did not spec ify whic h period of time for works done by the defendant it related to. Instead, it purported to represent the “FINAL 

SUMMARY (FINAL ACCOUNT)” [note: 7] for works done by the defendant. The arc hitec t and quantity surveyor, assuming that Payment Claim 16A was intended to be the defendant’s final c laim under c l 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2005, did not take any ac tion bec ause the defendant failed to produc e the supporting doc uments needed for the preparation of the Final Ac c ount as required under that very c lause. 

8       After some intermittent c ommunic ations between the parties, and upon the request of the plaintiff for the defendant to issue its final c laim pursuant to c l 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2005, the defendant served another payment c laim on 6 January 2014. The respec tive letter attac hing the 

payment c laim states as follows: [note: 8] 

 RE: 4 TAI YUAN HEIGHTS – PROGRESS CLAIM NO. 16B (FINAL ACCOUNT) 

 We refer to the above and are pleased to submit herewith our Progress Claim No.16B (FINAL ACCOUNT) for your perusal and c onsideration. 

I shall henc eforth refer to this payment c laim as “Payment Claim 16B”. Payment Claim 16B similarly did not spec ify whic h period of time for works done it related to. Instead, like Payment Claim 16A, it purported to represent the “FINAL SUMMARY (FINAL ACCOUNT)” for works done by the defendant. [note: 9] Vouc hers, invoic es and other supporting doc uments were also appended to Payment Claim 

16B. 


9       The quantity surveyor then sought to c larify with the defendant the nature of Payment Claim 16B. In an email from the quantity surveyor, Mr Oliver Ho (“Mr Ho”) to an employee of the defendant, 

Ms Angie Ang (“Ms Ang”), dated 27 January 2014, Mr Ho asked: [note: 10] 

 Hi Angie, 

 Please c onfirm whether your Claim No 16B is ac tually your Final Account Document submission pursuant to [cl] 31(11)(a) of the SIA Conditons [ sic ] of Contrac t. 

 [emphasis added] 

Ms Ang then replied on the same day: [note: 11] 

 Dear Oliver 

 We would like to c onfirm that our Claim No.16B dated 6 January 2014 is our Final Account. 

 [emphasis added] 

10     It bears noting that the SIA Conditions 2005 does not c ontain a c l 31(11)(a). Clause 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2005 does not c ontain any sub-c lauses (see above at [6]). Rather, c l 31(11)(a) is only found in later editions of the standard form c ontrac t, suc h as the most rec ent Singapore Institute of Arc hitec ts’ Artic les and Conditions of Building Contrac t (Lump Sum Contrac t) (9th Ed, Reprint August 2011) (“the SIA Conditions 2011”). Clause 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2011 in fac t provides for a final c laim proc edure different from that found in c l 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2005: 

 Final Account Documents 

 31.(11)(a) The Contrac tor shall before the end of the Maintenanc e Period submit his Final Ac c ount Doc uments to the Arc hitec t with a c opy to the Quantity Surveyor showing the final value of all Works c arried out inc luding variations and suc h other amounts whic h he c onsiders he is entitled to under the Contrac t together with supporting doc uments, vouc hers and other doc uments inc luding doc uments relating to the ac c ounts of the Designated or Nominated SubContrac tors or Suppliers to enable the Quantity Surveyor and the Arc hitec t to prepare the Statement of Final Ac c ount under paragraph (b) hereof. 

 31.(11)(b) The Arc hitec t shall within 3 months from: 

 (i) the date of rec eipt of the Final Ac c ount Doc uments from the Contrac tor under paragraph (a) hereof; or 

 (ii) the date of the issue of the Maintenanc e Certific ate; 

 (whic hever is the later) provide to the Contrac tor the Statement of Final Ac c ount whic h shall show the Arc hitec t’s final measurement and valuation of all Works c arried out together with any permitted deduc tions (inc luding liquidated damages) under the terms of the Contrac t whether or not suc h deduc tions have been made by the Employer unless in respec t of permitted deduc tions not yet made by the Employer, the Employer has informed the Arc hitec t of his dec ision to forgo or postpone the same. 

 31.(11)(c ) The Contrac tor shall serve his final payment c laim to the Employer (with a c opy to 


 the Arc hitec t and the Quantity Surveyor) within 14 days after the oc c urrenc e of either of the following events whic hever is the later: 

 (i) the issue of the Maintenanc e Certific ate; or 

 (ii) the rec eipt by the Contrac tor of the Statement of the Final Ac c ount under paragraph (b) hereof. 

 ... 

11     It thus appears to be the c ase that both the quantity surveyor and the defendant had, at least as of 27 January 2014, proc eeded on the inc orrec t basis that it was the SIA Conditions 2011 (or any other editions of the standard form c ontrac t subsequent to the SIA Conditions 2005) that governed the final c laim proc edure instead of the SIA Conditions 2005 that was inc orporated into the building c ontrac t between the parties. This is a signific ant point whic h I will return to later on in this judgment. 

12     Upon c onfirmation by the defendant that Payment Claim 16B was intended to be a “Final Ac c ount”, the parties, inc luding the quantity surveyor, began to prepare the Final Ac c ount. However, the doc umentation provided together with Payment Claim 16B was deemed defic ient by quantity surveyor and more doc uments were requested. The doc umentation required for the preparation of the Final Ac c ount pursuant to c l 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2005 was only fully c onsolidated on 26 June 

2014\. The arc hitec t then issued the maintenanc e c ertific ate on 30 June 2014 and began to prepare the final c ertific ate pursuant to c l 31(12)(a) of the SIA Conditions 2005 whic h provides as follows: 

 Final Certificate 

 31.(12)(a) Within 3 months of rec eipt from the Contrac tor of the doc umentation referred to in the prec eding sub-c lause of this Condition or of the issue of the Maintenanc e Certific ate (whic hever is the later) the Arc hitec t shall issue a Final Certific ate. Suc h Certific ate shall be supported by doc uments showing the Arc hitec t’s final measurement and valuation of the Works in ac c ordanc e with all the terms of the Contrac t, and after setting out and allowing for all payments or other expenditure of the Employer or any permitted deduc tions by him shall state any final balanc e due from the Employer to the Contrac tor or from the Contrac tor to the Employer, as the c ase may be, whic h shall thereupon bec ome a debt due. Suc h c ertific ate shall also take ac c ount expressly of any outstanding permitted deduc tions not yet made by the Employer under the terms of the Contrac t whether by way of liquidated damages or otherwise (unless the Employer shall inform the Arc hitec t of his dec ision to forego or postpone his right to the same). 

As the issuanc e of the maintenanc e c ertific ate was the later event, the final c ertific ate was due by 30 September 2014. 

13     On 31 July 2014, the defendant issued what it referred to as “Progress Claim No.17”. [note: 12] I shall henc eforth refer to this payment c laim as “Payment Claim 17”. Unlike Payment Claim 16A and Payment Claim 16B, Payment Claim 17 did not purport to be a “FINAL ACCOUNT” or to provide a “Final Summary” of the Final Ac c ount. Instead, Payment Claim 17 referred spec ific ally to the period of time for works done between 23 July 2010 (the date of the fifteenth progress payment c laim mentioned 

above at [5]) and 31 July 2014. [note: 13] 

14     The plaintiff did not issue a payment response to Payment Claim 17. He was of the opinion that Payment Claim 16B was the defendant’s final c laim under c l 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2005 and 


that the defendant c ould not, and should not, issue any payment c laim subsequent to its final c laim. The arc hitec t did not issue any c orresponding c ertific ate as well. The defendant then, on 3 September 2014, gave notic e to the defendant and the arc hitec t of its intention to apply for adjudic ation. The arc hitec t, unc ertain as to why the plaintiff issued Payment Claim 17, sent the 

following letter to the defendant on 4 September 2014: [note: 14] 

 We refer to your letter dated 3rd September 2014. 

 You will rec all that you submitted your final c laim pursuant to c lause 31(11) of the c ontrac t on 6th January 2014. 

 On the basis that this is your final c laim, we understand that you have been liaising with the quantity surveyor Mr. Oliver Ho in relation to the submission of all nec essary doc uments to enable the Final Ac c ount to be prepared. 

 We further understand from Mr. Oliver Ho that submission for all nec essary doc uments was finally c ompleted on 26th June 2014. On this basis we are in the proc ess of issuing the Final Certific ate pursuant to c lause 31(12)(a) of the c ontrac t. 

 There is therefore no basis for any further progress c laims to be submitted and we will proc eed on the basis their [ sic ] Progress Claim No. 16B dated 6th January 2014 is your final c laim. 

 Alternatively, if you are in fac t treating Progress Claim No. 17 as your final c laim pursuant to c lause 31(11) and wish for us to disregard Progress Claim No. 16B, please let us know within 7 days of this letter, failing whic h we will proc eed to issue the Final Certific ate on the basis of your final c laim as set out in Progress Claim No. 16B dated 6th January 2014 and in that event, Progress Claim No. 17 will be disregarded. 

As c an be seen from this letter, the arc hitec t had treated Payment Claim 16B as a final c laim under c l 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2005 and was of the opinion that no further payment c laims should be issued after the final c laim. The defendant never replied to this letter from the arc hitec t. The arc hitec t c onsequently disregarded Payment Claim 17 and c ontinued to prepare the final c ertific ate. 

**_The adjudication_** 

15     The defendant lodged an adjudic ation applic ation with the Singapore Mediation Centre on 4 

September 2014 and the plaintiff was notified of this on 5 September 2014. [note: 15] The plaintiff then filed its adjudic ation response on 12 September 2014. In its adjudic ation response, the plaintiff submitted that the defendant had no basis to issue Payment Claim 17 after it had issued what the 

plaintiff regarded as the defendant’s final c laim in the form of Payment Claim 16B. [note: 16] 

16     An adjudic ator was nominated and an adjudic ation c onferenc e was held on 19 September 2014. At this c onferenc e, c ounsel for the plaintiff repeated the arguments in his adjudic ation response. He also asked for an adjournment of the matter in the light of the fac t that the final c ertific ate was soon to be issued on 26 September 2014. The defendants, however, refused to ac quiesc e to suc h an adjournment. The adjudic ator thereafter, with the agreement of both parties, direc ted that the plaintiff was to file his written submissions by 24 September 2014 and that the defendant was to tender any reply by 26 September 2014. The adjudic ation determination was to be rendered by 1 

Oc tober 2014. [note: 17] 


17     The Final Ac c ount and final c ertific ate were issued on 25 September 2014. [note: 18] The plaintiff informed the adjudic ator of this the next day, on 26 September 2014. He subsequently sent the adjudic ator an email dated 27 September 2014 requesting the adjudic ator to c onsider the fac t that the Final Ac c ount and final c ertific ate had been issued for the purposes of rendering his dec ision. [note: 19] 

18     As agreed, the adjudic ator issued his adjudic ation determination on 1 Oc tober 2014. He dec ided that there was nothing in the SIA Conditions 2005 and the SOPA that prohibited the filing of a payment c laim after a final c laim has been issued. Further, as the plaintiff had failed to file any payment response, the adjudic ator noted that, ac c ording to s 15(3)( _a_ ) of the SOPA, he was not permitted to c onsider any reasons raised by the plaintiff for withholding the payment of any amount c laimed under Payment Claim 17. The adjudic ator thus found in favour of the defendant and granted the defendant its full c laim under Payment Claim 17 amounting to $625,167.98. The adjudic ator did not make any referenc e to the Final Ac c ount or final c ertific ate issued on 25 September 2014 in his adjudic ation determination. 

**The present proceedings** 

19     The plaintiff, unhappy with the adjudic ation determination rendered, brought the present proc eedings to c hallenge the adjudic ation determination rendered by the adjudic ator. He onc e again argues that the defendant was not allowed to issue Payment Claim 17 after it had issued Payment Claim 16B, whic h the plaintiff regards as the defendant’s final c laim under c l 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2005. He also argues that there was a breac h of natural justic e arising from the adjudic ator’s failure to c onsider the Final Ac c ount and final c ertific ate issued on 25 September 2014. 

20     However, as I have mentioned above (at [1]), the applic ation made by the plaintiff is not one under O 95 r 3 of the Rules of Court for the adjudic ation determination to be set aside—an applic ation whic h would require the plaintiff to provide sec urity for the $625,167.98 that he is required to pay in c onsequenc e of the adjudic ation determination. Rather, the plaintiff, without providing suc h sec urity, only seeks a dec laration that the adjudic ation determination is null and void or that the adjudic ator lac ked jurisdic tion to deal with the matter. In the alternative, the plaintiff seeks a stay of exec ution of the enforc ement of the adjudic ation determination. 

21     The defendant thus objec ts to the applic ation on a preliminary basis. The defendant takes the view that the plaintiff is not entitled to make the applic ation before me. It argues that the plaintiff should not be allowed to evade the requirement to provide sec urity under s 27(5) of the SOPA and O 95 r 3(3) of the Rules of Court when he is in essenc e attempting to set aside the adjudic ation determination. If the defendant suc c eeds on this issue, then the entire applic ation of the plaintiff must be dismissed regardless of the merits underlying his applic ation. I shall therefore proc eed to deal with this preliminary objec tion first. 

**The propriety of the plaintiff’s application** 

22     The SOPA provides a legislative framework for c ontrac tors to rec eive prompt payments for works done pursuant to a building and c onstruc tion. This func tion of the SOPA has been c omprehensively desc ribed by the Court of Appeal in _W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Osko Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2013] 3 SLR 380</span> (“ _W Y Steel_ ”) (at [18]): 

 ... It has often been said that c ash flow is the life blood of those in the building and c onstruc tion industry. If c ontrac tors and sub-c ontrac tors are not paid timeously for work done or materials 


 supplied, the progress of c onstruc tion work will almost inevitably be disrupted. Moreover, there is a not insignific ant risk of financ ial distress and insolvenc y arising as a result. In the years before the immediate predec essor of the Ac t ( viz , the Building and Construc tion Industry Sec urity of Payment Ac t 2004 (Ac t 57 of 2004) ("Ac t 57/2004")) was enac ted in 2005, there had been several suc h c ases. It was with the spec ific aim of minimising suc h disruptions that Ac t 57/ (now superseded by the Ac t) was passed. The Ac t ac hieves its stated purpose of fac ilitating c ash flow in the building and c onstruc tion industry in two princ ipal ways. First, it establishes that parties who have done work or supplied goods are entitled to payment as of right: see s 5 of the Ac t. Sec ond, it c reates an intervening, provisional proc ess of adjudic ation whic h, although provisional in nature, is final and binding on the parties to the adjudic ation until their differenc es are ultimately and c onc lusively determined or resolved: see s 21 of the Ac t. This is what is referred to as temporary finality. 

23     It is thus said that adjudic ation determinations are granted temporary finality in furtheranc e of the legislative purpose behind the enac tment of the SOPA. They may be enforc ed in the same manner as a judgment or an order of c ourt pursuant to s 27(1) of the SOPA; but they are only interim in nature and any underlying payment dispute resolved by the adjudic ation determination may be reopened at a later time and ventilated in what the Court of Appeal in _Chin Ivan v H P Construction & Engineering Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2015] SGCA 14</span> (“ _Chin Ivan_ ”) desc ribed (at [22]) as “’substantive’ proc eedings”, that is, proc eedings brought to obtain a final and binding determination of the full pric e payable for the work done. 

24     Despite the temporary finality granted to an adjudic ation determination, a party that is dissatisfied with an adjudic ation determination may still c hallenge that partic ular adjudic ation determination under the SOPA in two ways. These two avenues available to a dissatisfied party have also been elaborated on by the Court of Appeal in _W Y Steel_ (at [59]): 

 We have said above that the purpose of the Ac t is to ensure ( inter alia ) that even though adjudic ation determinations are interim in nature, successful claimants are paid. To this end, under s 22(1), the respondent must pay the adjudic ated amount either within seven days after being served with the adjudic ation determination (see s 22(1)( a )), or by the deadline stipulated by the adjudic ator (see s 22(1)( b )). The c laimant c an suspend work (see s 26(1)( d )) or take a lien on goods supplied (see s 25(2)( d )) if the respondent fails to pay. If the respondent intends to apply for a review of the adjudication determination, he must first pay the adjudicated amount to the claimant : see s [1]8(3) [ sic ]. If the respondent wants to set aside the adjudication determination, he must pay into court as security the unpaid portion of the adjudicated amount : see s 27(5). This requirement is repeated in O 95 r 3(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed). These provisions all point to one thing: where a claimant succeeds in his adjudication application, he is entitled to receive the adjudicated amount quickly and cannot be denied payment without very good reason. 

 [emphasis added] 

25     As c an be seen from the passage above, although a dissatisfied party may either apply for a review of an adjudic ation determination pursuant to s 18(2) of the SOPA or apply to c ourt to set aside the adjudic ation determination, he must, in either instanc e, fork out the unpaid adjudic ated amount; as payment to the c laimant in the c ase of a review of the adjudic ation determination pursuant to s 18(3) of the SOPA or as payment into c ourt as sec urity for the unpaid portion of the adjudic ated amount pursuant to s 27(5) of the SOPA and O 95 r 3(3) of the Rules of Court. Further, these provisions are in plac e to reinforc e the entitlement of a suc c essful c laimant in an adjudic ation to quic k payment of the adjudic ated amount. 


26     With regard to the requirement for the provision of sec urity in a setting aside applic ation, I would only add that this requirement also protec ts the suc c essful c laimant’s right to be paid by guarding that c laimant against the risk of the respondent bec oming insolvent and the risk of the respondent dissipating assets to avoid payment. It also ensures that the c laimant would be paid immediately upon the c onc lusion of the setting aside applic ation (whic h may sometimes take a substantial amount of time to c onc lude) in the event that the applic ation is dismissed. The c laimant should not be put through the entire proc ess of having to enforc e the adjudic ation determination against the respondent when that proc ess was delayed as a result of the setting aside applic ation itself. All in all, s 27(5) of the SOPA and O 95 r 3(3) of the Rules of Court provides suc c essful c laimants with a very important safeguard against non-payment of adjudic ated amounts whic h, in the grand sc heme of things, is aligned with the SOPA’s overarc hing aim of ensuring timeous payments to c ontrac tors. 

27     I am thus of the view that the requirement for the provision of sec urity under s 27(5) of the SOPA and O 95 r 3(3) of the Rules of Court is a stric t requirement that must be observed if one seeks to c hallenge an adjudic ation determination in c ourt. The SOPA seeks to provide c ontrac tors and subc ontrac tors with valuable rights in the light of the vulnerability of the liquidity-dependent industry whic h they operate in. It does so by laying down stric t statutory requirements that apply to eac h junc ture of the c laim proc ess, suc h as in the form of rigid timelines for the purposes of avoiding delay. It thus follows that the availability of these rights must be sec ured via stric t observanc e of these statutory requirements. This is espec ially so when the requirements are c learly enac ted to further the primary objec tive of the SOPA to preserve the rights of all parties in the c onstruc tion industry to timeous payment for work done and goods supplied. 

28     As was observed by the Court of Appeal in _Lee Wee Lick Terence (alias Li Weili Terence) v Chua Say Eng (formerly trading as Weng Fatt Construction Engineering) and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2013] 1 SLR 401</span>, the c ourt in a setting aside ac tion is c onc erned with jurisdic tional c hallenges against the adjudic ator, whic h if suc c essful, would render the adjudic ation determination “null and void” (at [66]). 

The plaintiff here, who seeks a dec laration that the adjudic ation determination is “null and void” [note: 20] and a dec laration that the adjudic ator “has no jurisdic tion to adjudic ate the matter”, [note: 21] is 

thus attempting to ac hieve the exac t effec t of a usual setting aside applic ation—save for the fac t that he does not take the further step of requesting for an ac tual setting aside order. If follows that the plaintiff is, in fac t, attempting to disguise (rather poorly, if I may add) his applic ation as something other than a setting aside applic ation so that he may evade the statutory requirement to provide sec urity for the unpaid portion of the adjudic ated amount. This is impermissible and to find otherwise would result in the c omplete erosion of the protec tion c onferred on suc c essful c laimants in an adjudic ation determination under s 27(5) of the SOPA and O 95 r 3(3) of the Rules of Court. 

29     Challenges against an adjudic ation determination, either on jurisdic tional grounds or for failure to c omply with the requirements of the SOPA (suc h as the requirement for the adjudic ator to “c omply with the princ iples of natural justic e” pursuant to s 16(3)( _c_ ) of the SOPA”), if suc c essful, result in that adjudic ation determination being rendered null, void or invalid. Suc h suc c essful c hallenges c onsequently lead to the inevitable c onc lusion that the adjudic ation determination in question should be set aside suc h that the payment obligations flowing from that adjudic ation determination are extinguished. Thus, regardless of the form of the applic ations from whic h c hallenges against adjudic ation determinations are brought, c hallenges against adjudic ation determinations must be regarded as being effec tively setting aside applic ations governed by s 27(5) of the SOPA. 

30     In this regard, I am satisfied that the statutory regime c ontemplates only the presc ribed avenues available to a dissatisfied party. To take a looser approac h would, to my mind, undermine the 


objec tive and intent of the statutory framework under the SOPA to safeguard the c ontrac tor’s expec tation of c ash flow when c ertain c onditions are met. 

31     The plaintiff’s applic ation, whic h is premised upon c ertain c hallenges against the adjudic ation determination, is in essenc e a setting aside applic ation and the plaintiff must ac c ordingly provide the sec urity required under s 27(5) of the SOPA and O 95 r 3(3) of the Rules of Court. As the plaintiff has failed to do so, its applic ation is improper, or even an abuse of proc ess if I may add, and I therefore order that it be dismissed in its entirety for the reasons I have given save for the plaintiff’s prayer for a stay of enforc ement of the adjudic ation determination whic h I shall now turn to. 

**Stay of enforcement of the adjudication determination** 

32     It is rather straightforward that the plaintiff’s prayer for a stay of enforc ement of the adjudic ation determination c annot be allowed and I make two points in this regard. First, a stay of enforc ement of an adjudic ation determination must be premised upon enforc ement proc eedings being brought in the first plac e. This would mean that any stay applic ation should properly be made by way of summons in the enforc ement proc eedings itself and not by way of originating summons, whic h the plaintiff has opted to do so here. 

33     Sec ondly, in any event, the grounds for granting a stay of enforc ement of an adjudic ation determination are very limited. These grounds were elaborated on by the Court of Appeal in _W Y Steel_ (at [70]): 

 70 In our judgment, a stay of enforc ement of an adjudic ation determination may ordinarily be justified where there is c lear and objec tive evidenc e of the suc c essful c laimant's ac tual present insolvenc y, or where the c ourt is satisfied on a balanc e of probabilities that if the stay were not granted, the money paid to the c laimant would not ultimately be rec overed if the dispute between the parties were finally resolved in the respondent's favour by a c ourt or tribunal or some other dispute resolution body. Further, we agree with HHJ Coulson QC in Derek Vago that a c ourt may properly c onsider whether the c laimant's financ ial distress was, to a signific ant degree, c aused by the respondent's failure to pay the adjudic ated amount and, also, whether the c laimant was already in a similar state of financ ial strength or weakness (as the c ase may be) at the time the parties entered into their c ontrac t. 

 71 In the c ourse of the arguments before us, it was suggested that the above approac h would tilt the balanc e unduly in favour of the suc c essful c laimant and plac e the unsuc c essful respondent unfairly at risk. It was also suggested that this would leave a suc c essful c laimant in an adjudic ation under the Ac t in a better position than a party who had suc c eeded at a trial but where an appeal was pending. Whether that is true or not, the c omparison is not one that is apt. An adjudic ation determination is provisional in the sense that it may ultimately be reversed if it is c hallenged in a c ourt or tribunal or some other dispute resolution body. However, as far as the rights of the parties to the adjudic ation are c onc erned, to the extent that the adjudic ation determination remains intac t pending any suc h c hallenge, it has the effec t of absolutely and c onc lusively determining the parties' rights until and unless it is eventually reversed in ac c ordanc e with the provisions of the Ac t see [13] and [18] above. Henc e, while we are prepared to rec ognise the possibility of granting a stay of enforc ement of an adjudic ation determination bec ause of the possibility of a different outc ome emerging eventually, a stay will not readily be granted having regard to the overall purpose of the Ac t, whic h is prec isely to avoid and guard against pushing building and c onstruc tion c ompanies over the financ ial prec ipic e. 

34     The plaintiff here has not produc ed any objec tive evidenc e of any risk of insolvenc y that the 


defendant may fac e. He has also not shown in any way that there exists the possibility that any money paid to the defendant would subsequently be irrec overable if the dispute between the parties are finally resolved in the plaintiff’s favour. Lastly, there is also nothing to suggest that a different outc ome would emerge at the c onc lusion of future “substantive” proc eedings that will fully and finally resolve the parties’ dispute. The plaintiff has thus not met the “high threshold ... required to justify granting a stay of enforc ement” in the present applic ation and its applic ation in this regard must also be dismissed. 

35     In the light of my findings above, the plaintiff’s applic ation must be dismissed in its entirety. The matter may thus be disposed of without any c onsideration of the ac tual c hallenges raised by the plaintiff against the adjudic ation determination. Nonetheless, I would like to make some observations c onc erning the plaintiff’s c ontention that Payment Claim 17 is an invalid payment c laim under the SOPA in the light of the fac t that it was issued after the defendant had issued its “final c laim” under c l 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2005. 

**Further observations on Payment Claim 17** 

**_The SIA Conditions 2005 and the SIA Conditions 2011_** 

36     The SIA Conditions 2005 are prec eded by a set of standard forms of c ontrac t issued by the Singapore Institutes of Arc hitec ts whic h existed long before the introduc tion of the SOPA and its predec essor, the Building and Construc tion Industry Sec urity of Payment Ac t 2004 (Ac t 57 of 2004). Like the SOPA, the SIA Conditions 2005 inc lude a mec hanism for the payment of monies due to c ontrac tors. This mec hanism was rec ently disc ussed in _Chin Ivan_ at [13]–[14]: 

 13 The roots of the SIA Conditions c an be trac ed to a set of standard forms of c ontrac t and subc ontrac t drafted by the late Mr Ian Dunc an Wallac e QC. These standard forms were first introduc ed in 1980 and made signific ant c hanges to the regime reflec ted in the then existing standard B&C c ontrac ts. The standard forms were intended to address a number of issues that had bedevilled the loc al B&C industry; in partic ular, the fac t that c ontrac tors sometimes found themselves at the merc y of employers who might withhold payment of c ertified sums on ac c ount of alleged c ounterc laims and set-offs. An important feature of the SIA Conditions is the regulation, by way of Arc hitec t’s c ertific ates, of the payment of monies due to c ontrac tors and of the deduc tions that c an be made by employers. The Arc hitec t’s c ertific ate serves as the basis for both the c ontrac tor’s c laim for payment of monies due and also the employer’s right to make deduc tions against suc h c laims. Under a B&C c ontrac t whic h inc orporates the SIA Conditions (also referred to hereafter as a “standard form SIA c ontrac t” where appropriate to the c ontext), the Arc hitec t, in essenc e, is the quasi-adjudic ator of both the c ontrac tor’s right to rec eive payment for work done as well as the employer’s right to withhold payment on ac c ount of any c ross-c laim(s). This fundamental role of the Arc hitec t and his c ertific ates is c learly desc ribed in the Singapore Institute of Arc hitec ts’ Guidance Notes on Articles and Conditions of Building Contract (Singapore Institute of Arc hitec ts, 3rd Ed, 2011) (“the Guidance Notes ”) as follows (at p 1): 

**2. Architect’s powers** 

 The sc heme of the c ontrac t is to ensure that virtually all areas of possible financial controversy , exc ept most c ases of breac h of c ontrac t by the Employer and all terminations of the Contrac t by either party, are to be regulated by the certificates of the Architect. ... In all c ases ... the contractual effect of these certificates is to bind both employer and contractor, but only until final judgment or final award in any dispute between them – both 


 parties will therefore be able to use the summary proc edures in the Courts (or interim awards by arbitrators) in order to enforc e the c ertific ates – see Clauses 31.(13) and 37.(3)(h) ... 

 [emphasis added] 

 14 This exc erpt from the Guidance Notes introduc es the c onc ept of “temporary finality” that is to be ac c orded to valid Arc hitec t’s c ertific ates so that they will bind the parties unless and until they are opened up and reviewed in the c ourse of proc eedings typic ally brought at the end of the projec t when a final judgment or award as to the parties’ substantive rights is rendered. The same broad sc heme is mirrored in the role of Dispute Review Boards that assist in resolving disputes in large-sc ale engineering projec ts governed by the standard terms of the International Federation of Consulting Engineers, more c ommonly known as FIDIC. The B&C adjudication framework encapsulated within the SOPA is also reflective of this scheme. 

 [emphasis added] 

Thus, under the SIA Conditions 2005, the arc hitec t, rather than an adjudic ator, determines the amounts due from the employer to the c ontrac tor for works done. The arc hitec t’s c ertific ate, rather than an adjudic ation determination, is then enforc eable pursuant to c l 31(13) of the SIA Conditions 2005 by way of summary judgment or interim award. This general sc heme remains in plac e under the SIA Conditions 2011 as well. 

37     With the introduc tion of the SOPA, the standard forms of c ontrac t were updated to harmonise the arc hitec t c ertific ation sc heme with the sc heme under the SOPA. For example, an arc hitec t’s interim c ertific ate must be issued 14 days after the c ontrac tor issues its progress payment c laim (c l 31(3) of the SIA Conditions 2005). On the other hand, under the SOPA, the employer only has to issue its payment response 21 days after the c ontrac tor issues its payment c laim (c l 31(15) of the SIA Conditions 2005 read with s 11(1)( _a_ ) of the SOPA). This sc heme would mean that an arc hitec t’s interim c ertific ate should always, or at least most of the time, be available for the purposes of the issuanc e of a payment response pursuant to the SOPA or for the purposes of any adjudic ation brought under the SOPA. This intention for the arc hitec t’s c ertific ate and adjudic ation proc ess to c omplement eac h other is stated in the Singapore Institute of Arc hitec ts’ _Guidance Notes on Articles and Conditions of Building Contract_ (Singapore Institute of Arc hitec ts, 3rd Ed, 2011) (“the _Guidance Notes_ ”) at p 20: 

 The Contrac t Conditions do not prec lude the Contrac tor from c laiming for payment for works c arried out as c ertified in the interim c ertific ate or final c ertific ate should he c hoose to do so. As a matter of prac tic ality, with the availability of fast trac k adjudic ation under the SOP Ac t, it is expec ted that most Contrac tors will take advantage of the adjudic ation proc eedings to pursue payment of their interim payment c laims. 

38     There was, however, some c onfusion regarding how the final c laim proc ess under c ll 31(11) and 31(12)(a) of the SIA Conditions 2005 interac ted with the SOPA. In partic ular, there was unc ertainty as to whether a final c laim under the SIA Conditions 2005 qualified as a payment c laim under the SOPA. This c onfusion was put to rest by the dec ision of Lai Siu Chiu J in _Tiong Seng Contractors (Pte) Ltd v Chuan Lim Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2007] 4 SLR(R) 364</span>. In that dec ision, Lai J found (at [52]) that a “final c laim” also c onstituted a payment c laim under the SOPA whic h c ould be adjudic ated upon. 

39     Lai J’s dec ision resulted in a degree of inc ompatibility between the SIA Conditions 2005 and the SOPA in relation to the final c laim proc ess. Under c l 31(12)(a) of the SIA Conditions 2005, the arc hitec t is only required to issue the final c ertific ate three months after the final c laim is submitted 


by the c ontrac tor with the required supporting doc umentation or three months after the arc hitec t has issued the maintenanc e c ertific ate (whic hever is later). This would mean that any payment response, whic h is due 21 days after the issuanc e of the final c laim, would have to be issued without the benefit of any arc hitec t’s c ertific ate. Further, there is also the possibility that adjudic ation between the parties may take plac e without the benefit of an arc hitec t’s final c ertific ate whic h would only be issued by the arc hitec t at a muc h later date. There c ould, as a result, be two enforc eable instruments that deal with the same subjec t matter and that may be inc onsistent with eac h other. 

40     Further c hanges were thus made to the standard forms of c ontrac t and this c ulminated in c l 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2011 whic h I have laid out above (at [10]). Other than c hanging the wording “final c laim” to “final payment c laim” under c l 31(11)(c ) of the SIA Conditions 2011, the terms were also amended suc h that the Final Ac c ount proc ess is to take plac e before the issuanc e of the final payment c laim. The arc hitec t’s final c ertific ate is then due within 14 days of rec eipt of the final payment c laim pursuant to c l 31(12)(a) of the SIA Conditions 2011. This sc heme thus harmonised the final payment c laim and c ertific ation proc ess with the SOPA in the same manner as that for progress payment c laims desc ribed above (at [37]). The employer would thus have the benefit of the final c ertific ate for the purposes of issuing a payment response to the final payment c laim. The adjudic ator would also have the benefit of the final c ertific ate for the purposes of rendering an adjudic ation determination. 

**_The dispute over Payment Claim 17_** 

41     The dispute between the parties thus arises as a result of the defendant and the quantity surveyor proc eeding on the mistaken premise that the c ontrac t with the plaintiff inc orporated the SIA Conditions 2011 (see above at [9]–[11]). This probably is a result of the fac t that the defendant and quantity surveyor are both involved in many suc h building c ontrac ts and this c aused them to lose trac k of the exac t edition of the standard terms that was inc orporated into the ac tual c ontrac t. Seen in this light, it c an thus be understood that Payment Claim 16B was indeed intended by the defendant to be a progress payment c laim that was submitted together with the Final Ac c ount doc uments required under c l 31(11)(a) of the SIA Conditions 2011 for the purposes of initiating the final payment proc ess under the SIA Conditions 2011. To the defendant’s mind, Payment Claim 16B c annot be a final payment c laim sinc e the latter may only be issued after the Final Ac c ount is prepared. 

42     As this point c ame to light after the hearing, I requested further submissions from the parties on the impac t, if any, of this c onfusion as to the applic able terms. The plaintiff’s main c ontention is that the parties c ontrac ted only on the basis of the SIA Conditions 2005. The defendant argues however that in the present c ontext there was no meeting of minds, as the parties were at c rosspurposes. The defendant thus submits that Payment Claim 16B is not intended to be a final c laim and that Payment Claim 17 was ac c ordingly not inc orrec tly submitted. 

43     I am unable to ac c ept the defendant’s further arguments. Whether a partic ular payment c laim is a final c laim or a progress payment c laim must primarily be determined ac c ording to the terms of the c ontrac t between the parties whic h defines suc h c laims and not by a party’s mere subjec tive intention. To hold otherwise would blur and render unc ertain the rules of engagement whic h the parties to a c onstruc tion c ontrac t expressly agree to. 

44     In my judgment, I am of the view that the objec tive evidenc e leads to the inevitable c onc lusion that Payment Claim 16B falls squarely within the definition of a final c laim under c l 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2005. This is reasonable in the c irc umstanc es sinc e the supporting doc uments required to be provided with the final c laim under c l 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2005 were submitted together with Payment Claim 16B. Further, as c ontrasted with Payment Claim 17, no spec ified time period was 


referred to in Payment Claim 16B. Instead, Payment Claim 16B purported to provide a “Final Summary” of the Final Ac c ount, and this would most definitely lead the plaintiff to believe that Payment Claim 16B was intended by the defendant to be a “final c laim” whic h prec edes the preparation of the Final Ac c ount under the SIA Conditions 2005. Even if the defendant did not intend for Payment Claim 16B to be a final c laim, the fac t that it had submitted Payment Claim 16B for the purposes of the preparation of the Final Ac c ount, a fac t whic h the defendant itself ac c epts in its further arguments— is inc ontrovertible evidenc e of the true nature of Payment Claim 16B, that of a final c laim filed prior to and for the purposes of preparing the Final Ac c ount as defined under c l 31(11) of the SIA Conditions. 

45     Lastly, I also note that the defendant never objec ted to the arc hitec t’s indic ation that he would proc eed to prepare the final c ertific ate. If the defendant had believed the SIA Conditions 2011 to be applic able, it would have been expec ted that the defendant would objec t to the preparation of a final c ertific ate, something that should only take plac e after the Final Ac c ount is prepared and after the defendant had issued what it believed to be its final payment c laim. The defendant also did not reply to the arc hitec t’s letter dated 4 September 2014 seeking c larific ation on the matter (see above at [14]). Even if the defendant did not intend for Payment Claim 16B to be a final c laim when it first issued Payment Claim 16B, its subsequent c onduc t suggests that this intention did not persist. 

46     In the c irc umstanc es, although I do sympathise with the fac t that the defendant had merely made an honest mistake when it issued Payment Claim 16B, the objec tive evidenc e suggests that Payment Claim 16B is indeed a final c laim as defined under c l 31(11) of the inc orporated SIA Conditions 2005. This brings me to the next issue, that is, whether payment c laims may, under the SOPA, be issued after a final c laim is issued pursuant to c l 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2005. 

**_Final claims and subsequent payment claims_** 

47     It was probably the defendant’s view when it issued Payment Claim 16B that, as long as it had yet to issue a final payment c laim, it may still issue progress payment c laims even during the preparation of the Final Ac c ount. That a c ontrac tor may do so before issuing its final payment c laim under c l 31(11)(c ) of the SIA Conditions 2011 has been rec ognised in the _Guidance Notes_ at pp 20– 21: 

 It is important to note that the Contrac t Conditions do not in any way prevent the Contrac tor from serving a payment c laim for works c arried out (inc luding variations ordered) as an interim payment c laim at any time before he submits his final payment c laim under Clause 31.11(c ) and to refer suc h payment c laim for adjudic ation under the SOP Ac t to sec ure payment. 

 As suc h, the final payment proc edure under Clause 31.11, does not affec t the Contrac tor’s right to seek immediate payment under the SOP Ac t for all works c arried out inc luding variations by the submission of an interim payment c laim to the Employer. The Contrac tor need not wait until the time for the submission of his final payment c laim in order to c laim payment for variations ordered either in the c ourse of the Works or after the c ompletion of the Works. 

48     Although this passage in the _Guidance Notes_ states that payment c laims may be made any time prior to the final payment c laim, it is c onspic uously silent as to whether further payment c laims may be made after the final payment c laim. In my opinion, this silenc e should be regarded as an implied ac knowledgment that no further payment c laims should be filed after the final payment c laim. A final payment c laim, or final c laim, as the word “final” suggests, should be the last payment c laim issued by the c ontrac tor. Further, while an arc hitec t may revise previously issued interim c ertific ates by issuing a further c ertific ate pursuant to c l 31(6) of both the SIA Conditions 2005 and the SIA Conditions 2011, c l 37(3)( _i_ ) states unequivoc ally that this power expires after the arc hitec t issues the final 


c ertific ate. This is further evidenc e of the “final” nature of a “final” c laim, “final” payment c laim and a “final” c ertific ate. 

49     In my view, it would not be within the c ontemplation of the drafters of the SIA Conditions 2005 and the SIA Conditions 2011 for further payment c laims made after the final c laim or final payment c laim to be resolved in ways other than the arc hitec t c ertific ation mec hanism provided. To my mind, they probably did not expec t any further payment c laims to be made after the final payment c laim as the final payment proc ess is intended to resolve all matters c onc erning all the work done by the c ontrac tor. 

50     In this regard, s 10(2) of the SOPA states as follows: 

**10.** —(2) A payment c laim shall be served — 

 ( a ) at suc h time as spec ified in or determined in ac c ordanc e with the terms of the c ontrac t; or 

 ( b ) where the c ontrac t does not c ontain suc h provision, at suc h time as may be presc ribed. 

As seen from the wording of s 10(2), the timing for the serving of a payment c laim is framed in a mandatory manner suc h that it “shall be served” at spec ified times. In this regard, s 10(2)( _a_ ) requires one to first look at the terms of the c ontrac t. 

51     While it is c lear that provisions in the building c ontrac t as to when a payment c laim is to be served must be observed stric tly pursuant to s 10(2)( _a_ ), it is not c lear what the effec t of any provision indic ating when payment c laims may not be served is. I am inc lined towards the view that the latter provisions should be given the same mandatory effec t pursuant to s 10(2)( _a_ ). A stipulation for payment c laims to be filed at c ertain timings nec essarily implies that payment c laims are not to be filed outside those timings. In this regard, there is no real differenc e between provisions that stipulate when payment c laims are to be served and those that stipulate when they may not be and there is no reason for s 10(2)( _a_ ) of the SOPA to disc riminate between the two. In my judgment, it is, at the very least, arguable, that a payment c laim issued at any time after the issuanc e of the final c laim or final payment c laim and thus not in ac c ordanc e with the SIA Conditions 2005 or the SIA Conditions 2011 respec tively, is invalid as it fails to c omply with s 10(2)( _a_ ) of the SOPA. To this extent, the plaintiff’s argument that Payment Claim 17 is invalid in the light of the fac t that it was issued after Payment Claim 16B (whic h should probably be regarded as the final c laim under c l 31(11) of the SIA Conditions 2005) appears to have some semblanc e of merit. 

52     Nonetheless, as I have already dec ided to dismiss the plaintiff’s applic ation on preliminary grounds, there is no need for me to reac h a c onc lusive determination as to this issue. I would like to emphasise that these observations made above c onc erning Payment Claim 17 and the issues assoc iated with it (at [36]–[51]) are _obiter dicta_. 

**Conclusion** 

53     For the reasons given above (at [22]–[35]), I dismiss the applic ation of the plaintiff. I also award c osts to the defendant to be taxed if not agreed.
