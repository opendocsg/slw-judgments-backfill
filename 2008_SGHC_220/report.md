Judith Prakash J: 

1       By this ac tion, the plaintiff seeks the return of a sum of US$1 million whic h it remitted to the defendant’s personal bank ac c ount on 3 August 2005. The plaintiff has put forward two c auses of ac tion, one for breac h of trust and the other for breac h of c ontrac t. The defendant’s position is that he rec eived the money on behalf of his c ompany, Prime International Consultants Pty Ltd (“Prime”), whic h was entitled to it as a c ommitment fee and that he did not hold the same on trust for the plaintiff. He further denies that there was ever any c ontrac t between him and the plaintiff. The relevant c ontrac tual relations were between the plaintiff and Prime. 

**Background** 

2       The plaintiff is a c ompany inc orporated in Malaysia and listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stoc k Exc hange. The key dec ision maker in the plaintiff at the material time was its Exec utive Deputy Chairman, Tan Sri Datuk Dr Mohan M K Swami (“Tan Sri Mohan”). In relation to the matters giving rise to this ac tion, he was assisted c hiefly by the plaintiff’s Direc tor of Corporate Affairs, Ravi Navaratnam (“Mr Navaratnam”). 

3       The defendant is a c hartered engineer by profession. He emigrated to Australia from Singapore in 1987 and thereafter ac quired a wealth of work experienc e in relation to oil and gas in the engineering, trading, marketing and c onsultanc y sec tors. In 1991, he proc ured the inc orporation in Australia of Prime. Prime is wholly owned by the defendant. He is its sole shareholder and direc tor. In 


relation to the matters giving rise to this ac tion, Prime was assisted by its business c onsultant Kevin Humphrys (“Mr Humphrys”). 

4       The next important player in this story is an Indonesian c ompany, PT Kutai Timur Resourc es (“KTR”). In about April 2005, KTR rec eived letters of rec ommendation from various loc al authorities in Indonesia allowing it to survey, study, mine, manage, revive, develop, explore, exploit and produc e oil and gas from wells loc ated in the region of Kutai Timur, East Kalimantan, Indonesia (the “Projec t”). 

5       On 16 July 2005, Prime signed a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with KTR. The purpose of the MOU was to rec ord the parties’ intentions to negotiate with eac h other to sec ure the Projec t and to define their respec tive responsibilities and interests in c onnec tion with the Projec t. Prior to the signing of the MOU, the defendant had met Tan Sri Mohan and had learnt that the plaintiff was interested in going into the oil and gas industry. The defendant had approac hed the plaintiff in c onnec tion with the Projec t bec ause Prime and KTR required funding for the operation of the Projec t. 

6       On 22 July 2005, the defendant and Mr Humphrys met Tan Sri Mohan in Prime’s offic e in Perth. They disc ussed the possibility of Prime and the plaintiff partic ipating in a joint venture with KTR in relation to the Projec t. They then signed a doc ument entitled “Heads of Agreement” whic h was expressed to be made between the plaintiff represented by Tan Sri Mohan and Prime represented by the defendant. This was a short doc ument. It c ontained four terms. The relevant portion read as follows: 

 OBLIGATIONS 

 PI [Prime] to fac ilitate the suc c essful signing of the Projec t Agreement in partnership with PT Kutai Timur Resourc es and other multinational oil and gas c ompanies. 

 STB [the plaintiff] to c ompensate PI on the suc c essful signing of the agreement by the following: 

1\. Within thirty days of the signing of the Projec t Agreement, make available the sum of US5,000,000 per oil field bloc k (payable to PI or other parties nominated by PI). 

7       Thereafter, Tan Sri Mohan went to Jakarta with the defendant to meet KTR. On 26 July 2005, Tan Sri Mohan met with Pak Sulaiman, the president of KTR, his c olleague Abdullah Syafei (known to all as “Pak Sany”), and two offic ials from Pertamina (Indonesia’s state oil c ompany). Pak Sulaiman told Tan Sri Mohan that KTR was c onsidering inviting the plaintiff to partic ipate as a partner in the joint venture for the Projec t. He also told Tan Sri Mohan that KTR would obtain the requisite approval for the Projec t from Pertamina in about two months. Tan Sri Mohan c onfirmed that the plaintiff was interested in partic ipating, subjec t to the results of due diligenc e being satisfac tory. 

8       The defendant then produc ed a doc ument entitled “Tripartite Joint Venture Agreement” (“TJVA”). The plaintiff reviewed the doc ument and, after further disc ussion, the parties agreed on the terms of the TJVA. It was signed on 27 July 2005 by all three parties, _viz_ , KTR, Prime and the plaintiff. At the same time, MOU signed a power of attorney (“POA”) in favour of Prime and the plaintiff. Among the salient terms of the TJVA were the following: 

 (a) KTR was desirous of working together with the plaintiff and Prime on the Projec t (Rec ital 8); 

 (b) the parties were desirous of entering into a further joint venture agreement (the “Final JVA”) to define their c omplete roles and responsibilities in the Projec t (Rec ital 8); 


 (c ) the parties were to endeavour to ac hieve the terms of the TJVA in a timely and effic ac ious manner (Clause 1(1)); 

 (d) upon the signing of TJVA, KTR was to c onfirm with the relevant authorities in Indonesia, inc luding BP MIGAS and Pertamina, that the nec essary approvals and lic enses would be issued to enable KTR, Prime and the plaintiff to survey, study, mine, manage, revive, develop, explore, exploit and produc e oil and gas from the Projec t (Clause 2(1)); and 

 (e) the plaintiff and Prime were to at all times ac t c onsultatively and jointly with eac h other to assist in negotiating relevant terms with third parties suc h as c onsultants, c ontrac tors, engineers, financ iers and other external experts required to further the suc c essful implementation of the Projec t (Clause 2(2)). 

9       The parties have different versions of the next part of the story. Ac c ording to Tan Sri Mohan, before he and the defendant left Jakarta on 28 July 2005, the defendant requested that the plaintiff make an upfront payment of US$5 million. This was the first time he had raised the issue of suc h a payment. He told Tan Sri Mohan that the money was needed to purc hase a data pac k from BP Migas whic h c ontained important geologic al information about the area where the Projec t’s oil wells were situated. 

10     The parties arrived in Singapore on 28 July 2005. Tan Sri Mohan was joined by Mr Navaratnam and another c olleague, Dato Pang Wee Pat (“Dato Pang”). All three of them had a meeting with the defendant the same day. At that meeting, the defendant said that “the Indonesians” were in Singapore and that they had asked for an upfront payment of US$5 million. After some disc ussion, the defendant reduc ed this amount to US$1 million and Tan Sri Mohan said that if the Projec t was genuine there should not be a problem about an upfront payment but that he needed authority from the plaintiff’s board in order to make the same. On 2 August 2005, the plaintiff’s board met and, after disc ussion, gave its mandate for a payment up to US$2 million. 

11     On 3 August 2005, there was a meeting in Singapore between Tan Sri Mohan, Dato Pang, Mr Navaratnam and the defendant. Tan Sri Mohan informed the defendant that the plaintiff proposed to make payment direc tly to KTR in two stages: the first US$500,000 would be paid upfront and the balanc e US$500,000 would be paid after suitable operator for the Projec t had been appointed. The defendant did not ac c ept this and it was eventually agreed that the sum of US$1 million would be paid to Prime. On 3 August 2005, the plaintiff remitted this sum to the defendant’s personal bank ac c ount in Singapore. In this c onnec tion, the plaintiff wrote a letter to Prime whic h read as follows: 

 Re: Ac knowledgement of rec eipt of US$1,000,000. 

 With referenc e to your letter dated 29 July 2005, authorizing the payment of US$1,000,000.00 to be made to Mr. GOH TAI HOCK, kindly ac knowledge rec eipt of the sum of US$1,000,000.00 via Telegraphic Transfer (TT) enc losed herewith being an up front payment to sec ure the Projec t as stipulated under the Tripartite Joint Venture Agreement between PT Kutai Timur Resourc es and Sitt Tatt Berhad and Prime International Consultants Private Limited. 

The letter was signed by Dato Pang. Beneath his signature, there was an ac knowledgement of rec eipt of the US$1 million signed by the defendant. 

12     The defendant’s version of events as set out in his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief was that during the meeting in Perth on 22 July 2005, Tan Sri Mohan had agreed that Prime would rec eive a sign-on fee if it suc c eeded in getting the plaintiff involved in the Projec t by signing agreements with 


KTR. This fee was disc ussed and agreed in an amount of up to AUD 2 million. It was understood that a portion of these monies would be paid to KTR’s representatives. Tan Sri Mohan suggested that after the plaintiff had signed agreements with KTR, he and the defendant should fly into Singapore for Prime to c ollec t the sign-on fee. 

13     During the subsequent disc ussions with KTR in Jakarta, KTR agreed to appoint Prime and the plaintiff as its attorneys under the POA in order to fac ilitate the progress of the Projec t. The POA was signed on 27 July 2005. Thereafter, ac c ording to the defendant, Prime and the plaintiff at a separate meeting agreed that a sign-on fee of US$1 million (equivalent to AUD 2 million) would be paid by the plaintiff to Prime for the suc c essful signing of the POA. A portion of these monies were to be disbursed to Pak Sulaiman and Pak Sany on behalf of KTR for their involvement in the signing of the POA and other agreements with KTR. The defendant said it was only on 28 July 2005 when he met Dato Pang in Singapore that he and Tan Sri Mohan were told that the approval of the plaintiff’s board would be required for the payment of the sign-on fee. The defendant reiterated that the purpose of this payment was for Prime to assist the plaintiff to sec ure its involvement in the Projec t by signing the POA, the TJVA and the Final JVA pursuant to c lause 1.2 of the TJVA. 

14     It was agreed at the meeting that as Prime did not operate a bank ac c ount in Singapore, it would be in order for the plaintiff to pay the fee into the defendant’s own bank ac c ount in Singapore. Prime wrote a letter on 29 July 2005 to authorise the payment of the money into the defendant’s ac c ount. On the same day, the defendant informed Tan Sri Mohan that Pak Sulaiman and Pak Sany were expec ting their share of the sign-on fee before the Projec t c ould c ontinue and the Final JVA be exec uted. On 30 July 2005, the plaintiff presented the defendant with a letter addressed to Prime to doc ument the payment and the terms of the payment. This letter stated that the US$1 million would be fully refundable. The defendant said that he unequivoc ally rejec ted the doc ument. 

15     After the defendant rec eived the money on 3 August 2005, he paid US$450,000 to Pak Sulaiman and US$150,000 to Pak Sany. The payments were effec ted on 5 August 2005. The defendant retained the balanc e of US$400,000 in his Singapore ac c ount. 

16     Thereafter matters proc eeded. A team from the plaintiff met various Indonesian parties from 22 to 24 August 2005. These meetings c ulminated on 24 August 2005 in the signing of the Final JVA. The salient terms of the Final JVA were as follows: 

 (a) By s 1.01 (vi), the parties would inc orporate a joint venture c ompany (“the JV Company”) in Indonesia; 

 (b) By s 1.02, the shareholding proportions would be: 

 i. fifty-five perc ent (55%) to Kutai [KTR]; 

 ii. thirty perc ent (30%) to STB [the plaintiff]; 

 iii. fifteen perc ent (15%) to Prime; 

 (c ) By s 4.02 (ii) (a), KTR was to be primarily responsible for the establishment and setting up of the JV Company. 

It was envisaged that the JV Company would be the entity to rec eive the various approvals and be the operator of the Projec t. The Final JVA also reiterated that the parties had an obligation to c ooperate in proc uring the partic ipation of thirdparty tec hnic al experts to assist in the 


implementation of the Projec t. 

17     Thereafter, problems arose. There were essentially two problems. First, the parties c ould not agree on the third-party expert or tec hnic al partner. The defendant suggested an Australian c ompany c alled Advanc ed Well Tec hnologies but this c ompany was not ac c eptable to the plaintiff bec ause it was not prepared to fund the exploration direc tly or from the sale of pre-produc tion oil. The plaintiff then brought in a Chinese c ompany, Asian Oil Company. On 15 Dec ember 2005 the plaintiff signed a letter of intent with Asian Oil Company without informing Prime. The sec ond problem was that the JV Company was not set up bec ause there were disputes as to how muc h paid-up c apital was required and the plaintiff who was to fund the establishment of the JV Company would not provide the nec essary c apital until these disputes were resolved. 

18     By an email dated 9 February 2006 and a letter dated 14 February 2006, Prime wrote to the plaintiff and stated that it would withdraw from the Final JVA and “resc ind all c laim to any entitlements and responsibilities defined in the [Final JVA]”. By a further email dated 21 February 2006, Prime told the plaintiff that its withdrawal related spec ific ally to all c laims to entitlements and responsibilities defined in the Final JVA and that it did not resc ind its right to c laims and entitlements that were defined outside of the Final JVA. On 22 February 2006, the plaintiff wrote to Prime and asserted that the latter’s withdrawal from the Projec t amounted to abandoning the Projec t in its entirety. It further demanded the immediate refund of the US$1 million payment made to Prime on 3 August 2005. This letter was followed by the plaintiff’s lawyer’s letter dated 9 Marc h 2006 in whic h it was asserted that Prime was in breac h of its obligation under the Final JVA and that it was unlawful for Prime to c ontinue to retain the US$1 million. Immediate repayment was demanded. Prime did not repay the money and this ac tion was c ommenc ed on 30 August 2006. 

19     The big problem that the plaintiff fac ed in putting forward its c laim that the defendant was liable to repay it the US$1 million was that in legal terms the defendant was not the rec ipient of the money. Although in fac t it was sent to his ac c ount, this was done bec ause he was the agent of Prime, the party with whom the plaintiff was in a c ontrac tual relationship, and he had been authorised by Prime to c ollec t the money on its behalf. It was Prime who was a party to the TJVA and the Final JVA and who withdrew from these c ontrac ts. Whilst the plaintiff sought to rec over the money from Prime in arbitration proc eedings, it also asserted a right of rec overy against the defendant sinc e he was the c ontrolling mind of Prime and also Prime itself has only a very minimal paid-up c apital. 

20     As I have said above, the plaintiff pitc hed its c ase on two bases: trust and c ontrac t. I will deal first with the c laim in c ontrac t. 

**The contractual claim** 

21     In the statement of c laim, the plaintiff pleaded that on the basis of the parties’ c onduc t, it was to be inferred that a c ontrac t c ame into being between the plaintiff and the defendant in or around late July/early August 2005 whic h c ontrac t c ontained the following terms: 

 (a) that the plaintiff was to make payment of the sum of US$1 million as an upfront payment to sec ure the Projec t; 

 (b) that the defendant would proc ure that Prime would, at all times, exert its best efforts to sec ure the Projec t and its best efforts to ac hieve the suc c essful realisation and c ompletion of the Projec t; 

 (c ) that the defendant would proc ure that Prime would at all times faithfully disc harge all its 


 obligations under both the TJVA and the Final JVA. 

22     The c onduc t that the plaintiff relied on was the demand by the defendant for payment of the sum of US$5 million to sec ure the Projec t, the negotiations resulting in the defendant agreeing to ac c ept US$1 million as the upfront payment to sec ure the Projec t, and the rec eipt of the same by the defendant on 3 August 2005. 

23     In its submissions on this issue, the plaintiff pointed out that the defendant was the c ontrolling mind and will of Prime. Prime ac ted solely through the defendant and no one else and the defendant, in turn, dec ided how Prime would ac t in respec t of any matter. At all material times, KTR and the plaintiff dealt direc tly with the defendant. Whilst the MOU, TJVA and Final JVA were c ontrac ts made with Prime, the issue whic h arose was whether it was open to the defendant, after having c ollec ted the US$1 million advanc e payment from the plaintiff, to assert that the plaintiff had to look solely to Prime for any remedy it might wish to pursue. It had to be remembered that whether Prime fulfilled its legal obligation under the c ontrac ts depended entirely upon the defendant. It was he alone who dec ided whether Prime would undertake and fulfil its legal obligations under the TJVA and Final JVA. 

24     The plaintiff noted that, under c ross-examination, the defendant had ac c epted without reservation that: 

 (a) the joint venture partners, KTR and the plaintiff, were entitled to assume that the defendant would be the person with the responsibility to make sure that Prime did what it was supposed to do under the two joint venture c ontrac ts; and 

 (b) it was not open to the defendant to say to the joint venture partners that he was not responsible if Prime failed to fulfil its obligations under those c ontrac ts. 

25     The plaintiff argued that in this situation it was open to the c ourt to infer that, in addition to the c ontrac ts whic h were made between Prime and the plaintiff, there existed a parallel c ontrac t between the defendant personally and the joint venture partners pursuant to whic h the defendant was legally obliged to use his best efforts to make Prime fulfil its obligations under the Final JVA. The plaintiff further submitted that, on the authorities, the test used by the c ourt is whether the parties’ c onduc t is explic able only on the basis of a binding agreement. The plaintiff asserted that if this question is answered in the affirmative, then the c ourt will infer that a c ontrac t is entered into between the parties. Further, the c ourt will examine the arrangements and, having regard to the benefits c onferred on one party, as well as the detriment suffered by the other party under that arrangement, will ask itself if an objec tive bystander would have c onc luded that the benefit was c onferred in c onsideration of a promise made by the other party. 

26     The authority c ited for the above proposition was _Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corporation (Australia) Pty Ltd_ , 1988 NSW Lexis 8785 where the Supreme Court of New South Wales found, on the fac ts, that there was a c ontrac t to be inferred from the c onduc t and statements made by the parties. The c ourt said (at [*23] to [*24]): 

 It is often diffic ult to fit a c ommerc ial arrangement into the c ommon lawyers’ analysis of a c ontrac tual arrangement. Commerc ial disc ussions are often too unrefined to fit easily into the slots of “offer”, “ac c eptanc e”, “c onsideration” and “intention to c reate a legal relationship” whic h are the benc hmarks of the c ontrac t of c lassic al theory... Nevertheless, a c ontrac t may be inferred from the ac ts and c onduc t of parties as well as or in the absenc e of their words .... The question is in this class of case is whether the conduct of the parties viewed in the light of the surrounding circumstances shows a tacit understanding or agreement. [emphasis added] 


It should be noted that in the c ited c ase, there was no c onc luded agreement but there was performanc e by the parties; the c ourt then implied a c ontrac t. 

27     The plaintiff submitted that in this c ase a c ontrac t may be inferred from the following c irc umstanc es and c onduc t of the parties: 

 (a) at all times, Prime was a $2 c ompany. The defendant was Prime’s c ontrolling mind and will; 

 (b) the TJVA and JVA were c ontrac ts in respec t of a Projec t involving large sums. Indeed, under the Heads of Agreement, Prime stood to rec eive the sum of US$5 million per oil field bloc k; 

 (c ) although the plaintiff was not legally obliged to do so at the time, the plaintiff was requested to make and did make an advanc e payment of US$1 million to “sec ure the Projec t”’ 

 (d) whether Prime fulfilled its obligations under the JVA was entirely dependent upon the defendant, its c ontrolling mind and will. 

 (e) the defendant ac c epted under c ross-examination that the plaintiff was entitled to assume that the defendant would be the person with the responsibility to make sure that Prime did what it was supposed to do under the JVA; and 

 (f ) the defendant also ac c epted under c ross-examination that it was not open to him to say to the plaintiff (and KTR) that he was not responsible if Prime failed to fulfil its obligations under the JVA. 

28     I am not c onvinc ed by the above submissions. I ac c ept the princ iple that a c ontrac t may be inferred from c onduc t but, as the Supreme Court of New South Wales was at pains to point out, suc h a determination c an only be made when all the c irc umstanc es support it. The c irc umstanc es of _Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd_ (c ited at [26] above) were very different from those that existed here. As the defendant submitted, the c irc umstanc es that existed in this c ase do not provide a basis to imply that a parallel c ontrac t existed between KTR, the plaintiff and the defendant personally. The plaintiff had only c ontrac ted with Prime and KTR and those c ontrac ts were doc umented and the terms that eac h party had to abide by were freely expressed in the doc uments. There was no void that needed to be filled by an implied c ontrac t. 

29     From the outset, the plaintiff was aware that whilst it was negotiating with the defendant, the c ompany that would be c ontrac ting with it was the c ompany run by the defendant, _ie_ , Prime. This is apparent from the Heads of Agreement signed in Perth. The plaintiff must therefore have been aware that the defendant was not undertaking personal liability in his dealings with the plaintiff. It was open to the plaintiff if it was unc omfortable with Prime to insist that the defendant must either c ontrac t personally with it or guarantee Prime’s performanc e. It did not do this. The fac t that whether Prime fulfilled its obligations under the JVA was dependent on the defendant c ausing it to do so and the further fac t that the defendant agreed that the plaintiff was entitled to assume that the defendant had the responsibility to make sure that Prime fulfilled its obligations under the Final JVA, c annot lead to the implic ation of a direc t c ontrac t between the plaintiff and the defendant. This is bec ause the defendant and Prime are separate legal entities and the defendant as the direc tor of Prime would in that c apac ity have a fiduc iary duty to Prime to ensure that Prime fulfilled its c ontrac tual obligations. The argument put forward by the plaintiff in c irc umstanc es like these would, if ac c epted, have the potential to impose liability by way of a c ollateral c ontrac t between the direc tors who c ontrol any c ompany and third parties who c ontrac t with that c ompany. In my judgment, the c irc umstanc es relied on by the plaintiff are inadequate to support the plaintiff’s c ontention. 


30     Further, the plaintiff’s c ase of two c ontrac ts was put to Tan Sri Mohan. He denied that there were two c ontrac ts. He c onc eded that the defendant represented Prime and stated that the defendant spoke on his own behalf only until the agreements were drafted when the c ompany (Prime) was introduc ed. Prior to this part of his evidenc e, Tan Sri Mohan, when asked whether there was a c ontrac t between the plaintiff and the defendant personally, answered: “Yes, ... bec ause he represented Prime”. Later, when he was asked whether there was a c ontrac t between and the plaintiff and Prime, he again answered in the affirmative. The third question was whether these were the same c ontrac ts or two different c ontrac ts and his answer was that they were the same c ontrac t. I agree with the defendant that this evidenc e made c lear that there was no parallel or c ollateral c ontrac t between the parties in that Tan Sri Mohan was trying to imply a personal c ovenant on the part of the defendant in the existing c ontrac t. It is not possible to add suc h a personal c ovenant into the existing c ontrac ts as they were written c ontrac ts and therefore the parole evidenc e rule set out in s 93 of the Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) would not permit the admission of oral evidenc e to vary the written c ontrac ts. 

31     Subsequent events did not disc lose any evidenc e of a c ollateral c ontrac t either. All c orrespondenc e sent by or on behalf of the plaintiff and by or on behalf of KTR regarding the Projec t were addressed to Prime and not to the defendant. Even after the dispute had arisen, the plaintiff in a letter of 20 February 2006 alleged that Prime had failed or refused to fac ilitate the suc c essful implementation of the Projec t. No suc h allegation was direc ted against the defendant personally. None of the plaintiff’s internal doc uments made any referenc e to a c ollateral c ontrac t or understanding that the defendant had undertaken personal obligations. The demands by the plaintiff and its Malaysian solic itors for the return of the US$1 million were made to Prime and not to the defendant. Mr Navaratnam, when questioned about this, c onfirmed that until the rec eipt of legal advic e, the plaintiff had never thought of a personal c ontrac t between it and the defendant. 

32     For the reasons given above, the plaintiff’s c laim on the basis of a direc t c ontrac t between it and the defendant must fail. The plaintiff also put forward an alternative c laim in c ontrac t. This was that Prime was in breac h of c ontrac t in repudiating the Final JVA and that the defendant had to be held responsible for that breac h as the alter ego of Prime. I will c onsider this issue after I deal with the c laim in trust. 

**The claim in trust** 

33     The planks of the plaintiff’s c laim in trust are as follows: 

 (a) an agent who rec eives trust property lawfully but who then deals with it in a manner inc onsistent with the terms of the trust is liable for breac h of trust; 

 (b) the sum of US$1 million whic h the plaintiff advanc ed to the defendant was not a sign-on fee but was advanc ed to sec ure the Projec t. Therefore the defendant was not entitled to treat that money as if it belonged to him or Prime but was legally obliged to apply the money only for purposes c onnec ted with the Projec t with a view to advanc ing the Projec t; 

 (c ) at the least, the defendant was liable to the plaintiff for the sum of US$350,511. bec ause when Prime withdrew from the Projec t in mid February 2006, the Projec t c ame to an end and the defendant was obliged to refund this sum (whic h was then the balanc e in his Singapore ac c ount) to the plaintiff; 

 (d) the defendant was also liable to the plaintiff for two additional payments totalling US$50,000 whic h he had paid out to two individuals in August and Oc tober 2005 as these 


 payments had not been made to further the Projec t; and 

 (e) even if the defendant was not liable to the plaintiff for breac h of trust as an agent of Prime, he would be liable for breac h of trust as the alter ego of Prime. 

34     In relation to the law, the plaintiff relied on texts and authorities establishing the proposition that an agent or stranger to a trust c an be held liable as a c onstruc tive trustee if it c an be shown that the agent or stranger to the trust rec eived trust property knowing it to be suc h but thereafter dealt with it in a manner inc onsistent with the terms of the trust. The plaintiff plac ed partic ular relianc e on the following paragraphs from _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ , Vol 9(2), (2003, Lexis Nexis): 

 [110.585] Knowing receipt or dealing: recipient liability 

 A rec ipient may be liable where he (1) knowingly rec eives trust property in breac h of trust (‘rec eipt of property c onstruc tive trust’); or (2) rec eives trust property without notic e of the trust and subsequently deals with it in a manner inc onsistent with the trusts of whic h he has bec ome c ognizant (‘wrongful dealing c onstruc tive trust’); or (3) rec eives trust property knowing it to be suc h but without breac h of trust and subsequently deals with it in a manner inc onsistent with trust. In suc h c ases, the desc ription of the rec ipient as a c onstruc tive trustee is misc onc eived. Suc h a person is not a trustee at all, even though he may be liable to ac c ount as if he were. 

 Head (3) above relates to a person, usually an agent of the trustees, who rec eives the trust property lawfully and not for his own benefit but who then either misappropriates it or otherwise deals with it in a manner whic h is inc onsistent with the trust.

 [110.587] Receipt of trust money 

 The law is reluc tant to make a mere agent a c onstruc tive trustee. Ac c ordingly a banker, broker, solic itor or other stranger to the trust who lawfully rec eives money, for not his own benefit, from a trustee whic h he knows to be part of the trust property does not bec ome a c onstruc tive trustee of it in relation to the benefic iaries unless he either misappropriates it or is guilty of some other wrongful ac t in relation to that money. To ac t wrongfully, he must be guilty of (1) knowingly partic ipating in a breac h of trust by his princ ipal; or (2) intermeddling with the trust property otherwise than merely as an agent and thereby bec oming a trustee de son tort; or (3) rec eiving or dealing with the money knowing that his princ ipal has no right to pay it over or to instruc t him to deal with it in the manner indic ated; or (4) some dishonest ac t relating to the money. 

In this c onnec tion, the c ase of _Carreras Rothmans Ltd v Freeman Mathews Treasure Ltd_ [1985] Ch 207 whic h rec ognises (at 221) that there is ample authority for the proposition that monies paid by A to B for a spec ific purpose whic h has been made known to B are c lothed with a trust, is also apposite. 

35     To bring its c laim within those princ iples, the plaintiff rec ognised that it had to establish that: 

 (a) the sum of US$1 million that the defendant rec eived from the plaintiff on 3 August 2005 


 was subjec t to a trust; 

 (b) the defendant knew that the sum of US$1 million was subjec t to a trust; and 

 (c ) the defendant dealt with the sum in a manner inc onsistent with the terms of the trust. 

**_Was the payment of US$1 million subject to a trust?_** 

36     How this issue is determined depends on the purpose for whic h the sum of US$1 million was paid to the defendant. The plaintiff’s version was that the sum was paid to the defendant “to sec ure the Projec t”. As suc h the defendant was not entitled to treat the money as belonging to him or Prime but was obliged to utilise it for the purpose of sec uring the Projec t and/or of advanc ing the Projec t. The defendant, on the other hand, c ontended that the US$1 million was a nonrefundable upfront payment to sec ure the signing of the Final JVA, whic h purpose was fulfilled. 

37     The defendant in advanc ing his c ase on this issue, laid great stress on the letter of 3 August 2005 whic h he desc ribed as the key doc ument setting out the purpose of the US$1 million payment. He emphasized that it had been prepared by the plaintiff, a listed c ompany with both in-house and external solic itors. The fundamental assumption must be that the plaintiff would have put down in that letter any terms that had been agreed; and the absenc e of any partic ular term must mean that it was not agreed. The letter desc ribed the sum of US$1 million as “being an upfront payment to sec ure the Projec t as stipulated under the Tripartite Joint Venture Agreement ...” and said nothing else about the terms of the payment. It was signific ant that the term “up front” rather than “deposit” or “advanc e” was used to desc ribe the payment. No reason was given as to why an advanc e or deposit was required. If payments were to be made to third parties, the plaintiff would have disbursed these direc tly. Further, the defendant had made it c lear to the plaintiff that Prime did not ac c ept that the payment would be refundable and the plaintiff had effec ted the payment with this knowledge. 

38     The defendant also c ommented that the plaintiff was not c lear what was meant by “to sec ure the suc c essful implementation of the Projec t”. He asserted that Tan Sri Mohan had modified the plaintiff’s position to state that Prime’s obligation was to use best efforts for a suc c essful implementation. This was explained further to mean getting the nec essary data, setting up the joint venture c ompany and getting a tec hnic al operator on board. In Perth, Tan Sri Mohan had already promised Prime US$5 million per oil field bloc k for the same steps but in c ourt he said that the payment of US$1 million c overed the same obligations. Further, the very first draft of the minutes of the plaintiff’s board meeting held on 25 August 2005 desc ribed the payment as a payment to sec ure entry to the Projec t. Entry would be sec ured by the signing of the Final JVA. 

39     Building further on the wording of the letter of 3 August 2005, the defendant dealt with what was meant by sec uring the Projec t “as stipulated under the [TJVA]”. The TJVA, he said, was an interim agreement to govern the relationship between the parties until the Final JVA was signed. The TJVA defined the term “Projec t” as used in that doc ument to mean the oil and gas wells loc ated in the Desa Mata Air, Desa Bangun Jaya and Desa Sempayau distric ts of East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Rec ital 8 and c l 1.2 of the TJVA required the plaintiff, KTR and Prime to enter the Final JVA to define their c omplete roles and responsibilities in the Projec t. Pursuant to c lause 6, the TJVA was to remain valid and binding until the signing of the Final JVA whic h would only happen after the plaintiff’s due diligenc e had been c ompleted. Sec uring the Projec t therefore meant sec uring the plaintiff’s partic ipation as envisaged in the TJVA, that is to bind KTR until due diligenc e had been c arried out and to ac hieve the purpose of the TJVA, to wit, the signing of the Final JVA. The plaintiff was anxious to enter the oil and gas industry and offered very large sums to sec ure suc h entry. Onc e the TJVA was signed, the final step to sec ure suc h entry was the Final JVA. 


40     Whilst the defendant relied mainly on doc uments to establish his position on the purpose for the payment, the plaintiff c hose to emphasise the defendant’s evidenc e in c ourt. It submitted that his version was c ompletely undermined by many inc onsistenc ies and shifts in his testimony. It desc ribed his evidenc e on this issue as unreliable, c onfusing and c ontradic tory and submitted that it should be rejec ted in toto. Sec ondly, it c ontended that the ac knowledgement of 3 August 2005 and the c irc umstanc es leading to the US$1 million payment supported its version rather than the defendant’s. Thirdly, in the plaintiff’s view, the other c ontemporaneous doc uments also supported its version. 

41     The plaintiff’s submissions on the twists and turns resorted to by the defendant while he was on the stand are, substantially, unanswerable. On this issue the defendant was a very bad witness indeed. He was one of those witnesses who c annot stop talking and elaborating on his evidenc e until the whole bec omes an elaborate tangle. 

42     As the plaintiff pointed out, the shifts in the evidenc e started from the very beginning: from the defendant’s ac c ount of the telephone c onversation he had with Tan Sri Mohan before the two men met in Perth. He initially testified that during this c onversation, there was no disc ussion about the up front fee. In almost the next breath, the defendant said that there was a mention “in passing” that there would be a payment “but we didn’t go any further than that”. Minutes later, he asserted that during this c onversation, Tan Sri Mohan informed the defendant that if he got KTR to grant the plaintiff the POA, Tan Sri Mohan would ensure that Prime was paid a sign-on fee. Therefore, the defendant then expec ted that Prime would rec eive the sign-on fee if KTR signed the POA. The defendant however c hanged tac k again to say he expec ted the sign-on fee to be paid “before the joint venture was signed” but shortly thereafter he reverted to his earlier position of expec ting payment on signing of the POA. 

43     There were more c ontradic tions to follow in relation to the defendant’s assertion of when the sign-on fee was to be paid. At various points the defendant c onfirmed that there was a firm agreement reac hed between him and Tan Sri Mohan in Perth that Prime would rec eive the fee the moment it suc c eeded in getting the plaintiff a c onfirmed role in the Projec t, even if the plaintiff’s exac t shareholding was not c onfirmed. He also said that the agreements to be signed in Indonesia with KTR would c onfirm the plaintiff’s role and therefore following their exec ution Prime would be entitled to its sign-on fee. When asked why he did not ask for payment of the sign-on fee immediately after the signing of the POA and TJVA, in response the defendant asserted that he had done so. It was then pointed out that no suc h assertion appeared in his affidavit. The defendant then c hanged his evidenc e and said that, at that point, the plaintiff’s shareholding in the Projec t was not c onfirmed and the fee was only due after the Final JVA c onfirming the parties’ shareholdings in the Projec t had been signed. 

44     The evidenc e that the sign-on fee would only be payable upon the signing of the Final JVA was inc onsistent with his earlier evidenc e that the fee would be paid onc e agreements were signed in Jakarta sec uring the plaintiff’s role in the Projec t. It was also inc onsistent with paragraph 44 of his affidavit where he stated that in Singapore on 30 July 2005 he had told the plaintiff’s representative that Prime had already done all it needed to do to rec eive the sign-on fee. 

45     The defendant had also testified that Tan Sri Mohan had insisted that the plaintiff’s exac t shareholding in the Projec t had to be c onfirmed before the fee was paid. He was asked why, if that was so, the parties had met in Singapore immediately after the signing of the TJVA to, as he alleged, disc uss the payment of the fee. In response, he explained that it was only initially that Tan Sri Mohan had wanted the fee to be paid after the c onfirmation of the shareholdings. After meeting the Indonesians, however, he bec ame very c omfortable with them and was prepared to pay the sign-on fee immediately after the POA and TJVA were signed. That explanation, however, c ontradic ted 


another piec e of the defendant’s testimony whic h was that it was after the POA was signed that Tan Sri Mohan insisted he needed the Final JVA to be signed before the sign-on fee would be paid. 

46     At another point in the evidenc e, the defendant further c ontradic ted his previous testimony. He said that the agreement entitling Prime to payment of the sign-on fee after the c onc lusion of the Final JVA was made in Perth. This c ontradic ted the earlier statement that in Perth the agreement was that the sign-on fee would be payable onc e agreements were signed c onfirming the plaintiff’s role in the Projec t. Confronted with this inc onsistenc y, the defendant shifted his position and asserted that the agreement providing for payment of the sign-on fee after the c onc lusion of the Final JVA was only reac hed in Jakarta. 

47     The defendant did not take issue with the plaintiff’s assertions regarding the c ontradic tions in his evidenc e. In his view, these shifts in evidenc e were not material when the evidenc e of the plaintiff, in partic ular that of Tan Sri Mohan, was c onsidered. Both parties, the defendant averred, did not give a c lear version of events bec ause the earlier disc ussions between the parties were not c lear. In any c ase, the paramount issue was the purpose of the US$1 million payment and whether it was refundable. The question turned on the events that immediately prec eded the payment and the c ontemporaneous doc uments and the purported inc onsistenc ies did not touc h on these key events. 

48     I do not agree that the inc onsistenc ies in the defendant’s testimony are not germane to the issue of the purpose of the payment. The manner of the defendant’s ac c ount of why the payment was made and the c ourse of events that allegedly led to the plaintiff agreeing to pay Prime a nonrefundable sign-on fee was material in my assessment of the c redibility of his ac c ount. The defendant shifted positions so many times in the c ourse of his testimony that I am not able to dec ide whic h part of his testimony was true and whic h part was not. That c onsiderably weakens his assertion that the plaintiff’s c ase on the reason for the payment was false. No doubt there were some inc onsistenc ies in Tan Sri Mohan’s evidenc e as pointed out in the defendant’s submissions. I do not spec ify them here bec ause I am satisfied that where they existed they were minor and, as the plaintiff pointed out in its Reply Submissions, in a c ouple of c ases the alleged inc onsistenc y was not borne out. Whatever the minor inc onsistenc ies in the plaintiff’s evidenc e were, they paled in c omparison with the defendant’s tec tonic c hanges of position. 

49     The plaintiff’s version is, however, supported by more than the testimony of Tan Sri Mohan. There is, first of all, the wording of the ac knowledgement whic h the defendant signed on 3 August 

2005\. That was drafted by the plaintiff and it desc ribed the payment as an “up front payment to sec ure the Projec t”. The defendant’s argument was that these words “sec ure the Projec t” meant that the defendant had to proc ure that KTR signed the Final JVA. The plaintiff, however, argued that they meant that the payment was being made to “advanc e” the Projec t. It pointed out that if its intention had been to refer to the signing of the Final JVA the language would have been “to sec ure Sitt Tatt Berhad’s involvement in the Projec t” and not simply “to sec ure the Projec t”. Whilst, obviously, this is a self-serving argument, it is a sensible one. On a plain reading the words “to sec ure the Projec t” indic ate that the payment was being made to advanc e the Projec t, or, using the defendant’s language “to get the Projec t going”. These words are also c onsistent with Tan Sri Mohan’s ac c ount that the defendant had explained to him that money was needed to get hold of c ertain information required for the Projec t and, later, that the Indonesians were in Singapore and required the payment urgently. It is also signific ant that the defendant should have insisted on this payment after the signing of the TJVA when, if his evidenc e was to be believed, it was not due until the Final JVA had been signed. If that was the c ase, then the defendant had no ground to even ask for the US$1 million in July 2005. 

50     The defendant in his submissions was in part c ontending that one c ould not simply have regard 


to the phrase “to sec ure the Projec t” without c onsidering the sec ond half of the sentenc e whic h read “as stipulated under the TJVA”. Looking at that portion of the sentenc e, the intention was to sec ure the plaintiff’s partic ipation in the projec t by signing the Final JVA. In my view, that is not the way to read the sentenc e. Rather the referenc e to the Projec t in c onjunc tion with the TJVA was obviously meant as a definition of the term “Projec t” and to indic ate that this definition was the same one as given to that term in the TJVA. 

51     Reading the words to “sec ure the Projec t” as meaning an up front payment whic h was intended to be used to advanc e the Projec t would also be c onsistent with the same words as used in the MOU. Clause 1.1 of the MOU stated that “the parties shall negotiate with one another in good faith ... to sec ure a projec t ....” The words “sec ure the projec t” also appear in c lause 1.2 of the MOU. The defendant agreed in c ourt that the purpose of the MOU was for Prime and KTR to work together “to get the Projec t going”. He argued that in the c ontext of the MOU the phrase “to sec ure the projec t” in c lauses 1.1 and 1.2 meant “to get the Projec t going”. Later, under c ross examination, the defendant used the phrases “to get the Projec t going”, “to move the Projec t” and “to sec ure the Projec t” interc hangeably. 

52     It is also important to have regard to the fac t that the payment was desc ribed as an “upfront” payment. The defendant had agreed in c ourt that under the terms of the TJVA, the parties were not obliged to fund the Projec t pending the exec ution of the Final JVA and, at that time, the parties knew that it might take some time for the JV Company to be set up in Indonesia. He also agreed that pending the setting up and c apitalisation of the JV Company, there were various expenses whic h were needed to get the Projec t going and neither Prime nor KTR was going to fund the Projec t in this interim period. He also agreed that nevertheless all parties wanted the Projec t to be funded pending the exec ution of the Final JVA in order to advanc e the Projec t expeditiously. The defendant had brought the plaintiff into the Projec t basic ally as a sourc e of funding but knew that no obligation to fund arose before the signing of the Final JVA. The foregoing bac kground makes it probable that the US$1 million payment was not intended as a sign-on fee but was a payment made pending the formation and c apitalisation of the JV Company to provide funds to meet various expenses required to get the Projec t going. These c irc umstanc es are also c onsistent with Tan Sri Mohan’s evidenc e regarding the funding needed for the data pac k. 

53     Additionally, the defendant c ould not produc e any doc umentary support for his c ase that Prime was entitled to a sign-on fee. The defendant’s story was that this fee was disc ussed in Perth at the same time as the terms of the Heads of Agreement were. It is surprising that referenc e to the fee was not inc luded in the Heads of Agreement. That doc ument was produc ed by Mr Humphrys who had no diffic ulty with reduc ing the terms of the Heads of Agreement into writing. There was no ac c eptable explanation as to why he c ould not have done the same had it been agreed in Perth that Prime would be paid a sign-on fee onc e the Final JVA was signed. The defendant said that writing was not nec essary bec ause he trusted Tan Sri Mohan. This was not a viable explanation sinc e the Heads of Agreement was put into writing. The defendant’s explanation for that was that it was Tan Sri Mohan who had wanted to doc ument that agreement but, even if that was so, given that Tan Sri Mohan had wanted something in writing, it would only have been sensible for the defendant to ensure that the writing was c omplete and reflec ted all that was agreed. Sinc e the writing was drafted by Mr Humphrys, there would have been no diffic ulty in the defendant giving him instruc tions to inc lude this term before the doc ument was given to Tan Sri Mohan for approval. 

54     The defendant alleged that before the JV Company was formed, it was nec essary to sec ure the plaintiff’s involvement in the Projec t and that this was to be ac hieved by Prime paying US$600,000 to the two parties c onnec ted to KTR. He also c onsidered that it was noteworthy that both Tan Sri Mohan and Mr Navaratnam knew that money was going to be paid to Indonesian parties. However, in 


c ross-examination, when asked if there were expenses that were needed to get the Projec t going until the JV Company had been set up and c apitalised, the defendant only mentioned the expenses relating to the setting up of the JV Company itself. He did not mention that he needed to pay US$600,000 to KTR personnel for this purpose. Whilst the plaintiff’s representative may have known that payments were being made to Indonesians, Tan Sri Mohan’s evidenc e was that as far as he was aware, what he was told was that the funding was required bec ause the Indonesians had asked for an up front payment of US$1 million to purc hase a data pac k from BP Migas and that the payment would have to be c hannelled through KTR. Under c ross-examination, Tan Sri Mohan maintained that this funding provided by the plaintiff was for the purpose of ac quiring information for the Projec t, and in this respec t his evidenc e was c orroborated by Mr Navaratnam. Additionally, there was evidenc e that Asian Oil Company subsequently asked for the same data pac k and some indic ation that some data c ould be purc hased from Pertamina. Tan Sri Mohan also testified that the plaintiff would not have paid a sign-on fee of US$1 million before the plaintiff knew what the terms of the Final JVA were. It follows from this that the plaintiff would also have not have paid the US$600,000 to sec ure KTR’s exec ution of the Final JVA before it knew the terms of this doc ument. 

55     A c ontemporaneous indic ation of the state of mind of the plaintiff is obtained from a note of meeting taken by Mr Navaratnam on 3 August 2005. It was written shortly after he, Tan Sri Mohan and Dato Pang met with the defendant in the Four Seasons Hotel in Singapore to disc uss the up front payment. Ac c ording to the note, Mr Navaratnam himself led the negotiations on the basis of the fac t that the plaintiff’s board wanted to mitigate risks by injec ting US$500,000 to the Indonesians direc tly and asking them to ac knowledge this payment as well as to c onsider it as a deposit if the deal did not go through for regulatory or lic ensing issues or the Projec t was not financ ially feasible. The balanc e US$500,000 would be paid if and when the operator was found for the Projec t. Mr Navaratnam noted that the defendant rejec ted the suggestion c ompletely and in the end the US$1 million was paid to Prime with an ac knowledgement of rec eipt of the fund. It was c lear that the plaintiff was not c onsidering making a non-refundable payment but wanted the money to be used for the Projec t and that was why it wanted an ac knowledgement direc tly from the Indonesians. Further, those minute do not refer to the payment being a sign-on fee. It was also Mr Navaratnam’s testimony that the payment was to be used to obtain c ertain information on the Projec t via the relevant payments to c ertain parties. Mr Navaratnam’s c redibility was not impugned during c ross-examination. 

56     It is also worth noting that when both the plaintiff and its solic itors by different letters demanded repayment of the upfront fee after Prime pulled out of the Projec t, neither Prime nor the defendant immediately rejec ted suc h demands on the basis that the payment was not an advanc e but a sign-on fee whic h Prime was entitled to keep. 

57     Having c onsidered the evidenc e as a whole, I am satisfied that the plaintiff’s version is, on the balanc e of probabilities, the c orrec t one and that the US$1 million was paid to Prime for it to be used to advanc e the Projec t and not simply as a sign-on fee whic h was due bec ause KTR had signed the TJVA or was more or less c ommitted to signing the Final JVA. I therefore ac c ept the plaintiff’s submission that when the money was in the defendant’s possession, he was aware that the US$1 million was only to be used to advanc e the Projec t and that he was not entitled to utilise it for his or Prime’s personal benefit. As the extrac ts from _Halsbury’s Law of Singapore_ quoted in [34] above make plain, where a rec ipient of money ac c epts that money with knowledge of the c irc umstanc es whic h make the money, in law, trust money, the rec ipient will bec ome a c onstruc tive trustee of the money. In this c ase, if the money had been paid to Prime, Prime would have held it on trust to be used to advanc e the Projec t bec ause the money was paid for that spec ific purpose. The money was paid to the defendant as Prime’s agent and on Prime’s authority and therefore, the defendant too bec ame a trustee of the money and was responsible for ensuring that it was only used for the spec ified purpose and no other. The defendant would only be trustee of the money if he knew that it 


was trust money. In this c ase it is not nec essary to have a long disc ussion of the defendant’s state of knowledge sinc e it was the defendant who dealt with the plaintiff and KTR on behalf of Prime and therefore was fully aware at all times of the reason for the payment. 

58     Alternatively, sinc e the fee was paid for a spec ific purpose, then when that purpose failed, the c ase of _Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd_ [1970] AC 567 (“ _Quistclose_ ”) is the authority for the proposition that thereafter the balanc e of the money would be held on a resulting trust for the person who had provided the funds for that purpose. 

59     The defendant argued that in law the plaintiff must show he was an agent of the plaintiff before he c ould be made liable as a c onstruc tive trustee. No authority was c ited in support of this proposition. It runs c ounter to the princ iples set out in _Halsbury’s Law of Singapore_ whic h indic ate (see [34]) that where an agent rec eives money belonging to his princ ipal whic h he knows is subjec t to a trust, then he c an bec ome liable himself for breac h of trust if he deals with the money in a way that to his knowledge does not c onform to the requirements of the trust notwithstanding that he has been instruc ted by his princ ipal to deal with it in this way. It is c lear that the princ ipal c onc erned is the rec ipient, not the payer of the funds. In this c ase, the princ ipal would be Prime, the intended rec ipient and owner of the money, and not the plaintiff. Therefore, the defendant’s liability would arise bec ause he was Prime’s agent and should have dealt with the money in ac c ordanc e with the purpose for whic h it was remitted to him on behalf of Prime. 

**_Did the defendant deal with the money in a manner that was inconsistent with the trust?_** 

60     In its c losing submissions relating to this issue, the plaintiff did not assert that the defendant had dealt with the whole sum of US$1 million in a manner that was inc onsistent with the trust. Its submissions were restric ted to two smaller amounts _viz_ the sum of US$350,511.71 and US$50,000. These amounts were made up as follows: 

 (a) the balanc e of US$350,511.71 whic h was standing to the c redit of the defendant’s ac c ount on 14 February 2006 and whic h he subsequently disbursed as follows: 

 i. on 7 Marc h 2006, US$5,000 was sent to an unknown party; 

 ii. on 2 May 2006, US$5,528.49 was sent to a Malaysian firm of solic itors; and 

 iii. on 2 June 2006, US$340,000 was remitted to Prime itself. 

 (b) the sum of US$50,000 c omprised a payment of US$30,000 whic h was paid out by the defendant on 16 August 2005 and a payment of US$20,000 that was made to Pak Sany on 7 Oc tober 2005. 

61     In respec t of the sum of $350,511.71, the plaintiff’s c ase was that when Prime withdrew from the Projec t on 14 February 2006, the Projec t c ame to an end. The Projec t was c onc eived in the c ontemplation that all three parties would work together and therefore onc e one of them withdrew, this tripartite projec t nec essarily ended. Onc e the Projec t ended, the balanc e of the US$1 million whic h was then standing in the defendant’s ac c ount (US$350,511.71) was held by the defendant on a resulting trust for the plaintiff in ac c ordanc e with the princ iples established in the _Quistclose_ c ase. Alternatively, the defendant was obliged to ac c ount to the plaintiff for the sum as a c onstruc tive trustee as he knew that the money was intended to be used to advanc e the Projec t. 

_Did Prime’s withdrawal bring the Project to an end?_ 


62     Before I c an deal with those arguments, I have to c onsider a sub-issue raised by the defendant’s response. The defendant argued that Prime did not breac h the Final JVA by withdrawing. It was Prime’s position that the JV Company had to be formed as soon as possible sinc e it was to be the prime mover of the Projec t. Prime understood that the JV Company was needed in order to get a tec hnic al operator on board and to go ahead with regulatory approvals. The failure of KTR to set up the JV Company and the failure of the plaintiff to fund the JV Company c oupled with the plaintiff’s intention to get a tec hnic al operator on board without that c ompany being inc orporated were the reasons why Prime pulled out. Prime was justified in pulling out in view of the breac hes of c ontrac t on the part of the plaintiff and KTR. However, even if the pulling out was not justified, no loss arose from Prime’s withdrawal. Its withdrawal removed the obstac les to the signing of a letter of intent with Asian Oil Company and permitted the plaintiff and KTR to c ontinue with the Projec t. The c orrespondenc e showed that they did c ontinue and the Projec t only foundered in May 2006 over the lac k of funding by the plaintiff. That was not c aused by Prime. 

63     The first question is on what basis the plaintiff c ould be said to be in breac h due to the fac t that the JV Company had not yet been formed. The defendant’s response was that it was the plaintiff’s duty to fund the JV Company and to c apitalise it and that bec ause the plaintiff did not advanc e the nec essary funds the setting up c ould not take plac e. However, there is nothing in the Final JVA that requires the plaintiff to solely fund the Projec t or solely c apitalise the JV Company. In fac t, s 5.03 (ii) states that eac h of the party has to subsc ribe for the perc entage of shares spec ified against its name in s 1.02. Further, s 9.01 whic h deals with financ ing of the JV Company provides that all financ ing needed by the c ompany in exc ess of the funds whic h the c ompany would generate itself shall be obtained through borrowings from financ ial institutions. 

64     Whilst there was a meeting of the parties on 12 Oc tober 2005 to disc uss the setting up of the JV Company and the initial c apitalisation required, the plaintiff did not agree at that meeting to solely c apitalise the JV Company. Draft minutes of the meeting rec orded that it had been agreed that US$ million would be deposited in the ac c ount of the JV Company and that this US$5 million would be funded by the plaintiff. The plaintiff however, refused to sign those minutes and did not ac c ept that they ac c urately reflec ted the agreement reac hed at the said meeting. On 17 Oc tober 2005, Mr Navaratnam wrote to KTR, making amendments to the minutes and stating that while Pak Sulaiman had mentioned at the meeting that in his view a sum of US$5 million would be required ultimately as the paid-up c apital, what had been agreed was that the extent of this would be c hec ked up on and the ultimate paid-up c apital c ould be paid in progressive stages. This was bec ause there had been a dispute between the representatives of KTR and the plaintiff as to the quantum of the initial paid-up c apital required. Whilst the plaintiff was willing to fund the extent of the paid-up c apital required, it did not agree to pay US$5 million within any partic ular period. The plaintiff’s Indonesian solic itors had informed them that a sum of between US$250,000 and US$500,000 would suffic e. A further meeting was held to disc uss the issue on 15 Dec ember 2005 and at that stage, KTR informed the parties that the JV Company required a minimum c apital of US$500,000 in order to obtain a business lic enc e for mining ac tivities. The partners agreed to look into the matter. It should also be noted that no deadline was provided in the Final JVA for the setting up of the JV Company. Thus, the defendant had no basis to assert that the plaintiff and KTR were in breac h of the Final JVA bec ause the JV Company was not set up by 14 February 2006 or bec ause the plaintiff had not provided funding of US$5 million for the c apitalisation of the JV Company. 

65     In c ourt, in trying to justify Prime’s withdrawal, the defendant laid emphasis on the proposed arrangements with Asian Oil Company. He stated that Prime did not want to sign the proposed letter of intent with Asian Oil Company before the JV Company had been formed. It insisted that the letter be signed by the JV Company itself. Sec ondly, Prime did not wish to stop the other two joint venture partners from proc eeding with the Projec t just bec ause it did not find the c ommerc ial terms of the 


proposed arrangement with Asian Oil Company attrac tive. It therefore withdrew. 

66     As the plaintiff pointed out, there was nothing in the Final JVA whic h prevented the joint venture partners from signing a non-binding letter of intent with Asian Oil Company pending the formation of the JV Company. In fac t the letter of intent was drafted to provide that the eventual c ontrac t would be c onc luded between Asian Oil Company and the JV Company. Sinc e the letter of intent was not to be legally binding, there was no basis on whic h Prime c ould justify not signing it when it was c lear in all the c irc umstanc es that in order for the parties to get Asian Oil Company on board as the tec hnic al operator of the Projec t, they needed to give something in writing to Asian Oil Company to indic ate their intention to work with Asian Oil Company on the Projec t. Thus the proposed signing of the letter of intent did not provide Prime with a legal justific ation to withdraw from the Final JVA. 

67     The fac t that Prime did not wish to stop the other two joint venture partners from proc eeding with the Projec t was not a legally ac c eptable reason for its withdrawal. The Final JVA did not c ontain any opt-out provision and therefore onc e Prime had signed it, it was obliged to observe its c ovenant in s 4.02 (i) to take all nec essary and/or reasonable steps on its part to give full effec t to the provisions of the Final JVA. Taking suc h reasonable steps would not inc lude unilaterally withdrawing from the Final JVA. Further, the fac t that Prime did not find the c ommerc ial terms of the proposed arrangement with Asian Oil Company attrac tive was also not a valid reason for its withdrawal. There was nothing in the Final JVA whic h prohibited the c ommerc ial terms whic h Asian Oil Company wanted and whic h Prime objec ted to. At the material time, Asian Oil Company was the only party with the tec hnic al expertise and financ ial musc le to undertake the Projec t. Whilst Prime had previously introduc ed a different party as the prospec tive operator, this party was not ac c eptable to the plaintiff as it was not willing to provide financ ing for the Projec t. By early 2006, the parties had no viable alternative to Asian Oil Company to fill the position of tec hnic al operator. 

68     Based on the evidenc e, I also ac c ept the plaintiff’s submission that it was Prime’s unreasonable c onduc t in refusing to agree to the letter of intent and its subsequent unilateral withdrawal from the Final JVA that undermined the entire Projec t and brought it to an end. 

_Application of the monies in the defendant’s account_ 

69     Dealing first with the sum US$350,511.71 standing to the c redit of the defendant’s ac c ount on 14 February 2006, the defendant’s evidenc e was that he applied this sum as follows: 

 (a) he remitted US$5,000 to an unknown party on 7 Marc h 2006 (he explained that this sum was used to pay hotel bills); 

 (b) he remitted US$5,528.49 to the firm of Rahman Too and Co on 2 May 2006 in settlement of the legal c osts inc urred by Prime in defending the arbitration proc eedings whic h the plaintiff had c ommenc ed against Prime; and 

 (c ) he remitted US$340,000 to Prime’s ac c ount on 2 June 2006. 

70     Prime was obliged to use the US$350,511.71 in order to sec ure or advanc e the Projec t. The defendant, knowing that, was equally obliged to ensure that the money was used for that purpose and that purpose only. He did not show how the remittanc es listed in [69] above advanc ed the stated purpose. When Prime withdrew from the Final JVA on 14 February 2006, it c ould no longer use the money for the stated purpose. It should therefore have returned the same to the plaintiff and the defendant, as Prime’s agent in possession of the funds, should have ac ted ac c ordingly instead of 


paying out the money to third parties for reasons that had nothing to do with advanc ing the Projec t or paying Prime itself the balanc e. I therefore hold that the defendant ac ted in breac h of trust in making these payments and is responsible to reimburse the plaintiff the sum of US$350,511.71. 

71     Next I turn to the plaintiff’s c laim for a further US$50,000. Its c ase was that the defendant c ommitted a breac h of trust in paying out two sums totalling this amount. The first was the sum of US$30,000. This was paid on 16 August 2005 into the ac c ount of one Yau Mei Ling. In c ourt, the defendant said that Yau Mei Ling was the wife of one Johnny who had introduc ed him to Tan Sri Mohan and that the sum was paid to Johnny as an introduc tion fee. He also said that he knew that Johnny would not be applying the money towards the Projec t. Then on 7 Oc tober 2005, the defendant paid Pak Sany US$20,000. Ac c ording to the defendant, the latter had asked for this additional sum bec ause “he was going to meet up with Migas”. 

72     I agree with the plaintiff’s submission that the payment of US$30,000 to Johnny was a misapplic ation of trust money bec ause the defendant c learly knew that the money would not be applied towards the Projec t. The defendant would therefore be liable to the plaintiff for this sum and I hold that he must repay it. 

73     In relation to the sum of US$20,000 to Pak Sany, the plaintiff argued that it was also a misapplic ation of trust money bec ause there was no indic ation that the defendant had any basis for believing that the money would be applied to advanc e the Projec t. There was simply the defendant’s bare allegation that Pak Sany had asked for the additional sum bec ause he was going to meet BP Migas. Whilst I rec ognise that there was no other evidenc e supporting the purpose of the payment, I do not find this explanation improbable. From the time that Tan Sri Mohan was in Jakarta, he knew that money would have to be paid to the Indonesians for the purpose of ac quiring information and that suc h information was possessed by Pertamina and BP Migas. The first few payments from the upfront fee were made to the Indonesians and the plaintiff had no quarrel with this. I ac c ept that this additional payment whic h was only two months after the first payments were made to the Indonesians and at a time when parties were working on getting the nec essary regulatory approvals was, on the balanc e of probabilities, made for the purpose of advanc ing the Projec t. 

74     I have found that the defendant is liable as trustee to repay the plaintiff the sums of US$350,511.71. This finding is c orrec t whether the trust arose at the moment when the money was paid to the defendant on behalf of Prime or whether it bec ame repayable to the plaintiff on the basis of a resulting trust whic h arose when the purpose for whic h the payment was made failed. As far as the sum of US$30,000 is c onc erned, however, the defendant’s liability to repay this only arises on the basis that from the beginning the fee was rec eived on trust to be applied for a partic ular purpose only. 

75     As far as the balanc e of the fee is c onc erned, _viz_ the sum of US$600,000, the evidenc e was that the defendant paid sums totalling this amount to two offic ers of KTR in early August 2005. At the time the plaintiff knew that payments were to be made to the Indonesians but did not know prec isely how muc h would be paid. Although it appears from the defendant’s evidenc e in c ourt that these payments did not relate to the data pac k from BP Migas, there is insuffic ient evidenc e to establish that these payments were not made for the purpose of sec uring the Projec t and therefore they c annot be rec laimed on the same basis as the sums mentioned in [75]. 

**Claim against the defendant as alter ego of Prime** 

76     The plaintiff had c ontended that if the defendant was not liable as an agent to repay the sum of US$350,511.71 whic h was standing in his ac c ount after the Projec t c ame to an end, he should be 


held liable for Prime’s breac h of trust under the alter ego doc trine. It is not nec essary to c onsider this argument in this c ontext in view of my findings on the defendant’s liability as Prime’s agent. 

77     The plaintiff had a further c laim against the defendant on the basis that he was Prime’s alter ego. It argued that in the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, it would be appropriate for the c ourt to pierc e Prime’s c orporate veil and hold the defendant personally liable for Prime’s final repudiation of the Final JVA. It was the defendant who personally steered Prime to repudiate the Final JVA. As the alter ego of an AUD $2 c ompany, who was answerable to no one else and who used Prime as he wished, the defendant c ould not make Prime a shield for himself and seek to avoid the damages suffered by the plaintiff on ac c ount of Prime’s repudiation of c ontrac t. 

78     I c annot ac c ept that submission. The separate legal personality of a c ompany was established more than a hundred years ago in the famous c ase of _Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd_ [1897] AC 22. Following that c ase, it is an ac c epted princ iple of law that, as stated in _Mayson, French & Ryan on Company Law_ (Stephen W Mayson et al, Blac kstone Press, 18th ed, 2001] at p 145: 

 Persons are entitled to inc orporate c ompanies for the purpose of separating their business affairs from their personal affairs or for the purpose of separating the affairs of one part of a business from another part. In doing so they are relying on the separate personalities of the c ompanies they inc orporate and this separate personality is respec ted by the c ourts, even if it is to the detriment of the inc orporators. 

79     It is c orrec t that from time to time the c ourts have ignored the c orporate separate personality c laim and have asc ribed the c ompanies’ rights and/or liabilities to another person. This has been referred to as lifting or pierc ing the c orporate veil but there are only limited c irc umstanc es in whic h this c ourse c an be taken. In the c ase of _Adams v Cape Industries Plc_ [1990] Ch 433, the English Court of Appeal said at p 536: 

 ... save in c ases whic h turn on the wording of partic ular statues or c ontrac ts, the c ourt is not free to disregard the princ iple of Salomon v A Salomon and Co. Ltd ... merely bec ause it c onsiders that justic e so requires. 

As the defendant submitted, the general proposition in law is that parties are entitled to protec t themselves by c reating c ompanies even if these are effec tively one man c ompanies and that those dealing with suc h c ompanies c an protec t themselves by requiring personal guarantees from the party who runs the c ompanies as noted by Toulson J in his judgment in _The Rialto_ (No 2) [1998] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 322 at 329. 

80     In _Win Line (UK) Ltd v Masterpart (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2000] 2 SLR 98</span>, following the princ iples established in _The Rialto_ , I held that the c ourts would pierc e the c orporate veil where it was merely a devic e, faç ade or sham. In this c onnec tion, a sham referred to ac ts done or exec uted by parties to the sham that were intended by them to give to third parties the appearanc e of c reating between the partic ipating parties legal rights and obligations whic h were different from the ac tual rights and obligations whic h the partic ipating parties intended to c reate. 

81     In this c ase, all parties knew that the defendant was the c ontrolling mind behind Prime. They also knew that they were c ontrac ting with Prime and not the defendant. Prime had an offic e in Perth. It operated its own bank ac c ount, its own assets, telephone line, fax line and letterheads. As the defendant submitted, the mere fac t that he held all the shares in Prime would not make him liable for Prime’s debts. There was no assertion of any impropriety in the defendant or Prime’s dealings and Prime had not been used by the defendant to further any improper purpose. Prime’s venture with the 


plaintiff and KTR was a _bona fide_ c ommerc ial transac tion. Thus there was no evidenc e that Prime had been c reated as a sham or a faç ade to shield the defendant from responsibility for nefarious transac tions. No false pic ture was presented to KTR in its dealings with Prime or with the defendant as the representative of Prime. In these c irc umstanc es, whilst the plaintiff might have been aggrieved that its c ontrac tual rec ourse was only against Prime, a c ompany with few assets, I c annot simply on the basis that the defendant as the only direc tor of Prime was instrumental in Prime’s breac h of c ontrac t hold him personally liable for that breac h. 

**Conclusion** 

82     For the reasons given above, there will be judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant for the following: 

 (a) US$350,511.71; 

 (b) US$30,000; 

 (c ) interest from the date of the writ; and 

 (d) c osts. C opyright © Government of Singapore.
