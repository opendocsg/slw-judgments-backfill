1       The defendants are manufac turers of mac hine tools and jigs. They leased a piec e of land from the plaintiffs at Ang Mo Kio Industrial Park Street 63, hereinafter to be referred to as ‘Plot 1’. The lease was for 30 years with an option to extend for another 30 years. The defendants c onstruc ted a fac tory building on this piec e of land and their business bec ame very suc c essful. It would be useful to desc ribe the loc ation of Plot 1 before proc eeding further with the narrative of the largely undisputed fac ts. As one stands on Street 63 fac ing the defendants’ fac tory, one would see a drainage reserve and another fac tory next to Plot 1 on its left. Behind Plot 1 is a piec e of vac ant land also belonging to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs sub-divided that vac ant land into two lots. The larger of the two shall be referred to as ‘Plot 2’. The sec ond, smaller portion was reserved for a Hindu temple. There is an ac c ess from the smaller portion past the Chinese temple to Street 63. Plot 2 is loc ked in by a drainage reserve on its left (as one fac es it from the defendants’ fac tory), the defendants’ fac tory and part of the Chinese temple anteriorly. The portion reserved for the Hindu temple is on its right. There is a road that runs ac ross the posterior of Plot 2. However, the Land Authority notified the defendants that that road is reserved for the Ministry of Defenc e and is not ac c essible to the defendants. Plot 2 is thus c ompletely land-loc ked with no ostensible ac c ess. 

2       The present dispute between the parties arose in this way. In early 1994 the defendants wrote to the plaintiffs indic ating an interest in leasing Plot 2 from them. By a letter dated 19 November 1996 the plaintiffs offered to lease Plot 2 to the defendants for 21 years with an option to renew for 30 years. It was not disputed that the parties agreed to start with 21 years for the Plot 2 lease so that that lease would tie up neatly with the lease of Plot 1, and the lease for the two plots would thereafter run c onc urrently for 21 years (and an option for a further 30). Plot 2 c onsists of 2,887 square metres of land. The rent was eventually agreed at $216,381.00 per annum payable quarterly. The plaintiffs’ letter of offer is important. The salient parts are reproduc ed as follows:

3       The defendants ac c epted the offer by letter dated 4 Dec ember 1996 and sent their first quarterly c heque on 8 January 1997. It will be seen that on rec ord, the defendants had to c onfirm ac c eptanc e within ten days from 19 November 1996, i.e. by 29 November 1996. They had also to remit payment of the first quarterly rent by 25 Dec ember 1996. The defendants were late on both c ounts but no issue arose from this. The defendants took possession of Plot 2 from 1 January 1997 and paid rent up to 30 June 1997 but had defaulted sinc e 1 July 1997. On 14 April 2000, the plaintiffs’ solic itors wrote to the defendants stating that the c ontrac t had been repudiated and demanded payment of arrears of rent and delivery of vac ant possession. The defendants pleaded frustration of c ontrac t and estoppel as their defenc e. However, only the frustration defenc e was advanc ed with vigour at trial. So far as the defenc e of estoppel was c onc erned, Mr Rai, c ounsel for the defendants, submitted that there was an implied warranty in the c ontrac t that ‘the site c ould be used as an industrial land to build a fac tory’. The defenc e rests on this simple point – that sinc e the defendants were unable to sec ure ac c ess to Plot 2 they c ould not build a fac tory there and, c onsequently, the c ontrac t was at an end by virtue of the doc trine of frustration. 

4       The full pic ture is not so simple. As early as 24 Oc tober 1994, two years before the plaintiffs’ offer of lease, the defendants were already interested in leasing Plot 2, were aware of a problem c onc erning ac c ess to Plot 2. By a letter of that date, Arc hispac e Designs (who were the arc hitec ts for the defendants) wrote to the plaintiffs informing them of a potential problem with ac c ess. Mr Hec tor Chia, the arc hitec t in c harge from Arc hispac e deposed in his affidavit that the plaintiffs replied by letter dated 9 November 1994 that they (the plaintiffs) ‘still insisted on ac c ess from the existing fac tory’. The letter c annot be understood in that way. All it said was, ‘Please forward the sc hematic plan on the proposed new development _and the proposed vehicular flow via the existing building in front_ ’ (my emphasis). Far from an insistenc e from the plaintiffs, it appears to 


be a proposal from Arc hispac e. By letter dated 22 April 1995 the Public Works Department referred to Arc hispac e’s c onsultation with them and set out the PWD’s position very unequivoc ally as follows: 

 ‘This s tre tch o f Yio Chu Ka ng Ro a d is fo r the e xclus ive us e by MINDEF a nd a s s uch yo ur pro po s e d s e co nd a cce s s to be ta ke n fro m this ro a d is no t s uppo rte d.’ 

On 10 July 1995 Arc hispac e wrote to MINDEF asking them to c onsider allowing emergenc y ac c ess through Old Yio Chu Kang Road for the Civil Defenc e fire engines should the need arises. They rec eived a reply dated 19 July 1995 saying that 

 ‘w e a re in no po s itio n to a llo ca te the s ubje ct la nd a nd yo u a re a dvis e d to a ppro a ch La nd Office fo r the a llo ca tio n. The Old Yio Chu Ka ng Ro a d is a ls o s ha re d by o the r us e rs a nd pe rmis s io n fro m P WD is ne ce s s a ry. We a re no t ma na ging the ro a d w hich fa lls o n Sta te la nd.’ 

Arc hispac e then forwarded MINDEF’s letter of 19 July to the plaintiffs. The arc hitec ts told the plaintiffs that they c ould not understand why the Old Yio Chu Kang Road c ould not be used for emergenc y ac c ess when it was ‘shared by others’. 

5       About a year later with nothing signific ant transpiring between the plaintiffs and the defendants in the interim, the plaintiffs wrote to Arc hispac e enquiring whether their c lients (the defendants) were ‘still interested on the additional land’. This letter was dated 5 August 1996 and Arc hispac e replied on the same day to say that the defendants were still interested, and asked for the ‘proc edures and c onditions to sec ure the land so that the lease c ould be finalised’. Arc hispac e’s letter also, inexplic ably, stated that ‘our preliminary disc ussion with MINDEF reveals that the Old Yio Chu Kang Road is ac c essible to the public and c an be used as an ac c ess to the site’. No evidenc e was led to justify this statement. In fac t, to the c ontrary, the only letter from MINDEF was the one they rec eived a year ago denying ac c ess. Arc hispac e wrote a further letter to the plaintiffs dated 21 August 1996 in whic h, among other matters, it stated that the PWD ‘c onfirmed that the Old Yio Chu Kang Road was for the exc lusive use of MINDEF’. They went on to say in their letter that ‘we subsequently wrote to MINDEF to allow emergenc y ac c ess only but was pleasantly surprised that MINDEF approved the ac c ess as it is “shared by other users”.’ This last statement was untrue. MINDEF did not approve ac c ess. Their statement was c lear. They had no authority to grant ac c ess. That lay with the PWD who had expressly refused to grant ac c ess. 

6       On 1 November 1996 the plaintiffs wrote direc tly to the defendants asking if they were still interested in the additional land (‘Plot 2’) with a lease of 21 plus 30 years with effec t from 1 January 1997 at the rate of $74.95. Arc hispac e replied in the affirmative on behalf of the defendants. Henc e, the plaintiffs’ letter of offer dated 9 November 1996 was given to the defendants. The defendants ac c epted the lease on 4 Dec ember 1996 without qualific ation. This is signific ant bec ause two days before that, their arc hitec ts (Arc hispac e) wrote to the Land Transport Authority asking if the LTA would c onfirm that ac c ess c ould be obtained through the Old Yio Chu Kang Road. The LTA wrote on 12 Dec ember 1996 asking to meet Arc hispac e to disc uss the ac c ess question. Arc hispac e only replied on 9 January 1997 asking to meet on 13 or 14 January 1997. Arc hispac e alluded to their meeting with LTA in their letter about two months later (dated 14 Marc h 1997) to the plaintiffs. They said: 

 ‘Altho ugh the is s ue o f w he the r Old Yio Chu Ka ng Ro a d ne xt to the MINDEF ca mp is us a ble by public is “re s o lve d”, w e unde rs ta nd fro m info rma l dis cus s io ns w ith LTA re ce ntly tha t this “ Public C a t 3 Ro a d”, ma y no t be built in the ne a r future .’ 

Several months later, Arc hispac e wrote a letter to the Urban Redevelopment Authority dated 23 May 1997 c onfirming that ‘the proposed future vehic ular traffic entry and exit as shown on Drawing No. 00/ARA is to be removed from the submission set as the Land Transport Authority has no future plans of upgrading the “Old Yio Chu Kang Road” in the near future.’ On 28 August 1997 Arc hispac e 


wrote to the plaintiffs to say that the defendants were “c onc erned” that at the moment, they were liable to pay the rentals for the additional land and were also unable to proc eed with their planned development. 

7       On the fac ts above, Mr Rai made an impassioned submission on behalf of the defendants that the c ontrac t of lease for Plot 2 must be deemed to be frustrated. But what really frustrated it? Mr Rai says that bec ause the authorities had refused them ac c ess through the Old Yio Chu Kang Road Plot 2 had bec ome land-loc ked and totally inac c essible. That, he says, was the frustration. Counsel’s c rutc h was the Reid test in _Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham Urban District Council_ [1956] AC 696, 721, c ited with approval in _Singapore Woodcraft Manufacturing v Mok Ah Sai_ [1978-79] SLR 516, 519 as follows: 

 ‘The que s tio n is w he the r the co ntra ct w hich the y did ma ke is , o n its true co ns tructio n, w ide e no ugh to a pply to the ne w s itua tio n: if it is no t, the n it is a t a n e nd ...’ 

Counsel also relied on _Lim Kim Som v Sheriffa Taiba Bte Abdul Rahman_ [1994] 1 SLR 393. In that c ase, the appellant was served with the 21-day notic e to c omplete the purc hase of land he had c ontrac ted to buy from the respondent. On the same day, a dec laration was made under s 5 of the Land Ac quisition Ac t, Ch 272 whereby the subjec t of the sale was dec lared to be ac quired by the government. The appellant refused to c omplete, pleading frustration. The High Court held that c ompulsory ac quisition was a proc ess and not an ac t and that the vendor is not divested of his title until after the State had taken possession of the land. The Court of Appeal reversed the High Court and held that the c ontrac t had been frustrated. Thean JA held that 

 ‘the pro ce s s o f co mpuls o ry la nd a cquis itio n w hich de facto ha d be gun w ith the s 5 de cla ra tio n ha d cha nge d the na ture o r dura tio n o r the title. The title ha d be co me no lo nge r o ne a s pro vide d in the a gre e me nt – be it a fe e s imple o r in pe rpe tuity – but a de fe ns ible o ne w hich w ithin a s ho rt pe rio d o f time w o uld ve s t in the s ta te a s it did’ ibid. pa ge 413. 

It c an be seen that the fac ts there are very different from the present one. The doc trine of frustration may be stated as a doc trine in c ontrac t law that where an unforeseen c ontingenc y oc c urs after a c ontrac t is made, and is due to neither party’s fault, and thereby rendering the c ontrac t inc apable of performanc e (at least on the part of one of the parties), or performed in a way that was not envisaged by the parties, then the c ontrac t is said to be frustrated and the c ourts will, as far as possible, relieve the parties from further performanc e of the c ontrac t. The doc trine of frustration as understood is naturally, limited by the fac ts of eac h c ase. In the present c ase before me, the alleged c ontingenc y was the inability of the defendants to proc ure ac c ess to the c ontrac t site from the Old Yio Chu Kang Road. This c annot by any c ount be regarded as an unforeseen c ontingenc y. The c onverse is true. It was not only foreseen before the c ontrac t, but it was made c lear to the defendants, at least from an objec tive reading of all the c orrespondenc e disc losed and admitted into evidenc e, that c onsent from the relevant authority (in this c ase the Public Works Department) was required. It was a known problem and one that was known for a long time. But the defendants, through their arc hitec ts, c hose to interpret the c orrespondenc e as evidenc e of c onsent having been granted and represented as suc h to the plaintiffs. 

8       Even though they did not obtain approval, the defendants’ arc hitec ts wrote to the plaintiffs and represented to them that ‘MINDEF approved the ac c ess as [the road] was shared by others’. It is c lear from the c orrespondenc e that this representation was untrue. I find, therefore, that at best, the defendants were happy to juggle two alternatives available to them at that time. The first was to assume the known risk that approval for ac c ess from the Old Yio Chu Kang Road may not be granted, but they hoped that they c ould get the authorities eventually to relent. The danger c ontemplated was that the authorities might not relent. In suc h a c ase, there c an be no frustration of the c ontrac t just bec ause the risk delivers the harm that it had been c arrying. The sec ond option 


the defendants had at that time, was to rebuild his fac tory by amalgamating the old and new sites. However, as c ounsel submitted, the ec onomic situation from 1997 onwards might have rendered this option unviable or imprac tic al. The story of the landloc ked tenant goes some distanc e in evoking sympathy, but it was nonetheless opportunistic ally c onc eived and thus, must be appraised reasonably and with detac hment. 

9       Mr Rai also submitted that we ought to head the ‘reality of the situation’ and take into ac c ount that the lease agreement c arry terms and c onditions whic h stipulated that the defendants as lessees had to c omply with the requirements from all the relevant authorities. Henc e, if any of the relevant requirements c ould not be met owing to no fault of the defendants the c ontrac t of lease must be held to be frustrated. The reality in suc h c ases, whic h is similar to c ases c onc erning the sale and purc hase of real property, is that a lessee or, in the c ase of a sale and purc hase, the purc haser, must protec t himself if he enters into a c ontrac t before verifying whether all the relevant approvals that he requires will in fac t be granted. He does so simply with the standard ‘subjec t to approval’ c lause. No suc h c lause was inserted in the present c ontrac t nor was there any attempt to do so. Mr Rai’s relianc e on c l (C) in the Terms of Lease ‘to c omply with the requirements from all the relevant authorities, e.g. URA, Land Offic e, LTA, CAAS etc ’ as having the same effec t is misplac ed. 

10     Clause (c ) was admittedly part of a sparsely drawn set of c onditions, but one must be reminded that these are c onditions, not c onditions prec edent. Thus a breac h would not render the c ontrac t void in itself. In the c ase of a c ondition, the remedies for breac h may be determined in part by the nature and extent of the breac h, the damage suffered, and any other relevant fac tor suc h as estoppel or waiver in the sense that the innoc ent party may c hoose to proc eed notwithstanding that he had c ome to know, or ought reasonably have known about the breac h. Reading that c lause in c ontext, the reader will naturally assume that if these c onditions are breac hed the c ontrac t will be affec ted. The question is, in what way would a breac h affec t the c ontrac t? Unless expressly stated otherwise, these c onditions must be c omplied with by the party on whom the burden to effec t c omplianc e falls, and that, c onversely, gives the other party suc h remedies for breac h as the law may allow. In the c ontext of the present terms and c onditions, I am of the view that they were addressed to the lessee. There was no evidenc e to suggest that the plaintiff landlord had to satisfy any requirement of any of the suggested relevant authorities. The c orrespondenc e between the plaintiffs and defendants from 1994 to the end of 1997 is replete with indic ations that the defendants had to obtain a number of c learanc es from suc h named authorities. They are standard terms in lease agreements. That being the c ase, the terms and c onditions c annot reasonably be read to mean that if any of them had not been satisfied the defendants were entitled to treat the c ontrac t as at an end and walk away from it. It is not that simple. If the duty or burden falls on the defendants then they c annot rely on their own failure to avoid the c ontrac t. Furthermore, if the defendants’ interpretation is right, then the established prac tic e of inserting a ‘subjec t to approval’ c lause by the purc haser or tenant will bec ome virtually redundant bec ause in most (if not all) suc h c ontrac ts, the vendor or landlord would have inserted c onditions similar to the ones found in the present c ase. The purc haser or tenant would then be plac ed in a more favourable position at the expense of the vendor or landlord. In other words, if the defendants’ relianc e on c l (c ) is c orrec t, then (without a ‘subjec t to approval’ c lause) a failure to c omply with any statutory requirement suc h as the failure to install a fire exit would entitle the defendants to avoid the c ontrac t. The same set of terms (c l (c )) c annot be interpreted one way for some requirements and another for others. 

11     The argument for an implied warranty must be rejec ted bec ause the c orrespondenc e shows that it was the defendants who were giving the plaintiffs the impression that there would be no diffic ulty getting ac c ess from the Old Yio Chu Kang Road. But more fundamentally, if the warranty to be implied was that the defendant would be able to build a fac tory on Plot 2, then it c annot be said that there had been a breac h bec ause there was no evidenc e that a fac tory c ould not be built there. On the c ontrary, from the evidenc e it appeared that it c ould have. The problem was really 


one of ac c ess. However, the evidenc e also does not justify an implied warranty that a fac tory c ould be built on Plot 2 ‘ _with access to the Old Yio Chu Kang Road_ ’. This is so partly bec ause there was a real possibility that ac c ess c ould be gained from Ang Mo Kio Street 63 either through the side of the defendants’ then existing building, or through a rec onstruc tion of the existing building. Indeed, even up to 17 Dec ember 1997 it will be seen from the letters of Arc hispac e, that the c onstruc tion of a fac tory at Plot 2 was to be c arried out simultaneously with the rec onstruc tion of the existing building. Their letter of 17 Dec ember 1997 to the URA has the heading: 

 ‘P RO P O SED EREC TIO N O F A 6-STO REY LIGHT INDUSTRIAL FAC TO RY AND P RO P O SED ADDITIO NS AND ALTERATIO NS TO EXISTING 3-STO REY LIGHT INDUSTRIAL FAC TO RY O N LO TS 12820, 13062 P T MK 18 AT 10 ANG MO KIO STREET 63’ 

and a text that says – 

 ‘... 

 As dis cus s e d, w e ha ve to info rm yo u tha t the pre vio us ly a ppro ve d pla ns unde r No tice o f Gra nt o f Writte n Pe rmis s io n De cis io n No. P300497-31F2 da te d 10 July 1997 w ill be re o rie nte d w ith ma jo r a lte ra tio ns due to the cha nge in ve hicula r a cce s s.

 ...’ 

Therefore, any implied warranty would have to be in terms that a fac tory c ould be built on Plot 2 with ac c ess to the Old Yio Chu Kang Road or Ang Mo Kio Street 63. But it would not be reasonable to imply a warranty in suc h wide and malleable terms when the party to whom that implied term would aid was at the material time, fully and totally aware of the nature and extent of the lac k of ac c ess to Plot 2. On the fac ts, by reason of the c onc urrent leases held by the defendants, the defendants were in a position to rebuild their fac tory with ac c ess from Street 63. To say now that it would be too c ostly to do so does not detrac t from the evidenc e that it was a distinc t prospec t or reasonable possibility in 1996, when the defendants’ business was expanding. I should emphasize that if the problem of ac c ess was not apparent to the defendants prior to the c ontrac t, they might have a reasonably strong c ase to avoid the c ontrac t on the ground that no reasonable tenant c an be expec ted to rent property without at least an implied warranty from the landlord that there must be some means of ac c ess to the property. The c ase before me was, however, not pleaded or fought on that basis and the fac ts were very different. The defendants who raised the defenc e of frustration had not satisfied me that the lac k of ac c ess – whether via the Old Yio Chu Kang Road or Ang Mo Kio Street 63 – was unforeseen at the time of the c ontrac t. But, more importantly, the defendants were, on the other hand, aware of the risk. By assuming that risk, they c an neither now rely on frustration or an implied warranty of ac c ess. An implied warranty works only when something so obvious (to the ‘offic ious bystander’) was overlooked by the parties at the time of c ontrac t. Given these c irc umstanc es, I am unable to find that there would be any implied warranty. 

For the reasons above, there will be judgment for the plaintiffs exc ept prayers 4 and 5 of the statement of c laim.
