Kan Ting Chiu J: 

1       This ac tion arose from the antipathy between two direc tor-shareholders of a c ompany. One of them obtained the leave of c ourt to c ommenc e proc eedings in the name of the c ompany against the other for breac hes of direc tors’ duties. There are other defendants and issues in the ac tion, but they are sec ondary and c onsequential to the issue between those two adversaries. 

2       I will refer to the c ompanies and persons involved in the dispute, and the c laims. 

**International Connex Holdings Pte Ltd, the plaintiff** 

3       International Connex Holdings Pte Ltd (“ICH”) was inc orporated in Singapore in 1968 under its original name International Polymers Pte Ltd. Two persons, Tan Eng Toh (“TET”) and Chen Chiang Su (“CCS”) built up the c ompany in its early days, and they and their families effec tively ran and own the c ompany. In 1979, TET’s son Chan Shing On (“CSO”), the first defendant, and CCS’s son Tan Koh Young (“TKY”), were appointed direc tors of the c ompany. TET and CCS have passed away in 2003, and TKY and CSO are the dominant members of their respec tive families in the c ompany. 

4       At the present time, the board of four direc tors of ICH is filled by the c hildren of TET and CCS. Two direc tors, namely CSO and his sister Tan Suat Yanh (“TSY”), the sec ond defendant, are the c hildren of TET. Two other direc tors, TKY and his sister, are the c hildren of CCS. TKY and CSO were more ac tively engaged in the c ompany than their respec tive siblings. There were differenc es over the running of the c ompany, as a result of whic h TKY stopped going to ICH’s offic e from 1998 exc ept to c hair meetings of the c ompany’s board of direc tors, and did not play an ac tive part in the affairs of the c ompany. In September 2001, he even proposed to wind up the c ompany, but that was not taken up. 

5       On 24 September 2004, a resolution was passed at an Extraordinary General Meeting of ICH to remove TKY as a direc tor of the c ompany. TKY obtained an order of c ourt on 9 November 2004 that 


the resolution was not to be ac ted on pending the trial of this ac tion. On 17 May 2005, he obtained leave in OS No 1245 of 2004 to c ommenc e proc eedings against the defendants in the originating summons, inc luding CSO, Tan Suat Yanh as the Administrator of the Estate of Tan Eng Toh, Dec eased, and Wealth Resourc es Enterprises Ltd (“WRE”). 

**Weifang Fuyuan Turbochargers Co Ltd (“WFT”)** 

6       In 1993, ICH, on the rec ommendation of CSO, made an investment in a joint venture in Weifang, China, to manufac ture turboc hargers. The resultant joint venture c ompany was named Weifang Fuyuan Turboc hargers Co Ltd. 

7       The original shareholders of WF T were ICH and two Chinese entities, namely Weifang Huaxing Mac hinery Group Co and Dingming Investments Co Ltd, with ICH as the largest shareholder. 

**Tan Koh Young** 

8       TKY was appointed c hairman of WF T. He did not play an ac tive role in the affairs of WF T. By his own ac c ount, he had no involvement in the running of the c ompany, while CSO was c losely involved in its management. 

9       WF T is a c ommerc ial suc c ess and ICH’s investment in WF T is now its most valuable asset. In 2001, there was a proposal for WF T to raise RMB 10m in c apital to inc rease and improve its produc tion c apac ity. WF T’s board held a meeting in Singapore on 17 August2001 to disc uss the matter with several direc tors c oming from China. In the c ourse of the meeting c haired by TKY, a disagreement broke out between him and CSO, and TKY left the meeting abruptly despite pleas from the other direc tors to him to return. The meeting c arried on in his absenc e, and a dec ision was reac hed that RMB10m was to be raised from the existing and new shareholders. 

10     The direc tors of WF T held another meeting on 30 Oc tober 2001 in China to c onfirm the inc rease of c apital and the issuanc e of new shares. TKY did not attend the meeting although he was notified. The meeting c onfirmed that injec tion of RMB 10m from CSO and TET and the staff of WF T into the c ompany’s c apital by the issuanc e of new shares to them. The allotment to CSO and TET was subsequently subsc ribed by WRE, a c ompany c ontrolled by CSO and his siblings. 

11     The direc tors of WF T were unhappy with TKY as c hairman, and dec ided to remove him from offic e. At a board meeting held on 12 January 2002, the direc tors resolved to terminate TKY’s appointment as c hairman in his absenc e, and appointed CSO as c hairman in his plac e. 

**Chan Shing On, the first defendant** 

12     His bac kground and roles in the plaintiff and WRE have been desc ribed in the foregoing paragraphs. He was direc tor and deputy general manager of WF T, and has been the c hairman of the c ompany sinc e TKY’s removal. 

**Tan Suat Yanh, the second defendant** 

13     She is the sister of CSO, and daughter of TET. She bec ame a direc tor of ICH on 20 January 

2004\. TKY ac knowledged that she has a smaller involvement in the matter than CSO and that most of the wrongdoings c omplained of took plac e before her appointment as direc tor. Nevertheless, he felt that she should have taken ac tion on his c omplaints, and that she should not have partic ipated in his removal as direc tor. 


14     There is a serious problem with the proc eedings against her bec ause TKY did not obtain leave of c ourt to sue her _personally_ in ICH’s name. TKY had obtained leave of c ourt to c ommenc e proc eedings against her _as the administrator of TET’s estate._ This defec t goes to the root of this ac tion against her. 

**Wealth Resources Enterprises Ltd, the third defendant** 

15     This is the c ompany whic h was allotted the new shares issued by WF T, and it is owned and c ontrolled by CSO and his siblings. 

**The claims and the defences** 

16     The c laims against the first and sec ond defendants are for breac hes of their duties as direc tors of ICH. The breac hes pleaded relate to four matters, firstly, the dividends alleged to have been dec lared and paid by WF T for the financ ial years 2000 and 2001; sec ondly, the issue of the new shares by WF T; thirdly, CSO’s failure to provide ICH with information on the ac tivities of WF T, and fourthly, CSO and TSY’s partic ipation in the removal of TKY as a direc tor of ICH. 

17     Counsel for ICH went at some length into the princ iples and c ases on the duties of a c ompany direc tor. It was submitted that a direc tor is under a duty: 

 (a) to safeguard and ac t bona fide in the best interests of the c ompany; 

 (b) to ac t honestly and for the proper purposes of the c ompany in relation to its affairs; 

 (c ) not to pursue his own interests and/or ac t to the detriment of the c ompany or the interests of the c ompany; and 

 (d) not to plac e himself in a position where his interests would c onflic t with his duties and the interests of the c ompany; 

and as a direc tor is a trustee of the assets of the c ompany, and he may not: 

 (e) exerc ise his powers for his own benefit or gain without c learly disc losing his interests to and obtaining the nec essary c onsent from the c ompany’s board of direc tors; 

 (f ) enter into engagements in whic h he has, or have a personal interest c onflic ting, or whic h may c onflic t, with the interests of the c ompany; or 

 (g) divert any business opportunity in whic h the c ompany is interested away from the c ompany to himself. 

and if he breac hes these duties, he is liable to ac c ount to the c ompany for any profit he makes. 

18     These are settled princ iples. They apply most c learly in where a person is, in his own right, a direc tor of one c ompany. When a direc tor serves as a direc tor to more than one c ompany, or where a person is nominated by one c ompany to serve on the board of another c ompany, the different duties and interests that arise have to be taken into ac c ount in defining his obligations to the c ompany. 

19     In respec t of the dividend payments, ICH pleaded that WF T had dec lared and paid dividends to its shareholders for the financ ial years 2000 and 2001, but ICH was not informed of the payments and 


did not rec eive them. ICH alleged that CSO had without its authority, agreed that the dividends be kept by WFT as loans, and had not informed it of the loan. 

20     The defenc e was that although WF T dec lared dividends, the c ompany was in need of funds. Its direc tors dec ided to retain the dividends as loans, and also to inc rease the c apital of the c ompany. It was also pleaded that CSO had informed TKY of these matters, and that TKY had not raise any objec tions. ICH’s reply was that TKY was not informed, and that the ac c ounts of ICH did not reflec t the loans of the dividend payments. 

21     ICH also alleged that WF T’s dec ision to inc rease its c apital and to issue new shares was c ontrary to the terms of the joint venture agreement and WF T’s artic les, and that CSO had agreed to them without its knowledge or approval. 

22     TKY stated in his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief that he neither agreed nor disagreed with the proposal, and was of the view that no dec ision c ould be taken until a valuation report of the assets and net worth of WF T, as well as its past ac c ounts, and the basis for the subsc ription of the new shares are available. 

23     The defendants pleaded that WF T’s board disc ussed the proposal at the meeting of 17 August2001 after TKY left the meeting, and had agreed to the issuanc e of the new shares. At a subsequent meeting of the direc tors on 30 Oc tober 2001, it was resolved that a portion of the new shares was to be issued to WRE. 

24     On the third head of c laim, ICH alleged that CSO had failed to provide ICH with information and doc uments regarding WF T and ICH’s shareholding in WF T and the value thereof. The defenc e to that was that TKY, being the c hairman and direc tor of WF T, c ould have obtained information from WF T direc tly, but he did not do that. Nevertheless, CSO had made all reasonable efforts to inform ICH and TKY of all the ongoings of WF T. ICH in its reply stated that TKF had in 2001, 2002 and 2004 written to WFT and CSO for financ ial doc uments and information, but had not rec eived them. 

25     On the removal of TKY as a direc tor, ICH pleaded that the removal TKY as a direc tor of ICH by CSO and TSY was not done honestly or in good faith but with ulterior motives to gain c ontrol of ICH’s board of direc tors and avoid sc rutiny and questions by TKY as a direc tor, and that his removal as a direc tor was not interest of ICH. 

26     The defenc e to that was that the removal of TKY as a direc tor was not done dishonestly or in bad faith but was nec essary bec ause TKY refused to sign the audited ac c ounts of ICH and that resulted in a summons being issued by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) for not filing the ac c ounts. The c ompany’s previous lawyers had advised CSO and TSY to remove TKY as a direc tor, and the matter with the IRAS was resolved after TKY was removed. 

27     Against WRE, ICH alleged that it held the new shares issued to it as its c onstruc tive trustee on the ground that it knew of CSO’s breac hes of duties when the shares were issued. WRE’s defenc e was a general denial. 

**The remedies sought** 

28     ICH seeks to obtain in these proc eedings: 

 (1) Damages; 


 (2) A dec laration that WRE holds the WFT shares as c onstruc tive trustees for ICH; 

 (3) An ac c ount of the profits made by WRE from the WFT shares; 

 (4) An order that WRE, subjec t to payment to it by ICH of the purc hase pric e thereof, transfer to ICH the WF T shares and pay to ICH the profits found to have been made by WRE on the taking of the ac c ount together with interest thereon; 

 (5) An order that CSO provide and hand over to ICH, and do and c onc ur in doing all ac ts and things nec essary to enable ICH to obtain, all the monthly financ ial reports issued by WF T sinc e January 1994; and 

 (6) A dec laration that the resolution passed on 24 September 2004 is null and void and an order that TKY be reinstated as a direc tor of ICH. 

**Evaluation of the evidence** 

29     As this ac tion is filed bec ause of TKY’s dissatisfac tion with the affairs of WF T, it is pertinent to c onsider his ac c ount on the management of the c ompany. He deposed in his affidavit of evidenc e-inc hief: 

30\. Although I was appointed Chairman of WF T, this was a nominal appointment and I had no involvement in the running of WF T. The 1st Defendant was the representative of the Plaintiffs on the Board of Direc tors of WFT and was c losely involved in WFT’s business. 

34\. Pursuant to the understanding between the 1st Defendant and myself, I was not asked to and did not attend any of the Board Meetings or General Meetings of WF T. This was known and ac c epted by the Board from the outset. I did not rec eive any notic es or information regarding suc h meetings until 2001. 

37\. From around 1998, there were a number of disagreements between the CCS family and the     TET family over various issues relating to the Plaintiffs. While the details of these disagreements are not relevant to this c ase, they resulted in a breakdown of the relationship between myself, TET and the 1st Defendant. 

38\. As parties were unable to agree on how to part ways, the assoc iation through the Plaintiffs c ontinued. However, the working atmosphere was no longer c ordial and I stopped going to the offic e of the Plaintiffs around late 1998. Despite this, I c ontinued to perform my duties as a direc tor of the Plaintiffs in other ways. 

30     The narration reveals that TKY and CSO had arrived at an understanding on the division of responsibilities between themselves. Sec ondly, although TKY said that he did not rec eive notic es or information on the meetings of WF T, he did not take ac tion for years. Thirdly, it is not ICH’s c ase that CSO was derelic t in his role in the management of WF T. Fourthly, after the disagreement between TKY and CSO c ame to a head, TKY did not resc ind the understanding and take a more ac tive part in WFT, and he allowed things to c arry on as before. 

**The retained dividends** 

31     On the dividends dec lared for the financ ial year 2001, TKY affirmed that CSO sent him a note in 


January 2001 whic h indic ated that WF T made a profit of RMB 3.85m and dec lared a dividend to be paid to its shareholders, with ICH’s portion to be rolled over as a loan to the c ompany. 

32     TKY deposed that: 

50\. At no time did the Plaintiffs agree to the retention of these dividends by WFT or to grant any loan to WF T. No resolution was ever passed by the Plaintiffs or its Board of Direc tors in respec t thereof neither was it ever raised at a Board Meeting or General Meeting of the Plaintiffs. 

33     TKY must be taken to mean that CSO was not authorised by ICH to agree to the retention of the dividends, and not that ICH had not agreed with the other shareholders of WF T that WF T was to retain the dividends as loans. 

34     CSO’s defenc e is that the board of direc tors of WF T dec ided to retain the dividends bec ause it was in need of funds, and that TKY had been informed on that. CSO also alleged that the dividends were not remitted to ICH for a sec ond reason, that the c ompany’s auditor had advised that it was better for the dividends to remain with WF T pending the resolution of the internal disputes of the c ompany. ICH’s auditor, Siew Tin Gin, however, denies having rendered suc h advic e to CSO. 

**The new shares issued** 

35     By the time WF T’s need for further c apitalisation and the issuanc e of new shares arose, TKY had little interest in WF T. His evidenc e was that he did not have suffic ient information to dec ide whether to support or rejec t the proposal. After leaving the meeting of 17 August2001, he did not enquire of ICH or CSO whether it was agreed that new shares were to be issued, and to whom they were to be issued. It was not c ontended that the shares allotted to WRE should be reserved for ICH instead. As TKY was of the view that ICH was not in a financ ial position to take up new shares without further c apital injec tions by its shareholders and as he had during that period proposed that the c ompany be wound up, he c annot c omplain that CSO did not c ommit ICH to subsc ribe for the new shares. TKY did not show that by supporting the proposal to issue the new shares and the allotment of some of the new shares to WRE, CSO ac ted against the interests of ICH. 

**My assessment of the evidence** 

36     After reading the affidavits of evidenc e-in-c hief, observing and hearing TKY and CSO while they were in the witness box, I am drawn to the c onc lusion that the underlying problem is more personal than legal. 

37     While their fathers had been able to work together effec tively, it is c lear that TKY and CSO do not get along, although they are both experienc ed businessmen. 

38     From the evidenc e, I find that while CSO was diligent in attending to the affairs of WF T, his c onduc t was not beyond reproac h as he has been less attentive in reporting to and seeking approval from ICH on his and WFT’s ac tivities. 

39     Having said that, I will deal with eac h of ICH’s c omplaints. First, there are the dividends for the financ ial years 2000 and 2001. (Those were the years referred to in the statement of c laim. ICH’s c ase at the hearing went beyond those two years, but I shall c onfine ICH to its pleaded c ase.) 

40     There is disagreement and unc ertainty whether WF T paid the dividends. There is the note from CSO to TKY whic h stated that WF T made a profit of RMB 3.85m and dec lared a dividend of RMB 1m to 


its shareholders and CSO’s explanation that the dividend was not paid out, and was retained by WF T. This dispute c ould have been resolved quite readily. Any dec laration, payment or retention of dividends by WF T will be regulated by Chinese law. A report by a Chinese lawyer or ac c ountant who has examined the c orporate rec ords and financ ial returns of WF T would have brought c larity on these matters. In the absenc e of suc h evidenc e, it is not prudent for me to make any finding on the fac ts. In any event, there is no evidenc e or allegation that dividends due to ICH have been misappropriated by CSO or WFT. 

41     On the c omplaint over the agreement to raise the c apital of WF T and the issue of new shares to WRE, it must be remembered that these are dec isions of WF T, not of ICH. Though ICH has a say in these matters through its nominee direc tors on the board of WF T, WF T’s direc tors made the dec isions to issue new shares and to offer shares to WRE. 

42     CSO partic ipated in those dec isions in his c apac ity as a direc tor of WF T. At that time, ICH had not c ome to a dec ision whether to support or oppose the proposals. On the other hand, CSO and the Chinese parties were in favour of inc reasing the c ompany’s c apital by issuing new shares. 

43     The allotment of the new shares to WRE was also a dec ision of WF T. When ICH did not take up the allotment it was entitled to, the direc tors were empowered to offer the shares to other parties who were interested. The shares were offered to CSO and TET, and were subsequently taken up by WRE, a c ompany c ontrolled by CSO and his siblings. When an existing shareholder elec ts not to take up its allotment, it is reasonable for the shares to be offered to other parties already involved with the c ompany whic h the direc tors were c omfortable with. WRE was a proper alternative allottee of the new shares. 

44     ICH also argued that under the joint venture agreement on the setting up of WF T, any dec ision on the inc rease of the share c apital required has to be passed unanimously by the direc tors, and made the point that TKY had not agreed to it sinc e TKY was absent and did not vote when those dec isions were taken. Two questions arise from this argument. The first is whether the requirement for unanimity referred to unanimity of the direc tors present and voting, or all the direc tors, inc luding absent direc tors like TKY. TKY exhibited in his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief an opinion from a Chinese lawyer that unanimity meant c onsent by all the direc tors, but the lawyer was not c alled as a witness to justify and defend his opinion, and that diminished its weight. Sec ondly, even assuming that there was a breac h of agreement, that was a breac h c ommitted by the joint venture parties, and not by CSO. 

45     In any event, was CSO duty-bound to oppose the proposals? He was a direc tor of ICH as well as WF T. When he served on the board of direc tors of WF T, he was a nominee of ICH. The duties as a nominee direc tor were examined by the Court of Appeal in _Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd and Another v Justlogin Pte Ltd and Another_ <span class="citation">[2004] 2 SLR 675</span> at [31]: 

 31 [I]t is settled law that every direc tor owes the same responsibility to the c ompany as a whole. It is no different where a direc tor is the nominee of a group of shareholders or c reditors. He should not regard himself as a “watc hdog” for those who put him on the board. A nominee direc tor should exerc ise his judgment in the best interest of the c ompany and should not be bound to ac t in ac c ordanc e with the direc tion or instruc tion of his appointor: see Boulting v Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians [1963] 2 QB 606 at 626. He must not put the appointor’s interests before those of the c ompany: see Scottish Co-operative [[1959] AC 324]. However, the duty is a subjec tive one and it is fulfilled provided it is exerc ised bona fide in the interest of the c ompany and not for any c ollateral purpose. But that is not to say that a nominee direc tor must ac t against the interest of his appointor. A nominee direc tor may take into 


 ac c ount the interest of his appointor if suc h interest does not c onflic t with the interest of the c ompany: see Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd v Zenecon Pte Ltd <span class="citation">[1995] 2 SLR 297</span> at 315, [58]. The c ourt will only interfere if it is of the view that no reasonable direc tor would c onsider the ac tion taken to be in the interest of the c ompany. 

46     ICH’s c ase was that CSO should not have ac ted without the approval of ICH. That did not take into ac c ount CSO’s duties to WF T. CSO had duties towards ICH and WF T, and he had disc harged his duties to both c ompanies when he supported the proposals. 

47     On the c omplaint that CSO had not provided ICH with information and doc uments, the evidenc e showed that CSO was not enthusiastic or metic ulous about reporting to ICH on the affairs of WF T. This might have arisen from the antipathy between him and TKY, or the feeling that TKY should obtain the nec essary information himself sinc e he was the c hairman, but these reasons do not release CSO from his duty to ICH to keep the c ompany informed on the affairs of WFT. 

48     On the final issue of the removal of TKY as a direc tor of ICH, it was not disputed that TKY had refused to signed the audited ac c ounts of the c ompany, and that had resulted in ac tion being taken by the tax authorities. The defenc e was that the termination was effec ted to bring an end to the diffic ulties. When a direc tor refuses to sign the audited ac c ounts of a c ompany, and does nothing to have them rec tified to his satisfac tion, he c annot c omplain of bad faith when he is removed from offic e. 

**Conclusion** 

49     I find that ICH has not proved its c ase in respec t of the dividends, WF T’s issuanc e of the new shares, the allotment of the shares to WRE, and the removal of TKY as a direc tor of ICH, and I dismiss these c laims. 

50     On the remaining c laim, I order CSO to exerc ise his powers as a direc tor to assist ICH to obtain the monthly financ ial reports issued by WFT sinc e January 1994. 

51     ICH will pay CSO and WRE c osts in respec t of all the issues on whic h it had not suc c eeded. TKY shall pay to TSY the c osts as he had instituted the proc eedings in ICH’s name against her in her personal c apac ity without the leave of c ourt. CSO is to pay ICH the c osts relating to the order made in the prec eding paragraph. 

52     A c onc luding c omment may be appropriate, and I hope, helpful. The outc ome of these proc eedings is not likely to satisfy the parties, or to lay the foundation for improved relationship between them. It would be to the advantage to all parties that a buy-out be affec ted on reasonable c ommerc ial terms, and for the parties to go their separate ways.
