## Judgment 

### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

1\. The ac c used is a 36 year old man who pleaded guilty to two c harges of sexual offenc es. The first was a c harge under s 354 of the Penal Code, Ch 224 relating to the use of c riminal forc e to outrage the modesty of a five year old boy. The sec ond was under s 377 of the same Code for having c arnal interc ourse against the order of nature, namely, in this c ase, performing fellatio on the boy. Both offenc es took plac e at the same plac e, same day, same time and on the same vic tim. The offenc es took plac e on 5 June 2001 at 3am in the flat belonging to the boy's parents. The ac c used was a friend of the tenant of the boy's parents. He had gone there to visit the friend and stayed over for the night. He slept in the living room. The boy and his 7-year old sister slept in their own room on a double-dec ker bed where the girl slept on the upper dec k. At 3am the ac c used entered the c hildren's room and the offenc es were c ommitted in the way desc ribed in the statement of fac ts whic h the ac c used admitted as follows: 

 "10. The vic tim was wearing a pair of shorts without any underwear. The ac c used pulled down the shorts to the vic tim's thighs. The ac c used then used his hands to touc h and rub the vic tim's penis. The ac c used told the vic tim he was doing some exerc ise. After a while the ac c used stopped. 

11\. Thereafter the ac c used bent his head down and began to suc k the vic tim's penis. After suc king the penis, the ac c used pulled the vic tim's shorts bac k up and left the bedroom. The vic tim felt pain at his penis." 

2\. The deed was disc overed when the boy's sister awoke and began to c ry when she c ould not find her mother (the family had just taken the c hildren bac k from a holiday c halet where they had been spending a few days holiday). When the ac c used heard the c rying girl he returned to the c hildren's room and brought the girl to her parents' room. The girl's father then brought her bac k to the c hildren's room and there found his son "in a c rouc hing position on his bed". The boy then related what happened to his parents who lodged a polic e report leading to the arrest of the ac c used and the c urrent proc eedings before me. 

3\. The c ase itself is not c omplex, but it posed some important questions as to how the ac c used ought to be sentenc ed. He was c harged on two different c harges arising from the same inc ident. Generally, 


and in princ iple, there is nothing wrong with that if the fac ts indic ate that in the c ourse of a single transac tion distinc tly different offenc es were c ommitted and s 170 of the Criminal Proc edure Code Ch 68 bears this out. 

4\. A c ritic al examination of all the materials inc luding the nature of the offenc e, and the c irc umstanc es of the offender and his vic tim must follow after the presentation of the fac ts and c irc umstanc es of the c ase so that the c ourt, in punishing the offender, neither falls short nor applies in exc ess. The c ourt’s duty c an only be disc harged in the fairest possible way by taking into ac c ount the matters that I have averted to above - however laborious or mundane the effort. I now revert to the present c ase in whic h the ac c used is c harged with two offenc es c ommitted within the same minute. I think that it may be as inappropriate to fill a single c harge with two offenc es suc h that the ac c used does not know whic h it is that he has to meet (a proc edural irregularity known c ommonly as _duplicity_ ) as it is to c reate two c harges from what is essentially a single offenc e. I am not here referring to c ases in whic h multiple different offenc es are c ommitted in the c ourse of a single transac tion (for example, the abduc tion, assault and rape of a vic tim in the c ourse of a kidnapping) in whic h the law provides an adequate means of ensuring that the c rimes are properly dealt with but with c ases suc h as the present whic h appears to be a unitary offenc e. Where the line is to be drawn between these two types of c ases depends on the fac ts and evidenc e in eac h c ase. Where a robber relieves a man of $10 from his left poc ket, and then $10 from his right, should he be c harged on a single c harge of robbing the man of $20 or two c harges of robbery of $10 eac h? Similarly, should a man who beats another a hundred times with a stic k on a single oc c asion be c harged on a single c ount of assault, or a hundred c harges of assault? If it forms part of the same inc ident little distinc tion c an be made to say that the offender paused for breath between eac h blow. That is not to say that the c ourt will ignore the gravity of the c rime. The number of blows and the severity of eac h blow will be c ounted in the assessment of all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase and reflec ted in the severity of the sentenc e, passed in ac c ordanc e with established sentenc ing princ iples. If what was done was in fac t a single offenc e it will be unfair to leave the offender instead, with a rec ord for having c ommit t ed _two_ offenc es, a small matter that no one else may c are about other than the offender himself. Fairness to the offender in this regard does not affec t the punishment he deserves or of justic e to his vic tim. It belongs to that meager portion of the c ase from the situation of the offender that, nevertheless, must not be oc c luded from judic ial reflec tion. 

5\. It is the spec ific fac ts of the c ase that determine whether an ac t is more a unitary offenc e or a multiple one for the purposes of sentenc ing. The unitary nature of the offenc e is apparent where the ac ts are so c losely related in time, motion and spac e. On the fac ts before me, I am of the view that the two ac ts are suffic iently c lose as to c onstitute a unitary offenc e for the purpose of sentenc ing. The two ac ts c omplained of took plac e at virtually the same time (as c an be seen from the c harges). T he part of the vic tim’s body violated by the ac c used is the same. In the c irc umstanc es, in view of what I have stated above, the two c harges ought to be c onsidered as part of a single offenc e for the purposes of sentenc ing. 

6\. The age of the c hild, the sex of the c hild, the manner and duration in whic h the offenc e was c ommitted are further matters to be c onsidered. The resilienc e of a c hild is sometimes overlooked when the tender psyc he of a c hild bec omes the foc al point of c onc ern. These are all matters of fac t upon whic h the c ourt must do its best to apportion, based, of c ourse, on what is known before him, esc hewing spec ulations, and avoiding generalizations as far as possible. In sentenc ing the ac c used on the two c harges that he had pleaded guilty to, I am taking into ac c ount a previous c onvic tion of the ac c used on a c harge for outraging modesty and for whic h he was fined $4,000. There c an be no inc lination towards lenienc y on ac c ount of his being a first offender bec ause he is not, and so a more severe punishment reserved for a repeat offender must be c ontemplated. I am grateful to Mr. Wee for the authorities that he had given me in the c ourse of his mitigation speec h. I am also grateful to the 


DPP Miss Ravneet for her helpful submission on sentenc ing. _Adam bin Darsin v PP_ <span class="citation">[2001] 2 SLR 412</span> is indeed an appropriate c ase to begin c onsideration of sentenc ing in a c ase suc h as the present. I need only bear in mind that in the _Adam_ c ase the ac c used c ommitted a series of offenc es and pleaded guilty to eight with 15 others taken into ac c ount. The vic tims were boys in their teens and therefore muc h older than the vic tim in the present c ase. The Court of Appeal in _Adam_ also reminds us that the overall gravity of the c riminal c onduc t must be taken into ac c ount. The c ourt also laid down the standard of 5 years imprisonment as a starting point for fellatio. Bearing in mind that c riminal c ases always vary bec ause no two offenders nor their vic tims, nor the c irc umstanc es, are alike, any sentenc ing guideline from a superior c ourt must always be regarded as a most important fac tor espec ially in c onnec ting all the broad c lusters of similarities, but must not be taken as an indic ation that having done so, the individual fac ts and c irc umstanc es of the c ase need no longer be studied with the view to either varying upwards or downwards from the norm. In sentenc ing the ac c used the c irc umstanc es and nature of his previous c onvic tion six years ago, and his intoxic ated state in that c ase and this, though of no exc ulpatory value in my view, is, nonetheless, indic ative of an absenc e of a planned _modus operandi_ and have been taken into ac c ount. They are given their due weight, balanc ed against the c irc umstanc es and age of the vic tim. 

7\. In this c ase, in view of the fac t that the c onduc t of the ac c used was enc apsulated within the same inc ident taking no more than a minute apart, and having taken into ac c ount the fac ts inc luding those forming the matrix of the first c harge, I am sentenc ing the ac c used to one day's imprisonment in respec t of the first c harge and 6 years' imprisonment in respec t of the sec ond c harge. The sentenc e of imprisonment in respec t of the first c harge shall run c onc urrently with that of the sec ond c harge and shall c ommenc e with effec t from today. I am not bac kdating the sentenc e in this c ase bec ause I am of the opinion that the 5 months' imprisonment already served should be part of the punishment given the c irc umstanc es of this c ase.
