**Aedit Abdullah JC:** 

1       The applic ants (“the Applic ants”) are trustees of a c haritable trust who dispute their liability imposed by the Commissioner of Stamp Duties (“the Respondent”) for additional buyer’s stamp duty (“ABSD”) c harged on a c onveyanc e of property to them in their c apac ity as trustees. As the statutory provisions stipulate liability for ABSD where the transfer of property is to benefic ial owners who c omprise entities or foreigners, the primary question is whether the benefic ial owners of the subjec t property in our c ase, if at all identifiable, inc luded suc h entities or foreigners. Having c onsidered the arguments, I find in favour of the Applic ants that ABSD is not c hargeable. 

**Statement of the case** 

2       A statement of the c ase was filed under s 40 of the Stamp Duties Ac t (Cap 312, 2006 Rev Ed) (“SDA”), whic h provided the bac kground to this dispute. The statement sought the opinion of the c ourt on whether a sale and purc hase agreement (“SPA”) attrac ted ABSD under s 4(1) read with Art 3( _bf_ ) of the First Sc hedule of the SDA. Under this SPA, Goodwood Residenc e Development Pte Ltd (“the Vendor”) agreed to sell the subjec t property loc ated at 263 Bukit Timah Road #05-09 Singapore 259704 (“the Goodwood Property”) to the Applic ants, who ac ted in their c apac ity as trustees for the Chew How Tec k Foundation (“the Foundation”). 

3       The Foundation is a c harity registered in Singapore with the Commissioner of Charities and was established by Mr Chew Chee Thong (“the Settlor”) in 1994. The c onstituting deed states that the objec ts of the Foundation are: 


 (a) the promotion in Singapore and Malaysia of Medic al Researc h into the c auses and treatment of c anc er and heart disease; 

 (b) the relief of hardship, poverty or distress of persons resident in Singapore or Malaysia; 

 (c ) the furtheranc e of the educ ation of persons resident or whose parents or guardians are resident in Singapore or Malaysia, and who are in need for financ ial assistanc e; and 

 (d) the erec tion of new hospital buildings of any Chinese hospital in Singapore or Malaysia. 

4       The Settlor left a will dated 26 August 1994 (“the Will”) when he passed away. Grant of Probate was issued by the High Court to Chew Hwee Ming and Sat Pal Khattar (c ollec tively “the Exec utors”) on 30 Oc tober 2001. Clause 2 of the Will provided, in respec t of a property loc ated at 37 Chee Hoon Avenue (“the Chee Hoon Property”), as follows: 

 My property known as No. 37 Chee Hoon Avenue, Singapore 1129 shall be made available to my wife ZHAO HUI FANG for her personal use during her lifetime or until she remarries whic hever is earlier. If my wife does not wish to use the said property as her personal residenc e, the said property shall be given to my daughter CHEW HWEE MING for her use during her lifetime and or for the use of any one or more of her c hildren during their lifetime as their personal residenc e. My daughter may in her disc retion at her own c ost improve build rebuild erec t enlarge dec orate or improve the said property with a view to using it as her residenc e. It is my desire however that my daughter does not apply more than Singapore Dollars Two Million ($2,000,000.00) in improving or rebuilding the said property. 

 Provided that when my daughter’s youngest surviving c hild attains the age of thirty (30) years, neither my daughter nor any one of or more of her c hildren wish to use the said property as their personal residenc e, the property may be leased or disposed and any inc ome or the proc eeds thereof shall be paid to the CHEW HOW TECK FOUNDATION (“the FOUNDATION”) a c harity established by a Trust Deed (hereinafter c alled “the Trust Deed”) made on 26th August 1994 between me of the one part, and Zhao Hui Fang, Chew Hwee Ming, Sat Pal Khattar and Jerry Lee Kian Eng (hereinafter c ollec tively c alled “the Trustees”), of the other part. 

5       In 2014, on the applic ation of the Exec utors, the High Court granted an order allowing the Exec utors to sell the Chee Hoon Property and purc hase the Goodwood Property as a substitute (“the Order of Substitution”). The order, whic h was made with c onsent of the Applic ants, provided, _inter alia_ , that: 

 (a) the Exec utors be empowered to sell the Chee Hoon Property at not less than $22.8m, freed from all life and c ontingent life interests set out in the Will; 

 (b) part of the proc eeds be utilised for the purc hase of a unit at the Goodwood residenc e (in whic h the Goodwood Property is loc ated) at a pric e of not more than $6.6m in the name of the Foundation; 

 (c ) the balanc e to be paid to the Foundation subjec t to trusts set out in its c onstituting deed; and 

 (d) Clause 2 of the Will to c ontinue to apply with full forc e and effec t in relation to the Goodwood Property (instead of the Chee Hoon Property) with nec essary modific ations. 


6       The purc hase of the Goodwood Property was also authorised by the Commissioner of Charities by order dated 10 February 2015, _vide_ , Charity Proc eedings Order No 1 of 2015. 

7       The SPA for the purc hase of the Goodwood Property was thereafter exec uted at a purc hase pric e of $6.56m. 

8       In April 2015, the Applic ants sought an adjudic ation of the stamp duties payable on the SPA. _Ad valorem_ stamp duty was some $191,400, whic h the Applic ants duly paid. The SPA was thus stamped on 7 April 2015. However, on 23 April 2015, the Applic ants wrote to the Respondent arguing that ABSD should not be c harged on the SPA. They represented that the Goodwood Property had been purc hased princ ipally for the benefit of Mdm Zhao Hui Fang, the Testator’s wife (“Mdm Zhao”), and that the other persons entitled under the Will did not intend to stay in the said property and were prepared to disc laim, relinquish and renounc e all their rights therein. As suc h, ABSD ought not to be imposed on the SPA as Mdm Zhao was a Singapore c itizen who did not hold any other residential properties in Singapore. Further, after Mdm Zhao’s death or re-marriage, the Foundation would take possession of the Property to further its c haritable objec ts, and the Foundation was not an entity _per se_. 

9       The Respondent, however, replied in November 2015 that the legal and benefic ial interest of the Goodwood Property resided in the Foundation, whic h was an entity, and henc e ABSD of 15% on the purc hase pric e of $6.56m, being $984,000, was payable. 

10     This was disputed by the Applic ants, who maintained, _inter alia_ , that (a) Mdm Zhao had a life interest in the Goodwood Property and not a mere lic enc e to reside, (b) she was Singaporean and did not hold another residential property, (c ) the Foundation was not an entity _per_ se, and (d) the ABSD legislative framework did not c ontemplate the Applic ants’ position suc h that any levy of ABSD on the SPA would be out of its sc ope. 

11     Despite their objec tions, the Applic ants paid under protest, on 22 January 2016, the assessed ABSD of $984,000 and the late payment penalty $2,965, for a total sum of $986,965. By way of letter dated 16 February 2016, the Respondent informed the Applic ants that the assessment of ABSD was maintained on the basis that the benefic ial interest in the Goodwood Property rested in the Foundation. 

12     The Applic ants then filed an appeal under s 40 of the SDA to the High Court on 16 Marc h 2016. Under this proc edure, a c ase is to be stated by the Commissioner of Stamp Duties setting out the question(s) upon whic h the Commissioner’s opinion was required and the dec ision made by him in that regard (s 40(1)). Thereupon, the matter is to be heard by the High Court for its determination of the question(s) submitted. If the Commissioner’s dec ision is c onfirmed, the c ourt may order the applic ant to pay c osts of the appeal to the Commissioner (s 40(5)). If the Commissioner’s dec ision is, however, found to be erroneous, the c ourt shall order the repayment of any exc ess duty, fine and/or penalty paid in c onformity with the erroneous dec ision, with or without c osts (s 40(4)). 

13     The questions stated for determination by the c ourt are: 

 (a) whether the SPA is c hargeable with ABSD under s 4(1) read with Art 3( bf ) of the First Sc hedule of the SDA; and 

 (b) if the SPA is c hargeable with ABSD, the ABSD with whic h the SPA is c hargeable. 

14     As will be elaborated upon below, under s 4(1) read with Art 3( _bf_ )(viii) of the First Sc hedule of 


the SDA, ABSD is c hargeable on an instrument exec uted in Singapore, on or after 12 January 2013, for the sale of residential property “if the grantee, transferee or lessee [of that property], or any of 2 or more joint grantees, transferees or lessees is a foreigner or an entity”. The phrase “grantee, transferee or lessee” is in turn defined under Art 3(2)( _d_ ) , _vis-à-vis_ a trust, as a referenc e to the benefic ial owner of the property. 

**The Applicants’ case** 

15     At the outset, the Applic ants argue that the Foundation is not liable for ABSD on the SPA under Art 3( _bf_ )(viii) of the First Sc hedule for three main reasons: (a) the Foundation is not the benefic ial owner of the Goodwood Property, (b) the Foundation is not an “entity”, and (c ) ABSD is not intended to be imposed on a c haritable purpose trust. 

16     First, as regards the referenc e to benefic ial ownership of the Goodwood Property, the Applic ants argue that while the term “benefic ial owner” is not statutorily defined, Art 3(2)( _d_ ) must refer to a legal personality vested with the equitable interest in the property at the time of exec ution of the sale and purc hase agreement. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) e-tax guide provides some guidanc e but is over-simplistic as it refers to the “intended owner” whic h is not the same in law as a “benefic ial owner”. The various c ases c ited by the Respondent are also not relevant as they relate to foreign tax provisions. 

17     On this approac h, Mdm Zhao holds a life interest under the Will in the Goodwood Property and should be regarded as its benefic ial owner at the time of exec ution of the SPA. ABSD is thus not c hargeable as Mdm Zhao is a Singaporean and does not hold any other residential property. 

18     In any event, the Applic ants argue that the Foundation is not the benefic ial owner of the Goodwood Property. Legal interest in the Goodwood Property is held by the Applic ants in their c apac ity as trustees, but the Foundation, having no institutional form, is inc apable of holding the benefic ial interest. Further, the Foundation is not a benefic iary stipulated under its c onstituting trust deed. As the Foundation is a c haritable purpose trust, it is valid even if there is no c ertainty of objec ts. The Foundation also remains valid even though its funds have been applied to a nonc haritable purpose suc h as the purc hase of the Goodwood Property: s 64 of the Trustees Ac t (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed). 

19     Sec ond, the Applic ants argue that the Foundation does not fall within the definition of “entity” under Art 3(1) of the First Sc hedule of the SDA as the Foundation is simply a c harity established under a trust deed; it has no institutional form and registration as a c harity also does not c lothe it with suc h a form: _Khoo Jeffrey v Life-Bible-Presbyterian Church_ [2011] 3 SLR 500 (“ _Khoo Jeffrey_ ”). 

20     Third, in respec t of the legislative purpose of the ABSD regime, the Applic ants argue that ABSD was not intended to be imposed on c onveyanc es of residential properties to c haritable purpose trusts. This is apparent from a press statement jointly issued by the Ministry of Financ e and the Ministry of National Development on 7 Dec ember 2011 (“the Press Statement”), whic h they c ontend is relevant and admissible under s 9A(3) of the Interpretation Ac t (Cap 1, 1997 Rev Ed) (“IA”). This is also buttressed by the lac k of a spec ific ABSD provision dealing with suc h c haritable purpose trusts in whic h there are no identifiable benefic iaries. 

21     In reply to the Respondent’s alternative submissions that the benefic ial owners of the Goodwood Property are (a) the benefic iaries of the c haritable objec ts, (b) the Applic ants in their c apac ity as trustees, or (c ) the public , the Applic ants submit variously that these arguments are spec ulative as to the Applic ants’ exerc ise of disc retion as trustees, based on distinguishable and 


unpersuasive authorities, and c ontrary to established trust princ iples. They also highlight that the Respondent has departed from its initial position, as explained in the Statement of the Case, that the legal and benefic ial interests in the Goodwood Property rest in the Foundation as an entity _per se_. In reply to the Respondent’s further arguments that the Applic ants as trustees, or the public , c onstitute an “entity”, the Applic ants c ontend that Parliamentary debates show that ABSD was intended to moderate investment demand. The statutory definition of “entity”, _ie_ , a “person who is not an individual”, must ac c ordingly be c onstrued to mean a c orporate person and not any body of persons. 

22     Finally, the Applic ants stress that no other part of Art 3( _bf_ ) of the First Sc hedule of the SDA would apply in the c irc umstanc es. Contrary to the Respondent’s submission, the disapplic ation of the spec ific rule in relation to trusts under Art 3(2)( _d_ ) does not resurrec t any general or alternative rule under Art 3( _bf_ )(viii). Thus, under Art 3(2)( _d_ ), the inquiry remains on the benefic ial owners of the Goodwood Property, if any, and not the “transferees” of the property as suc h. This is bec ause the Arts 3( _bf_ )(viii) and 3(2)( _d_ ) should be read in tandem, and to allow the Respondent’s argument for a fall-bac k general rule (see [31]) would be to open a bac kdoor for it to subjec t c harities to ABSD, c ontrary to Parliamentary intent. 

23     For these reasons, the Applic ants submit that there is no basis for the imposition of ABSD on the SPA, and the Respondent should ac c ordingly refund in full the paid ABSD and late payment penalty. 

**The Respondent’s case** 

24     The Respondent raises three main arguments, framed in the alternative, in support of its position that ABSD is c hargeable on the SPA. 

25     First, it argues that the benefic ial owner of a c haritable purpose trust is determined by referenc e to the objec ts of that c harity. Here, the c onstituting trust deed presc ribes, _inter alia_ , medic al researc h in Singapore and Malaysia as the Foundation’s objec ts. As suc h, the potential persons who would in fac t benefit from the Foundation’s objec ts would more likely than not inc lude entities ( _eg_ , researc h institutes) and foreigners ( _eg_ , Malaysian researc hers) (hereinafter referred to as the “fac tual benefic iaries”). Sinc e there would c onc eivably be at least one benefic ial owner who is an entity or a foreigner on this theory, ABSD of 15% is c hargeable. 

26     Sec ond, the Respondent submits that the Applic ants as trustees of the Foundation are themselves the benefic ial owners of the Goodwood Property. Relianc e was plac ed primarily on Australian authorities for the proposition that where no person c an be identified as entitled to the equitable estate in land, the trustee, despite being trustee, is entitled to the whole estate both legal and equitable. Ac c ordingly, as the Applic ants in their offic ial c apac ity as trustees fall within the statutory definition of “entity” ( _ie_ , a “person who is not an individual”), ABSD is c hargeable. 

27     Third, the Respondent argue that the benefic ial owner of property held under a c haritable purpose trust is “the public ”, c iting in support the public benefit requirement for validity of c haritable trusts, and an ac ademic artic le. As members of the public would inc lude at least an entity or a foreigner, ABSD is c hargeable. 

28     The Respondent raises three further arguments in reply to the Applic ants. First, it submits that, c ontrary to the Applic ants’ submissions, on proper c onstruc tion of the Will, Mdm Zhao only has a personal lic enc e to use, and not a life benefic ial interest in, the Goodwood Property. As suc h, she is not the benefic ial owner of that property, and her c itizenship and ownership of other residential properties are irrelevant c onsiderations. 


29     Sec ondly, the Respondent c larifies that it no longer argues that the Foundation is an entity and _per se_ the benefic ial owner of Goodwood Property. Indeed, it ac knowledges that a trust is a relationship and not a legal person. Rather, its arguments relate to the benefic ial owners of the Goodwood Property, whom it argues to be the fac tual benefic iaries of the c haritable objec ts, the Applic ants as trustees, and/or the public. 

30     Thirdly, the Respondent argues that ABSD was intended to c over c haritable purpose trusts, c iting the same Press Statement as the Applic ants whic h it agrees is admissible as extrinsic evidenc e under s 9A(3) of the IA to aid statutory c onstruc tion. Express referenc e was made to “trusts” in the Press Statement, and there is no spec ific exemption for c haritable purpose trusts under the ABSD regime unlike in other loc al tax legislation. Further, if c haritable purpose trusts are exc luded from the sc ope of ABSD, undesirable disparity would result between c harities inc orporated as trusts, and those c onstituted as uninc orporated assoc iations or c ompanies limited by guarantee. 

31     Finally, the Respondent submits that, even if there is no benefic ial owner to properties held under a c haritable purpose trust, that merely displac es the spec ific rule in Art 3(2)( _d_ ) of the First Sc hedule of the SDA relating to “residential property on trust”. In that event, the general rule under Art 3( _bf_ )(viii) of the First Sc hedule would apply in relation to the profile of the transferees as suc h ( _ie_ , in relation to the Applic ants in their offic ial c apac ity as trustees of the Foundation) to maintain the c hargeability of c onveyanc es to c haritable purpose trusts. 

**The decision** 

32     ABSD is not c hargeable on the SPA. This is bec ause the Goodwood Property is property of a c haritable purpose trust ( _ie_ , the Foundation) under whic h the benefic ial interest of trust assets is suspended. Contrary to the Respondent’s submissions, neither the persons who fac tually benefit from the c haritable objec ts of the Foundation, nor the Applic ants as trustees of the Foundation, nor the public , is the benefic ial owner of property held under a c haritable purpose trust. There being no ac tive or extant benefic ial ownership of the Goodwood Property, there is nothing for ABSD to attac h to under the First Sc hedule of the SDA. 

33     However, c ontrary to the Applic ants’ submission, Mdm Zhao is not the holder of a proprietary life interest in the Goodwood Property under the Will, but rather, a mere personal lic ensee with permission to reside rent-free in the property for her lifetime. Her c itizenship status and property holdings are therefore irrelevant to the c hargeability of ABSD on the SPA. 

**The analysis** 

34     The statutory regime for ABSD will first be laid out, then the following issues will be examined in sequenc e: 

 (a) whether Mdm Zhao has a benefic ial life interest, or a mere personal lic enc e to reside, in the Goodwood Property; 

 (b) who, if anyone, is the benefic ial owner of properties held under a c haritable purpose trust; 

 (c ) whether the benefic ial owner identified in (b) falls within the statutory definitions of “entity” and/or “foreigner”; and 

 (d) whether any other provision in the First Sc hedule of the SDA applies to impose ABSD on the SPA. 


35     For the Respondent’s position to prevail, issues (a), (b) and (c ) must all be answered in its favour. This is bec ause on the Respondent’s primary c ase, in order to warrant the c harging of 15% ABSD on the SPA, the benefic ial owner of the Goodwood Property must be determined, and would inc lude an “entity” or “foreigner”. Alternatively, the Respondent must suc c eed on issue (d). Finally, two misc ellaneous issues will be dealt with at the end of this judgment. 

**_The statutory regime for ABSD_** 

36     ABSD was introduc ed in 2011 as part of a series of measures aimed at moderating rising property pric es in Singapore. The statutory regime for ABSD is c ontained in the following provisions in the SDA. Sec tion 4(1) is the c harging provision in respec t of stamp duties generally: 

4\. —(1) Subjec t to the provisions of this Ac t and any other written law, every instrument mentioned in the First Sc hedule, being an instrument — 

 ( a ) whic h, not having been previously exec uted by any person, is exec uted in Singapore; or 

 ( b ) whic h is exec uted outside Singapore, and relates to any property situated, or to any matter or thing done or to be done, in Singapore, and is rec eived in Singapore, 

 shall be c hargeable with duty of the amount spec ified in that Sc hedule as the proper duty for that instrument. 

37     Sec tion 22(1) extends the ambit of the duty to c over not only ac tual c onveyanc es but also any c ontrac t for suc h c onveyanc e: 

22\. —(1) Every c ontrac t or agreement for the sale of — 

 ( a ) any equitable estate or interest in any property; or 

 ( b ) any estate or interest in any property exc ept property situated outside Singapore, and stoc k or shares, 

 shall be c harged with the same ad valorem duty, payable by the purc haser, as if it were an ac tual c onveyanc e on sale of the estate, interest or property c ontrac ted or agreed to be sold. 

It appears that amendments have been introduc ed in 2017 removing the phrase “and stoc k or shares” in s 22(1)( _b_ ) of the SDA. Those amendments, however, do not c onc ern the present c ase. 

38     The First Sc hedule lists out the instruments c hargeable with stamp duty and the rate payable in respec t of eac h partic ular instrument. Artic le 3 of the First Sc hedule deals with the c onveyanc e, assignment or transfer of immovable property or any interest thereof. In partic ular, Art 3( _bf_ ) provides for ABSD to be imposed on the sale of residential property exec uted on or after 12 January 2013. In this regard, the ABSD rate payable would broadly depend on three fac tors: (a) whether the grantee, transferee or lessee is a Singapore c itizen, Singapore permanent resident, or a foreigner, (b) whether he/she is an individual or an entity, and (c ) the number of properties owned by him/her at the material time. 

39     The present c ase foc uses on Art 3( _bf_ )(viii) of the First Sc hedule, whic h imposes a c harge of 15% ABSD on the total amount of c onsideration of the residential property sought to be c onveyed “if 


the grantee, transferee or lessee, or any of 2 or more joint grantees, transferees or lessees is a foreigner or an entity”. 

40     To this end, Art 3(2)( _d_ ) of the First Sc hedule c larifies that save for limited exc eptions, if the property c onc erned is held on a trust, the phrase “grantee, transferee or lessee” would refer to the benefic ial owner(s) of that property: 

 exc ept where the residential property is to be held as property of a business trust or a c ollec tive investment sc heme or as partnership property, a referenc e to a grantee, transferee or lessee, in a c ase where he is to hold the residential property on trust, is a referenc e to the benefic ial owner; and where there is more than one benefic ial owner (whether or not inc luding the grantee, transferee or lessee himself ), all the benefic ial owners shall be treated as joint grantees, transferees or lessees 

41     Two other definitions in Art 3(1) of the First Sc hedule are material: 

 (a) “Entity” means “a person who is not an individual, and inc ludes an uninc orporated assoc iation, a trustee for a c ollec tive investment sc heme (“CIS”) when ac ting in that c apac ity, a trustee-manager for a business trust when ac ting in that c apac ity and, in a c ase where the property c onveyed, transferred or assigned is to be held as partnership property, the partners of the partnership whether or not any of them is an individual”. 

 (b) “Foreigner” means “an individual who is not a c itizen of Singapore and not a permanent resident of Singapore”. 

42     In essenc e, the relevant rule in the present c ase is that 15% ABSD would be c hargeable if any of the benefic ial owners of the Goodwood Property is a “foreigner” or “entity” as defined. 

**_Mdm Zhao’s interest under the Will_** 

43     The first issue whic h arises for c onsideration is whether Mdm Zhao’s interest in the Goodwood Property under the Will is a proprietary life interest or a mere personal lic enc e to reside. This issue arises as the Applic ants argue that Mdm Zhao has, in her personal c apac ity and on proper c onstruc tion of the Will, at the material time of assessment of ABSD, a proprietary life interest in the Goodwood Property whic h takes priority over all other equitable interests in the same. Thus, no ABSD would be c hargeable on the SPA as Mdm Zhao is a Singapore c itizen and holds no other property in Singapore. Their submission in this regard, if ac c epted, is fatal to the Respondent’s c ase. The Respondent c ounters that Mdm Zhao has only a personal lic enc e to reside in the Goodwood Property, and thus her c itizenship status and property holdings are not relevant. 

_The effect of the Order of Substitution_ 

44     The preliminary issue is whether the Order of Substitution made by the High Court in 2014, allowing the Exec utors to sell the Chee Hoon Property and purc hase the Goodwood Property as a substitute, had any effec t on the nature of Mdm Zhao’s interest under the Will. It did not. While the Order of Substitution referred to the life interest of Mdm Zhao as a proprietary interest, that did not prec lude me from finding otherwise. The Order of Substitution was a c onsent order, c onc erned only with the substitution of one property for another. The nature of the interest held by Mdm Zhao was not in issue. No issue estoppel would thus have arisen, as that requires a c ourt of c ompetent jurisdic tion to have determined a question of fac t or law in the c ourse of the same litigation or other litigation between the same parties ( _The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro_ 


_Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal_ [2015] 5 SLR 1104 (“ _TT International 2015_ ”) at [100]). In this regard, the Respondent was not party to that earlier proc eeding, and no question of fac t or law was ac tually determined there, save only as to the substitution of property, and even that was resolved by c onsent. 

45     No c ause of ac tion estoppel would arise either: this estoppel arises where the existenc e or nonexistenc e of a partic ular c ause of ac tion has already been determined in a previous litigation between the same parties ( _TT International 2015_ at [99]). Again, neither the parties in the earlier proc eedings nor the substantive c laim there (if there c ould even be said to be one) was the same as those in the present dispute. It should be noted that the Applic ants do not ac tually put forward a c ontrary position on estoppel or prec lusion, but rather invite the c ourt to c onstrue the Will as well. 

_Mdm Zhao’s interest in the Goodwood Property_ 

46     Turning to the substantive submissions, I agree with the Respondent that, on a proper c onstruc tion of the Will, Mdm Zhao was a mere lic ensee with a personal right to reside in the Goodwood Property rent-free; the Will c onfers no proprietary or ownership interest on her. Spec ific ally, the legal interest in the property remains vested in the trustees of the Foundation, and, as will be disc ussed, the benefic ial interest is suspended. 

47     Clause 2 of the Will is set out above. For ease of referenc e, the salient portion of that c lause is reproduc ed as follows: 

 My property... shall be made available to [Mdm Zhao] for her personal use during her lifetime or until she remarries whic hever is earlier. If [Mdm Zhao] does not wish to use the said property as her personal residenc e, the said property shall be given to my daughter... for her use during her lifetime and or for the use of any one or more of her c hildren during their lifetime as their personal residenc e... 

48     The c lause then provides that the daughter may, in her disc retion and at her own c ost, improve or build on the property, though the Testator expressed his wish that his daughter should not spend more than $2m doing so. The c lause further provides that if the daughter’s youngest surviving c hild reac hes 30 years, and neither the daughter nor any of the c hildren wishes to use the property as their personal residenc e, the property may then be leased or disposed of, with the proc eeds to be paid to the Foundation. 

49     The issue as to whether Mdm Zhao has a proprietary or personal life interest is one that turns on the Testator’s intention (see Peter Butt, _Land Law_ (Lawbook Co, 6th Ed, 2010) at para 10.06). As the Court of Appeal held in _Foo Jee Seng v Foo Jhee Tuang_ [2012] 4 SLR 33, this intention “must predominantly be derived from the wording of the will itself, although the c irc umstanc es prevailing at the time the will was exec uted may be taken into ac c ount” (at [17]). 

50     The Applic ants highlight the following fac tors in c l 2 of the Will to support their submission that the Testator’s expressed intention is for Mdm Zhao to be given a proprietary life interest: 

 (a) the referenc es to “use” during the lifetime of Mdm Zhao and thereafter the lifetime of their daughter and grandc hildren, suc h use being a referenc e to residenc e and thus nec essitating oc c upation of the property by Mdm Zhao; 

 (b) the reversion of the property to the Foundation only upon the renunc iation of eac h of the 


 life interests of Mdm Zhao, their daughter and grandc hildren; and 

 (c ) the fac t that the Foundation may only lease or dispose of the property, and use any proc eeds deriving therefrom, upon renunc iation of the life interests of Mdm Zhao, their daughter and grandc hildren. 

51     The Applic ants’ submissions are not persuasive in this regard. First, the appearanc e of the word “use” in the Will does not in itself determine the nature of Mdm Zhao’s interest. There is no c onsistent approac h that c an be gleaned from the c ases c ited by either party, and the inquiry must in the end be c ontextual against the partic ular will in issue. Here, it is signific ant that c l 2 does not expressly refer to “life interest”, but rather adopts language suc h as “personal use during her lifetime”, “as her personal residenc e”, “for her use” and “the use of any one or more of her c hildren”. In my view, the foc us of the gift was c learly only on Mdm Zhao’s personal right to reside on the property if she so desired. The salient terms in c l 2 spoke of “personal use”, whic h would appear inc onsistent with Mdm Zhao having any rights of possession, exc lusion or alienation. These are important inc idents of ownership, whic h Mdm Zhao would ordinarily have been entitled to if she had a proprietary life interest. Further, the multiple instanc es at whic h the qualifying phrase “as her personal residenc e” appear emphasise the limited nature of Mdm Zhao’s interest. 

52     Sec ond, the Applic ants’ use of the word “revert” or “reversion” in their submission, suggesting that Mdm Zhao and the family members have proprietary life interests in Goodwood Property, is inc orrec t. Nothing “reverts” to the Foundation on the family’s renunc iation of their interests; rather, the operative term in c l 2 is a direc tion to the Exec utors that the property “shall be made available” to Mdm Zhao and other family members during their lifetimes. Presumably, on renunc iation, remarriage, or death of the family members, the property shall no longer be “made available” to them. There is some authority that the phrase “made available” does not c onfer any proprietary right in the subjec t, but rather grants a mere lic enc e to use as residenc e ( _Morss v Morss_ [1972] 1 All ER 1121 at 11241125). 

53     Third, the Applic ants’ suggestion that the Foundation’s ability to exerc ise proprietary rights _visà-vis_ the trust property ( _eg_ , for lease or disposal) arises only upon the renunc iation or expiration of the family’s rights, if true, may be a relevant fac tor in their favour. However, under the Will, inc ome and proc eeds from the property, even during the lifetime of Mdm Zhao and their c hildren and grandc hildren, ac c rue to the Foundation if, simply, none of the family members wish “to use [the property] as their personal residenc e”. The restric tive phrasing of the interest that is to be renounc ed brings this c ase c loser to _Re Hadjee Yousof_ [1961] 1 MLJ 267, where the High Court found that the testator’s wife and c hildren had a mere personal lic enc e to reside rent-free until the date of distribution, as _inter alia_ , the gift did not c arry with it the right to make any profit. It is also inc ongruous for the testator to have given Mdm Zhao and the family members proprietary interests in the Goodwood Property, and yet have the Will provide expressly for the daughter’s (and no other family member’s) power to renovate the property. This suggests that what was c onferred upon Mdm Zhao was not a proprietary life interest at all. A life interest is a form of an estate in freehold (Robert Megarry & William Wade QC, _The Law of Real Property_ (Charles Harpum, Stuart Bridge & Martin Dixon gen eds) (Sweet & Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2012) at paras 3-004 to 3-007). This is not c hanged in Singapore law: only the _estate in tail_ was statutorily c onverted into an _estate in fee simple_ through s 51 of the Conveyanc ing and Law of Property Ac t (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed). Given that freehold status, no further c ontrol or restric tion on – and no espec ial provision or stipulation as to – the enjoyment of the land would ordinarily be expec ted. 

54     It may be that the Testator’s intent was for the Goodwood Property to be used as a family home for Mdm Zhao and their c hildren, but that does not by itself mean that the family members 


rec eive proprietary rights in the property. On a proper c onstruc tion of the Will, I find that Mdm Zhao was only given a personal lic enc e to reside, as opposed to a proprietary life interest, in the Goodwood Property. 

**_Beneficial ownership of property under a charitable trust_** 

55     The c onsequenc e of Mdm Zhao’s having only a personal lic enc e to reside in the Goodwood Property is that the benefic ial interest _may_ remain elsewhere. Against that bac kdrop, the Respondent’s main c ase for imposing ABSD on the SPA is premised on three alternative arguments: 

 (a) The persons fac tually benefiting from the c haritable work of the Foundation are benefic ial owners of the Goodwood Property. Sinc e there would c onc eivably be at least one entity ( eg , researc h institutes) or foreigner ( eg , Malaysian researc hers) among them, ABSD is c hargeable. Alternatively, these fac tual benefic iaries c onstitute a “body of persons” within the definition of “entity” suc h that ABSD applies. 

 (b) The Applic ants in their c apac ity as trustees are “legal benefic ial owners” of the Goodwood Property. Sinc e they are a “body of persons”, they fall within the definition of an “entity”. ABSD is thus c hargeable. 

 (c ) The public is the benefic ial owner of the Goodwood Property. Sinc e members of the public would inc lude at least an entity or a foreigner, ABSD is c hargeable. Alternatively, the public is a “body of persons” within the definition of “entity” and thus ABSD applies. 

_Law on beneficial ownership of charitable trust property_ 

56     The SDA refers to ownership in Art 3(2)( _d_ ). Ownership as a c onc ept is related to, but not c oterminous with, c onc epts of property, title and interest. The foc us in the present proc eedings is on benefic ial ownership, whic h entails a right that c an be asserted against the world exc ept a _bona fide_ purc haser for value without notic e, rather than only against the trustee. Proprietary inc idents of ownership apply to a benefic ial owner; that is, his interest c an be protec ted from wrongful interferenc e by third parties, and it c an also be alienated, mortgaged, partitioned, devised or bequeathed. The prec ise nature of benefic ial rights and the interplay between legal and benefic ial ownership have not been fully mapped out, but the argument is probably in favour of the position that benefic ial ownership is a right _in rem_ , rather than just _in personam_ against the trustee (see Jamie Glister & James Lee, _Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2015) (“ _Hanbury & Martin_ ”) at paras 1-1018 to 1-1019; Steven Elliott, _Snell’s Equity_ (John Mc Ghee QC gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015) (“ _Snell’s Equity_ ”) at paras 2-001 to 2-004). 

57     For the c reation of a private express trust for persons, there has to be c ertainty of objec ts, in addition to the c ertainties of subjec t matter and intention ( _Guy Neale and others v Nine Squares Pty Ltd_ [2015] 1 SLR 1097 at [51]). The requirement for the three c ertainties is c onnec ted to the ownership of legal and equitable rights under a trust, and serves broadly the purpose of enabling the trustee, or the c ourt in default, to exec ute the trustee’s duties ( _Snell’s Equity_ at para 22-012). In partic ular, c ertainty of objec ts is usually taken to be c onc erned with the identific ation or identifiability of spec ific benefic iaries in order that “a trust c an both be enforc ed against the trustee and c ontrolled by the c ourts” ( _Goi Wang Firn (Ni Wanfen) and others v Chee Kow Ngee Sing (Pte) Ltd_ [2015] 1 SLR 1049 (“ _Goi Wang Firn_ ”) at [27]). However, the three c ertainties do not c onc lusively identify the loc us of ownership. Nor do they apply in the exac t same manner to c haritable purpose trusts, whic h attrac t a different set of requirements both under c ommon law and statute. 


58     A c haritable trust is a trust for purposes, not persons. In a trust for persons, benefic ial ownership of the trust assets would lie with the benefic iaries of that trust, _ie_ , the _cestuis que trust_. That is trite law. In c ontrast, a purpose trust may not have an asc ertainable benefic iary. In _Hongkong Bank Trustee (Singapore) Ltd v Tan Farrer and others_ [1988] 1 SLR(R) 53 (“ _Tan Farrer_ ”), the High Court rec ognised as “a fundamental princ iple of English law that no trust whic h is not a c haritable trust c an be valid if it has no benefic iary” (at [15]), and that the law in Singapore was generally the same (at [16]). Charitable trusts thus fall within a narrow exc eption of trusts that are not subjec t to the requirements of c ertainty of objec ts or the benefic iary princ iple: in essenc e, no benefic iary needs to be identified (see _Koh Lau Keow and others v Attorney-General_ [2013] 4 SLR 491 (“ _Koh Lau Keow (HC)_ ”) at [19]; _Goi Wang Firn_ at [19]; _Hanbury & Martin_ at para 15-003; _Snell’s Equity_ at para 23003; Graham Virgo, _The Principles of Equity and Trusts_ (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2015) (“ _Virgo on Equity_ ”) at 174). As a c orollary, there is simply no identifiable benefic ial ownership under a c haritable purpose trust. The persons who may benefit from a c haritable trust are not, by mere virtue of their rec eipt of fac tual benefits, vested with the benefic ial interest in the trust property. Thus, in the absenc e of statutory guidanc e to the c ontrary, individuals who may fac tually benefit from a c haritable trust do not have standing to enforc e that trust ( _Hanbury & Martin_ at para 15-002; _Hauxwell v Barton-on-Humber UDC_ [1974] 1 Ch 432 at 450 per Brightman J). Rather, in plac e of the c onc epts of benefic ial interest and benefic ial ownership, the foc us _vis-à-vis_ c haritable purpose trusts is on the c ontrol and supervision of the trustees, whic h power is vested in the Commissioner of Charities and the AttorneyGeneral under the Charities Ac t (Cap 37, 2007 Rev Ed) (“Charities Ac t”) and the Government Proc eedings Ac t (Cap 121, 1985 Rev Ed) (see _Goi Wang Firn_ at [46]). 

_Respondent’s submissions on beneficial ownership_ 

59     The Respondent makes three alternative submissions as to the identity of the benefic ial owner of the Goodwood Property, the legal title of whic h is held by the Applic ants in their c apac ity as trustees of the Foundation. If one of these submissions is ac c epted, it will then arise for c onsideration whether the benefic ial owner so identified is a “foreigner” or “entity” within the meaning of Art 3( _bf_ ) (viii) of the First Sc hedule suc h that ABSD applies. These submissions are examined in turn. 

(1) Fac tual benefic iaries of the c harity as benefic ial owners 

60     The Respondent’s first submission is that in a c haritable purpose trust, the benefic ial interest is held by the persons who may fac tually benefit from the c harity’s objec ts and work, whic h in this c ase would c onc eivably inc lude researc h institutes and Malaysian researc hers. The Respondent c ites Geraint Thomas & Alastair Hudson, _The Law of Trusts_ (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2010) (“ _Thomas & Hudson_ ”) for the following passage (at para 6.43): 

 It is arguable that the benefic iaries of a c haritable trust (who c onstitute an apprec iable sec tion of the public ) are indeed the equitable ‘owners’ of the trust property and that a c haritable trust is saved from invalidity, not by the disapplic ation of the benefic iary princ iple, but by the disapplic ation of the rules relating to c ertainty of objec ts and/or the rule against perpetuity. In other words, it c ould be said that the benefic iaries of a c haritable trust, whic h is usually a c ontinuing trust with an open c lass of benefic iaries, are effec tively in the same position as the objec ts of a private disc retionary trust. 

61     I do not ac c ept the Respondent’s submission in this regard. With respec t to the learned authors, it would seem that that quote, invoked by the Respondent as a proposition of authority, was really in the nature of a hypothesis or something to provoke thought about the benefic iary princ iple. The quotation is loc ated in the c onc luding sec tion of a c hapter c onc erned primarily with nonc haritable purpose trusts. In that sec tion, the authors were c onsidering the problem thrown up by 


suc h private purpose trusts – that they lac k benefic iaries, and by a traditional view of the benefic iary princ iple, without a benefic iary there is no trust. Thus, the learned authors foc used their attention on the possible c irc umventing argument that “the fundamental problem of non-c haritable purpose trusts is not one of essential validity but of enforc eability”; if so, then one prac tic al effec t is that an English c ourt may rec ognise a foreign non-c haritable purpose trust in respec t of whic h an enforc er has been appointed ( _Thomas & Hudson_ at paras 6.41-6.42). It is against this c ontext that the authors c onsidered the argument on whether the fac tual benefic iaries of a c haritable trust c an be c onsidered the equitable “owners” of the trust property. In essenc e, the point of the passage was not to equate the fac tual benefic iaries with the benefic ial owners in the proprietary sense, or to examine the true nature of the fac tual benefic iary’s interest in the c haritable trust, but rather to probe the limits and c ontent of the benefic iary princ iple. The Respondent’s selec t quote therefore does not assist him. 

62     Furthermore, it is important to note that the authors themselves plac ed the term “owner” in quotation marks, and subjec ted the Respondent’s selec t quote to a number of qualifiers (see _Thomas & Hudson_ at para 6.43). Indeed, the authors do not appear to be equating _per se_ the fac tual benefic iaries of a c haritable trust with the benefic ial owners in a proprietary sense properly-so-c alled. The text itself rec ognised in a footnote that the rule in _Saunders v Vautier_ (1841) 4 Beav 115 is not applic able to these fac tual benefic iaries – _ie_ , they c annot, even if ac ting together, require the c haritable trustee to transfer the legal interest in the c harity’s property to them and thereby terminate the trust ( _Thomas & Hudson_ at para 6.43 n 144). Furthermore, there is no suggestion that suc h fac tual benefic iaries have rights of alienation or exc lusion against others, lac king thus the c ruc ial hallmarks of ownership. 

63     I note that Professor Hudson also does not appear to c ontinue to support the Respondent’s position in his other text, at where he made a c lear distinc tion between the fac tual benefic iaries of a c haritable trust and the “benefic iaries in the trust law sense” who hold proprietary rights in the trust property (Alastair Hudson, _Equity and Trusts_ (Routledge, 7th Ed, 2012) at para 25.2.1): 

 There are a number of interesting features of the c haritable trust... The triangle of settlortrustee-benefic iary does not apply in the c ase of public trusts suc h as c harities... [T]here is no nexus between trustee and benefic iary prec isely bec ause there are no individual benefic iaries. This is bec ause the AttorneyGeneral sues in plac e of benefic iaries to enforc e the purposes of the c harity against the trustees. While c harities will seek to benefit individuals or groups of people, those people are not benefic iaries in the trust law sense bec ause they do not ac quire proprietary rights in the property held on trust for the c haritable purpose. 

64     In any event, even if Professors Thomas and Hudson had the intent of c lothing the fac tual benefic iaries of a c haritable trust with benefic ial ownership, suc h a proposition is to my mind not supported by law. There would also appear not to be any other c ommentary or text adopting the same approac h. To this end, I find apposite another leading c ommentary highlighting that the fac tual benefic iary’s “benefit” is stric tly inc idental to the objec ts of the c haritable purpose trust ( _Snell’s Equity_ at para 23-001): 

 Identifiable individuals may benefit from these c haritable purposes. However, any benefit they derive as individuals is stric tly inc idental to the main purpose of the trust, whic h is to c onfer a benefit on the public at large or some sec tion of it. 

65     For the foregoing reasons, the Respondent’s submission that those fac tually benefiting from the c harity work of the Foundation are the benefic ial owners of the Goodwood Property c ould not be ac c epted. 


66     Two other observations are due. First, this surprising argument by the Respondent c onfuses the different meanings attac hed to benefic ial ownership and obtaining a fac tual benefit from something. Benefic ial ownership is c onc erned with rights in relation to property. The latter just refers to obtaining some positive impac t from something. A benefic ial owner properly-so-c alled may often also be a fac tual benefic iary, but fac tual benefic iaries are not, nec essarily and by mere virtue of their rec eipt of fac tual benefits, benefic ial owners. Sec ond, it goes against the very c onc ept of a c haritable trust to find that benefic ial ownership is vested in the fac tual benefic iaries of the c harity. If that were the c ase, it should follow that the all the persons fac tually benefiting c ould, if they so desired, get together and dispose of the property that is the subjec t matter of the trust. But that is simply not the law. On the other hand, if the fac tual benefic iaries c ould not dispose of their interest in the c haritable trust or alienate it in some way, then c learly that renders their purported “ownership” meaningless: that is not ownership in any true sense. 

67     In the present c ase, therefore, those fac tually benefiting from the objec ts and work of the Foundation, whether in Singapore or Malaysia, c ould not be regarded as benefic ial owners of the Goodwood Property. 

(2) The trustees of the c harity as “legal benefic ial owners” 

68     The Respondent alternatively argues that the Applic ants in their c apac ity as trustees are entitled to both the legal and benefic ial interests in the trust property and should therefore be treated as benefic ial owners of the Goodwood Property. Relianc e was primarily plac ed on a series of Australian c ases, inc luding _Glenn v Federal Commissioner of Land Tax_ [1915] 20 CLR 490 (“ _Glenn_ ”), _CPT Custodian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue of the State of Victoria_ [2005] 221 ALR 96 (“ _CPT Custodian_ ”) and _Lend Lease Funds Management Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue_ [2009] VSC 360 (“ _Lend Lease Funds_ ”). The Applic ants seek to distinguish these c ases as dealing with different statutory provisions. I agree with the Applic ants that the Respondent’s relianc e on these c ases is misplac ed. 

69     Taking first the c ase of _Glenn_. In that c ase, the appellants were the residuary legatees under a will, taking subjec t to c ertain direc tions by the testator to the trustees to, _inter alia_ , manage the estate to ac c umulate a c ertain sum and thereafter make spec ified payments or provisions out of the estate at spec ified intervals. It was undisputed that at the time of hearing, the ac c umulation had not started and that the appellants had no ac c rued right to any part of the testator’s estate, real or personal (at 495-496). The issue of law stated for the opinion of the c ourt was whether the appellants were liable to be assessed as joint owners in respec t of c ertain lands whic h formed part of that estate. This issue turned on a provision under the Australian Land Tax Assessment Ac t 1910 whic h defined an “owner” as “every person jointly or severally, whether at law or in equity, [who] (a) is entitled to the land for any estate of freehold in possession; or (b) is entitled to rec eive, or in rec eipt of, or if the land were let to a tenant would be entitled to rec eive the rents and profits thereof, whether as benefic ial owner, trustee, mortgage in possession, or otherwise” (at 496). The Federal Commissioner’s argument was that the appellants were entitled to the equitable estates of freehold in possession notwithstanding that they may derive no benefit from the estate for some time. As suc h, they fell within the statutory definition of “owners” and were taxable as joint owners of the land. The appellants c ountered that they had at no time an estate of freehold in possession in the land c onc erned; at best, they had only a c ontingent estate in remainder. 

70     Thus, _Glenn_ was c onc erned with the interpretation of the phrase “estate... in possession” within the statutory definition of “owner” used in the Australian statute. Griffith CJ, delivering the lead judgment, rejec ted the Federal Commissioner’s submissions and c ited an ac ademic text for the proposition that “the person taking under the c onditional limitation or exec utory devise, c annot, while 


the suspense c ontinues, in the proper sense of that word, having any _estate_ , though the event, on whic h it depends, is c ertain of happening” (at 496). Griffith CJ then moved to adopt this position as the proper c onstruc tion of the statutory phrase “estate in possession” (at 497): 

 In my opinion, the term “estate in possession” is used in the Land Tax Assessment Act in the sense explained by [the ac ademic text]. This is not only the natural, but the only just, interpretation that c an be put on the words. For the tax is an annual tax and the “owner” of the land is the person who is in the present enjoyment of the fruits whic h presumably afford the fund from whic h it is to be paid. 

71     It was in this c ontext that Griffith CJ rejec ted the assumption underlying the Federal Commissioner’s submissions – that there must be a distinc t holder in equity of the estate of freehold in possession whenever there was a trustee at law. The partic ular dic tum of Griffith CJ’s, on whic h the Respondent in our c ase relies, reads as follows (at 497): 

 The [Federal Commissioner’s] argument is based on the assumption that whenever the legal estate in land is vested in a trustee there must be some person other than the trustee entitled to it in equity for an estate of freehold in possession, so that the only question to be answered is who is the owner of that equitable estate. In my opinion, there is a prior inquiry, namely, whether there is any suc h person. If there is not, the trustee is entitled to the whole estate in possession, both legal and equitable. 

72     It is notable that the other members of the benc h in _Glenn_ , Isaac s and Ric h JJ, did not expressly c onc ur with Griffith CJ on this point as to the loc ale of the benefic ial interest, and their respec tive judgments were c learly prefac ed as dec isions on the proper c onstruc tion of the phrase “estate in possession” whic h was used in the statutory definition of “owner” (at 500, 507). In fac t, Isaac s J appears to have taken an entirely different approac h from Griffith CJ, preferring instead the view that the various other named individuals in the testator’s will, as well as the appellants, c onstituted c ollec tively the objec ts of the trust and henc e shared in the c omplete equitable interest in the trust property (at 503): 

 Trusts... are equitable obligations to deal with property in a partic ular way. Trustees have no equitable interest; that belongs to the person or persons for whom the benefit is intended... In Pearson v Lane , Sir William Grant makes this plain. He says: “The equitable interest in that estate must have resided somewhere: the trustees themselves c ould not be the benefic ial owners; and, if they were mere trustees, there must have been some cestui que trust. In order to asc ertain who they are, in suc h a c ase a Court of equity inquires, for whose benefit the trust was c reated; and determines, that those, who are the objec ts of the trust, have the interest in the thing, whic h is the subjec t of it.” 

 But it must not be overlooked that the c omplete interest in the thing is shared by all the objec ts of the trust... 

 [internal c itations and quotations omitted] 

73     The Respondent further relied upon _CPT Custodian_ , whic h is a more rec ent c ase endorsing the dic tum of Griffith CJ in _Glenn_. _CPT Custodian_ c onc erned the issue of whether unit holders of a unit trust were liable for land tax under the Land Tax Ac t 1958 (Vic ). Suc h liability attac hed, similarly as it did in _Glenn_ , to the “owner” of any equitable estate or interest in land, whic h was statutorily defined to inc lude a “person entitled to any land for any estate of freehold in possession”. In this c ontext, after quoting Griffith CJ in _Glenn_ , Gleeson CJ writing for a unanimous c ourt said as follows (at [25]


## [26]): 

 That statement was a presc ient rejec tion of a “dogma” that, where ownership is vested in a trustee, equitable ownership must nec essarily be vested in someone else bec ause it is an essential attribute of a trust that it c onfers upon individuals a c omplex of benefic ial legal relations whic h may be c alled ownership... 

 In Glenn , Griffith CJ c onstrued the statutory expression “estate in possession” as denoting “an estate of whic h some person has the present right of enjoyment”, saying that land tax being an annual tax, “the ‘owner’ of the land is the person who is in the present enjoyment of the fruits whic h presumably afford the fund from whic h it is to be paid”... 

74     From the c ontext of _CPT Custodian_ , Gleeson CJ c learly took the view that _Glenn_ was c onc erned with the c onstruc tion of the terms used in the Australian statutes, namely “estate in possession” and “owner”, whic h appeared in both the Land Tax Ac t and the Land Tax Assessment Ac t. The Australian c ourts took the view, broadly speaking, that this phrase referred to the person who has the present benefit of the funds from whic h tax is to be paid. In applying this interpretation, traditional equitable propositions were not taken to be material in the fac e of the statutory language. Instead, _Glenn_ and _CPT Custodian_ were foc used on the c onstruc tion of the terms in the partic ular trust and the partic ular statute in those c ases, whic h held sway over the traditional c onc epts of equity as suc h. This was made c lear by a long introduc tory passage of the dec ision in _CPT Custodian_ , the salient parts of whic h are reproduc ed as follows: 

 [14] Something now should be said respec ting the task of statutory c onstruc tion whic h was presented to Nettle J and then to the Court of Appeal. There were two steps to be taken... The first step was to asc ertain the terms of the trusts upon whic h the relevant lands were held. The sec ond was to c onstrue the statutory definition to asc ertain whether the rights of the taxpayers under those trusts fell within the definition. 

 [15] In taking those steps, a priori assumptions as to the nature of unit trusts under the general law and princ iples of equity would not assist and would be apt to mislead. All depends... upon the terms of the partic ular trust... 

 [16] To approac h the c ase... by asking first whether... the holder of a unit “in a unit trust” has “a proprietary interest in eac h of the assets whic h c omprise the entirety of the trust fund” and answering it in the affirmative, did not immediately assist in the c onstruing the definition of “owner” in the Ac t. That definition does not speak of ownership of proprietary interests at large, but of entitlement to any estate of freehold in possession. 

 [17] ... it is one thing to identify rights protec ted by a c ourt of equity, and another to identify an interest whic h has “the nec essary quality of definable extent whic h must exist before it c an be taxed”. In the present c ase, the “definable extent” is that spec ified by the definition in the Ac t. No doubt, unit holders ac c urately may be said to have had rights protec ted by a c ourt of equity, but that does not require the c onc lusion that in the statutory sense they were “owners” of the land held on the trusts in question. 

75     _Lend Lease Funds_ is a further c ase c ited by the Respondent whic h followed _CPT Custodian_ and _Glenn_. The issue in that c ase was whether c ertain statutory exemptions applied to a transfer of the _estate in fee simple_ in land, from the statutorily defined “c ustodian” of a registered sc heme under Chapter 5C of the Australian Corporations Ac t 2001 (Cth), to the responsible entity of that sc heme. One issue was whether it was indeed only a bare legal _estate in fee simple_ that was transferred. The 


Supreme Court of Vic toria held in favour of the taxpayer based on a c onstruc tion of the terms of the trust deed c onc erned, albeit ac c epting that _CPT Custodian_ lent some support to the tax authority’s submissions. It is on this latter quote that the Respondent relies ( _Lend Lease Funds_ at [54]): 

 Although the High Court was c onc erned with the definition of “owner” in the Land Tax Ac t, the above passage supports the argument put by the Commissioner that, in the c ase of a unit trust and depending on the terms of the Trust Deed, where no persons c an be identified as entitled to an equitable estate in the land, the trustee, despite being a trustee, is entitled to the whole estate both legal and equitable. 

76     Three observations may be made. First, it was ac c epted in _Lend Lease Funds_ that _CPT Custodian_ was c onc erned at its essenc e with an issue of statutory c onstruc tion _vis-à-vis_ Vic toria’s Land Tax Ac t that was in forc e. Sec ond, the c ourt was c autious to limit the sc ope of its proposition to a unit trust, and even then, c ontingent on the terms of the partic ular trust deed in question. It is not c lear if the same proposition applies to a c haritable purpose trust, and the Respondent did not seek to analogise the trust deed in our c ase to that in _Lend Lease Funds_. Third, and most importantly, the c ourt here was again c onc erned with the applic ation of the partic ular statutory language in the Vic torian Duties Ac t to delimit their grounds for exemption from duty. 

77     These c ases c ited by the Respondent are c learly c onc erned with a different legislative c ontext, and do not stand for a broad proposition that the Applic ants as trustees of the Foundation are c onc urrently benefic ial owners of the Goodwood Property and thus liable for the ABSD that may be imposed. In this regard, there is an immediate c ontrast between the language of the Land Tax Assessment Ac t disc ussed in _Glenn_ , whic h is the progeny of the series of c ases relied on by the Respondent, and the ABSD provisions under the SDA. The Australian statute’s definition of “owner” targeted the holder of the estate in possession and the rec ipient of rents and profits, and it expressly c overs not only benefic ial owners, but also “trustee, mortgagee in possession, or otherwise”. In c ontrast, the language of the ABSD provisions looks, in the c ontext of a trust, spec ific ally and only to the status of the benefic ial owner, the c onc ept of whic h is not statutorily defined in the SDA and instead left to be determined ac c ording to the general laws and princ iples of equity. 

78     Further, the Australian c ases c ited make c lear that they were primarily c onc erned with the proper c onstruc tion of the statutes in issue, and that the reasoning relied upon in that regard may not be entirely c onsistent with equitable princ iples. To this end, it bears reminder that it is not generally helpful to selec tively highlight dic ta from foreign jurisprudenc e on the c onstruc tion of partic ular terms in foreign tax statutes, even if those terms are _in pari materia_ with loc al provisions (whic h is not the c ase here), without an explic ation of the relevant c ontext, history, and purpose of the foreign tax statutes and how those c ompare to the loc al regime in Singapore. The situation may be different if the salient issue relates to the judic ial approac h or philosophy to be taken in applying the law or in engaging in non-jurisdic tion-spec ific inquiries (see, _eg_ , _ABB v Comptroller of Income Tax_ [2010] 2 SLR 837 (“ _ABB v CIT_ ”) at [13]), but that is not our c ase. Partic ularly where, as is the c ase here, the issue before the c ourt involves the c onstruc tion or applic ation of a head of tax that _prima facie_ is pec uliar to Singapore and serves a unique loc alised legislative purpose, the party seeking to rely on foreign jurisprudenc e would have to do more to show its relevanc e. To this end, I find apposite guidanc e from the Court of Appeal in _JD Ltd v Comptroller of Income Tax_ [2006] 1 SLR 484: 

 [31] It is understandable for tax prac titioners to exhibit a proc livity towards relying on texts and c ase law from the Commonwealth jurisdic tions... 

 [32] However, we find it important to remind prac titioners that as tax law is essentially a c reature of statute, dec isions from foreign jurisdic tions should be treated with the appropriate 


 degree of c aution, espec ially where the wording of the foreign tax legislation is not identic al with or not in pari materia with the loc al equivalent... It is desirable, therefore, in interpreting tax legislation, to rely on foreign authorities only if the c orresponding tax statutes are identic al or very similar to loc al legislation, and if the sc hemes of deduc tion and taxation systems are alike. 

79     The Respondent also c ites a single line in David J. Hayton & Charles Mitc hell, _Hayton & Marshall: Commentary and Cases on The Law of Trusts and Equitable Remedies_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2005) (“ _Hayton & Marshall 12th Ed_ ”) (at para 3-200), for the proposition that the trustees of a c haritable purpose trust are “legal benefic ial owners” of the trust property, but under fiduc iary and equitable duties owed to the AttorneyGeneral. I set out the c ited quote in greater c ontext as follows: 

 Thus, the English c ourts should not hold the above Jersey trusts to be void so that the settlor is entitled from the outset to the benefic ial interest under a resulting trust. Where then is the benefic ial interest? Should a non-c haritable purpose trust be treated like a c haritable purpose trust where the trustees are the legal benefic ial owners, but are under fiduc iary and equitable duties owed to the AttorneyGeneral and the Charity Commissioners or any “interested person” having the permission of the Commissioners? 

80     With respec t to the learned editors, apart from the issue of c ontext, the proposition that trustees of a c haritable purpose trust are “legal benefic ial owners” has not been established as good law. The sole authority c ited for the proposition was a footnote stating “Just like exec utors of a testator: _Commissioner of Stamp Duty v Livingston_ [1965] AC 694” ( _Hayton & Marshall 12th Ed_ at 204 n 29). But that c ase related to the nature of rights of a residuary legatee as against the exec utor of an un-administered estate, and its extrapolation into our c ase is questionable. Further, there may be some imprec ision in the term used by the learned editors, _ie_ , “legal benefic ial owner”, for at least on one view, where the whole legal and benefic ial ownership of an asset resides in the same party, “[i]t might... not be appropriate to speak of a ‘trust’ at all” ( _Power Knight Pte Ltd v Natural Fuel Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) and others_ [2010] 3 SLR 82 (“ _Power Knight_ ”) at [49]). Indeed, this view is supported by the original text of Visc ount Radc liffe’s dec ision in _Commissioner of Stamp Duty v Livingston_ , where he refuted the false assumption that “for all purposes and at every moment in time the law requires the separate existenc e of two different kinds of estate or interest in the property”, and thereupon reasoned that “[w]hen the whole right of property is in a person... there is no need to distinguish between the legal and equitable interest in that property” (at 712-713). It thus does not follow – and it in fac t appears c ontradic tory to the Visc ount Radc liffe’s reasoning – that even in a trust for purposes, the legal and benefic ial interests of the property must simultaneously exist and c onc urrently lie in the trustee who is then termed the “legal benefic ial owner”. 

81     On princ iple, the proposition that trustees of a c haritable trust hold both the legal and benefic ial interests in the trust property also ignores the signific ant handic ap that is imposed on the powers of the trustees by the trust instrument, statute, and general law. Certainly, trustees in general, inc luding those ac ting in relation to a c haritable purpose trust, c annot do as they wish, sinc e the ultimate right to enjoyment of the property is not theirs. If that is still to be termed “benefic ial ownership”, it is benefic ial ownership of suc h a withered sort that does not merit that name. The proposition relied on by the Respondent also does not appear to have been retained in the 14th edition of the work (see Ben Mc Farlane & Charles Mitc hell, _Hayton & Mitchell: Text, Cases and Materials on the Law of Trusts and Equitable Remedies_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2015) (“ _Hayton & Mitchell 14th Ed_ ”)). 

82     For the above reasons, I do not ac c ept the Respondent’s submission that the trustees of a c haritable purpose trust are entitled to both the legal and equitable estates of the trust property. 


The Applic ants c annot, by mere virtue of their being trustees of the Foundation, be simultaneously referred to as the legal and benefic ial owners of the Goodwood Property. 

(3) “The public ” as benefic ial owners 

83     The Respondent makes a third alternative argument that “the public ” is the benefic ial owner of properties held by a c haritable purpose trust. In support of this, the Respondent c ites an ac ademic artic le (Roger Cotterrell, “Power, Property and the Law of Trusts: A Partial Agenda for Critic al Legal Sc holarship” (1987) 14(1) Journal of Law and Soc iety 77 at 88-89): 

 ... the law c annot c omprehend property without any benefic ial owner... 

 ... Property put into a c haritable trust is not ‘disembodied’ property. Not only is it tec hnic ally owned by c harity trustees but its protec tion is in various aspec ts the responsibility of public offic ials... The c ruc ial fac tor here is that the property settled on c haritable trust is given for the ‘public benefit’. Its ultimate benefic ial owner is ‘the public ’ or we might say ‘soc iety’. Charitable trusts provide a rare, perhaps unique, instanc e of the c onstruc tion of soc iety as a c ollec tive subjec t – a property owner – within private law. Small wonder that property onc e dedic ated to c harity remains perpetually so dedic ated. Soc iety as benefic ial owner c an never die. 

84     With respec t to the learned author, the c ontext of the artic le renders it suspec t as authority for the proposition put forward. Professor Cotterrell’s artic le is a c ritique of, _inter alia_ , the c lassic al c onc eptions of property and ownership; it is unabashedly written from the perspec tive of the Critic al Legal Studies movement. That movement aimed at unpac king notions and c onc eptions, long held by c ourts and lawyers, foc using on what the movement perc eived to be suspec t c onc entration and exerc ise of politic al power. The c onc eption of law held by the movement, while perhaps thoughtprovoking, is relatively far removed from the day-to-day law administered by the c ourts. This may perhaps be the first instanc e of a revenue authority c iting an artic le written from the Critic al Legal Studies perspec tive. 

85     In any event, the artic le does not assist the Respondent in the analysis of the question at hand. Aside from issues about the c ontext and sourc e of the quotation relied upon, there is no authority for the proposition that benefic ial ownership of a trust must always be identifiable. In the c ontext of a c haritable purpose trust, the only substantive objec tion to trust property being without benefic ial ownership is the lac k of c ontrol or c onstraint on the legal owners or trustees should they seek to depart from the stipulated term and purposes of the trust. As rec ognised by Professor Cotterrell, a mec hanism is supplied through c ontrol either by the AttorneyGeneral or the Commissioner of Charities. Signific ant issues may arise in respec t of non-c haritable purpose trusts, but suc h trusts have been rec ognised as valid on oc c asion. How they are to be c harac terised is a matter for another c ase, but it suffic es to note that on one view suc h trusts would also not have benefic ial owners: “These [non-c haritable purpose] trusts are generally rec ognised as valid, notwithstanding the absenc e of any benefic iary, for reasons whic h have more to do with ‘human weakness or sentiment’ rather than legal logic or princ iple” ( _Goi Wang Firn_ at [45]-[46], c iting _Tan Farrer_ at [15]). 

86     The argument that it is “the public ” that owns a c haritable trust is an ultimately empty proposition. Contrary to the Respondent’s relianc e on _Koh Lau Keow (HC)_ , the fac t that a c haritable trust must be for public benefit in order to be valid does not thereby mean that the public is the benefic ial owner of the trust property. This is again a c onflation of the c onc epts of fac tual benefits and legal benefic ial interest. Further, it is questionable if the rule in _Saunders v Vautier_ allowing the benefic iaries as a group to require the transfer to them of the legal title of the trust property 


absolutely c ould apply to c haritable purpose trusts in general ( _Thomas & Hudson_ at para 6.43, n 144), or under the Respondent’s submission as to the “public ” being benefic ial owners of a c haritable trust, sinc e that would allow any stipulated c haritable purpose to be disregarded or c irc umvented by the said “public ” invoking this rule. Although c harities often seek to promote public benefit, c haritable trust property c annot be said to be property of the c ommons: most trust property, aside perhaps from pastoral land, simply c annot be used in that way. On a Hohfeldian analysis of jural relationships, public ownership _per se_ does not c ontain any c ontent as a legal c onc ept. Desc ribing the “public ” or “soc iety” as the “owner” of the c haritable trust property, therefore, is a misuse of the term and does not c reate any right in the public as a group. 

87     For the above stated reasons, I rejec t all three of the Respondent’s submissions as to the loc ale of the benefic ial interest under a c haritable purpose trust. Neither the fac tual benefic iaries of the c haritable trust, nor the trustees, nor the public c an be said to be the benefic ial owners of property held under a c haritable purpose trust. Rather, in my view, the benefic ial interest in a c haritable purpose trust is simply “in suspense” and not extant; there is in suc h a trust simply no asc ertained or asc ertainable benefic iary. This is not a c onc ept unfamiliar to trust law or to loc al jurisprudenc e (see, _eg_ , _Power Knight_ at [51]; _Koh Lau Keow and others v Attorney-General_ [2014] 2 SLR 1165 at [18(a)]). Ac c ordingly, sinc e there is no ac tive or extant benefic ial owner to property held under a c haritable purpose trust, there is nothing to whic h ABSD may attac h under Art 3( _bf_ )(viii) read with Art 3(1) of the First Sc hedule of the SDA. 

**_Foreigners or Entities_** 

88     The above dec ision as to the non-identifiability of the benefic ial owner of the Goodwood Property renders it, stric tly speaking, unnec essary to make a determination as to whether any of the purported benefic ial owners fall within the statutory definitions of “entity” or “foreigner”. However, as parties have submitted full arguments in this regard, two issues will be c onsidered: 

 (a) whether the Applic ants as trustees of the Foundation c onstitute an “entity” as defined in Art 3(1) of the First Sc hedule of the SDA; and 

 (b) whether the Foundation itself c onstitutes an “entity”. 

_Definition of “entity” under Art 3(1) of the First Schedule_ 

89     It is an established princ iple in Singapore that the purposive approac h to statutory c onstruc tion under s 9A(1) of the IA governs the interpretation of tax statutes, and in this regard “effec tively displac es the c ommon law princ iple that tax statutes should be interpreted stric tly in favour of the taxpayer” ( _ABB v CIT_ at [54]; see _ACC v Comptroller of Income Tax_ [2011] 1 SLR 1217 at [17]). The Australian c ourts appear to take a similar approac h: “tax statutes do not form a c lass of their own to whic h different rules of c onstruc tion apply” ( _Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioners of Territory Revenue_ [2009] 239 CLR 27 at [57]), as do the English authorities (Lord Wilberforc e, _W T Ramsay Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners_ [1982] AC 300 at 323; see generally, Oliver Jones, _Bennion on Statutory Interpretation_ (LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2012) (“ _Bennion_ ”) at s 310): 

 A subjec t is only to be taxed on c lear words, not on “intendment” or on the “equity” of an Ac t... What are “c lear words” is to be asc ertained on normal princ iples; these do not c onfine the c ourts to literal interpretation. There may, indeed should, be c onsidered the c ontext and sc heme of the relevant Ac t as a whole, and its purpose may, indeed should, be regarded. 

90     Ac c ording to the Respondent, ABSD is c hargeable in the present c ontext under artic le 3( _bf_ )(viii) 


of the First Sc hedule of the SDA bec ause the benefic ial owners of the Goodwood Property inc lude an “entity” or “foreigner”. The term “entity” is defined in Art 3(1) of the First Sc hedule as follows: 

 “entity” means a person who is not an individual, and includes an unincorporated association, a trustee for a collective investment scheme when acting in that capacity, a trustee-manager for a business trust when acting in that capacity and, in a case where the property conveyed, transferred or assigned is to be held as partnership property, the partners of the partnership whether or not any of them is an individual 

The primary definition of “entity” is thus “a person who is not an individual”, whereas the extended definition inc ludes the spec ific examples stated, suc h as a trustee for a CIS. 

91     Generally, the phrase “means... and inc ludes...” may serve two purposes: the first being to illustrate the primary definition following the term “means”, and the sec ond being to extend that primary definition beyond its natural import ( _Low Guang Hong David and others v Suryono Wino Goei_ [2012] 3 SLR 185 at [14]; c iting _Pan-United Marine Ltd v Chief Assessor_ [2008] 3 SLR 569). In this c ase, it is immaterial whic h purpose the phrase was intended to serve, sinc e even taking the sec ond purpose _ex hypothesi_ , and thereby giving the term “entity” the broadest definition possible, it would nevertheless still not c over the trustees of c haritable purpose trusts. As will be explained, this is bec ause the extended definition of “entity” expressly inc ludes the trustees of a CIS and of a business trust, but makes no mention of trustees in general, whether of a trust for persons, a private purpose trust, or a c haritable purpose trust. 

_Whether the Applicants as trustees are an “entity”_ 

92     The Applic ants argue that the definition of “entity” under Art 3(1) of the First Sc hedule of the SDA does not c over a body of persons suc h as the Applic ants in their c apac ity as trustees. The Parliamentary debates are material and should be taken into ac c ount in the c onstruc tion of the term “entity”. Although the Parliamentary debates did not ac c ompany the introduc tion of the ABSD regime, whic h was introduc ed by way of a Ministerial Order, the Minister’s speec h subsequently when the Parliamentary debate was held foc used on purc hases of residential properties made by individual buyers and c ompanies. These debates also indic ate that the c onc ern underlying the introduc tion of ABSD was with investment demand, whic h would primarily c onc ern c ompanies whic h are c ommerc iallydriven, rather than c haritable trusts. The Respondent argues to the c ontrary that the Parliamentary debates do not assist in c onstruing the meaning of the term “entity”, whic h has remained the same sinc e 2011. 

93     I find that the Applic ants as trustees of a c haritable purpose trust are not an “entity” within the meaning of Art 3( _bf_ )(viii) of the First Sc hedule. First, they do not fall within the primary definition of “entity”, _ie_ , a “person who is not an individual”. Sec ond, even if the extended definition serves an expansionary purpose to the primary definition, trustees of a c haritable purpose trust are not c aptured within its sc ope. 

94     As regards the primary definition, the phrase “person who is not an individual” is potentially wide but c onstrained ultimately by the meaning of the word “person”. In the absenc e of any other indic ation, the word “person”, sinc e it must not be an individual, would by ordinary meaning have to be taken as a legal person, c learly c apturing body c orporates and presumably c orporations sole. However, this definition would not inc lude trustees of c haritable purpose trusts. The Applic ants in their c apac ity as trustees are c ertainly non-individuals, but even as a c ollec tive they are not a legal person: they are individuals disc harging their respec tive duties, and are not treated usually as a bloc in their dealings with the world. Although they usually ac t unanimously, eac h trustee must exerc ise 


his or her disc retion separately unless otherwise authorised by the trust deed ( _Snell’s Equity_ at paras 29-005 and 29-038). A trustee’s liability for breac h of trust is generally also limited to the losses resulting from his own breac h; where more than one trustee is involved in the wrongdoing, eac h trustee remains jointly and severally liable ( _Snell’s Equity_ at para 30-045). Certainly, trustees c ould be treated as a bloc or a legal person by statute, but that requires c lear language, in the absenc e of whic h the general position should apply. 

95     The Respondent attempts to rely on s 2(1) of the IA, but it does not assist. That provision reads: 

 “Person”... inc lude[s] any c ompany or assoc iation or body of persons, c orporate or uninc orporate 

96     The definition of “person” under the IA is inc lusive and c overs a “body of persons”. In that sense, it is potentially broader than the phrase “person who is not an individual” under Art 3(1) of the First Sc hedule of the SDA. However, the definition in Art 3(1) is also inc lusive, and through the extended definition c aptures a number of spec ific c onc epts, inc luding a trustee for a CIS, a trustee manager for a business trust, and partners of a partnership. Given this, the IA definition is exc luded by virtue of the introduc tory words c ontained in the c hapeau of s 2(1), whic h provide that the definitions that follow (inc luding that of “person”) would not apply if “there is something in the subjec t or c ontext inc onsistent with suc h c onstruc tion”. 

97     Turning to the extended definition of “entity” under Art 3(1), by virtue of this limb, the primary definition of “entity” is expanded to c over uninc orporated assoc iations and partnerships, both of whic h would otherwise not normally be taken to have legal personality. These c onc epts, however, do not apply to the Foundation or the Applic ants as trustees. An uninc orporated assoc iation is a group of persons bound together by a mutual c ontrac t, whic h the Applic ants are not. Nor are the Applic ants in a partnership. 

98     The extended definition also inc ludes trustees of a CIS and trustee-managers of a business trust. However, while the trustees of these two spec ific kinds of trusts ( _ie_ , CIS and business trusts) are referenc ed, it does not follow that the trustees of any other kind of trust are nec essarily to be c aptured by the definition _ejusdem generis_. The definition does not c learly and expressly c over trusts in general, nor are the two spec ific kinds of trusts mentioned typic al or representative examples of trusts: a CIS is a group investment vehic le usually open to the public and governed by its own regulatory regime; a business trust is another spec ial type of investment vehic le that bears little resemblanc e to a traditional trust and was introduc ed into our law by a spec ific statute: the Business Trusts Ac t (Cap 31A, 2005 Rev Ed). 

99     Therefore, as the extended definition is after all a spec ific list, without any general desc ription of struc tures and arrangements that may c over the c onc ept of c haritable purpose trusts, it is not possible for the Respondent to plac e relianc e beyond the primary defining phrase “person who is not an individual”. The legal understanding of what is a non-individual person thus c ontrols what the term “entity” c an c over in this c ase. As explained, on this c onstruc tion, neither the primary nor the extended definition – and thus the definition of “entity” as a whole – inc ludes the Applic ants in their c apac ity as trustees of the Foundation. 

_Whether the Foundation itself constitutes an “entity”_ 

100    The Applic ants argue that the Foundation itself was not an “entity”. The registration of the Foundation as a c harity under the Charities Ac t merely ac c ords it with the status of being a “c harity”, but does not give it institutional c harac ter, nor mean that it is therefore an “entity”. This institutional 


form of a c harity is distinc t from its c haritable status: _Khoo Jeffrey_ at [33]. I agree. The Respondent does not argue otherwise, foc using instead on the positions of the fac tual benefic iaries, the Applic ants as trustees, and the public , as opposed to the Foundation itself. In my view, the Respondent is c orrec t not to take a c ontrary position. 

**_Liability for ABSD under other provisions_** 

101    Given the dec ision above that properties held under a c haritable purpose trust do not have identifiable benefic ial owners, there is no benefic ial owner of the Goodwood Property to whic h Art 3(2) ( _d_ ) may relate, and therefore Art 3( _bf_ )(viii) read with Art 3(2)( _d_ ) does not apply to impose ABSD on the SPA. The Respondent argues, as a fall-bac k alternative, that even if Art 3(2)( _d_ ) is inc apable of applying, liability attac hes direc tly through the operation of Art 3( _bf_ )(viii) _vis-à-vis_ the trustees themselves. In that c ase, it would be the profile of the Applic ants as trustees (rather than the benefic ial owner of the Goodwood Property) that bec omes the foc al of the inquiry, sinc e they are in suc h c apac ity the direc t “grantees, transferees or lessees” of the Goodwood Property. 

102    However, there is nothing in Arts 3(2)( _d_ ) or 3( _bf_ )(viii), or in the framework of the First Sc hedule, that supports the Respondent’s proposed interpretation. Artic le 3(2)( _d_ ) itself provides that “in a c ase where [the grantee, transferee or lessee of the c onveyed residential property] is to hold the residential property on trust”, it is the benefic ial owner of that property that is the c onc ern of ABSD liability, “exc ept where the residential property is to be held as property of a business trust or a c ollec tive investment sc heme or as partnership property”. The natural and plain reading of the provision would be that Art 3(2)( _d_ ) defines c omprehensively the sc ope of ABSD liability when the c onveyed property is to be held on a trust, unless that trust is of a spec ific kind that is c learly and expressly exempted from its purview ( _ie_ , a business trust or CIS). Those exemptions do not apply in the present c ase. The Art 3(2)( _d_ ) definition of “grantee, transferee or lessee” is premised on the subjec t property having an identifiable benefic ial owner; nothing in the First Sc hedule operates where no benefic ial interest is identifiable despite the property being held on trust. 

103    Further, none of the other ABSD provisions in the First Sc hedule would apply to impose ABSD liability on the SPA. All of the sub-provisions in Art 3( _bf_ ) make referenc e to the “grantee, transferee or lessee” of the c onveyed property, whic h phrase is then defined under Art 3(2)( _d_ ) to refer to the benefic ial owner of the same if the property is to be held on trust. Ac c ordingly, even if the Respondent relies on any of these other sub-provisions, he would fac e the same issues _vis-à-vis_ c haritable purpose trusts and the non-identifiability of their benefic ial ownership. Indeed, the Respondents do not argue that any other sub-provisions apply. 

**Miscellaneous** 

104    Aside from the arguments above on the c hargeability of ABSD on the SPA, there are two other issues whic h remain. 

**_Materials in aid of statutory interpretation_** 

105    In the present proc eedings, both parties plac ed relianc e on the Press Statement issued to ac c ompany the enac tment of the ABSD provisions, but for different purposes. The Applic ants use it to argue that ABSD was not intended to be imposed _vis-à-vis_ c onveyanc es to a c haritable purpose trust. The Respondent c ites the Press Statement to show that it was. 

106    In determining the admissibility of, and weight to be given to, the Press Statement with respec t to a statutory c onstruc tion of the SDA, it is primarily ss 9A(2) to (4) of the IA that need to 


be c onsidered: 

 (2) Subjec t to subsec tion (4), in the interpretation of a provision of a written law, if any material not forming part of the written law is c apable of assisting in the asc ertainment of the meaning of the provision, c onsideration may be given to that material — 

 ( a ) to c onfirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning c onveyed by the text of the provision taking into ac c ount its c ontext in the written law and the purpose or objec t underlying the written law; or 

 ( b ) to asc ertain the meaning of the provision when — 

 (i) the provision is ambiguous or obsc ure; or 

 (ii) the ordinary meaning c onveyed by the text of the provision taking into ac c ount its c ontext in the written law and the purpose or objec t underlying the written law leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. 

 (3) Without limiting the generality of subsec tion (2), the material that may be c onsidered in ac c ordanc e with that subsec tion in the interpretation of a provision of a written law shall inc lude — 

 ( a ) all matters not forming part of the written law that are set out in the doc ument c ontaining the text of the written law as printed by the Government Printer; 

 ( b ) any explanatory statement relating to the Bill c ontaining the provision; 

 ( c ) the speec h made in Parliament by a Minister on the oc c asion of the moving by that Minister of a motion that the Bill c ontaining the provision be read a sec ond time in Parliament; 

 ( d ) any relevant material in any offic ial rec ord of debates in Parliament; 

 ( e ) any treaty or other international agreement that is referred to in the written law; and 

 ( f ) any doc ument that is dec lared by the written law to be a relevant doc ument for the purposes of this sec tion. 

 (4) In determining whether c onsideration should be given to any material in ac c ordanc e with subsec tion (2), or in determining the weight to be given to any suc h material, regard shall be had, in addition to any other relevant matters, to — 

 ( a ) the desirability of persons being able to rely on the ordinary meaning c onveyed by the text of the provision taking into ac c ount its c ontext in the written law and the purpose or objec t underlying the written law; and 

 ( b ) the need to avoid prolonging legal or other proc eedings without c ompensating advantage. 

107    Sec tion 9A allows a broad c ategory of material to be used to interpret statutory provisions. But some materials are by their nature more likely to be useful than others: that is the basis of the c larific ations c ontained in sub-sec tions (3) and (4). Thus, in dec iding the weight to be asc ribed to 


any material c ited in aid of a purposive c onstruc tion of a statute, the c ontext of these materials must itself be c onsidered. In this regard, preparatory materials used in the proc ess of enac ting or drafting a statute, and materials used or referred to in the relevant legislative deliberations, would c learly be useful in the eluc idation of the purpose of that statute or its provisions. These assist bec ause they c ould have c onc eivably influenc ed and had an impac t on the statutory language and struc ture, or may reflec t the objec t and mind of the draftsmen as eventually sanc tioned by Parliament. In c ontrast, materials post-enac tment would in most situations be unhelpful and c aution must be exerc ised to avoid asc ribing meaning that arises after enac tment, or was not present at all in the minds of those exerc ising the power of enac tment (see generally, _Bennion_ at p 654). 

108    In addition, the purpose of the material sought to be relied on is also relevant. Generally, greater weight will be given to materials that are c learly intended or designed to be used to explain, in a legal sense, the meaning of the statutory provisions, or are designed to be c apable of sc rutiny by a c ourt of law. Materials meant for other purposes, suc h as explanation for laypersons, must be treated c autiously lest unintended meanings are grafted on to the legislative provisions. 

109    Press statements thus must be warily used in statutory interpretation. First, they are generally prepared post-enac tment. Sec ondly, their targeted purpose is primarily and presumably to explain the position in a simple and easily understood way, without usually being legally prec ise, or with the intent to have legal effec t. The additional danger is that a whole slew of different public materials, suc h as Fac ebook posts and Twitter feeds, would be posited as possible interpretative aids. A post on soc ial media would generally not be regarded as useful in interpreting a statutory provision bec ause it is usually made in a c ontext that would not involve any element of drafting or legislative intent, but rather, would be intended to educ ate the public or to respond to a partic ular situation. For similar reasons, a press statement would also rarely give rise to an estoppel binding the government. 

110    In our present c ase, it is said by the Respondent, with whom the Applic ants joined, that the Press Statement was the only available material that c ould assist. In my view, however, the absenc e of any other aid to interpretation is not suffic ient to c lothe the Press Statement with the mantle of being assistive or a doc ument to be ac c orded any signific ant weight. If there is nothing, there is nothing. If the Minister or authority in enac ting the ABSD wishes to provide guidanc e on interpretation, there are other means. They may, ac ting under delegated law-making powers, issue legal guidanc e on how words and phrases are to be interpreted: in that event, those statements may be legitimate interpretative material of c onsiderable weight under s 9A, sinc e that material is c learly c reated and intended to explic ate the statutory language (assuming it does not c ross the line by enac ting legislation outside the legislative proc ess). However, suc h intent must be made manifest by adopting the appropriate form, suc h as by being issued expressly as an interpretive guide, whic h would signal c learly its intent to be taken as a legal interpretative doc ument. A press statement, on the other hand, will be c oloured by its usual purpose – to public ise and explain the regime to laypersons who are unfamiliar and untrained in the law. A press statement not being drafted with an eye to its being used or sc rutinised in the legal sense by a c ourt of law, will very rarely be c onferred muc h weight, if at all, as an interpretive material, unless it was expressly flagged to be intended to give interpretive effec t; but in that c ase it would really just be express legislative guidanc e. 

111    In this c ase, the Press Statement that both parties sought to rely on is unhelpful to either party. The Press Statement states, _inter alia_ , the following: 

 (a) the Government’s objec tive “is to promote a sustainable residential property market where pric es move in line with ec onomic fundamentals”; 

 (b) the Government “dec ided to impose the ABSD to moderate investment demand for private 


 residential property and promote a more stable and sustainable market”; 

 (c ) in a Table appended to the Press Statement, ABSD is said to apply to transac tions with “[f]oreigners and non-individuals (c orporate entities) buying any residential property”; and 

 (d) in a footnote, “non-individuals” is said to “inc lude[] c orporate, trusts, and c ollec tive investments sc hemes amongst others”. 

112    The Respondent points to the inc lusion of “trusts” in the footnote, while the Applic ants highlight the failure to spec ific ally inc lude trusts for purposes ( _eg_ , c haritable purpose trusts) and the referenc es to “c orporate entities” and “investment demand”, whic h the Applic ants c laim do not apply to them. In my view, both parties are stretc hing the Press Statement too far; the language in the Press Statement was at best ambiguous. In the c irc umstanc es, the Press Statement generally as a rule, and spec ific ally in this c ase, does not illuminate legislative purpose as to whether ABSD was intended to apply _vis-à-vis_ c onveyanc es of residential property to a c haritable purpose trust. 

113    The Applic ants also c ite a tax-guide issued by IRAS to the public in arguing for its interpretation of “benefic ial owner”. For the same reasons as disc ussed above in relation to the use of the Press Statement, suc h tax guides should not generally c ontrol or influenc e the interpretation of statutory provisions. They are not preparatory materials, thus running the risk of modifying the language of the statute post-enac tment. Nor would it be part of their purpose to be c onstrued legally by a c ourt of law: they are generally intended to guide laypersons in navigating a partic ular statutory regime. Simplific ation, as well as the glossing over of tec hnic alities and c omplexities, are to be expec ted. Furthermore, it must be c autioned that these tax guides, to the extent that they reflec t the guidelines and prac tic es of the tax authorities, are not nec essarily law: “That this has been the prac tic e of the Comptroller does not in any way illuminate the question of whether this _should_ be the prac tic e of the Comptroller. Prac tic e is not law” [emphasis in original] ( _Comptroller of Income Tax v GE Pacific Pte Ltd_ [1994] 2 SLR(R) 948 at [35]). 

**_Imposing Tax Liability on Charities_** 

114    For avoidanc e of doubt, it should be made c lear that there is nothing in princ iple for or against having ABSD apply to transac tions over residential properties by c harities. Whether or not a c harity, and in partic ular a c haritable trust, is to be liable for tax of any sort is a matter of polic y for the relevant Ministries and agenc ies. There just needs to be stated c lear imposition under the relevant statutory instrument. The preferred c ourse would be to ensure that the language of the statute itself is c lear, and that it has been drafted to reflec t the legislative intent as best as humanly possible. 

115    For this reason, not muc h weight c ould be given to the Respondent’s argument that if c haritable purpose trusts are exc luded from the sc ope of ABSD liability, an undesirable disparity would arise between the treatment of c harities c onstituted as trusts as opposed to those c onstituted as uninc orporated assoc iations or c ompanies limited by guarantees. The desirability of this position as a matter of polic y falls outside the provinc e of the c ourts. 

**Conclusion** 

116    My answers to the questions posed in the Case Stated are thus: 

 (a) The SPA is not c hargeable with ABSD. 

 (b) In view of the answer to (a), the sec ond question does not arise. 


117    It follows that there should be repayment of the sums paid by the Applic ants to the Respondent under protest. Separate direc tions will be given with respec t to arguments on c osts.
