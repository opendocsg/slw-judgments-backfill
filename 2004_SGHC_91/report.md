**Yong Pung How CJ:** 

1       These were four related applic ations arising from the same fac ts. In Criminal Revisions Nos 11 and 12 of 2004, Lee Cheong Ngan alias Lee Cheong Yuen (“Lee”) and Chiong Yen Bao (“Chiong”) sought to have their respec tive c onvic tions set aside. In support of their applic ations for c riminal revision, Lee and Chiong also requested for leave to introduc e additional evidenc e, in Criminal Motions Nos 7 and 8 respec tively. I allowed the c riminal motions, but rejec ted the applic ations for c riminal revision. I now give my reasons. 

**Background** 

2       Lee and Chiong are husband and wife, and joint owners of the premises at No 69 Toh Tuc k Road (“the premises”). The property adjoining the rear of the premises is No 37 Toh Tuc k Plac e. A bric k retaining wall with an attac hed c hain-link meshed fenc e lies near the boundary between the premises and No 37 Toh Tuc k Plac e. 

3       Between January and Marc h 2001, offic ers from the Building and Construc tion Authority (“BCA”) visited the premises to inspec t the retaining wall and fenc e. As they found the fenc e in a state of disrepair, the BCA wrote to Lee and Chiong on 24 Marc h 2001, direc ting them to repair the fenc e by 14 April 2001. 

4       On 6 July 2001, Phua Chee Sim (“Phua”), an offic er attac hed to the Building Management Sec tion of the BCA, c arried out another inspec tion of the retaining wall and fenc e. As he was refused entry onto the premises, Phua had to examine the retaining wall and fenc e from No 37 Toh Tuc k Plac e. He found a portion of the fenc e c ollapsed, with the remaining sec tion in a state of dilapidation. 


5       Phua then obtained a survey plan from the Singapore Land Registry, whic h c onfirmed that the retaining wall and fenc e were within the boundaries of the premises. The BCA ac c ordingly issued a notic e to Lee and Chiong on 20 July 2001 (“the notic e”), under s 4(1) of the Buildings and Common Property (Maintenanc e and Management) Ac t (Cap 30, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”). Sec tion 4(1) provides that: 

 Where in the opinion of the Commissioner [of Buildings] any building or c ommon property has not been kept or maintained in a state of good and servic eable repair or in a proper and c lean c ondition, the Commissioner may, by notic e in writing, require the owner within suc h period as may be spec ified in the notic e to take suc h steps or c arry out suc h repairs and maintenanc e as the Commissioner thinks fit. 

6       The notic e was served by registered post as presc ribed under s 20(1)(b) of the Ac t, and direc ted both Lee and Chiong to repair the damaged fenc e at the bac k of the premises by 19 August 

2001\. The notic e also stated that a failure to c omply would c onstitute an offenc e under s 4(3) pf the Ac t, whic h is punishable with a fine not exc eeding $5,000 and a further fine not exc eeding $25 for every day that the offenc e is c ontinued after c onvic tion. 

7       Lee Min Kwang (“Min Kwang”), a son of Lee and Chiong, subsequently wrote to the BCA on 15 August 2001, asking for more time to repair the fenc e. He explained that their neighbours at No 37 Toh Tuc k Plac e had built a bird c age next to the fenc e, rendering it impossible to c arry out the nec essary rec tific ation works. Cruc ially, he also ac knowledged that a survey plan from the Singapore Land Registry showed that the retaining wall and fenc e were within the boundaries of the premises. 

8       On 29 Dec ember 2001, Phua c onduc ted another inspec tion of the retaining wall and fenc e, again from No 37 Toh Tuc k Plac e. He disc overed that Lee and Chiong had still not c arried out any rec tific ation work. As a result, two summonses were issued against Lee and Chiong respec tively on 27 February 2002. Both c harges in them read as follows: 

 You ... are c harged that you did fail to c omply with the Notic e ... issued by the Commissioner of Buildings on 20 July 2001 under sec tion 4(1) of the Buildings and Common Property (Maintenanc e and Management) Ac t, Chapter 30, requiring you to repair the damaged c hain link fenc e at the rear of the premises at No. 69 Toh Tuc k Road, Singapore by 19 August 2001 and you have thereby c ommitted an offenc e punishable under sec tion 4(3) of the said Ac t. 

**The proceedings below** 

9       Lee and Chiong appeared before the magistrate on 8 Oc tober 2002, but the hearing was adjourned for the parties to produc e an agreed statement of fac ts (“Agreed SOF”). On 9 Oc tober 2002, the magistrate was informed that Lee and Chiong intended to plead guilty. The magistrate then stood down the hearing to allow their c ounsel, Mr Tan Cheng Yew (“Tan”), to explain the Agreed SOF and c harges to them. 

10     When the hearing resumed, the c harge was read in Mandarin to Chiong, and in English to Lee. The interpreter informed the c ourt that both were pleading guilty, and understood the nature and c onsequenc es of their pleas. The Agreed SOF was then read, and the interpreter notified the c ourt that Lee and Chiong admitted to the fac ts c ontained therein. The magistrate ac c ordingly c onvic ted Lee and Chiong on the respec tive c harges. 


11     In mitigation, Lee and Chiong submitted, through Mr Tan, that the damage to the fenc e was c aused by their neighbours at No 37 Toh Tuc k Plac e. Also, they were both in their seventies, and had been c onfused when they first rec eived the BCA’s notic e, as they did not know if the retaining wall and fenc e fell within their premises. 

12     After hearing the fac ts and taking into ac c ount every relevant mitigating fac tor, the magistrate sentenc ed Lee and Chiong to pay a fine of $900 eac h (in default nine days’ imprisonment). The fines were duly paid, yet Lee and Chiong still failed to c arry out the required repairs. They were then c harged on 17 Oc tober 2003 with a c ontinuing offenc e under s 4(3) of the Ac t. On 15 Marc h 2004, they filed these four applic ations to c hallenge their c onvic tions on the earlier February 2002 c harges. The later c harges in Oc tober 2003 were not in issue before me. 

**The applications** 

13     Lee and Chiong both filed petitions for c riminal revision, asking the High Court to exerc ise its revisionary powers pursuant to s 268 of the Criminal Proc edure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) to set aside their c onvic tions. They submitted that they had never intended to admit without qualific ation to the offenc es alleged against them, and had suffered serious injustic e at the hearing before the magistrate. 

14     To substantiate their c ases for revision, Lee and Chiong also applied for leave to introduc e new evidenc e. In Criminal Motion No 7 of 2004, Lee sought to admit his own affidavit, as well as that of his other son, Lee Wei Kwang (“Wei Kwang”). In Criminal Motion No 8 of 2004, Chiong sought to admit her own affidavit to assist her c ase. 

**The criminal motions** 

15     The revisionary powers of the High Court are governed by s 23 of the Supreme Court of Judic ature Ac t (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) and s 268(1) of the CPC. Ac c ording to s 268(1) of the CPC, the High Court, in the exerc ise of its revisionary powers, may also take additional evidenc e in ac c ordanc e with s 257(1) of the CPC, whic h provides that: 

 In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter the High Court, if it thinks additional evidenc e is necessary , may either take suc h evidenc e itself or direc t it to be taken by a Distric t Court or Magistrate’s Court. [emphasis added] 

16     In dec iding if the evidenc e sought to be adduc ed is “nec essary”, the three c onditions set out in _Ladd v Marshall_ [1954] 1 WLR 1489 must be fulfilled: 

 (a) non-availability – it must be shown that the evidenc e c ould not have been obtained with reasonable diligenc e for use at trial; 

 (b) relevanc e – the evidenc e must be suc h that, if given, it would probably have an important influenc e on the result of the c ase; and 

 (c ) reliability – it must be apparently c redible, although it need not be inc ontrovertible. 

17     I adopted this framework in _Juma’at bin Samad v PP_ <span class="citation">[1993] 3 SLR 338</span>, and have repeatedly affirmed its authority in c ases suc h as _Chan Chun Yee v PP_ <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 638</span>, _Tan Sai Tiang v PP_ <span class="citation">[2000] 1 SLR 439</span> and most rec ently, in _Annis bin Abdullah v PP_ <span class="citation">[2004] 2 SLR 93</span>. 


18     In this c ase, the affidavits that the petitioners sought to adduc e desc ribed their version of what transpired in the c ourt below on 8 and 9 Oc tober 2002. It was apparent that, by the very nature of the evidenc e, the first c ondition was fulfilled, sinc e this evidenc e obviously c ould not have been obtained at the proc eedings below. The sec ond c ondition was also c learly satisfied, as the evidenc e was highly relevant. Lee and Chiong based their c ases for c riminal revision on the main ground that their pleas of guilt below were invalid. In order to asc ertain the legality of their pleas of guilt, and c onsequently, the soundness of their c onvic tions, I had to c onsider evidenc e of the c irc umstanc es in whic h the pleas were taken. 

19     The only real issue here was the apparent c redibility of the additional evidenc e. Although untested assertions of events would generally not be admitted at this stage, I noted that the affidavits of Lee, Chiong and Wei Kwang were broadly c onsistent in the most material partic ulars. Bearing in mind that the evidenc e must only be apparently c redible, and need not be inc ontrovertible, I found that the final c ondition was satisfied, but only by the barest of margins. 

20     The dec iding fac tor in this c ase was the high degree of relevanc e that this additional evidenc e had on Lee’s and Chiong’s petitions for c riminal revision. They had to be allowed to put forward their version of events for me to asc ertain the soundness of their c onvic tions in the c ourt below. Given the c irc umstanc es, the Deputy Public Prosec utor had no objec tion to the admission of the affidavits. 

21     Of c ourse, the fac t that I agreed to admit the affidavits did not mean that I ac c epted their entire c ontents as the truth. The verac ity of the allegations still had to be tested against the rest of the evidenc e. As all three affidavits c ame from interested parties, I was espec ially c hary of ac c epting their evidenc e at fac e value. With this in mind, I turned to c onsider the petitions for c riminal revision. 

**The criminal revisions** 

22     I laid down the princ iples governing the exerc ise of the High Court’s revisionary powers in _Ang Poh Chuan v PP_ <span class="citation">[1996] 1 SLR 326</span> at 330, [17]: 

 [V]arious phrases may be used to identify the c irc umstanc es whic h would attrac t the exerc ise of the revisionary jurisdic tion, but they all share the c ommon denominator that there must be some serious injustic e. Of c ourse there c annot be a prec ise definition of what would c onstitute suc h serious injustic e for that would in any event unduly c irc umsc ribe what must be a wide disc retion vested in the c ourt, the exerc ise of whic h would depend largely on the partic ular fac ts. But generally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the dec ision that strikes at its basis as an exerc ise of judic ial power by the c ourt below. 

23     Bearing in mind the potential for abuse by ac c used persons who have pleaded guilty, the c ourt will exerc ise its revisionary power sparingly, to ensure that it does not degenerate into a c onvenient form of “bac kdoor appeal”: _Teo Hee Heng v PP_ <span class="citation">[2000] 3 SLR 168</span> at [7]. Not only must there have been some error, illegality, impropriety or irregularity, it must also have resulted in grave and serious injustic e: _Ma Teresa Bebango Bedico v PP_ <span class="citation">[2002] 1 SLR 192</span> at [8], followed in _Lee Eng Hock v PP_ <span class="citation">[2002] 1 SLR 364</span>. 

**_The petitioners’ case_** 


24     Lee and Chiong raised several issues to substantiate their c ase for c riminal revision. First, various c omplaints were made against Mr Tan’s c onduc t of their c ase. They further alleged that the interpreter did not adequately translate the c harges or the Agreed SOF, and failed to c onvey their reservations to the c ourt. The magistrate’s notes of evidenc e (“NOE”) were also ambiguous, and did not c learly rec ord that they had both entered an unequivoc al plea of guilt. It was submitted that all the c irc umstanc es, taken together, established that they had suffered serious injustic e, and their c onvic tions ought to be set aside. 

**_The pleas of guilt_** 

25     The greater part of the petitioners’ arguments disputed the validity of their pleas of guilt below. The c irc umstanc es under whic h the High Court would exerc ise its revisionary powers in suc h c ases are firmly settled. Sec tion 180(b) of the CPC states that if the ac c used understands the nature and c onsequenc es of his plea and intends to admit without qualific ation the offenc e alleged against him, he may plead guilty to the c harge and the c ourt may c onvic t him on it. In _Ganesun s/o Kannan v PP_ <span class="citation">[1996] 3 SLR 560</span>, I adopted the three c ommon law safeguards for a valid plea of guilt as laid down in _Lee Weng Tuck v PP_ [1989] 2 MLJ 143: 

 (a) an ac c used should plead guilty by his own mouth and not through his c ounsel; 

 (b) the onus lies on the judge to asc ertain whether the ac c used understands the true nature and c onsequenc es of his plea; and 

 (c ) the c ourt must establish that the ac c used intends to admit without qualific ation the offenc e alleged against him. 

26     I turned to c onsider eac h of the petitioners’ c ontentions in light of these princ iples. 

**_Allegations against defence counsel_** 

27     Lee and Chiong made many serious allegations against Mr Tan. Ac c ording to them, he c onsented to the Agreed SOF without their authority, ac ted against their instruc tions, did nothing to express their views to the c ourt, and also omitted to advise them of the availability of the defenc e of reasonable c are. 

28     In many petitions for c riminal revision, the ac c used often c hallenges defenc e c ounsel’s c onduc t of the c ase. Yet many of these allegations are often unfounded, and are raised by the ac c used only in a desperate attempt to esc ape the rigours of the law. In _Lee Eng Hock_ , ([23] _supra_ ), the petitioner pleaded guilty, but later sought c riminal revision on the ground that he had misunderstood his c ounsel’s advic e. While he was c onvinc ed of his own innoc enc e throughout, he thought that his c ounsel had advised him that a plea of guilt would not oc c asion a c ustodial sentenc e. In dismissing the petition, I made the following observations at [10] of my judgment: 

 If the c onduc t of defenc e c ounsel c ould be so easily c hallenged, the c hilling effec t on the c riminal Bar would be immense. While there may in some c ases be a thin line between dispensing c redible legal advic e and pressurising one’s c lient to plead guilty, it is undesirable to allow defenc e c ounsel to be made c onvenient sc apegoats, on the bac ks of whom “bac kdoor appeals” are c arried through. 

29     These sentiments applied with equal forc e here. Given that Mr Tan has unfortunately 


disappeared from the c ountry, I was forc ed to evaluate the reliability of the petitioners’ ac c ount of events without his assistanc e. After c arefully c onsidering the evidenc e, I found that the petitioners’ c laims simply c ould not be ac c epted. 

30     If Mr Tan was in fac t guilty of the petitioners’ allegations, they had every opportunity to voic e their objec tions in c ourt. They may have been slightly overwhelmed by the proc eedings, as they were advanc ed in years and it was their first time in c ourt. Nonetheless, their sons Min Kwang and Wei Kwang had been keenly involved in the c ase from the beginning. They were present in c ourt, and fully c apable of protesting on their parents’ behalf. 

31     Lee, Chiong and Wei Kwang alleged in their affidavits that they had openly disagreed with Mr Tan at the hearing, and the magistrate had stood down the proc eedings twic e for the parties to resolve their differenc es. Yet there is no rec ord of any of this in the magistrate’s NOE, whic h only reflec t that the magistrate had stood down for the c harges and the Agreed SOF to be explained to Lee and Chiong. The magistrate must have been aware of his duty to ensure that both Lee and Chiong did intend to plead guilty to the c harges against them. If there was indeed suc h an obvious dispute between the petitioners and Tan, I had no doubt that the magistrate would not have ac c epted their pleas of guilt. 

**_Allegations against interpreter_** 

32     Lee and Chiong also c laimed that the interpreter did not translate the c harges of the Agreed SOF in full, but instead said, in Mandarin, words to the effec t of “you know what you are here for” and “trust your lawyer”. Again, I found their assertions to be c ompletely groundless. 

33     The role that interpreters play in c ases involving pleas of guilt is espec ially vital, sinc e they assist the c ourt in ensuring that the ac c used understands the nature and c onsequenc es of his plea, and intends to admit without qualific ation to the offenc e alleged against him. Given the importanc e of their work to the validity of guilty pleas, it is perhaps inevitable that in suc h c ases for c riminal revision, allegations against interpreters are almost c ommonplac e. 

34     However, it would be detrimental to the administration of justic e if the c onduc t of interpreters c ould be so easily impeac hed. Ac c used persons should take note that suc h arguments will be summarily rejec ted, unless they c an establish a suffic ient basis for their allegations, and it is demonstrated that the interpreter’s c onduc t undermined any of the three proc edural safeguards outlined above. 

35     In this c ase, Lee and Chiong c ould not offer any reasons to explain why the interpreter, an offic er of the c ourt, would neglec t to translate suc h material evidenc e, and demonstrate suc h a flagrant disregard for his duties. Their c ontentions were c learly unwarranted, and their c ase was further undermined by the c onsiderable lapse of time between the hearing and their petitions. For some 17 months, Lee and Chiong made no c omplaints against the interpreter, and took no ac tive steps to dispute their c onvic tions. It would be unreasonable to expec t the interpreter to be able to rec all details of the proc eedings now, so as to rebut their allegations. 

36     In any c ase, I had no doubt that both Lee and Chiong were aware of the partic ulars of the c harge, and understood the nature and c onsequenc es of their pleas. The notic e of 20 July 2001 c learly informed them that a failure to c omply would amount to an offenc e under s 4(3) of the Ac t. They had rec eived the summons on 27 February 2002, and engaged c ounsel shortly thereafter. They were represented in the c ourt below, and their sons Min Kwang and Wei Kwang were also ac tively 


c onc erned with the c ase throughout. The nature and c onsequenc es of the c harges must have been impressed upon them. 

**_The Agreed SOF_** 

37     Lee and Chiong also argued that the Agreed SOF c ontained errors on the fac e of it, whic h raised serious issues as to its ac c urac y. It is trite law that the c ourt has a legal duty to rec ord a statement of fac ts following an ac c used’s plea of guilt, and to sc rutinise the statement to ensure that all the elements of the c harge are made out. The ac c used need not admit to every fac t alleged in the statement of fac ts, so long as what he does admit c ontains all the essential ingredients of the offenc e he is c harged with: _Mok Swee Kok v PP_ <span class="citation">[1994] 3 SLR 140</span>. 

38     Here, Lee and Chiong c laimed that the Agreed SOF c ontained evidenc e of a material element of the offenc e that was c ontradic tory. Paragraph 3 of the Agreed SOF states that: 

 Based on a detailed survey plan issued by the Chief Surveyor of the Singapore Land Registry, the c hain link meshed fenc ing and bric k retaining wall between No 69 Toh Tuc k Road and No 37 Toh Tuc k Plac e was shown entirely within the ac c used persons’ property, ie No 69 Toh Tuc k Road. 

39     However, Lee and Chiong maintained that a private survey c onduc ted by Ho Huai Hoon Surveyors found that the fenc e was not within their premises. As s 4(1) of the Ac t c onfers a power on the Commissioner of Buildings to issue notic es only to owners of the relevant property, if the fenc e was not within the premises, the BCA’s notic e under s 4(1), and Lee’s and Chiong’s c onvic tions under s 4(3), must be set aside. 

40     Their arguments on this point were flawed for many reasons. In so far as they disputed the definitive statement in the Agreed SOF that the fenc e was within the premises, they had to prove that Mr Tan c onsented to the partic ulars in the Agreed SOF without their authority. As they had not proved their allegations against Mr Tan to my satisfac tion, I found that this partic ular fac t must be taken to have been properly admitted. 

41     In any c ase, the petitioners’ son Min Kwang had c onfirmed their ownership of the retaining wall and fenc e in his letter to the BCA on 15 August 2001. Their other son Wei Kwang had also admitted in his affidavit that the ownership issue had been “c onc lusively settled” by the Singapore Land Authority in February 2003. Having effec tively c onc eded this point, Lee and Chiong c ould not hope to resurrec t the issue now. 

42     Even if I was prepared to reopen the question, Lee and Chiong had failed to adduc e any evidenc e of the alleged private survey showing that the fenc e was not within their premises. A report from the surveyors they c ommissioned would have provided a strong measure of support for their c laims. Tellingly, no suc h report was ever produc ed. It was impossible for me to ac c ept their c ontentions, espec ially when the BCA had produc ed two survey plans from the Singapore Land Registry that direc tly c ontradic ted their c ontention. 

**_The notes of evidence_** 

43     Lee and Chiong also objec ted to the c ontents of the magistrate’s NOE, whic h they c laimed were bare and ambiguous, and failed to reflec t the “nuanc es” of what ac tually happened. 


44     Given the many exigenc ies that judges fac e, it is to be expec ted that the NOE will generally rec ord only the most pertinent aspec ts of the evidenc e, often in point form. Here, the NOE did in substanc e rec ord the most relevant events of the hearing. It was c lear, from a perusal of its c ontents, that both Lee and Chiong had pleaded guilty, indic ated that they understood the nature and c onsequenc es of their plea, and admitted to the Agreed SOF. 

45     Lee and Chiong made muc h of several minor omissions in the NOE. For instanc e, they pointed out that the magistrate did not make any distinc tion between Lee and Chiong. However, sinc e Lee’s and Chiong’s c ases were being heard together and they were obviously c onduc ting their c ases on the same footing, the magistrate had understandably found it unnec essary to refer to them individually. A broad, objec tive view must be taken of the entire NOE. It would be suffic ient so long as the most relevant elements of the hearing are rec orded. To insist on the level of detail that Lee and Chiong argued for would simply open the door to greater delays in c ourt proc eedings. 

**_Delay_** 

46     Even if I ac c epted Lee’s and Chiong’s c ontentions, any injustic e they may have suffered was seriously attenuated by their delay in presenting the petitions. While delay would generally be immaterial in a c ase of injustic e, it may indic ate, in some c irc umstanc es that there was in fac t no injustic e c aused: _Ang Poh Chuan_ , ([22] _supra_ ), followed in _Lim Hean Nerng v Lim Ee Choo_ <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 585</span>. In this c ase, Lee and Chiong c ould not offer any c redible explanation for the lateness of their applic ations. Although it was unfortunate that Lee had suffered from poor health sinc e his c onvic tion, this did not adequately explain the delay of more than 17 months. Chiong was still in a position to present their c ase, and their sons Min Kwang and Wei Kwang c ould also have instruc ted c ounsel to file the petitions. 

47     In fac t, I found it reasonable to infer from the c irc umstanc es that these petitions were filed only as a response to the subsequent 17 Oc tober 2003 c harges against Lee and Chiong, for a c ontinuing offenc e under s 4(3) of the Ac t. They probably began to c onsider petitioning for c riminal revision only after they rec eived the sec ond summons, and were fac ed with the prospec t of a muc h heftier fine. All of this further undermined their c ase that they suffered substantial injustic e in the c ourt below. Their behaviour was c ertainly not c onsistent with that of anyone c arrying the burden of injustic e on their bac ks. 

**_Strict liability and the defence of reasonable care_** 

48     Sec tion 4(3) of the Ac t provides that “any person who fails to c omply with the requirements of any notic e issued by the Commissioner under subsec tion (1) shall be guilty of an offenc e”. The material elements of the offenc e are: (a) a valid notic e issued by the Commissioner to the owner; and (b) failure to c omply. 

49     As there is no express _mens rea_ requirement, Lee and Chiong c onc eded that the provision c reated a stric t liability offenc e. However, they argued that the defenc e of due diligenc e or reasonable c are should have been available to them, following the princ iples in _M V Balakrishnan v PP_ <span class="citation">[1998] SGHC 416</span>; [1998] 1 CLAS 357 and _Tan Cheng Kwee v PP_ <span class="citation">[2002] 3 SLR 390</span>. As Mr Tan failed to inform them of this, they allegedly suffered a serious injustic e that must be set right. 

**_Strict liability_** 


50     In _Comfort Management Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">[2003] 2 SLR 67</span>, I adopted the approac h established in _Sweet v Parsley_ [1970] AC 132 and _Gammon (Hong Kong) Ltd v Attorney-General of Hong Kong_ [1985] AC 1, to dec ide if the relevant offenc e was one of stric t liability. The following opinion expressed by Lord Sc arman in _Gammon (Hong Kong) Ltd_ (at 14) provides a c onc ise set of guidelines: 

 (1) there is a presumption of law that mens rea is required before a person c an be held guilty of a c riminal offenc e; (2) the presumption is partic ularly strong where the offenc e is “truly c riminal” in c harac ter; (3) the presumption applies to statutory offenc es, and c an be displac ed only if this is c learly or by nec essary implic ation the effec t of the statute; (4) the only situation in whic h the presumption c an be displac ed is where the statute is c onc erned with an issue of soc ial c onc ern, and public safety is suc h an issue; (5) even when a statute is c onc erned with suc h an issue, the presumption of mens rea stands unless it c an be shown that the c reation of stric t liability will be effec tive to promote the objec ts of the statute ... 

51     However, it was not nec essary for me to dec ide if s 4(3) of the Ac t did indeed c reate a stric t liability offenc e, as Lee and Chiong c learly possessed the requisite _mens rea_ in any c ase. As I noted earlier, the only material elements of the offenc e were: (a) a valid notic e issued by the Commissioner to the owner; and (b) failure to c omply. It was not disputed that Lee and Chiong had rec eived a valid notic e, and as owners of the retaining wall and fenc e, were obliged to c omply. Onc e they rec eived the notic e, they knew what was required of them, yet they deliberately c hose not to c arry out the nec essary repairs. They were both c learly guilty of an offenc e under s 4(3). 

**_Defence of reasonable care_** 

52     Even if I ac c epted that the defenc e of reasonable c are was available to Lee and Chiong, their c onduc t fell far short of what was required. After rec eiving the BCA’s notic e, they took no steps to c arry out the rec tific ation works. They c laimed that the fenc e was not within their property, yet they did not submit any evidenc e of the alleged private survey they c ommissioned to support their c ontention. Moreover, their son Min Kwang had already ac knowledged that the fenc e fell within the premises as early as 15 August 2001. 

53     Lee and Chiong also asserted that their neighbours at No 37 Toh Tuc k Plac e were responsible for the damage to the fenc e. However, as they failed to produc e any c redible evidenc e to substantiate their allegations, I had no c hoic e but to rejec t their c laims. 

**Conclusion** 

54     For the reasons above, I allowed the c riminal motions to adduc e new evidenc e, but dismissed the petitions for c riminal revision. 

_Criminal motions allowed. Petitions for criminal revision dismissed._
