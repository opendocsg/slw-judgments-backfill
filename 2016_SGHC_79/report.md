**Introduction** 

1       Lee Han Min Garry (“the appellant”) applied in Originating Summons (Bankruptc y) No 68 of 2015 (“the OSB”) to set aside the statutory demand dated 10 November 2014 for the sum of $90,000 (“the demand”) that had been served on him by Piong Mic helle Luc ia (“the respondent”). The appellant’s applic ation was dismissed by the Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) against whose dec ision he filed this Registrar’s Appeal No 310 of 2015 (“the Appeal”). 

2       The Appeal c ame on for hearing before this c ourt. At the c onc lusion of the hearing, this c ourt dismissed the Appeal with c osts. As the appellant has filed a notic e of appeal (in Civil Appeal No 222 of 2015) against my dec ision, I now set out my reasons. 

**The facts** 

3       The appellant married the respondent on 15 August 2010, but the parties are in the midst of divorc e proc eedings instituted by the respondent in Divorc e No 4672 of 2014. 

4       At the material time, the appellant’s residential address was at 88A Shrewsbury Road, Singapore 307845 (“the premises”) whic h is a temple. On 10 and 30 November 2014, the respondent’s solic itors’ proc ess server (“the proc ess server”) attempted to serve the demand on him but did not suc c eed. 

5       On 4 Dec ember 2014, by way of substituted servic e, the proc ess server served the demand on the appellant by posting on the front door of the premises. The proc ess server followed up by filing his affidavit of servic e on 2 April 2015. 

6       Based on the demand, the respondent filed a c reditor’s bankruptc y petition against the appellant in Bankruptc y No 581 of 2015. The proc ess server attempted to serve the appellant with the bankruptc y petition and the respondent’s supporting affidavit (c ollec tively, “the bankruptc y doc uments”) on 12, 13 and 14 April 2015 without suc c ess. 


7       The respondent applied for substituted servic e of the bankruptc y doc uments _vide_ Summons No 1806 of 2015 whic h applic ation was granted on 20 April 2015. Thereafter, on 21 April 2015, substituted servic e of the bankruptc y doc uments was effec ted on the appellant by way of posting on the front gate of the premises. 

8       Ac c ording to the appellant’s affidavit filed 25 August 2015 (“the appellant’s first affidavit”) in support of the OSB, servic e of the demand on him was improper and therefore ineffec tual/invalid. He c laimed that he did not rec eive or have notic e of the demand until after the bankruptc y doc uments were served on him by being wired to the gate of the premises. He pointed out a disc repanc y—the proc ess server’s affidavit of servic e deposed that substituted servic e was effec ted by posting the demand on the _front door_ of the premises whereas in the proc ess server’s note exhibited to the proc ess server’s affidavit, he had stated that on 4 Dec ember 2015 he had posted the demand on the _letter box_ of the premises. In her reply affidavit filed on 15 September 2015, the respondent repeated what the proc ess server said in his note: namely, that servic e was effec ted on the appellant by posting on the letter box of the premises, whic h the respondent deposed was a c onspic uous part of the premises. 

9       In the appellant’s first affidavit, he c laimed (at [4]) that he did not rec eive the demand nor did he see a c opy of the demand on the front door of the premises. He exhibited a photograph of the temple showing its front door inside the premises and the letter box on the c ompound’s wall. He added (at [8]): 

 I am of the view that the [demand] was not posted on the front door of the premises and neither was it posted on the letter box of the said premises. 

10     Apart from the bare statement, no explanation was given by the appellant as to why he did not rec eive notic e of the demand. If, ac c ording to the appellant himself, he was and is the only oc c upant of the temple, why did he not c hec k the letter box daily or regularly? 

11     Reply affidavits were filed by the appellant and one Tay Thiam Chye in response to the respondent’s reply affidavit. It is not nec essary for purposes of the appellant’s c urrent appeal to address those affidavits as they touc hed on the merits of the debt whic h formed the basis of the demand and the bankruptc y petition of the respondent. 

**The decision** 

12     At this junc ture, it would be appropriate to look at rr 96 and 97 of the Bankruptc y Rules (Cap 20, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”). r 96 pertaining to servic e states: 

 (1) The c reditor shall take all reasonable steps to bring the statutory demand to the debtor’s attention. 

 (2) The c reditor shall make reasonable attempts to effec t personal servic e of the statutory demand. 

 (3) Where the c reditor is not able to effec t personal servic e, the demand may be served by suc h other means as would be most effec tive in bringing the demand to the notic e of the debtor. 

 (4) Substituted servic e under paragraph (3) may be effec ted in the following manner: 

 ( a ) by posting the statutory demand at the door or some other conspicuous part of the last 


 known plac e of residenc e or business of the debtor or both; 

 ( b ) by forwarding the statutory demand to the debtor by prepaid registered post to the last known plac e of residenc e, business or employment of the debtor; 

 ... 

 ( d ) suc h other mode whic h the c ourt would have ordered in an applic ation for substituted servic e of an originating summons in the c irc umstanc es. 

 [emphasis added] 

13     Rule 97 relates to applic ations to set aside statuary demands and the relevant provisions read as follows: 

 (1) Subjec t to paragraph (2), the debtor who has been served with a statutory demand may — 

 ( a ) within 14 days; or 

 ( b ) where the demand was served outside jurisdic tion, within 21 days, 

 from the date on whic h the demand is served or deemed in ac c ordanc e with these Rules to be served on him, apply to c ourt by way of originating summons for an order setting aside the statutory demand. 

 ... 

 (5) The applic ation shall be supported by an affidavit — 

 ( a ) spec ifying the date on whic h the statutory demand c ame into the debtor’s hands; 

 ( b ) stating the grounds on whic h the statutory demand should be set aside; and 

 ( c ) exhibiting a c opy of the statutory demand. 

14     As stated earlier at [9]–[10], the appellant gave no explanation why the demand did not and/or would not have c ome to his notic e. He failed to c omply with r 97(5)( _b_ ) of the Rules. The c ourt was also sc eptic al of his c ontention that he had no notic e of the demand when the bankruptc y doc uments had in fac t c ome to his notic e. 

15     In this regard, the c ase of _Re Rasmachayana Sulistyo (alias Chang Whe Ming), ex parte The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2005] 1 SLR(R) 483</span> is instruc tive. There, the petitioner bank who was the judgment c reditor made several attempts to effec t personal servic e of the requisite statutory demand on the three judgment debtor plaintiffs. Servic e was made by three modes, namely (i) by the proc ess server leaving a c opy of the demand at the address of the debtors’ nominated forwarding agent in Singapore; (ii) by way of advertisement in the Straits Times newspaper; and (iii) by leaving c opies of the demands at the debtors’ last known residential addresses. However, the bankruptc y petitions were only served on the debtors’ nominated forwarding agent. The debtors appealed to a judge against the dec ision of an Assistant Registrar in granting the bankruptc y petitions and dismissing the debtors’ objec tions that the statutory demands had not been effec tively served. In dismissing the debtors’ appeals, the judge held _inter alia_ (at [21]): 


 The essenc e of the servic e requirements under the [Bankruptc y Rules] is to ensure that the statutory demand, bankruptc y petition and other relevant proc esses are brought to the personal attention of the debtor prior to the hearing of the petition. A bankruptc y order results in the transformation of the legal status of the debtor and ought not to be made unless the c ourt is satisfied that the debtor had ac tual or deemed notic e of the proc eedings. 

16     Even if the appellant did not have ac tual notic e, he had deemed notic e of the demand as he should have but failed to c hec k the letter box of the premises. 

17     Not surprisingly therefore, when the OSB c ame on for hearing in the c ourt below, the AR felt that there was little merit in the appellant’s applic ation and dismissed it with c osts, noting that the letter box of the premises would c ome within the meaning of a “c onspic uous part” of the premises under r 96(4)( _a_ ) of the Rules set out above. 

18     It was not nec essary for the appellant to depose in his affidavits (and for the respondent to respond thereto) to the c irc umstanc es of the respondent’s loan. In this regard, s 62 of the Bankruptc y Ac t (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”) is relevant. The material portion states: 

 Presumption of inability to pay debts 

62\. For the purposes of a c reditor’s bankruptc y applic ation, a debtor shall, until he proves to the c ontrary, be presumed to be unable to pay any debt within the meaning of sec tion 61(1)( _c_ ) if the debt is immediately payable and — 

 (a) (i) the applic ant c reditor to whom the debt is owed has served on him in the presc ribed manner, a statutory demand; 

 (ii) at least 21 days have elapsed sinc e the statutory demand was served; and 

 (iii) the debtor has neither c omplied with it nor applied to the c ourt to set it aside; 

19     The appellant must disc harge the burden to prove there was invalid or defec tive servic e of the demand on him. If he had suc c eeded earlier in the OSB, the merits of the respondent’s demand would bec ome ac ademic as the respondent would not be able to pursue the matter by filing her c reditor’s petition against him. It is only if the appellant fails to set aside the demand that he would have to c ontest the respondent’s c laim on the merits – either bec ause the “debt” underlying the demand is disputed under s 62 of the Ac t, or he is not unable to pay the “debt” under s 61(1)( _c_ ) thereof. The respondent’s c laim for $90,000 against the appellant was based on his written ac knowledgment of the debt dated 23 May 2013 witnessed by a solic itor, whic h he agreed to but failed to repay within six months. The appellant should not c onflate the two issues (as he had done) by c hallenging the merits of the “debt” against him in the same affidavits in whic h he deposed to the reasons/c irc umstanc es why the demand should be set aside. 

20     At the two Appeal hearings, c ounsel for the appellant repeated her c lient’s error. No submissions were made on why the servic e of the demand was said to be defec tive and/or invalid and c ounsel foc used solely on the merits of the underlying “debt” upon whic h the demand was based. 

21     As I shared the AR’s views that the appellant’s applic ation was without merit, I similarly dismissed the Appeal with c osts fixed at $2,000/to the respondent.
