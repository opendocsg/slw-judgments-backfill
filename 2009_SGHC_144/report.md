**Introduction** 

1       The ac c used is Tharema Vejayan s/o Govindasamy, now 40 years old. He was tried and c onvic ted on the following c apital c harge: 

 [O]n the 1st day of July 2007, at or about 4.41 am, at Bloc k 181 Stirling Road, Singapore, did c ommit murder by c ausing the death of one Smaelmeeral Binte Abdul Aziz, female 32 years, and you have thereby c ommitted an offenc e punishable under Sec tion 302 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. 

Due to sc heduling diffic ulties, the trial took plac e over several bloc ks of dates. 

2       At around 4.39 am on 1 July 2007, a SBS Transit bus driver, Goh Chin Hoc k, who was waiting at a bus-stop in front of Bloc k 181 Stirling Road (“Bloc k 181”) c alled the polic e when he heard a loud ‘thud’ and disc overed the dec eased’s body lying on the ground of that bloc k. Another witness, Hamzah Bin Rasip, also c alled the polic e to report that “someone had jumped down”. The dec eased was dead by the time paramedic s arrived at the sc ene. She was pronounc ed dead at about 5.03 am. 

**The Case for the Prosecution** 

3       The ac c used and the dec eased married in June 2002. They had two c hildren, a son born in Marc h 2003 and a daughter born in Nov 2005. The dec eased filed for divorc e in Marc h 2007 and obtained an interim judgment for divorc e on 13 June 2007. 

4       On 30 June 2007, the night before the dec eased met her death, the dec eased went drinking with her c lose friends, Mathinah Baham d/o Samsudeen (“Mathinah”) and Selvaranee d/o Kanakasabai (“Selvaranee”). The three met in the evening and visited a pub c alled Chakrawathy. The dec eased stayed there with her friends until about 4am on 1 July 2007 when she left the pub alone to return to her unc le’s home in Strathmore Avenue in Queenstown (where she was residing at that point of time). 

5       At about 4.06am, the dec eased c alled a mutual friend of hers and of the ac c used, Abdul Razak s/o P Maudu (“Razak”), telling him that she was drunk and that she was near Queenstown MRT station, whic h is along Commonwealth Avenue and next to Bloc k 181. Bloc k 181 is situated between Stirling Road and Commonwealth Avenue. At that point of time, Razak was at a (now defunc t) pub 


c alled Raagawoods, whic h was then in the vic inity of Tanglin Road. Razak was c elebrating his birthday at the pub with the ac c used and several others. 

6       After ending the c all with the dec eased, Razak c onveyed her message to the ac c used. At the ac c used’s request, Razak drove him to Commonwealth Avenue where the ac c used alighted at the bus-stop in front of Bloc k 27A, whic h is direc tly ac ross the road from Bloc k 181 and next to Queenstown MRT station. Razak then returned to the pub. 

7       When the ac c used alighted, he did not see the dec eased. He then walked ac ross an overhead bridge to the other side of the road where he saw the dec eased sitting at the bus stop in front of Bloc k 181, drunk and wearing a blac k bare-bac k sleeveless blouse. There was also an empty bottle of beer next to her. 

8       Upon seeing the dec eased in that state, the ac c used bec ame angry and assaulted her repeatedly. He then dragged her to the lift lobby of Bloc k 181 whic h had two lifts, A and B. When the 

door of lift A opened, he pulled her inside and pressed the button for the 13th floor, whic h was the highest floor in that bloc k. The ac c used c ontinued to hit her in the lift, at the same time sc olding her for getting so drunk. He also blamed her for not taking time to c are for their c hildren and c hoosing to spend her time drinking with her friends instead. 

9       When the lift reac hed the 13th floor, the ac c used pulled the dec eased to the c orridor outside the first unit from the lift. He c ontinued to assault and sc old her. The ac c used was so “fed up” with the dec eased, espec ially with her drinking problem, that he c arried her body and somehow pushed or threw her over the parapet wall. 

**Prosecution’s Witnesses** 

10     The Prosec ution c alled many witnesses at the trial to provide c ritic al evidenc e as to what really took plac e on 1 July 2007. The evidenc e adduc ed c an be summarised in the following manner. 

**_The autopsy findings_** 

11     The autopsy on the dec eased was performed by Senior Consultant Forensic Pathologist Assoc iate Professor Gilbert Lau (“Professor Lau”) of the Centre for Forensic Medic ine of the Health Sc ienc es Authority (“HSA”). In Professor Lau’s report, the c ause of death was rec orded as “multiple injuries”. Professor Lau found the following injuries (amongst others): 

 Skull A frac ture of the left ala nasi; no c ranial, zygomatic or maxillary or mandibular frac tures were found. 

 Mouth multiple, deep, haemorrhagic lac erations of the gingival muc osa (inner aspec t) of the upper lip and, to a lesser extent, of the lower lip, assoc iated with c omplete disruption of the frenulum and dislodgement of the right upper c entral inc isor; the anterior part of the tongue was also deeply lac erated. 

 Musc uloskeletal 


 System an oblique frac ture of the sternum; multiple rib frac tures; an oblique, frac turedisloc ation of the thorac ic spine; a frac ture of the left sac ral wing; a frac ture of the body of the left pubis; a frac ture of the right superior pubic ramus; frac tures of the medial thirds of both c lavic les; a spiral, mid-shaft frac ture of the right humerus; an open frac ture of the right olec ranon proc ess; an open frac ture of the medial epic ondyle of the left humerus; frac tures of the right tibia and fibula; an open spiral, mid-shaft frac ture of the left femur. 

12     Based on the injuries found on the dec eased, Professor Lau c onc luded that death was “predominantly due to multiple injuries c onsistent with a fall from a height”. In addition, Professor Lau noted that there were marked bruising and swelling on the fac e, whic h was evidenc e of signific ant blunt forc e trauma. At the trial, Professor Lau reiterated his view that the fac ial injuries were most 

likely inflic ted before the dec eased fell.[note: 1] Professor Lau was of the view that in line with blunt forc e trauma, “c onsiderable forc e” was also applied to the fac ial injuries sinc e the left nasal bone was 

frac tured as a result.[note: 2] On c ross examination, Professor Lau also testified that c onsidering the amount of blood loss, it was unlikely that the dec eased would have had the strength to pull herself over the parapet railing to c ommit suic ide: 

 Q: Now, we knew she had tried to c ommit suic ide from the 13th floor before. 

 A: Okay. 

 Q: So c ould she have done that? 

 A: The possibility exists, mere possibility. 

 Q: Why do you say “mere possibility”? Assuming if she wanted to c ommit suic ide --

 A: Yes, but, er --

 Q: ---and she dec ided to c ommit suic ide there--

 A: After being bashed up, as you put it, and bashed to suc h an extent that she bled so profusely that she would have been very c onsiderably weakened, one would wonder whether she would have been in a state to c ommit suic ide. 

**_Toxicology Report_** 

13     The dec eased also underwent a toxic ology examination performed by Dr Danny Lo Siaw Tec k of the Centre for Forensic Sc ienc es of HSA. There was nothing remarkable as the tests showed negative results for c hemic al and drug c onsumption. However, there were 177mg/100ml of ethanol in the sample of blood (oxalated) and 236 mg/100 ml of ethanol in the sample of vitreous humour (i.e. liquid in the pupils). The reading from the vitreous humour was higher than that found in the blood bec ause 

the latter is subjec t to alc ohol elimination through metabolism whereas the former is not[note: 3]. Sinc e the degree of alc ohol intoxic ation of a person is gauged by the degree of ethanol found in the blood, the findings were c onsistent with the fac t that the dec eased had been drinking alc ohol prior to her death. 


**_Relationship between the accused and the deceased_** 

14     As mentioned above, the ac c used and the dec eased married in 2002 and thereafter, the 

dec eased suffered years of abuse[note: 4] c ulminating in her obtaining a personal protec tion order (“PPO) against him on 4 April 2006. After the PPO was obtained, the ac c used was often arrested for breac h of the PPO and the dec eased c alled the polic e whenever their quarrels esc alated. On no less than four oc c asions, the dec eased c alled for polic e assistanc e, alleging abuse and threats by the 

ac c used.[note: 5] 

15     As several witnesses testified, the c ouple had a lot of marital problems. From the start, there were tensions bec ause the dec eased was Muslim and the ac c used was Hindu. There was therefore 

some pressure on the ac c used to c onvert to Islam.[note: 6] Thereafter, throughout the marriage, the 

dec eased’s night shift at work[note: 7] and her drinking habit were a c onstant sourc e of quarrels. They also had disagreements over how their c hildren should be taken c are of. Their relationship further deteriorated when, in early 2006, the dec eased c aught the ac c used sleeping in bed with a girl named 

Rita in their matrimonial flat when she returned home early after her night shift.[note: 8] In turn, the ac c used was also unhappy with the dec eased for leaving home to stay with another man, one Manimaran s/o Arugulavan (“Manimaran”). The dec eased would also often taunt the ac c used with SMS messages stating that she was with someone else who was, unlike the ac c used, a 

gentleman.[note: 9] At one point of time, to avoid c onfrontation, the ac c used also moved out of the 

matrimonial flat to stay in a rented room.[note: 10] This series of events c reated a lot of distrust and suspic ion between the dec eased and the ac c used. 

16     As a result, the ac c used also had a falling out with the dec eased’s sister, believing that the latter had visited a _bomoh_ who c ast a spell on the dec eased, resulting in the dec eased’s behaviour. The ac c used also believed that the sister had c aused a spell to be c ast on him c ausing him to “hear 

voic es” and to get angry easily.[note: 11] Thereafter, to c ounter the situation, the ac c used also c onsulted several _bomohs_ both in Singapore and abroad in an attempt to remove the alleged spells 

c ast on him and his family.[note: 12] 

17     Due to their strained relationship, the dec eased was admitted into the Institute of Mental 

Health twic e and was diagnosed with adjustment disorder and stress.[note: 13] She was released when she was assessed not to be suic idal. Although the dec eased had on oc c asions told her friends that 

she wanted to c ommit suic ide[note: 14], her ex-boyfriend, Govindarajoo s/o Ramu (“Govindarajoo”), who had c ohabited with her before, testified in c ourt that he did not think that the dec eased was suic idal. The dec eased was, in his opinion, someone who would talk about c ommitting suic ide but was 

essentially a person who wanted to move on in life and not quit.[note: 15] 

18     The dec eased had also intermittently terminated several pregnanc ies.[note: 16] In Marc h 2007, the dec eased started divorc e proc eedings against the ac c used and in June 2007, obtained an interim judgment for divorc e. 

**_Events before and after the death of the deceased_** 

19     At the trial, Razak testified that he was the only person at the party who did not drink alc ohol and was therefore the only person in their group who was sober. He testified that the ac c used drank 

a variety of alc oholic drinks (about 10 glasses[note: 17]) that night and he appeared a “little drunk” 


but was unable to c onc lude on his state of drunkenness.[note: 18] However, on c ross-examination, 

Razak agreed that the ac c used c onsumed a lot of alc ohol[note: 19] but he appeared “steady” when c ompared to Steven (another friend at the pub) who was “c ompletely gone”. In this regard, the ac c used himself testified that he had about 12 to 13 glasses of whisky and also some other alc oholic 

drinks.[note: 20] The ac c used also said that eac h glass was about 10 c m high and the whisky when 

mixed with ic e and other mixtures suc h as soft drinks c ame up to about 7 to 8c m.[note: 21] Razak also testified that eac h time the ac c used poured himself a drink, it would be up to “1½ to 2 inc hes”, and 

this was about “slightly more than half” of a whisky glass.[note: 22] 

20     The dec eased fell from the c ommon c orridor of the 13th floor of Bloc k 181. The first unit along 

the c ommon c orridor of the 13th floor belonged to one Nanc y Loh, who testified that she heard loud groaning and banging noises outside her flat that morning but was too afraid to open the door to find out what was going on. She was sc ared and reported what she had heard to the polic e. Similarly, another witness, Hamzah Bin Rasip, who was standing on the ground near Bloc k 181, testified that he heard loud banging noises c oming from the bloc k. 

21     When the dec eased fell from the 13th floor of Bloc k 181, there were two other witnesses in the vic inity – both were SBS bus drivers who were waiting at the bus stop in front of Bloc k 181 for c ompany transport to report for work. Both testified that they had earlier heard sounds of ‘c rying’ c oming from Bloc k 181. Goh Ngern Hoe, one of the bus drivers, testified that he heard a loud sound c oming from the void dec k of Bloc k 181 and, upon turning to look, saw a body lying on the pavement of Bloc k 181. 

22     The two bus drivers saw a man who looked like an Indian, having c urly hair and a thic k moustac he (the ac c used used to sport a thic k moustac he but had a c lean shaven fac e during the trial), at the stairc ase landing leading to the ground floor of Bloc k 181. When the man reac hed the ground floor, he looked to his right in the direc tion of the dec eased’s body and upon seeing the two bus drivers at the bus stop turned to his left and walked away towards the rear of Bloc k 181. Goh Chin Hoc k, the other bus driver, later identified the ac c used in c ourt as the man they saw that early 

morning.[note: 23] 

23     Sometime later that morning at about 4.41am, Razak rec eived another c all from the ac c used asking Razak to pic k him up from the Queenstown Sports Complex along Stirling Road. Razak went with one Pannirselvam s/o Anthonisamy (“Pannirselvam”, also known as “Appu”) to pic k the ac c used up. In the c ar on the journey home, the ac c used, blabbering in a drunken state, mentioned the Malay 

word ‘ajar’ whic h means ‘teac h’[note: 24]. Razak sent the ac c used to his home in Jurong West. During 

the journey, the ac c used appeared drunk, was retc hing[note: 25] and wanted to vomit. Razak 

therefore stopped the c ar to allow the ac c used to vomit at the side of the road.[note: 26] Razak also 

noted that the ac c used stumbled a little while getting out of the c ar to walk home[note: 27]. After dropping the ac c used off, Razak left. 

24     In the afternoon of 1 July 2007, Razak c alled the ac c used to tell him that the polic e was looking for him. The ac c used then arranged to meet Razak and Pannirselvam. 

25     When they met, the ac c used told them what had happened the night before. The ac c used tried 

to explain that he had hit the dec eased bec ause she spoke to him arrogantly[note: 28]. Razak c ould not c onfirm whether the ac c used told him that he “threw her down” or whether the ac c used “let go 


of her grip”[note: 29]. Pannirselvam gave oral evidenc e whic h was inc onsistent with his rec orded polic e statement. In partic ular, Pannirselvam said in c ourt that the ac c used had told him that the dec eased was “on the parapet wall” and the ac c used “was holding on to her legs” but when the ac c used tried 

to pull her bac k”, he had “no strength”[note: 30]. Pannirselvam’s rec orded statement (P338), on the other hand, stated that the ac c used told him that “he threw her down the bloc k” and that “he threw 

the legs over the parapet”[note: 31]. Pannirselvam explained that he was told by the polic e to sign his statement despite the inac c urac ies as he c ould still “go to c ourt to tell the truth”. 

26     The prosec ution thereafter applied under s 147(3) of the Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), to substitute Pannirselvam’s oral evidenc e with his rec orded statement (P338). I allowed the applic ation as I c ould not ac c ept Pannirselvam’s explanation for signing his statement. 

27     The ac c used also told Razak that he would first make arrangements for the c are of his c hildren 

and then surrender to the polic e.[note: 32] When a van appeared at the meeting plac e, the ac c used thought that it was the polic e and walked quic kly away with one of his c hildren. However, it turned out that the van was not a polic e vehic le. The ac c used finally surrendered himself to the polic e two days later on 3 July 2007 at about 9.40 am. 

**_Crime scene & forensic evidence_** 

28     As the polic e proc essed the c rime sc ene, they found blood stains at the bus stop in front of Bloc k 181, a blood trail along the path from the bus stop to the lift lobby of the bloc k and many blood 

stains in one of the two lifts of Bloc k 181 and along the c ommon c orridor of the 13th floor. The polic e 

also found trac es of blood on the floor of the stairc ase between the 13th floor and the 12th floor and 

between the 2nd floor and the ground floor. There were also other bloodstains on the ground floor, leading to the rear of the bloc k. Bloodstained shoeprints were also found at the sc ene. Signific antly, at the bus stop in front of Bloc k 181, the polic e also found a tooth whic h was subsequently sent for post-mortem dental examination and found to be the dec eased’s. Subsequently, the polic e also found more bloodstains in Razak’s c ar although it had been washed in the morning of 1 July 2007. The c ar was later seized and examined. 

**_Forensic findings in respect of the bloodstains_** 

29     The bloodstains were examined by Dr Tay Ming Kiong, Consultant Forensic Sc ientist of the HSA (“Dr Tay”). Dr Tay found that the bloodstains in Razak’s c ar belonged to the dec eased. Dr Tay further found that the dec eased was “dripping blood” when she was moving from the bus stop to the lift lobby of Bloc k 181. The bloodstains on the lift door were also c aused by impac t, whic h Dr Tay opined 

c ould be due to punc hing, slapping or kic king.[note: 33] The bloodstains in the lift were also low lying, 

suggesting that the dec eased did not walk into the lift but was dragged in.[note: 34] This was c onsistent with the findings of Kuah Kim Lian, another forensic sc ientist with the HSA, who found that the tears on the dec eased’s trousers were the result of “pulling and stretc hing forc es exerted on the 

trousers’ fabric s”[note: 35]. 

30     Dr Tay also testified that the heavy bloodstains on the c orridor floor on the 13th floor indic ated that the dec eased was there for some time. Strands of long hair were also pulled out and deposited on both the metal railing on the parapet wall and on the c orridor floor. Dr Tay was of the view that sinc e the hair was matted and soaked with blood, it was likely that the head from whic h it c ame was 

bleeding[note: 36]. 


31     Signific antly, Dr Tay found that “for some time, the vic tim’s bleeding wounds were positioned over the parapet wall, dripping blood onto the storeys below”. Dr Tay c larified in c ourt that given the vertic al flow patterns of the blood, this meant that an objec t (or person) was “stationed” for “some 

time” over the metal railing.[note: 37] In other words, the assailant had used the railing as a pivot to support the dec eased’s body and thereafter, additional forc e was applied for the entire body to go 

over the wall.[note: 38] When pressed to c larify what he meant by “some time”, Dr Tay opined that it 

was diffic ult to gauge but given the drip patterns, it was definitely not something “momentary”[note: 39] and was at least several sec onds long[note: 40]. 

32     Upon c ross examination, Dr Tay was open to the suggestion that the dec eased c ould have 

fallen down on her own in that position or that somebody c ould have pushed her down:[note: 41] 

 Q: So she would be positioned on the parapet wall. 

 A: Yes. 

 Q: Okay. That’s---that’s what I wanted to know, okay. Now, when she was positioned in this---then she c ould have fallen down. 

 A: Mm. 

 Q: Either on her own or somebody pushed her. 

 A: Yes. 

33     The Defenc e also suggested that the dec eased c ould have killed herself, to whic h Dr Tay opined that it was possible but an unlikely event sinc e there were no bloody palm prints found on the 

parapet railing[note: 42]: 

 Q: Now, c ould she have killed herself that day? Bec ause when she was in that position, c ould she have jumped off? 

 A: Then she must get over this, er, barrier that was the parapet wall— 

 Q: That’s right. 

## ... 

 Q: No, c ould she have pushed herself up? You know--

 A: Her height was, I understand, about just---how---how muc h was her height? 

 Q: Doesn’t matter, you c an push yourself up. 

 Court: 1. 


 Witness: 1.61? 

 Court: But her heels were 7.5 c m. 

 Witness: Yes 

 A: But her c entre of gravity would be about, er, 0.55 of her height. That means about---probably about 0.8 something metres, so she still would need to lift herself up, er--

 Q: Yes, lift herself up. 

 A: ---quite a distanc e. 

 Q: She c ould lift herself up, why not? 

 A: But there were no, er, bloody palm prints on that, er--

 Q No, no, I’m--

 A: –Railing 

 Q She c ould have gone up and then— 

 A: She would need, er, something, er, to lift herself up. 

34     Dr Tay also observed that the flowerpots aligned along the parapet wall were undisturbed and while there were bloodstains on the leaves of the plants, the flowerpots did not appear to have been moved. It was therefore unlikely that the dec eased had used the flowerpots to pull herself over the parapet wall: 

 Q: Now we move bac k to P33. Dr Tay, you gave evidenc e in Court that you saw that the pots were upright and no soil was dislodged from the pot. What do you make out of that? 

 A: Er, your Honour, I c an make out that these pots were largely undisturbed. I saw two bloodstains on---on two leaves on the---on the plants and that was all. And the smudges were loc ated some distanc e from the pots, the smears. 

 Q: And are there any stains on the flowerpot? Maybe David c an show that area. 

 A: Er no, your Honour, I did not see any stains on the---on the---on the pots. The rims, as you c an see, are very c lean, the upper rims. There was a part of the pot that broke but at the sc ene, er, I did not see this part on the floor. That means, er, this part broke some time before. This broken part was not observed at the sc ene.[note: 43] 


## ... 

 Q: I’ll show you a photograph that you c overed with us earlier, P33. A few photographs on--I’m showing the undisturbed flower pot soil. And---and a photo earlier, P whic h is a general sc ene to put the bloodstain in perspec tive. P32. 

 A: Yes, your Honour. This photo shows that the heavy bloodstains were loc ated some distanc e from the potted plants. In my opinion, er, it would be highly unlikely for her to have tried to lift herself up if that is one sc enario that you’re---the---you’re c onsidering, to lift herself up by standing on the flower pot and getting over the railing. Bec ause that will most c ertainly tip over the---the potted plant. And also the time that she were to spend trying to get over the railing at that point would c ause substantial amount of blood on the floor next to the potted plaints, whic h is not the c ase here.[note: 44] 

35     The c lose proximity between the dec eased’s body on the ground and the edge of the bloc k (about 90 c m) suggested that the dec eased had fallen without muc h of a “horizontal projec tion”. Any “horizontal projec tion”, in Dr Tay’s view, would have translated into a greater distanc e between the body and the edge of the bloc k. 

 Q: ...Now there’s a distanc e of 90 c entimetres, P21, P21. This distanc e of 90 c entimetres, Dr Tay, c an you tell us more about this? 

 A: Yes, your Honour. This distanc e was--I will say was a very short distanc e from the edge of the building. And it’s very c onsistent with the fac t that her body brushed against the exterior of the parapet wall on the 13th storey. So she prac tic ally just--just went over the railing and then fell down without muc h of a horizontal projec tion away from the building. Bec ause of the height that she fell from, any initial horizontal veloc ity imparted to her on the 13th storey would translate into a fairly large distanc e on her reac hing the ground. So one c an tell, er, there was a very minimal horizontal veloc ity in her motion from the parapet, er, of the 13th storey. 

36     Dr Tay was also able to trac e the path taken by the assailant. In his expert opinion, this was 

what happened. First, the assailant walked from the 13th floor “towards the stairc ase and desc ended 

to the 12th storey lift lobby; the right hand with wet blood held the hand-rails and deposited bloodstains on them”. The assailant then “pressed the button of Lift B to desc ent” but “turned around 

when Lift A arrived first instead”. Thereafter, the assailant exited from the lift at the 2nd floor and desc ended via the stairc ase to the ground floor. The assailant then walked to the rear of Bloc k 181, “leaving inc reasingly faint bloody shoeprints on the floor”. 

37     The polic e took swabs of bloodstains from the c rime sc ene for DNA analysis. The bloodstains found at the sc ene largely belonged to the dec eased. Signific antly, a swab c ollec ted from a 

bloodstain beside the lift button of lift B on the 12th floor of Bloc k 181 returned positive results for 

both the dec eased’s and the ac c used’s DNA.[note: 45] Similarly, another swab c ollec ted from a 

bloodstain on the left lift wall of lift A also turned up positive results for the ac c used’s DNA.[note: 46] The polic e also found a c igarette butt at the bus stop in front of Bloc k 181. The c igarette butt was 


tested and it turned up an unknown male’s DNA, i.e. not belonging to the dec eased or to the ac c used. A swab c ollec ted from a bloodstain on the stairc ase between the sec ond floor and the ground floor of Bloc k 181 tested positive for the DNA of the dec eased and an unknown female. 

38     These swab tests were performed by Ang Hwee Cheng (“Ang”), Forensic Sc ientist with the DNA profiling laboratory of the HSA. Ang testified that all unknown profiles would be searc hed against the national database of DNA profiles, whic h inc luded the DNA profiles of offenders from February 2003 

onwards.[note: 47] This national database for DNA was c alled Combined DNA Identific ation System or CODIS, for short. In this regard, Tan Pang Tiong, the Head of Criminal Rec ords at the Criminal Investigation Department testified that the DNA profile of Manimaran – the man the dec eased lived 

with briefly – was c onvic ted of theft and his DNA sample was taken and stored in CODIS on 19th May 

2005\.[note: 48] 

39     Ang explained that DNA c an be deposited by many means, for example by merely touc hing a lift 

button[note: 49] but this would ultimately be dependent on the individual – how good he or she was as a “shredder” of DNA. In this regard, Ang c onfirmed that the results of the DNA tests were highly 

dependable bec ause “it’s not possible to find the same DNA profile in the whole population”.[note: 50] In other words, Manimaran’s DNA was tested and his was not one of the unknown DNAs found at the sc ene. Similarly, the DNA results showed c onc lusively that the ac c used was in lift A of Bloc k 181 with the dec eased on 1 July 2007.

40     The post-mortem dental examination was performed by Dr Tan Peng Hui (“Dr Tan”), Consultant Forensic Odontologist with the Centre for Forensic Medic ine of the HSA. Dr Tan found that a tooth was missing from the dec eased’s upper jaw. Upon examining the tooth found at the bus stop, Dr Tan c ompared it with the missing soc ket and found that it fit ‘snugly’ into the empty tooth soc ket. This meant that the tooth found belonged to the dec eased. 

41     Dr Tan also found that the “presenc e of the soc ket and assoc iated soft tissue injury suggested that the tooth loss was most likely _peri-mortem_ .” In other words, the tooth was missing _before_ the dec eased died. Although Dr Tan agreed upon c ross examination that without the knowledge of the dec eased’s dentistry before she fell, it was possible that the soft tissue injury was c aused by the fall, he felt that the c ollec tive evidenc e suggested that it was more likely due to a _peri mortem_ injury 

than to the fatal fall[note: 51]: 

 Q: That’s right. So if she had fallen down and you don’t know the state of her – of her dentistry before she died, right, if the state of her dentistry meant that that part c ould have been a very weak part of her body, it c ould have---she c ould have injured herself by falling down? 

 A: Yes. 

 Q: That’s right. That’s what I wanted to hear. 

 A: But—but the assoc iated soft tissue injury on the upper lip and tooth number 17 and tooth 41 c ollec tively suggested an injury more than a fall. 


 Q: Okay. But assuming her—the—tooth had c ome out first—okay, let’s say she fell down and the tooth c ame out first, then the other injuries c ould have been c aused in the fall when she fell down from the height. 

 A: No, bec ause the other injury would have been mar—far more severe if it had been from a fall. 

 Q: Okay. You tell me---okay. 

 A: Yah. 

 Q: She will—if—the tooth was found c lose to where she had fallen down, would you have been satisfied that it was c aused by the fall? 

 A: It—it—it c ould be. 

42     Dr Tan opined that a “blow to the mouth was the probable c ause” of the tooth loss. Dr Tan also found that the dec eased had sustained frac tures of some other teeth, whic h were “c onsistent with trauma sustained by the right side of the jaws”. 

**_Forensic evidence in respect of fingerprints and shoeprints_** 

43     Mohd Yazid Bin Abdullah, a fingerprint expert, analysed four latent prints whic h were lifted at the c rime sc ene. He was of the view that latent print CID/SC/381/07 ‘D’ (P342) matc hed the “left middle fingerprint impression” of the ac c used. This latent print was lifted from the top of the parapet wall. 

44     Although the polic e did not rec over the c lothes and shoes worn by the ac c used on 1 July 2007 (as he had disc arded them at a bus-stop near his home), the polic e seized a pair of light yellowish green ‘US Star’ shoes from the ac c used’s flat. The pair of shoes seized was matc hed against the shoe prints found at the c rime sc ene by forensic sc ientist Chow Yuen San Vic ky. She was of the view that the repeated diamond pattern from the shoes did not matc h three of the shoe prints at the sc ene. (“Meera-63 to 65”) (P311 to P313). However, the shoe prints were left by shoes of a similar size and design as those of the pair seized. 

**Statements by the accused** 

45     After the ac c used surrendered himself to the polic e, he made several statements pursuant to the Criminal Proc edure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Revised Edition). During the trial, the prosec ution sought to admit these statements but the defenc e objec ted as to their admissibility. As a result of this, a trial-within-a-trial was c arried out to determine their admissibility. 

**_Trial-within-a-Trial_** 

46     The ac c used c hallenged the following statements: 


 (a) s 122(6) statement rec orded by ASP Ang Bee Chin (“ASP Ang”) dated 3 July 2007 (“1st disputed statement” or “s 122(6) statement”) 

 (b) s 121 statements rec orded by ASP Cindy New Lay Peng (“ASP New”) on the following dates: 

 4 July 2007 (“2nd disputed statement”) 

 5 July 2007 (“3r d disputed statement”) 

 6 July 2007 (“4th disputed statement”) 

 8 July 2007 (“5th disputed statement”) 

 9 July 2007 (“6th disputed statement”) 

 10 July 2007 (“7th disputed statement”) 

 Collec tively, the “s 121 statements” 

 (c ) Field Investigation Diary, belonging to ASP New, whic h partic ularised the details of a sc ene visit on 10 July 2007 (“Field Investigation Diary”) 

47     It is trite law that the prosec ution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an ac c used’s statement was voluntarily made. The c ourt has to take a global approac h, c onsidering all c irc umstanc es and all that the defenc e has to do is raise the issue of any misc onduc t under whic h the statement was proc ured. If the statement is found to have been made involuntarily, then it would not be admissible. As stated by the Court of Appeal in _Zailani bin Ahmad v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[2005] 1 SLR 356</span> (“ _Zailani bin Ahmad_ ”): 

 42 In our opinion, the entire trial within a trial is to be regarded as a c omposite whole. In exerc ising his func tions as judge and jury, the trial judge should take a global approac h and arrive at his c onc lusion as to whether the Prosec ution had indeed proved its c ase beyond reasonable doubt and not ask himself the question of whether the ac c used had raised any doubt in the Prosec ution’s c ase. 

 43 In our view, the only requirement, if any, on the Defenc e is to raise an issue and bring to light the alleged offending c onduc t of the rec ording offic ers as well as the c irc umstanc es under whic h the statement was given, and if the c irc umstanc es outlined appeared to give rise to an inferenc e or a nagging suspic ion that the statement was tainted by any of the vitiating fac tors, then the statement must be held to be inadmissible. 

48     The test of voluntariness is both an objec tive and subjec tive determination. This was suc c inc tly summarised in _Public Prosecutor v Lim Thian Lai_ <span class="citation">[2005] SGHC 122</span> at [32]: 

 It is also settled law that the test of voluntariness c omprises elements of both objec tivity and subjec tivity. An ac tual threat, induc ement or promise must be found to fac tually exist. Having established that, the fac ts must be c arefully sc rutinised to determine whether the threat, 


 induc ement or promise operated on the mind of the ac c used during the material period, inspiring either the hope of esc ape (whether partial or full) or fear of punishment in relation to the ac tual or prospec tive c harge; see Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP <span class="citation">[1999] 1 SLR 25</span>; Sharom bin Ahmad v PP <span class="citation">[2000] 3 SLR 565</span>. In the final analysis, the c ourt will review all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase in determining whether there were any reasonable grounds for the ac c used to assume that he would rec eive any benefit or avoid any punishment: see Tan Boon Tat v PP <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR 1</span>. If a threat or induc ement is indeed found to have been made, then the prosec ution must prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the original threat or induc ement had effec tively dissipated when the statement(s) in question were made: see Lim Sing Hiaw v PP [1965] 1 MLJ 85. It is not inc umbent on the prosec ution, however, to prove that there is no lurking shadow of doubt or minute vestiges of fear in the mind of the ac c used before a statement is rec orded: Panya Martmontree at 349 and see s 24 of the Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). 

**_(i) Section 122(6) Statement_** 

49     The first disputed statement was rec orded by ASP Ang. The statement was c hallenged on two main grounds. Firstly, it was alleged that the temperature in the interview rooms was too c old when the ac c used made his statement. The ac c used had an asthmatic c ondition but ASP Ang was unaware of this at that point of time. The defenc e c laimed that the ac c used, who was merely wearing shorts and a polo-shirt when he made his statements, was adversely affec ted by the room temperature. In this regard, the ac c used himself testified that both ASP Ang and the interpreter were wearing long 

pants and a Punjabi suit respec tively.[note: 52] As a result of his asthmatic c ondition, the ac c used c laimed that he was labouring under the fear of an asthmatic attac k while he gave his 

statements.[note: 53] Sec ondly, the defenc e also c laimed that ASP Ang had already formed an 

impression of the alleged offenc e[note: 54] and when the ac c used paused, ASP Ang then prompted the 

ac c used to “try to remember”.[note: 55] 

50     ASP Ang c ould not remember what she had said but c onc eded that maybe “onc e or twic e” she 

would say “try to remember”[note: 56]. On re-examination, ASP Ang c larified that what she meant was 

that she might have told the ac c used to “try to remember about what happened”[note: 57].ASP Ang also explained that when she rec orded the statement from the ac c used, she did not know the fac ts of the c ase and therefore did not ask spec ific questions suc h as “did suc h and suc h a thing 

happen?”[note: 58]. The ac c used explained that he followed the alleged prompting bec ause “they knew 

better about this c ase”[note: 59] and this was bec ause “they are polic e”. For the above two reasons, the defenc e argued that the ac c used felt extreme disc omfort from the c old and when asked to sign 

his prompted statement, he just signed it.[note: 60] It was therefore not voluntary. 

**_(ii) S 121 Statements_** 

51     The s 121 statements were c hallenged by the defenc e on similar grounds[note: 61] as the first disputed statement (i.e. the s 122(6) statement). These objec tions applied to all the s 121 statements and I will therefore deal with them together. The s 121 statements were taken by ASP New and not ASP Ang. 

52     Firstly, the defenc e c laimed that the ac c used was feeling very c old when he was giving his s 121 statements and this was made worse by his asthmatic c ondition. Therefore, these statements 

were involuntary. [note: 62] However, ASP New testified that she was unaware of the ac c used’s asthmatic c ondition. Sec ondly, the defenc e c laimed that bec ause the ac c used suffered from c ervic al 


spondylitis, the ac c used was very c o-operative as he was feeling pain and simply wanted the rec ording of the statements to end. Spondylitis is a c hronic degenerative c hange of the ac c used’s 

c ervic al spine due to wear and tear.[note: 63] Like the ac c used’s asthmatic c ondition, ASP New was 

unaware of this and only found out about it during the trial.[note: 64] 

53     As a result of the c old, his asthmatic c ondition and spondylitis, the ac c used c laimed that he was unable to sleep well at night and the s 121 statements were not voluntary as he was not able to 

c onc entrate.[note: 65] 

54     Those were the general c hallenges mounted by the defenc e whic h were c ommon to all statements. I will now set out the spec ific c hallenges whic h were made against the respec tive s 121 statements. 

_(a) Second Disputed Statement – 4 July 2007_ 

55     The sec ond disputed statement was spec ific ally c hallenged on the grounds that the statement 

was not read bac k to the ac c used.[note: 66] Further, the defenc e also argued that there was no 

warning administered under s 121 of the CPC.[note: 67] In partic ular, the defenc e argued that ASP New was aware of the fac ts of the c ase and therefore suggested known fac ts to the ac c used whic h 

eventually went into the statement.[note: 68] 

_(b) Fourth Disputed Statement – 6 July 2007_ 

56     The defenc e c hallenged this statement on the ground that sinc e the third disputed statement 

was in soft-c opy, it was a mere template and ASP New did not read the warning to the ac c used.[note: 69] In addition, the defenc e also alleged that the interpreter read only parts of the statement bac k to 

the ac c used.[note: 70] 

_(c) Sixth Disputed Statement – 9 July 2007_ 

57     The Defenc e c hallenged this statement on the basis that the ac c used c ould not have c hanged the words “we had an argument” to “we had a misunderstanding”. The relevant part of the statement reads: 

 We reac hed home at about 4am that day. Less than an hour, we had 

an argument a misunderstanding while at home and I c hased Meera out of the house. After she left, I do not feel good and went to look for her. She was resting at the void dec k of HDB bloc k and I knew that she went to stay with her sister after that. To what I know, Meera went bac k to stay with Mani sometime later. 

This c hange, the defenc e c laimed, was a tac tic used by the polic e to c reate the impression that the ac c used was alert and was making c hanges as he read through his statement when the ac c used was 

in reality extremely unc omfortable and c old.[note: 71] The ac c used testified that he saw no differenc e 

between the two words “argument” and “misunderstanding”.[note: 72] 

_(d) Seventh Disputed Statement – 10 July 2007_ 

58     The defenc e c hallenged the admissibility of this statement bec ause ASP New admitted that she did not ask the interpreter to read bac k the previous statements to the ac c used before proc eeding to 


(^1130) At 13th storey, through Ravi, the ac c used informed that the plac e seemed new to him. _It was not familiar to him. The accused then led us to the corridor where he said that the place is familiar_. He was asked why was it familiar and he replied that he c annot tell why. He just know that it was there. He remembered seeing the window. The ac c used then pointed to the plac e along the c orridor in whic h he sc olded and slapped the dec eased. The ac c used informed that he made Meera sit, leaning against the parapet wall. He sc olded and slapped her. Her legs were bent. Her head slidded to the ground, nearer to the lift. The ac c used was angrier seeing that and he pic ked the dec eased up and threw her over the parapet. (emphasis added) take his statement on 10 July 2007.[note: 73] In addition, the defenc e c laimed that the warning in s 121 was similarly not read to the ac c used.[note: 74] The ac c used also c laimed that he was expec ting to see his c hildren when he gave this statement and this was why he was all the more c ooperative when rec ording the statement.[note: 75] **_Entries in the Field Diary_** 59 ASP New also brought the ac c used on a c rime sc ene visit to Bloc k 181 on 10 July 2007 and noted her findings in her Field Diary. Although ASP New testified that she rec orded whatever the ac c used said c ontemporaneously, the defenc e c laimed that it was not logic al for the ac c used to c ome out of the lift and c laim that the plac e was not familiar, only to state that it was familiar moments later. I reproduc e the relevant parts of the field diary below: This, the defenc e argued, suggested that the polic e had rec orded the sec ond statement (“ _the accused then led us to the corridor where he said that the place is familiar_ ”) bec ause they knew that the first statement (“ _it was not familiar to him_ ”) showed that the ac c used c ould not remember the c rime sc ene and was therefore detrimental to their c ase. At trial, the ac c used testified that he never c laimed that the plac e was familiar to him and maintained that the surroundings of Bloc k 181 were hazy when they went on the sc ene visit.[note: 76] 60 The defenc e also c laimed that the ac c used was weak-willed and upset during the field trip. This again was bec ause he did not sleep well at night as he was c old and was experienc ing a lot of nec k pain. Given that the investigation offic ers already had a prec onc eived notion of the fac ts in this c ase, the field trip was an ac ademic exerc ise whereby the ac c used merely replied in the positive to promptings by the polic e on what had happened in their view.[note: 77] **Decision of the court in the trial-within-a-trial** 61 After hearing the submissions from both parties, I found that the prosec ution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements were obtained voluntarily from the ac c used. I now set out my reasons below. 62 The defenc e referred to the c ase of _Public Prosecutor v L Hassan & 2 Ors_ <span class="citation">[1988] SGHC 357</span> (“ _L Hassan_ ”) as showing fac ts analogous to the present c ase. In L _Hassan_ , although the defenc e c laimed that the sec ond ac c used was put through c old air-c onditioner treatment (as the defenc e here did), Rubin J in finding that the statements rec orded from the sec ond ac c used were inadmissible, did not plac e muc h weight on this. Instead, the statements were inadmissible bec ause the 


investigating staff sergeant had told the sec ond ac c used that the first ac c used had named him as an ac c omplic e and that the sec ond ac c used should therefore agree with it. 

63     While the defenc e c laimed that the statements in this c ase were made under heavy prompting, there was no evidenc e to suggest this. In fac t, the interpreter testified that ASP Ang provided no 

prompting at all times[note: 78]: 

 Q: Okay, But what he told us also is that bec ause he was unable to remember – 

 A: Mm-hm 

 Q: -the suggestions c ame from ASP Ang and of c ourse you interpreted to him, you know— 

## A: I – 

 Q: -and she knew the fac ts of the c ase, you see. 

 A: Mm-hm. 

 Q: I mean being a rec ording offic er you know the fac ts of the c ase. And then you interpreted her suggestions to him. 

 A: No, Sir. No, Sir. She did not prompt in any way. 

 Q: Yes. 

 A. No. 

 Q. Did not prompt. 

64     While ASP Ang may have asked the ac c used to “try to remember about what happened”, I did not think that this alone c ould by any measure result in any form of induc ement or oppression. Most importantly, the polic e statements and the field investigation diary c ontained details whic h only the ac c used knew and therefore c ould not have been suggested by anyone. In partic ular, in the s 121 statement rec orded on the 4 July 2007, the ac c used stated that he had “used [his] fist and boxed against the lift wall as [he] was frustrated to see her [i.e. the dec eased] in [that] state”. A blood swab was c ollec ted from the lift wall of lift A at Bloc k 181 and this swab matc hed the DNA of the ac c used. However, the laboratory report was only made available some _two_ months _after_ the rec ording of that statement. In other words, there was no way ASP New c ould have known of this DNA matc h at the time of rec ording to have suggested suc h details to the ac c used. Looking at all the statements as a whole, they c ontained detailed ac c ounts of the inc ident that night and I was satisfied that the statements and the field investigation entries were not obtained by suggestions but were true ac c ounts of the events. 

65     The Defenc e also relied on [77] of L _Hassan_ , whic h spelt out the grounds on whic h Rubin J rejec ted the statements from the third ac c used in that c ase. Notably, the third ac c used was subjec ted to long periods of interrogation without rest. The third ac c used in L _Hassan_ was arrested at 


about 11.20pm on 6 January 1997 and was thereafter not allowed proper rest until 1.45 pm the next day save for a short respite between 6.05 am and 8.10 am and between 9.40 am and 10.50 am on 7 January 1997. However, the fac ts of the present c ase are vastly different. The ac c used here was not sleep-deprived at all. Indeed, most of the statements in the present c ase were rec orded in half a day and the ac c used had ample breaks in between for lunc h. The c ase of L _Hassan_ was therefore c learly inapplic able. 

66     The ac c used may have had c omplaints about the room temperature but ASP Ang c onfirmed that while the ac c used was not given any hot drinks in the c ourse of rec ording his s 122(6) 

statement,[note: 79] she only c ommenc ed rec ording the statement after the ac c used had taken his 

dinner. The ac c used would have been given a pac ket of food and a _hot drink_ for dinner.[note: 80] ASP 

Ang also testified that she did not see the ac c used shivering.[note: 81] 

67     With respec t to the s 121 statements, ASP New also testified that the ac c used did not c omplain to her about anything during the rec ording of his statements and that the ac c used was 

instead very forthc oming in giving his statements.[note: 82] I found no reason to doubt the c redibility of ASP New’s testimony. Although ASP New did not know that the ac c used had asthma, she did ask 

him if he was feeling well before proc eeding to take his statements.[note: 83] Moreover, as ASP New c onfirmed in her testimony, the temperature in the interview rooms was 26 degrees Celsius and this 

was c entrally c ontrolled[note: 84] for _both_ the loc k-up rooms and the interview rooms[note: 85]. The temperature of these rooms was therefore not deliberately reduc ed to c reate any form of oppression. 

68     While reac tion to c old would vary from person to person, the ac c used had ac c ess to hot water. His request for blankets was turned down only for safety reasons. Indeed, when the ac c used asked for a blanket, the station sergeant c hec ked with the ac c used if he had a fever and he did not have 

one.[note: 86] The ac c used’s request for a blanket was not ac c eded to only bec ause he was c onsidered a “high risk ac c used” and a blanket was not allowed to be issued to him for fear that he 

might use it to c ommit suic ide.[note: 87] 

69     As for the ac c used’s nec k pain (the c ondition of spondylitis), ASP New c onfirmed that the ac c used had at all times ac c ess to a doc tor. The ac c used had on five oc c asions between 4 July and 

9 July[note: 88] refused to take parac etamol for his pain. Parac etamol was presc ribed to him by the doc tor for the pain experienc ed as a result of spondylitis but the ac c used refused to take it bec ause he felt that it would be ineffec tive. While the ac c used may feel that parac etamol would be ineffec tive, I was not in a position to disagree with the diagnosis of a doc tor who had seen the patient. 

70     During the c ourse of the trial, the ac c used also c omplained of nec k pain and I direc ted ASP New 

to inform Queenstown Remand Prison to ensure that he rec eive medic al attention.[note: 89] The ac c used was subsequently given a nec k brac e to wear during the trial and he did put it on whenever he wanted to. 

71     On the evidenc e, I rejec ted the ac c used’s allegations that his statements were not voluntary bec ause he was weak-willed or upset during the rec ording of the various statements as a result of feeling c old the night before or of lac k of sleep or as a result of his nec k pain. 

72     On the issue of tampering and c oerc ion, I did not believe the assertion that the 6th disputed statement was tampered with by the polic e in the sense that the word ‘argument’ was c hanged to 


 (a) The ac c used was by virtue of intoxic ation, entitled to the general defenc e of intoxic ation under s 85 and s 86 of the Penal Code. 

‘misunderstanding’ to c reate the impression that the ac c used was alert during the c ourse of taking his statements. There was simply no evidenc e to support suc h an allegation. Similarly, there was also no evidenc e to suggest that the polic e had c oerc ed or even induc ed the ac c used to give answers during the sc ene visit. 

73     With respec t to the alleged absenc e of a c aution before the rec ording, it is trite law that this in itself does not prevent a statement from being admitted into evidenc e. As stated by the Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v Mazlan bin Maidun and Anor_ <span class="citation">[1993] 1 SLR 512</span> at [37]: 

 [A] statement rec orded from a suspec t or an ac c used under s 121(1) and sought to be admitted in evidenc e under the provisions of s 122(5) may be so admitted even if no c aution has been read to him in terms of s 121(2); but if, in addition to these c irc umstanc es, he was told at the time he made the statement that he was bound to state truly everything he knew c onc erning the c ase, suc h statement may not be admitted by reason of his having been induc ed to make it, within the meaning of s 122(5). 

74     In essenc e, the “only c irc umstanc e where a statement made by an ac c used whether in polic e c ustody or not, may not be admitted in evidenc e is where it s tainted by induc ement, threat or promise.” ( _Mohamed Bachu Miah v PP_ <span class="citation">[1993] 1 SLR 249</span> at [50]; _Public Prosecutor v Lim Thian Lai_ <span class="citation">[2005] SGHC 122</span> at [42]) Therefore, the alleged failure to read bac k the statements to the ac c used also did not affec t the admissibility of the statements, so long as they were voluntarily obtained ( _Public Prosecutor v Leong Siew Chor_ <span class="citation">[2006] 3 SLR 290</span> at [90]; _Panya Martmontree and Others v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[1995] 3 SLR 341</span> at [6]; and _Public Prosecutor v Vanasan Sathiadew and Others_ <span class="citation">[1989] SGHC 87</span> at [29]). 

75     Lastly, while the ac c used would undoubtedly have wanted to see his c hildren, I did not think 

that this c onstituted any induc ement on the part of the polic e as far as the 7th disputed statement was c onc erned. The polic e did not withhold visitation rights in order to proc ure the statements from the ac c used. 

76     For the above reasons, I found that the polic e obtained the statements and the field investigation entries without any threat, induc ement or promise. I therefore admitted the s 122(6) statement, the s 121 statements and the field investigation entries at the c onc lusion of the trialwithin-a-trial. 

**The Case for the Defence** 

77     Part of the c ase for the defenc e had initially proc eeded on the grounds that the ac c used was not at Bloc k 181 or in its vic inity on 1 July 2007 but that another man, Manimaran, was the one at the sc ene. This line of defenc e was however abandoned as the trial proc eeded bec ause the evidenc e adduc ed showed c learly that it was the ac c used and not Manimaran who was there that early morning. 

78     The c rux of the defenc e was that: 


 (b) The ac c used was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the killing and therefore entitled to the defenc e of diminished responsibility under Exc eption 7 in s 300 of the Penal Code. 

 (c ) The ac c used was provoked by the ac tions of the dec eased and therefore entitled to the defenc e of grave and sudden provoc ation under Exc eption 1 in s 300 of the Penal Code. 

 (d) The dec eased c ommitted suic ide. 

79     In support of the above defenc es, two witnesses were c alled, a psyc hiatrist and the ac c used himself. With respec t to the ac c used, his evidenc e did not shed muc h light on what happened that early morning bec ause he testified that he c ould not remember what happened from about 3 am on 1 July 2007 at Raagawoods to the time he woke up at about 3 pm the same day. However, he was able to testify as to his drinking habits and other bac kground fac ts. 

**_(i) Defence of Intoxication_** 

80     Although the ac c used c ould not remember how muc h he drank at Raagawoods , he testified that he would usually drink onc e or twic e a week. His drinking habit started with stout when he was 

17     and he started drinking whisky only from 2006.[note: 90] When the ac c used drank stout, he would usually drink about one or two bottles. The ac c used also admitted upon c ross examination that he 

“knew his limit” and would usually be able to hold his drinks quite well.[note: 91] The ac c used also testified that he would usually not mix his drinks – if he started with stout, he would c ontinue drinking 

stout. Conversely, if the ac c used started with whisky, he would only c ontinue drinking whisky.[note: 92] In this regard, although the ac c used c ould not remember what happened that night, he said that 

as far as he knew, he had only c onsumed whisky and not tequila. Similarly, the ac c used did not rec all drinking a mixed alc oholic drink c alled Graveyard, said to be a very strong drink. 

81     The ac c used would usually finish his drink before refilling his glass.[note: 93] In other words, the ac c used would refrain from refilling half-filled glasses. The ac c used agreed during c ross examination that while he would only refill an empty glass, it was possible that his friends c ould have refilled his half empty glass that early morning. The ac c used did not pay any attention as to whether his friends 

did that.[note: 94] 

82     The ac c used would usually pour half portions eac h of whisky and Coke into his glass. He would also add ic e into the drink. Eac h whisky glass was about 6.5 c m in width and 10c m in height. This was done by estimation in c ourt using a water bottle bec ause no whisky glass was seized from Raagawoods. Neither was any bill seized to indic ate how muc h liquor was purc hased. In any c ase, any bill seized would indic ate only the amount of alc ohol purc hased to be shared among the ac c used and Razak’s friends. There would not be any indic ation from the bill alone how muc h alc ohol was ac tually c onsumed by the ac c used himself. 

83     Dr Tommy Tan Kay Seng (“Dr Tommy Tan”), a forensic psyc hiatrist having his own prac tic e at Novena Medic al Centre, gave evidenc e that based on his c alc ulations the ac c used was suffering from ac ute alc ohol intoxic ation that morning. Dr Tommy Tan’s report on the ac c used person’s level of intoxic ation is reproduc ed in full below: 

 Estimated blood alc ohol c onc entration at time of offenc e 


Tharema was drinking from about 1am to 4am. His own ac c ount was that he had drunk 12 to 13 “pegs” of whisky with c oke. The word “peg” is a lay word whic h meant a pour of alc ohol. There is no standard amount of a pour. However, a standard measure of liquor in any bar or pub in Singapore is 30ml. A self-pour drink c an be more than 30 ml, although it c ould also be less, depending on the drinker and the c ompany. Ac c ording to Tharema, his one peg of his whisky is like a pour similar to “teh tarik”. 

In estimating blood alc ohol c onc entration, I have used the most c onservative estimates of the many variables (The only non variable is the c onc entration of alc ohol in whisky and most liquors, whic h is 43%.) 

Perc entage of water in a male human body is usually estimated at 60% (I used 70% so that there was even more water volume to dilute the alc ohol c onsumed.) Body metabolism of alc ohol is between 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. (I have used the higher figure.) 

His weight c ould ac tually be less at the time of the alleged offenc e as he c ould [have] gained weight during his remand. 

Assuming that on average one pour of whisky is 30mls. 

12     pours = 360 mls of whisky 

= 155 mls of alc ohol (average c onc entration of whisky is 43% alc ohol) 

= 124 gms of alc ohol (spec ify gravity of alc ohol is 0.8) 

= 124000 mgs of alc ohol 

Tharema’s weight was 57 kg. 

Therefore his water volume was (assuming a c onservative 70% of body weight) 

= 40 kg 

= 40 l 

= 400 dl 

Blood alc ohol c onc entration without metabolism 

= Amount of alc ohol/body water volume 

= 124000 mgs/400 dl 

=310 mgs/dl 

Metabolism of alc ohol is 20 mg/dl per hour. 

From 1 am to time of alleged offenc e = 3.75 hours. 

Total amount of alc ohol metabolised = 3.75 x 20 


 = 75 mg/dl 

 Estimated alc ohol level at time of alleged offenc e = 310 – 75 mg 

 = 235 mg/dl 

 At this level of blood alc ohol c onc entration, there is slurring of speec h, whic h would be c ompatible with Mr. Razak’s observation that Mr. Tharema was slurring in speec h. 

 If we assumed that he had 10 drinks, instead of 12 drinks in 3 hours, his blood alc ohol c onc entration at the time of alleged offenc e would have been 183 mg/dl. At this level, his c ognition and judgment would be affec ted and there would be motor in-c oordination. 

 This would be c ompatible with his ac c ount that he thought that he was at the bloc k of his flat. He brought his wife to the 13th floor bec ause he was staying at the 13th floor in Jurong West. 

 His Judgment was very affec ted by the alc ohol he had drunk. He had made a mistake about the bloc k of flat. Henc e it is plausible that he did not know the blac k objec t on the floor whic h he threw over the parapet was his wife. It is equally plausible that he c ould not form the intention to kill his wife. 

 Tharema had ac ute alc ohol intoxic ation (F10.0, ICD 10; 300.00 DSMIV-TR) at the time of the alleged offenc e. 

During c ross-examination, Dr Tommy Tan c onc eded that his c alc ulations were at best an estimation bec ause intoxic ation was subjec t to many variables. 

 Q: Yes, and c an you tell us, you know, for alc ohol intoxic ation, whether a person is intoxic ated---what are the things, what are variables, you know. How shall I put it? There are c ertain things that would c ome into play in a c alc ulation, right? 

 A: Yes 

 Q: Like I have seen in your c alc ulation--

 A: Body weight. 

 Q: Body weight--

 A: Amount c onsumed. 

 Q: ---metabolism rate. 

 A: Yes. 

 Q: Whether he had eaten before. 

 A: Yes. So it---it is, we, only at best an estimation. 


84     Dr Kenneth Koh, a c onsultant psyc hiatrist in the Institute of Mental Health, Singapore, was c alled by the prosec ution to rebut Dr Tommy Tan’s expert evidenc e. Dr Kenneth Koh took a different view. In his report dated 21 January 2008, after interviewing both Razak and Pannirselvam, Dr Kenneth Koh took the view that the ac c used was intoxic ated but was nonetheless still able to form the intention to murder the dec eased. The report is reproduc ed as follows: 

 Both Mr Abdul Razak and Mr Pannirselvam c onfirm that Mr Tharema had c onsumed a fair amount of alc ohol in the hours prec eding the alleged offenc e. 

 After listening to their ac c ounts of the behaviour of Mr Tharema just before and after the alleged ac t of homic ide, my original opinions stated in my report to the c ourt dated 30 July 2007 remain unc hanged. I am of the further opinion that while he may have c onsumed alc ohol just prior to the alleged offenc e, he was not so intoxic ated as to have been unable to form intent. 

85     Dr Kenneth Koh elaborated on his views while testifying in c ourt. He explained that while the ac c used was intoxic ated, it was not to the extent that he was unaware of his ac tions. To the c ontrary, the ac c used informed Dr Kenneth Koh that he did not think he was drunk at the material time bec ause, in the ac c used’s words, “I know my limit”. In the expert’s opinion, the objec tive fac ts showed that the ac c used’s ac tions were very organised that early morning and they appeared to follow a fairly logic al sequenc e with no abnormal bizarre disorganised behaviour. The ac c used had enough c ontrol of himself to be aware of what he was doing although the alc ohol probably did disinhibit him in his c ontrol and perhaps judgment as well. 

**_(ii) Defence of Diminished Responsibility_** 

86     The ac c used testified that he suspec ted that blac k magic had been used on him and his family. The ac c used c onsulted a _bomoh_ after his son suffered from c onstipation and after the ac c used was 

unable to perform during sexual interc ourse with the dec eased.[note: 95] The ac c used testified that the dec eased was also affec ted by blac k magic bec ause she had moved about the house in a seemingly unc aring manner and also bec ause she started to lose weight as well. When c onsulted, a medic al doc tor did not find any problems with the dec eased’s health but a _bomoh_ told the ac c used that a spell had been c ast on his entire family. The ac c used c laimed that the dec eased also believed that blac k magic had been c ast on her. It was also his belief that someone had c ome to his house 

and sprinkled something at his doorstep.[note: 96] In essenc e, the ac c used testified that he believed that unless he c ould find a stronger _bomoh_ than the spell c aster to c ounterac t the blac k magic put on his family, matters would worsen for his entire family. 

87     In this regard, Dr Tommy Tan was of the view that the ac c used was suffering from a psyc hiatric c ondition termed “delusional disorder – persec utory type” whic h was c harac terised by a belief that the dec eased’s sister had been using blac k magic to c ause problems to his marriage by plac ing c harms on him, his wife and their son. Dr Tommy Tan testified that the delusional disorder would c ause the ac c used to make “delusional interpretations” of events whic h oc c urred around him, 

interpreting them as events resulting from blac k magic .[note: 97] Dr Tommy Tan was therefore of the view that the ac c used c ould qualify for the defenc e of diminished responsibility. The salient parts of Dr Tommy Tan’s report are reproduc ed as follows: 

 Diagnosis 

 Mr Tharema Vejayan s/o Govindasamy has delusional disorder – persec utory type (F22.0, International Classific ation of Diseases, edition 10; 297.1 Diagnostic and Statistic al Manual IV 


## TR). 

 It is c harac terised by a paranoid delusion that his sister in law had been using blac k magic on him to c ause him to have problems with his wife; he believed that the sister-in-law has plac ed c harms on him, his wife and son. He believed that she is doing so bec ause he and his wife broke off relationship with the sister-in-law and husband. 

 Mental state examination showed that he bec ame very angry and agitated eac h time he talked about his sister in law. He believes that his sister in law has c harmed or used blac k magic on him and his family. He said that he c ould not understand why his wife has c hanged so suddenly and there were so many problems in his marriage. 

 The delusional disorder is c ommonly related to the events in the person’s life and c ommonly arises in middle age. In this c ase, he developed a delusion when he and his wife were having problems after the birth of their sec ond c hild and after his wife was estranged from her sister. He believes that his sister in law has used blac k magic to c ause problems in his marriage and she was doing it bec ause he had c aused a break up between her and Smaelmeeral. 

 It is a delusion as it is a false and unshakable belief. He was very agitated eac h time he talked about his sister in law using c harms or blac k magic on him. It is a false belief about his sister in law wanting to harm his marriage and he c annot be shaken from this belief. 

 It is usual for him and other patients to seek treatment for their symptoms from traditional healers. He attributed his marital problems to a spiritual c ause or blac k magic. 

 Tharema said that he had killed his wife. He said that he c ould not understand why he had done so. He believes that the blac k magic had c aused him to kill his wife. 

 ... 

 Opinion 

 Mr Tharema Vejayan s/o Govindasamy has delusional disorder – persec utory type whic h is c harac terised by a belief that his sister in law is using blac k magic to c ause problems to his marriage by plac ing c harms on him, his wife and son. 

 ... 

 He c an qualify for the defenc e of diminished responsibility at the time of the alleged offenc e. He has abnormality of mind induc ed by disease (delusional disorder – persec utory type) whic h substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his ac ts that c aused the death of his wife. 

88     Dr Kenneth Koh also testified in rebuttal on this defenc e. He was of the view that before a delusional disorder c ould be diagnosed, one must first suffer from a delusion. A delusion was defined by him as a false unshakable belief not in keeping with the soc ial and c ultural bac kground of the patient. Dr Kenneth Koh was of the further view that sinc e blac k magic was believed by the ac c used person’s family and friends and is ac tually quite a c ommonly held belief of people in this region, this was in keeping with the soc ial and c ultural bac kground of the ac c used. The ac c used was therefore not suffering from any delusion. In addition, the ac c used also did not suffer from any psyc hotic symptoms, whic h would otherwise indic ate that he was suffering from a delusional disorder. 


89     Dr Kenneth Koh submitted a report on the mental state of the ac c used on 30 July 2007. The relevant parts of the report are reproduc ed below: 

 Mental State at Time of Alleged Offence 

 Mr Tharema presented as a man who was attentive during the interview and displayed no odd behaviour. 

 He denied having any symptoms of psyc hosis at the time of the inc ident or ever before. Thus, he did not experienc e any halluc inations or delusions. His speec h was relevant with no evidenc e of thought disorder. He also did not experienc e any feelings of his thoughts being interfered with. 

 There was also no evidenc e that his mood was signific antly disturbed during the time of the alleged offenc e. There was no sustained period of low mood, sleep or appetite disturbanc e, impairment of c onc entration or experienc e of anhedonia. 

 Opinion 

 I am of the opinion that: 

1\. Mr Tharema does not suffer from any mental disorder. 

2\. He was not of unsound mind at the time of the alleged offenc e. 

3\. He is c urrently fit to plead in a Court of Law. 

4\. As Mr. Tharema has no mental disorder, he does not have an abnormality of mind that would have signific antly impaired his responsibility for his ac tions. 

90     I asked Dr Tommy Tan why, if the ac c used was suffering from a delusion that his sister in law had used blac k magic on his family, he c hose to attac k his wife and not the sister in law. In other words, what was the nexus between the delusion and the killing of the dec eased? Dr Tommy Tan c andidly admitted that he was unable to provide an explanation for this and that the ac c used c ould not assist him on this bec ause he c ould not rec all the events of that fateful morning. 

**_(iii) Possibility of Suicide_** 

91     The defenc e also alluded to the fac t that the dec eased had a history of being suic idal. In this regard, the ac c used testified that the dec eased had previously attempted suic ide and was thereafter warded in the Institute of Mental Health in 2006. Although the dec eased was diagnosed with adjustment disorder at the Institute of Mental Health, Dr Tommy Tan was of the view that suc h a diagnosis did not nec essarily mean that the dec eased was _not_ suic idal. Dr Tommy Tan pointed out that the diagnosis of “adjustment disorder” by the Institute of Mental Health was non-spec ific as 

there were at least seven types of adjustment disorders.[note: 98] An adjustment disorder c ould be a prolonged depressive reac tion or a brief one. Dr Tommy Tan was of the view that although the Institute of Mental Health had diagnosed the dec eased as not suic idal, that c ould be due to the fac t that the dec eased had entered a “safe environment” and was therefore no longer suic idal. However, ac c ording to Dr Tommy Tan, this also meant that the dec eased c ould bec ome suic idal again onc e she was out of that “safe environment”. 


 A: Erm, the diagnosis made by Dr. Lee is a very non -spec ific diagnosis. Er, it c omes under the rubric of 43.2 International Classific ation of Diseases, er, WHO. And it says---states all subjec tive stress and distress, emotional disturbanc e usually interfering in soc ial func tion and performanc e. Okay. And here it reads---it c lassifies that at least – one, two, three, four, five, six – seven types of adjustment disorders, okay. 

 Q: Yes. 

 A: There’s nothing in the report that states what kind of adjustment disorder is she, the dec eased was suffering from, all right. 

 Q: Yes. 

 A: It c an be a brief one whic h lasts for a month. It c an be a prolonged one. A brief depressive reac tion, ac c ording to this book--

 Q: Yes 

 A: ---whic h c an last up to a month or a prolonged depressive reac tion that lasts up to 2 years. So if you’re talking about an adjustment disorder, it’s not like an ac ute reac tion to a situation. It is a prolonged---it is a ---it is a disorder that lasts for a period of time. So it’s not the morning before---the night before she had a fight with her husband, she attempted suic ide, she goes to a hospital, she settles down and that’s it. If it was the c ase, then there’s no need for the hospital to give, er, the dec eased another appointment. The fac t she gave another appointment and er, she didn’t turn up. Rather the husband turned up. So she was suffering for a prolonged or well, a mental disorder of some period of time, not something that is just that night alone. 

 Q: Yes, sure, sure. 

 A: Okay. 

 Q: All right. 

 A: And the other thing is just bec ause she may not be suic idal, all right, when she admit to the hospital, a lot of our patients who are suic idal before admission bec ome nonsuic idal bec ause they c ome into a safe environment. 

 Q: Yes. 

 A: Okay, and when they c ome to a safe environ---environment and the doc tor makes sure that everything is well with her and that she c an go bac k to, er, proper c are, they will release her. So it’s not normal for her not to be suic idal the following day.[note: 99] 

**Decision of the court in the trial proper** 


92     The prosec ution grounded its the c ase on s 300(a) and 300(c ) of the Penal Code. The respec tive sub-sec tions provide as follows: 

 Murder 

 300. Exc ept in the c ases hereinafter exc epted c ulpable homic ide is murder – 

 (a) if the ac t by whic h the death is c aused is done with the intention of c ausing death; 

 ... 

 (c ) if it is done with the intention of c ausing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflic ted is suffic ient in the ordinary c ourse of nature to c ause death; 

**_Whether the accused was present at the crime scene?_** 

93     Although the Defenc e had suggested the possibility that it c ould have been the dec eased’s exboyfriend, Manimaran, who was at the sc ene, the objec tive fac ts c learly plac ed the ac c used with the dec eased on 1 July 2007. Several blood swabs were taken at the sc ene as evidenc e but none was c onnec ted to Manimaran. As set out above (see [38] ), the Head of Criminal Rec ords testified that Manimaran’s DNA was in the national DNA database and this meant that Manimaran’s DNA would have been c ompared with the blood swabs c ollec ted to see if there was a matc h. Not only were positive blood swabs matc hing the ac c used’s DNA found at the sc ene (both in lift A and on the parapet wall 

on the 13th floor of Bloc k 181), there were also two bus drivers who saw and identified the ac c used as the man they saw at Bloc k 181. Razak’s testimony also showed unequivoc ally that the ac c used was dropped off in the vic inity of Bloc k 181 and pic ked up a little later in that same area. The ac c used had gone to Queenstown to look for the dec eased. Clearly, the ac c used was at Bloc k 181 and its vic inity on 1 July 2007 and had met the dec eased. 

**_Actus Reus: Whether the deceased committed suicide or was thrown over the parapet wall?_** 

94     There were also suggestions that the dec eased might have c ommitted suic ide. However, the polic e statements made by the ac c used showed that the ac c used had thrown or somehow pushed the dec eased over the parapet wall. I would refer in partic ular, to the statements made to ASP Cindy New on 10 July 2007: 

 Q2: Can you tell me how hard did you slap Meera while at the bus stop? 

 A2: I was angry at that time, to me, I slapped her in normal way. This is the way I slapped her throughout from the bus stop to the bloc k and even before I threw her off. 

 Q5: You led the polic e to the c orridor of the 13th storey, where you threw Meera down. Can you desc ribe how you throw Meera over the parapet? 

 A5: I remembered that after I c arried Meera to my c hest level to let go of her over the parapet I stood only my toes and put my hands over the parapet and let go of Meera. During the proc ess, Meera’s body did touc h the metal railing. 


 (emphasis added) 

Similarly, the ac c used desc ribed during the sc ene visit how he had thrown the dec eased down from 

the 13th floor. I refer to the field investigation diary as reproduc ed here: 

 1130 ...The ac c used informed that he made Meera sit, leaning against the parapet wall. He sc olded and slapped her. Her legs were bent. Her head slidded to the ground, nearer to the lift. The ac c used was angrier seeing that and he pic ked the dec eased up and threw her over the parapet. The ac c used informed that he did not move the position of the dec eased’s body before he threw her down the bloc k. He carried the deceased with her head and her legs over the parapet together. The dec eased did not struggle. She was saying something but the ac c used do not know what she was saying. After throwing her over the parapet, the accused turned and walked away. 

 (emphasis added) 

95     Dr Tommy Tan felt that suic ide was a high probability, given the dec eased’s history of suic ide attempts. However, Dr Lau pointed out that the dec eased had lost a lot of blood and it would not have been possible for her to muster the strength to pull herself over the parapet wall. It was also c lear that the dec eased was quite intoxic ated then and would not have been able to c ommit suic ide without any help. The forensic evidenc e at the sc ene did not suggest suic ide at all. Even if the dec eased had ventilated to her friends her desire to die, her ac tions on 1 July 2007 c ertainly did not indic ate that she was suic idal or depressed, although she may have missed having the c ompanionship of the ac c used after their divorc e. To the c ontrary, the dec eased was out partying and having a good time with her friends and parted with them in a jubilant mood. Committing suic ide c ould not have been on her mind. 

96     For the above reasons, I found that the ac c used had indeed thrown or pushed the dec eased over the parapet wall to fall to her death. Although the ac c used’s desc ription of how the dec eased went over the parapet wall was different from the rec onstruc ted version by the prosec ution’s forensic experts, this was immaterial to the c harge. In his statements, the ac c used stated that he had “put [his] hands over the parapet and let go of Meera”. The prosec ution’s forensic experts on the other hand were of the view that the dec eased was “pivoted” over the parapet wall for “some time” before being pushed over. Given that the ac c used c laimed total amnesia about the c ruc ial moments, the verac ity of his version in his statements c ould not be tested in c ourt. The evidenc e still showed that 

the ac c used c aused the dec eased’s death by c ausing her to fall from the 13th floor of Bloc k 181. 

97     For the above reasons, I found that the dec eased did not c ommit suic ide and that the ac c used had thrown or pushed her over the parapet wall. The _actus reus_ for murder was therefore established. 

**_Mens Rea: Whether the accused had the requisite intention under ss 300(a) and (c) of the Penal Code?_** 

98     The _mens rea_ required in s 300(a) is the intention to kill the dec eased, whereas s 300(c ) only requires that the ac c used had the intention to c ause bodily injury to the dec eased of a nature whic h is suffic ient in the ordinary c ourse of nature to c ause death. 


99     I agree with the defenc e that the ac c used originally went to Queenstown with the intention to find his ex-wife and not to kill her. After all, the ac c used was out drinking and he would not have been able to antic ipate the dec eased’s phone c all for help. 

100    Intention should be distinguished from motive. The Court of Appeal noted in _Ranwilage Fernando v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 893</span> (“ _Ranwilage Fernando”_ ) at [45] that all that is required in a murder trial is “proof of the ac t” and _mens rea_ : it is “not nec essary to establish motive”. This muc h was also noted in Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan & Chan Wing Cheong, _Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore_ (LexisNexis, 2007) (“ _Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore_ ”) at [9.32]: 

 Intention is also different from desire and motive. Desire and motive involve c onsideration of a person’s ‘feelings’ or of their reasons for behaving in a partic ular way. Intention is a more ‘neutral’ term and a person may intend something without desiring it...A mother who suffoc ates and kills her young son, who is c lose to death and in great pain from terminal c anc er, intends to kill him. This is so even though she wanted to spare him further suffering and the last thing she would ever have really wanted or desired would have been to kill her own c hild. Her underlying reasons for ac ting in this way must fall to be c onsidered, if at all, through the general and spec ial exc eptions and not through the question of intent. 

 (emphasis added) 

101    An intention to kill c an often be inferred objec tively from fac ts surrounding the fatal wound or injury inflic ted upon the dec eased. Relevant fac tors inc lude the kind of weapon used, the loc ation of the injury and also the number of injuries found on the dec eased. Therefore, it was suffic ient for an intention to kill to be inferred in the c ase of _Ranwilage Fernando_ bec ause it was a single stab wound to a _vital_ organ ( _Ranwilage Fernando_ at [46].) Similarly, multiple wounds inflic ted on the...vic tim by a sharp objec t...only lead to one and only one c onc lusion – that the person who c aused them had intended to c ommit murder” ( _Public Prosecutor v Krishna a/l Gurumurthi & Ors_ [2000] 1 MLJ 274 at 310). 

102    While the ac c used may have intended originally to bring the dec eased home, the situation obviously c hanged after he saw the state of the dec eased at the bus stop. In this c ase, by throwing 

or pushing the dec eased over the parapet wall from the 13th floor, death was a prac tic al c ertainty. It c an therefore be inferred that the ac c used intended to kill the dec eased (See _Neville v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 153</span> and _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Watt Song_ <span class="citation">[1993] SGHC 159</span>). At the very least, by c ausing the dec eased to fall down from that height, the ac c used c ertainly had the intention to c ause suc h bodily injuries (i.e., the multiple injuries sustained from the fall) that were suffic ient in the ordinary c ourse of nature to c ause death (see also the autopsy report above). 

103    It is not possible to identify the exac t moment at whic h the ac c used formed an intention to kill or to c ause the fatal bodily injuries to the dec eased. The ac c used attac ked the dec eased vic iously at the bus stop. It was therefore possible that the ac c used formed the requisite intention at the bus stop. It was equally possible that the ac c used formed the intention only when he pressed the lift 

button for the 13th floor. In any c ase, the exac t point at whic h the requisite intention was formed is immaterial bec ause by c ausing the dec eased to fall from that height, the only reasonable inferenc e was that he intended her death. 

104    For the above reasons, I found that the ac c used threw or pushed the dec eased over the 

parapet wall at the 13th floor and in doing so, either intended to kill her or to c ause suc h bodily 


injuries that were suffic ient in the ordinary c ourse of nature to c ause death. Therefore, the elements of sec tions 300 (a) and (c ) were amply established. 

**Law of Intoxication** 

105    The ac c used also invoked the defenc e of intoxic ation. The defenc e of intoxic ation is spelt out in s 85 and s 86 of the Penal Code: 

 Intoxication when a defence 

 85.—(1) Exc ept as provided in this sec tion and in sec tion 86, intoxic ation shall not c onstitute a defenc e to any c riminal c harge. 

 (2) Intoxic ation shall be a defenc e to any c riminal c harge if by reason thereof the person c harged at the time of the ac t or omission c omplained of did not know that suc h ac t or omission was wrong or did not know what he was doing and — 

 ( a ) the state of intoxic ation was c aused without his c onsent by the malic ious or negligent ac t of another person; or 

 ( b ) the person c harged was, by reason of intoxic ation, insane, temporarily or otherwise, at the time of suc h ac t or omission. 

 Effect of intoxication when established 

 86.—(1) Where the defenc e under sec tion 85 is established, then in a c ase falling under sec tion 85(2)( a ) the ac c used person shall be ac quitted, and in a c ase falling under sec tion 85(2) ( b ), sec tion 84 of this Code and sec tions 314 and 315 of the Criminal Proc edure Code [(Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)] shall apply. 

 (2) Intoxic ation shall be taken into ac c ount for the purpose of determining whether the person c harged had formed any intention, spec ific or otherwise, in the absenc e of whic h he would not be guilty of the offenc e. 

 (3) For the purposes of this sec tion and sec tion 85 “intoxic ation” shall be deemed to inc lude a state produc ed by narc otic s or drugs. 

106    As noted in _Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore_ at [25.3], there are essentially three forms of the defenc e of intoxic ation: 

 Three forms of the defenc e of intoxic ation c an be extrac ted from these provisions. The first is where a third party had malic iously or negligently c aused the ac c used to bec ome intoxic ated to the extent of not knowing the ac t to be wrong or what he or she was doing. This is sometimes desc ribed as involuntary (or non self-induc ed) intoxic ation. The sec ond form of the defenc e is where the ac c used was so severely intoxic ated as to have been insane at the time of the alleged c rime. Thirdly, an ac c used will be ac quitted of a c rime whic h has intention as an element should intoxic ation have prevented him or her from having that intention. For the sec ond and third forms of the defenc e, the intoxic ation c ould have been voluntary(or self induc ed). 

**_(i) Section 85(2)(a)_** 

107    On the fac ts, the first form of the defenc e under s 85(2)(a) c learly does not apply bec ause 


there was no evidenc e of involuntary intoxic ation. In fac t, the ac c used was c elebrating Razak’s birthday and any c onsumption of alc ohol was therefore done with his full knowledge. 

**_(ii) Section 85(2)(b)_** 

108    On the sec ond form of the defenc e under s 85(2)(b), the Court of Appeal in _Tan Chor Jin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[2008] 4 SLR 306</span> (“ _Tan Chor Jin_ ”) c larified at [24] that insanity by intoxic ation was a c onc ept to be distinguished from the defenc e of unsoundness of mind under s 84. While the ac c used need not show that he was suffering from a permanent mental disease, insanity by intoxic ation still required him to show that he was unaware of what he was doing or that his ac tions were wrong: 

 24 We are of the view that the two c onc epts – viz, unsoundness of mind in s 84 on the one hand and insanity by reason of intoxic ation in s 85(2)(b) on the other – are indeed different. One should not be too astute to attribute statutory superfluousness to Parliament where the use of the word “insane” in s 85(2)(b) is c onc erned. Sec tion 85(2)(b) refers to a different basis for exoneration from that afforded by s 84 as the former is grounded on intoxic ation-induc ed insanity. In c ontrast, the unsoundness of mind embrac ed by s 84 refers to an abnormal state of mind that c overs diseases and defic ienc ies of the mind, both of whic h are invariably permanent c onditions. The referenc e to “temporarily or otherwise” in s 85(2)(b) is neither ac c idental nor superfluous. These words do not refer merely to the temporary symptoms or effec ts of intoxic ation. Rather, they refer to an abnormal state of mind that c an, inter alia, be transient. In short, s 85(2)(b) reinforc es the point that an otherwise normal person c an, under the influenc e of drink or drugs, bec ome so intoxic ated that he bec omes legally “insane”. This c ondition of insanity c an be transient, as opposed to the unsoundness of mind envisaged in s 84, whic h must be permanent. 

 While the ac c used need not show that he was suffering from a permanent mental disease to fall under s 85(2)(b), any form of intoxic ation induc ed insanity however transient must be shown to be of suc h a “degree that [the ac c used] did not know that his ac tions were wrong or did not know what he was doing. 

109    On the fac ts, there was nothing to show that the ac c used did not know what he was doing or that what he was doing was wrong. I disagreed with the defenc e that the ac tions of the ac c used 

showed that he was a “raving mad man”[note: 100]. On the c ontrary, I agreed with the prosec ution that the ac c used was very muc h aware of what was happening for the reasons that follow. 

110    Firstly, after alighting from Razak’s c ar, the ac c used c alled him to thank him for the ride to Queenstown as he (the ac c used) was talking with the dec eased over the phone during the journey there and he had forgotten to thank Razak when he alighted. I do not think that a person intoxic ated to the extent c laimed would have the presenc e of mind to be making a c all and then remember subsequently he had not thanked Razak. 

111    Sec ondly, the ac c used told the polic e that he had brought the dec eased into the lift so that he c ould slap her “out of the view of others”. This showed that the ac c used was aware of his surroundings and did not want anyone to see him beating up his ex-wife. I reproduc e the relevant portion of his statement rec orded on 5 July 2007: 


 5 About 20 minutes later, Razak c ame with another friend, Appu. I got into his c ar and he asked if everything was alright. I told them everything was fine and I told him to drive home. Razak drove off after he dropped me at my bloc k. I went home to shower and c hange my c lothing. I plac ed my tee shirt, jeans and shoes that I wore earlier into a plastic bag. After that I left my house and walked to my brother’s house about 2 streets away. I threw the plastic bag containing my clothing and shoes at the bus stop along the way to my brother’s house. 

 (emphasis added) 

 Q13: With referenc e to paragraph 2 of your statement, why did you drag her to the bloc k in front of the bus-stop? 

 A13: Ac tually, I wanted to bring her to the c hairs at the bloc k, to make her sit down and freshen up. I c arried her by her armpit with my right hand and dragged her there. After we passed by the c ar park in front of the bloc k, I saw the drunken state she was in and c ould not take it anymore. I wanted to slap her some more and dec ided to do that inside the lift, out of the view of others. 

112    Thirdly, as explained by Dr Tay, the ac c used desc ended from the 13th floor to the 12th floor 

using the stairc ase, from the 12th floor to the 2nd floor using the lift and thereafter walked down the 

stairs from the 2nd floor to the ground floor. This was an elaborate way to desc end from the 13th floor and this showed his presenc e of mind bec ause he c learly had a logic al plan to avoid being seen by others. The fac t that a bloodstain belonging to the ac c used and to the dec eased was found beside 

the lift button of lift B[note: 101] at the 12th floor indic ated that the ac c used had wanted to take lift B 

down to the 2nd floor but somehow lift A c ame up. This was only logic al bec ause lift A was c overed in blood and the ac c used probably did not want to be seen c oming out of that lift. This showed a logic al mind whic h was inc onsistent with the assertion of alc ohol-induc ed insanity. 

113    Fourthly, when the ac c used reac hed the ground floor, he saw the two bus drivers looking at him. The drivers testified that the ac c used had turned to his right to look at the body of the dec eased and upon seeing the bus drivers, the ac c used turned and walked away towards the bac k of Bloc k 181. This showed again that the ac c used wanted to avoid detec tion. 

114    Fifthly, the ac c used managed to c all Razak to pic k him up from Queenstown Sports Complex. This showed that the ac c used knew where he was at that point of time. If he had read the name of the plac e from a signboard, that showed that at the very least, he was still sober enough to read. Razak had dropped off the ac c used at a different loc ation one street away and if not for the ac c used’s instruc tions, would not know where the ac c used was. The ac c used’s ability to relay information showed that he still had his senses about him. 

115    Sixthly, the ac c used had the presenc e of mind to go home and c hange his c lothes and thereafter dispose of them on the way to his brother’s house. This was c learly an attempt to dispose of c ritic al evidenc e and it reflec ted his c oherent state of mind then. I refer to the polic e statement rec orded on 4 July 2007: 

116    Seventhly, if the ac c used was intoxic ated to the extent c laimed, it would only be logic al for him to suffer from a hangover the next day. However, when he met up with Razak and Pannirselvam later that afternoon, there were no c omplaints from him about a hangover. Similarly, when Razak 


c alled the ac c used to inform him that the polic e was looking for him, the ac c used did not appear to be in a haze as to what it was all about. 

117    Finally, there are the statements given by the ac c used to the polic e and to Dr Kenneth Koh. The ac c used told Dr Kenneth Koh that he “knew his limit” when it c ame to drinking and in his polic e statements, the ac c used said he was not drunk. I refer to the polic e statement rec orded on the 5 July 2007: 

 Q4: Referenc e to Q2, what did you drink at the pub? 

 A4: We reac hed there about 1plus. On our arrival, the birthday dec oration was already done. We just did some final arrangement. I started drinking whiskey, only after 1am. I drink only about 12 to 13 glasses. It was whiskey mixed with c oke, I did not get myself drunk. 

 (emphasis added) 

**_Section 86(2) of the Penal Code_** 

118    Sec tion 86(2) requires two elements to be met. The requirements are suc c inc tly summarised in the Court of Appeal’s dec ision of _Tan Chor Jin_ at [27]: 

 27 We turn now to s 86(2) of the Penal Code, whic h is the last of the three avenues through whic h intoxic ation may be raised as a defenc e (see [17] above). Two requirements must be met before this subsec tion c an be suc c essfully invoked. First, the ac c used must show evidenc e of his intoxic ation. In this regard, objec tive evidenc e of the ac c used’s level of intoxic ation is c ruc ial (see Jin Yugang v PP <span class="citation">[2003] SGCA 22</span> at [32]). Sec ond, even if the ac c used c an prove that he had c onsumed a c onsiderable amount of alc ohol, the surrounding fac ts must show that he was so intoxic ated that he c ould not form the intention whic h is a nec essary element of the alleged offenc e (see Mohd Sulaiman v PP <span class="citation">[1994] 2 SLR 465</span> (“ Mohd Sulaiman ”) at 474, [31]). 

119    In respec t of the first requirement, there was a lac k of c lear evidenc e as to the ac c used’s level of intoxic ation. While the ac c used himself c laimed that he drank 12 to13 pegs of alc ohol, his friend Pannirselvam testified that the ac c used drank Graveyard and Tequila as well. However, this would be inc onsistent with the ac c used’s professed drinking habit bec ause he said he did not like to mix his drinks. The only c onsistent evidenc e was that the ac c used drank about 10 to 13 glasses of whisky. While the ac c used managed to estimate the dimensions of the whisky glass and also his pouring habits (half portion of whisky with half portion of c oke), we have to bear in mind that he added ic e to his drinks as well. This would have diluted the ac tual amount of alc ohol c onsumed. 

120    In any event, ac c epting that the ac c used drank a lot of alc ohol at Raagawoods and was intoxic ated, the question is, to what degree? The sec ond requirement of s 86(2) measures the extent of intoxic ation: the surrounding fac ts must show that the ac c used was intoxic ated to suc h an extent that he was unable to form the intention required of the alleged offenc e. 

121    The objec tive fac ts as disc ussed above not only showed that the ac c used was not insane by intoxic ation but also that he was not intoxic ated to suc h an extent that he was unable to form the requisite intention for murder. The ac c used was able to give the polic e a detailed ac c ount of what happened that early morning. The detailed statements were c learly not made by a man who was so severely intoxic ated that he did not know what had happened or c ould not have formed an intention 


to kill. For instanc e, in the polic e statement rec orded on 6 July 2007: 

 Q24: With referenc e to paragraph 4 of your statement, c an you desc ribe how did you pull Meera to the c orridor of the first unit from the lift? 

 A24: When I walked out of the lift, Meera was lying down. I lifted her up by one side of her armpits using my right hand. By the same way, I pulled her out from the lift but she was not able to stand on her feet and she fell to the floor. This time, I did not lift her up, but pulled her by the same armpit with my right arm and dragged her towards the c orridor outside the first unit. When I dragged her towards the c orridor, my right arm was straightened and I was walking in a forward direc tion. 

122    Despite his detailed statements, the ac c used c laimed a state of total amnesia during the trial. While Dr Tommy Tan has explained that his amnesia at trial c ould have been the result of an imperfec t formation of memory due to intoxic ation that night, I found that the evidenc e adduc ed showed c learly that the ac c used had the ability to form the requisite intention on 1 July 2007 and that indeed he had the intention to c ommit murder. 

**Law of Diminished Responsibility** 

123    The ac c used also relied on the defenc e of diminished responsibility under Exc eption 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code, whic h provides: 

 Exception 7 .—Culpable homic ide is not murder if the offender was suffering from suc h abnormality of mind (whether arising from a c ondition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent c auses or induc ed by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his ac ts and omissions in c ausing the death or being a party to c ausing the death. 

124    In _Zailani bin Ahmad_ , the Court of Appeal reiterated the three limbs required of an ac c used person before the defenc e of diminished responsibility is established. The three limbs are: 

 (a) he must have been suffering from an abnormality of mind; 

 (b) suc h abnormality of mind must have: 

 (i) arisen from a c ondition of arrested or retarded development of mind; or 

 (ii) arisen from any inherent c auses; or 

 (iii) been induc ed by disease or injury; and 

 (c ) suc h abnormality of mind as in (b)(i) to (b)(iii) must have substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his ac ts and omissions in c ausing the death or being a party to c ausing the death. 

125    In addressing limb (a), the phrase “abnormality of mind” was desc ribed in _R v Byrne_ [1960] 2 QB 396 (“ _Byrne_ ”) at 403 as “a state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal”. The phrase is wide enough to c over the mind’s ac tivities in all its aspec ts, not only the perc eption of physic al ac ts and matters, and the ability to form a rational 


judgment as to whether an ac t is right or wrong and also the ability to exerc ise will power to c ontrol physic al ac ts in ac c ordanc e with that rational judgement ( _Byrne_ at 403). In essenc e, as illustrated in _Took Leng How v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[2006] 2 SLR 70</span> at [47], the first limb requires two questions to be answered: 

 What warrants emphasis is that limb (a) requires the c ourt to be satisfied not only of the fac t that the ac c used was suffering from a c ondition that a reasonable man would c onsider abnormal, but further that the abnormality was of suc h a degree as to impair the ac c used’s c ognitive func tions or self-c ontrol. This latter requirement foc uses on the “extent” of the alleged abnormality. It is nec essary bec ause a person who suffers some sort of malady that may be deemed as abnormal need not nec essarily suffer from any impairment of his or her c ognitive func tions or ability of self-c ontrol. Limb (a) should never be deemed satisfied unless the extent of the purported abnormality is also established. 

126    It is also pertinent to remember that c onflic ting expert evidenc e would often be adduc ed and while the c ourt c an seek guidanc e from available medic al evidenc e, the c ourt has to draw its own c onc lusion on the matter, taking into c onsideration all the fac ts of the c ase. In this regard, I refer to the c ase of _Zailani bin Ahmad_ at [49] to [50]: 

 49...However, in c oming to a dec ision on whether an ac c used is suffering from suc h an abnormality of mind, the c ourt is entitled to seek guidanc e from available medic al evidenc e. Where the c ourt is fac ed with evidenc e c onflic ting with suc h medic al evidenc e, it is within the disc retion of the c ourt to form its own c onc lusion on the matter, taking into ac c ount other fac ts suc h as the ac ts or statements of the ac c used and his demeanour, and any other c onflic ting medic al opinion: R v Byrne, as ac c epted by this c ourt in DZ v PP <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 22</span> at [21] and [22]. 

 50 In this c ontext, it is a settled princ iple that, even where suc h medic al opinion is unc hallenged, the trial judges would be perfec tly entitled to rejec t or differ from the opinions of the medic al men, if there are other fac ts on whic h they c ould do so: Sek Kim Wah v PP [1987] SLR 107, following Walton v R (1977) 66 Cr App R 25, R v Byrne and R v Kiszko (1978) 68 Cr App R 62. This c ourt’s dec ision in Sek Kim Wah v PP was c ited with approval in its later dec isions in Contemplac ion v PP <span class="citation">[1994] 3 SLR 834</span> at 844, [36] and Zainul Abidin bin Malik v PP <span class="citation">[1996] 1 SLR 654</span> at 661–662, [29] and [30]. 

127    Limb (b) on the other hand c harac terises the basis for the abnormality of mind and is therefore a question of medic al fac t. Limb (b) is a c onc ept to be distinguished from the “reasonable man’s notion of whether someone is suffering from an abnormality of mind” ( _Zailani bin Ahmad_ at [51]). Limb (c ) c onc erns the extent of impairment and requires that the ac c used be substantially impaired by the abnormality of mind. Limb (c ) is “ultimately one for the c ourt to answer” ( _DZ v PP_ <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 22</span>l; _Zailani bin Ahmad_ at [52].) 

128    While a reasonable man who does not believe in blac k magic may think that the ac c used had a state of mind so different from ordinary human beings, it was c lear on the fac ts that the ac c used had a very luc id mind before, during and after killing the dec eased. The same findings relating to the ac c used’s ac ute awareness of the events that fateful morning that disentitled him from invoking the defenc e of intoxic ation also apply here and I need not repeat them. As Dr Kenneth Koh has said, the ac c used had enough c ontrol of himself to be aware of what he was doing although the alc ohol probably did disinhibit him in his c ontrol and perhaps judgment as well, meaning no more than that a person who had imbibed too muc h alc ohol c ould be more daring and impulsive than he might otherwise have been. That falls far short of the requirements of Exc eption 7 in s 300. 


129    Dr Tommy Tan was of the view that the ac c used was suffering from a “delusional disorder – persec utory type”. I was also not c onvinc ed by the c onc lusions of Dr Tommy Tan for the following reasons. 

130    Firstly, Dr Tommy Tan in c oming to his c onc lusions had relied on the ac c used’s ac c ount of hearing voic es and seeing blac k objec ts. I reproduc e the relevant parts of Dr Tommy Tan’s report as follows: 

 Psychiatric Symptoms 

 After he and his wife broke off relationship with the sister-in-law and her husband, many things happened to him. He said that he lost his job. There was something blac k bloc king half of his right eye. 

 He went to see a bomoh in Clementi with a friend named Ric ky for the blac k magic bloc king his right eye. His eye bec ame muc h better after that.... 

 Account of the alleged offence by Mr Tharema 

 Tharema pulled and c arry Smaelmeeral to the nearby bloc k to sit at the c hairs. He saw the lift and he thought he was at his bloc k. He said that he pressed the lift. He sc olded her in the lift bec ause she slipped. When the lift door opened, he realised that was not his bloc k. He saw something blac k on the floor. He said that he just threw the thing. 

However, the ac c used never mentioned suc h “blac k objec ts” in his polic e statements or to Dr Kenneth Koh. It was strange that the ac c used would only mention suc h details a year later in 2008 when he was being examined by Dr. Tommy Tan. Dr Kenneth Koh examined the ac c used about two weeks after he was arrested and observed no psyc hiatric symptoms or signs of any psyc hotic disorder. 

131    Sec ondly, during c ross examination, the ac c used was not only self-c ontradic tory in his evidenc e but also inc onsistent with his ac c ount to Dr Tommy Tan. I reproduc e the relevant parts of his evidenc e below: 

 Q: Did you tell Dr Tommy Tan that while you were on the 13th floor of Blk 181 Stirling Road on that partic ular day, there was a blac k thing c overing your right eye? Did you tell that to Dr Tommy Tan? 

 A: I did not refer to him that the partially blac k eye---partially blind eye on the---the 13 th floor on that day. But earlier, I told him about it. 

 Q: Okay, You told him about it earlier. Spec ific ally, Mr Tharema, did you tell Dr Tommy Tan that you saw something blac k on the floor at the 13th storey of Blk 181 Stirling Road? Did you tell Dr Tommy Tan that? 

 A: Yes I did. 

 Q: Oh you did. So did you ac tually see something blac k on the 13th floor, Blk 181, at the time of the inc ident? 


 A: I have not seen it on that inc ident--

 Q: Yes? 

 A: ---during that inc ident. 

## ... 

 Q: Yes, So did you tell Tommy Tan that at Blk 181 Stirling Road you saw something blac k on the floor and you threw that thing away? 

 A: Yes, I have told him. 

## ... 

 Q: I see. Now let us forget about what you told the psyc hiatrist, the polic e or anyone. Tell us now---tell the---tell his Honour, did you or did you not see any blac k thing on the floor at Bloc k 181 Stirling Road? 

 A: I did not. 

 Q: You did not. Right. So it nec essary follow, right, that you did not then throw the blac k thing away, right? 

 A: Yes. 

 Q: So you have to agree with me, Mr Tharema, that you lied to Dr. Tommy Tan when you said that you threw blac k thing away and you saw the blac k thing at Bloc k 181? Am I right? 

 A: Could be. 

 Q: Yes? Not “c ould be”. It has to be, right? 

 A: That’s right. 

132    In any c ase, as mentioned earlier, Dr Tommy Tan was not able to explain the nexus between the alleged delusion and the killing of the dec eased. This was not a c ase where the ac c used had a delusion about the dec eased and then killed her while under suc h a delusion. 

**The Law of Grave and Sudden Provocation** 

133    The ac c used also pleaded the defenc e of grave and sudden provoc ation under Exc eption 1 to s 300 of the Penal Code whic h provides: 


 Exception 1 .—Culpable homic ide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-c ontrol by grave and sudden provoc ation, c auses the death of the person who gave the provoc ation, or c auses the death of any other person by mistake or ac c ident. 

 The exc eption is subjec t to the following provisos: 

 ( a ) that the provoc ation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an exc use for killing or doing harm to any person; 

 ( b ) that the provoc ation is not given by anything done in obedienc e to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exerc ise of the powers of suc h public servant; 

 ( c ) that the provoc ation is not given by anything done in the lawful exerc ise of the right of private defenc e. 

 Explanation .—Whether the provoc ation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offenc e from amounting to murder is a question of fac t. 

134    The law of grave and sudden provoc ation was rec ently disc ussed in _Seah Kok Meng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[2001] 3 SLR 135</span> (“ _Seah Kok Meng”_ ). There are two requirements to the defenc e. Firstly, the subjec tive requirement that the ac c used was deprived of his self-c ontrol. In asc ertaining the loss of self c ontrol, “it is nec essary to look at the objec tive fac ts” bec ause “mere assertion would not suffic e” ( _Lau Lee Peng_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[2000] 2 SLR 628</span> (“ _Lau Lee Peng_ ”) at [32].) Sec ondly, the objec tive requirement that the provoc ation was “grave and sudden” whic h requires the applic ation of the ‘reasonable man test’ ( _Seah Kok Meng_ at [21]). The ‘reasonable man test’ was introduc ed “to deny the defenc e to those who overreac t bec ause they are ‘exc eptionally pugnac ious and bad tempered and over-sensitive” ( _Public Prosecutor v Kwan Cin Cheng_ <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 345</span> (“ _Kwan Cin Cheng_ ”) at [65]). The question to be asked in the ‘reasonable man test’ is whether an ordinary person would have been so provoked as to lose his self-c ontrol when plac ed in the same situation. In asc ertaining the objec tive test, earlier events and the “mental bac kground” c reated in the ac c used’s mind are relevant fac tors ( _Kwan Cin Cheng_ at [50]). The mental infirmities of the ac c used c ould also be c onsidered if they affec ted the gravity of the provoc ation, but “individual pec uliarities whic h merely affec ted the ac c used’s power of self c ontrol but not the gravity of the provoc ation should not be taken into ac c ount” ( _Lau Lee Peng_ at [29]). 

135    The Court of Appeal in _Mohammed Ali bin Johari v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">[2008] 4 SLR 1058</span> (“ _Johari”_ ) has also observed: 

 102 It is also important to note (in so far as the first requirement relating to a loss of selfc ontrol is c onc erned) that the antithesis of a loss of self-c ontrol is deliberation (and even c alc ulation). The former is a nec essary (albeit not suffic ient) prerequisite before the defenc e under Exc eption 1 will be suc c essful. The presenc e of the latter, on the other hand, indic ates that the provoc ation was not sudden and the defenc e would therefore not suc c eed (see, for example, the Singapore High Court dec ision of PP v Tsang Yuk Chung [1988] SLR 812 at 820, [33], where the c ourt held that “the stabbing was a c alc ulated and deliberate ac t”; see also Lim Chin Chong ([99] supra) at [30] and Seah Kok Meng at [25], as well as above at [96]). It is equally c lear that “[m]ere assertion would not suffic e” (per Chao JA in Lau Lee Peng at [32]). 

 103 It is also important to emphasise that whilst (as c learly set out in the loc al c ase law noted above) there is no requirement of “proportionality” as suc h, the severity of the physic al assault is 


 a fac tor whic h the c ourt would (in most c ases at least) take into ac c ount (see, for example, Seah Kok Meng at [26]). 

136    The alleged provoc ation here was the dec eased’s dressing that night and bec ause the ac c used felt that the dec eased was always out drinking and getting herself drunk. He was therefore “fed up” with her. This muc h was mentioned in his polic e statements. I refer to the polic e statements rec orded on 5 and 6 July 2007: 

 Q8: With referenc e to paragraph 2 of your statement, what do you mean that she was dressed in the manner that you did not like? 

 A8: At that time, she was wearing a half bare-bac k blac k blouse with low c ut nec k line in the front. I think it was too revealing for me, espec ially that she went c lubbing in that dressing and also got herself drunk. I was even more furious when I saw a bottle of ‘Baron’ beer beside her. The alc ohol c ontent for ‘Baron’ beer was muc h higher than ‘Tiger’ beer whic h I think it was not suitable for her as she c annot even stomac h 3 glasses of normal beer. That was why I slapped her. 

(Statement rec orded on 5th July 2007) 

 Q25: With referenc e to paragraph 4 of your statement, what did you intend to do when you pulled Meera out of the lift? 

 A25: When I brought her into the lift was to disc ipline her by sc olding her and slapping her. When the lift door opened at the upper floor, I had to bring her out of the lift... At the c orridor outside the first unit, I made her sit against the parapet wall fac ing the unit...I saw that she was not waking up and not doing anything. I was very angry. I see that there was no use sc olding and slapping her. She was doing he same thing every time, getting herself drunk all the time. I felt ashamed of what she did. I really fed up and I just c arried her up and threw her down the bloc k. 

(Statement rec orded on 6th July 2007) 

137    The defenc e submitted that the ac c used snapped upon seeing the dec eased and that there was grave and sudden provoc ation bec ause the ac c used did not expec t to see the dec eased in a drunken state: 

 So similarly on this oc c asion also, he went to fetc h her home. And he did not expec t her to be in this state, your Honour, as desc ribed in the statement. And your Honour, I’m submitting that the ac c used snapped, your Honour. And there was grave and there was sudden provoc ation, your Honour, on the available evidenc e, and my c lient just suc c umbed and started slapping her, your Honour, going by the statement.[note: 102] 

138    The fac ts showed that the ac c used did not lose self c ontrol and neither was any provoc ation grave and sudden. The ac c used was unhappy about the dec eased’s dressing and her drinking habit but these were points of quarrel in their life together. They had many quarrels in the past on the 


same issues. The ac c used’s ac ts of hitting the dec eased were c onsistent with his quic k tempered nature. There was nothing unusual on 1 July 2007 whic h would have c aused him to lose self c ontrol and to kill the dec eased. The fac t that the ac c used brought the dec eased into the lift in order to bring her out of the public eye was further evidenc e that he was in c ontrol of his ac tions. I disagreed with the defenc e that the ac c used did not expec t the dec eased to be in the state that he found her in. The ac c used was fully aware that the dec eased was out drinking bec ause she had c alled Razak earlier. Henc e, he went to look for the dec eased knowing that she was so drunk she needed help to go home. 

139    In any c ase, I found that the sec ond requirement of grave and sudden provoc ation was also not satisfied. Firstly, it was not the first time that the dec eased had got herself drunk and there had been many quarrels between them over her drinking habits. The ac c used should be well ac quainted with her drinking habits and therefore her drunkenness on 1 July 2007 c ould not have amounted to grave and sudden provoc ation. Sec ondly, by objec tive standards, the c lothes worn by the dec eased were not so revealing that a reasonable person would have reac ted in the same manner that the ac c used did. Indeed, the dec eased was wearing a pair of blac k pants that night and while she wore a sleeveless top, there was also a jac ket belonging to her (whic h she would have worn when she went out drinking) that was found at the bus stop. Her friend, Selvaranee, testified that the dec eased was not dressed in an unac c eptable manner that night: 

 Q: Was that the first time you went to a pub with her? 

 A: Quite a few times. 

 Q: Now, as c ompared to the previous time that she went c lubbing with you--

 A: Mm-hm 

 Q: --c an you desc ribe her dressing that night? 

 A: Erm--

 Q: How---how do you think her dressing was? 

 A: She always used to be in jeans---jeans and the tops. She don’t wear so sexy and all that. She normally c omes in a long pants and a T-shirt or something with sleeveless T-shirts, something like that. 

 Q: The previous times that she went to the pub, how did she dress? 

 A: The same. 

 Q: Is it in jeans or in sleeve--

 A: She was in a, er, jeans also. 

 Q: So her dressing that night, how would you desc ribe her dressing? 


 A: Ac tually the dressing is quite reasonable, not so sexy and all that bec ause she was c overing with jac ket and all that and she---her hair was let go, so I don’t seem there’s any sexiness on that. She just looked very normal, ac tually. 

140    The provoc ation was c ertainly not sudden. If the ac c used was provoked by the drunken state of the dec eased at the bus stop and by what she was wearing, he still had time to c alm down 

bec ause the entire episode from the bus stop to the 13th floor took some twenty minutes. It would 

not have been likely in the c irc umstanc es for any sudden provoc ation to have oc c urred on the 13th floor bec ause the dec eased was so intoxic ated and, after the severe beating and blood loss, would not be in any position to provoke the ac c used. Indeed, she was so weak that the ac c used had to 

rest her body against the parapet wall on the 13th floor. Further, surely the mere slumping of the body into a helpless heap c ould not be a triggering point to a reasonable man. Neither c ould an inability to respond orally by a prac tic ally unc onsc ious woman be deemed to be suc h. 

141    Whether the ac c used was provoked at the bus stop or sometime later, he c learly had time to rec onsider his ac tions but he did not. In any event, there was no evidenc e at all that the dec eased offered any provoc ation verbally or physic ally besides being c ompletely helpless. 

**Conclusion** 

142    For the above reasons, I found that the c harge of murder was made out against the ac c used beyond reasonable doubt and there were no defenc es available to him. Ac c ordingly, I c onvic ted him and passed the mandatory death sentenc e on him.
