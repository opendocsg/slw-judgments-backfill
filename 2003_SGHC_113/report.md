1       Four ac c used persons appeared before me to take a plea in respec t of various c harges against them. The first ac c used was Kalathithar a Subran Hilan; the sec ond, Thankappan Ayyappan; the third Yong Ah Lai; and the fourth, Marni A/P Konasagaran. The third ac c used is the husband of the fourth, Marni A/P Konasagaran. The sec ond, third and fourth ac c used fac ed a total of seven c harges eac h but the prosec ution proc eeded only with the third, fourth, and an amended seventh c harge. The third and fifth c harges were stood down. The first ac c used fac ed two c harges but the prosec ution only proc eeded with the sec ond c harge against him. The first c harge was stood down. These four ac c used persons together with a fifth person, were sc heduled for trial before Justic e Kan Ting Chiu. The sc heduled trial was interrupted bec ause the four ac c used indic ated that they wished to plead guilty to some of the c harges. They thus appeared before me to be dealt with on those c harges. 

2       The c ase against the ac c used persons were c onnec ted in this way. The first ac c used was c harged with the rape of a 13-year old female under s 3761) of the Penal Code. The sec ond, third, and fourth ac c used were c harged with abetment by c onspirac y, in proc uring men to rape the same 13-year old female, under s 376(1) of the Penal Code read with s 109. That was the amended seventh c harge. The fourth and sixth c harges related to proc uring the same 13-year old for the purposes of prostitution, under s 140(1)(b) of the Women’s Charter, and living off the earnings of prostitution, under s 146(1) of the Women’s Charter. 

3       When the plea was taken all four initially indic ated that they were pleading guilty to the c harges. Only Thankappan (the sec ond ac c used) was represented by c ounsel. The first ac c used then addressed me saying that when he had sex with the girl he did not know that she was under 14 years of age and that he paid her for the sexual ac t. In the c irc umstanc es, it appears to me that his plea is suffic iently qualified and ought to be rejec ted. The third ac c used also qualified his plea. I, therefore, rejec ted the plea of guilt of the first and third ac c used persons, and proc eeded with the c ase against the sec ond and fourth ac c used persons. 

4       The c entral figure in this c ase was the first ac c used, so if he is not found to be guilty of any offenc e a c onvic tion against his abettors may ostensibly appear bizarre. But it is not nec essary so. If the c harge of abetment is one of c onspirac y, the offenc e whic h was the subjec t of the c onspirac y need not have been c ompleted for the c onspirators to be guilty. It is not a requirement that the princ ipal offender is c onvic ted before his abettors may be dealt with. The abettors c an be dealt with even where the princ ipal offender is never c aught. However, there is room for improving the proc edure in some of these c ases. Standing down the c harges against the abettors until the trial of the princ ipal offender is one way. But, if the c ourt dec ides that the abettors or c o-ac c used ought to be dealt with first, and separately, then the c ourt dealing with the abettors and c o-ac c used will have to proc eed on the basis of the c ase as it is presented. The first and third ac c used have been 


remitted for trial and are no longer a matter of c omment from this c ourt. Whatever the result may be of their trial, it is best remembered that every c ase is but a mere pastic he in the vast c anvas of c ase law, eac h unto its own, unified where c onsistenc y permits, but stands alone otherwise. In the present c ase, the ac c used persons before me admitted to c onspiring to proc ure men to have sex with a 13-year old girl in c irc umstanc es that they admit amounted to rape. The Statement of Fac ts reveals that the 13-year old girl was taken from her home in Malaysia under the false pretenc e of bringing her to Singapore as a maid. When she arrived, she was forc ed into prostitution. With these fac ts admitted by the ac c used, I ac c epted their plea of guilt and c onvic ted them ac c ordingly. I should note, for c ompleteness, that the admission of the fac ts was also implic itly, but c learly, an admission that there was no c onsent from the young girl to perform the sexual ac ts. 

5       The offenc e of abetment of rape of a 13-year old girl is almost as serious as if the abettors had eac h been the ac tual rapist, but, in sentenc ing the abettors, the c ourt is entitled to take into ac c ount that those offenders who had not forc ed themselves physic ally on the girl. Thus, bearing in mind the general opinion of the c ourt in _Chia Kim Heng Frederick v PP_ <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 361</span>, and applying them with adjustments to the fac ts of the present c ase, I am of the view that a term of imprisonment of 11 years is appropriate. One of the matters that require emphasis here is the c ommitment of the c ourts towards the deterrenc e of sexual offenc es against young c hildren, espec ially where they are subjec ted to prostitution, and drained not only of their innoc enc e, but also of their money. I thus sentenc ed the two ac c used to 11 years imprisonment, and also six strokes of the c ane in respec t of the sec ond ac c used for the amended seventh c harge. I had c onsidered whether the sentenc e of imprisonment in respec t of the fourth ac c used should be higher sinc e no c aning may be inflic ted on her. However, I am of the view that an adjustment upwards is not nec essary. I have also taken into ac c ount the fac t that these two ac c used had pleaded guilty to the c harges, a plea of guilt in this instanc e had spared the c hild from the rigours and ordeal of trial. 

6       An offenc e under s 140(1)(b) and s 146(1) of the Women’s Charter is punishable with imprisonment of up to five years and also with a fine not exc eeding $10,000. In view of the fac t that both ac c used were first offenders, and taking into ac c ount the totality of the overall sentenc es I am of the view that a term of imprisonment of one year and a fine of $5,000 is suffic ient in respec t of eac h of the ac c used. The sentenc es of imprisonment under s 140(1)(b) and s 146(1) are to run c onc urrently but c onsec utively to that under the term of imprisonment ordered under s 376(1) of the Penal Code. In default of payment of fine the ac c used will serve six months for eac h fine unpaid.
