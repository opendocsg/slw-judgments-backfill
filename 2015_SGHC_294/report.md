**Introduction** 

1       This c ase c onc erns a somewhat unique c ommerc ial warehouse development, Novelty Bizc entre (“the Development”). Not only does it c ome with freehold title, it is also equipped with fac ilities suc h as a swimming pool, a gymnasium, a “c hill-out lounge”, an “aromatic garden”, a sun dec k, and other attrac tions whic h are typic ally found in high end c ondominiums. The purc hase of warehouse units in the Development was made even more attrac tive to Haneda Construc tion & Mac hinery Pte Ltd (“the plaintiff”) when it was offered a developer disc ount of 16%. 

2       As things transpired, the plaintiff purc hased not one, but all the eight remaining warehouse units in the Development. It c laimed that it did so not bec ause of the Development’s unique features and disc ounted pric e, but bec ause its property agent, T Tanabakiyam (“the 2nd defendant”), had represented to its direc tors Punitha d/o Vasu Kalingarayar (“Punitha”) and Gopal s/o Muniandy (“Gopal”) on more than one oc c asion that ready sub-purc hasers had been lined up to purc hase the eight units from the plaintiff at a premium of at least 19% above the plaintiff’s purc hase pric e. If true, this would have translated into a very handsome profit for the plaintiff, and the 2nd defendant would have earned two rounds of c ommission from the sale to the plaintiff and the c onsequent sub-sales. 

3       Unfortunately for the plaintiff, one day after it exerc ised the options to purc hase, the Government announc ed new c ooling measures to disc ourage short-term spec ulation in properties. These measures inc luded the implementation of seller’s stamp duty payable on all industrial properties whic h were resold within three years of purc hase. While the 2nd defendant did find sub-purc hasers who paid the option fees for four of the plaintiff’s warehouse units before the c ooling measures were announc ed, only one of the sub-purc hasers eventually c ompleted the sub-sale. In the end, the plaintiff only managed to sub-sell one unit and obtain financ ing to c omplete the purc hase of two other units. It had to forfeit the monies it paid for the balanc e five units to the developer. 


4       The total potential outlay for the purc hase of the eight units was about $10.2m. If the alleged representations made by the 2nd defendant were true, the plaintiff would have made a tidy profit of at least $2m from the sub-sales within a spac e of less than a month. Despite the signific ant financ ial reperc ussions either way, the alleged representations were not doc umented in writing _at all_. Instead, the plaintiff’s c ase is based solely on oral representations allegedly made by the 2nd defendant. Not unexpec tedly, this was hotly c ontested at the trial. 

5       The c ase started off as a c laim in fraudulent misrepresentation. It bec ame somewhat c omplic ated when new lawyers engaged by the plaintiff introduc ed an additional c laim based on an alleged oral c ontrac t. What was not apprec iated by the plaintiff when the c ontrac tual c laim was added was that both c laims were, at least in part, premised on the _same_ disc ussions whic h took plac ed at the _same_ initial meeting. Problematic ally, the terms pleaded in support of the alternative c laims narrated different and inc onsistent ac c ounts of what was said at the _same_ disc ussion during t he _same_ meeting. The plaintiff eventually abandoned the c ontrac tual c laim after the c lose of the trial. Apart from the self-induc ed c ontradic tions between the terms of the alleged oral c ontrac t and the alleged misrepresentations, this c ase is unusual in that the plaintiff is relying on _different misrepresentations_ allegedly made on _different occasions_ whic h, if true, would also have c ontradic ted eac h other. 

6       What then is the effec t of the plaintiff’s ac c ount of the c ontradic tory representations? Does it prove that the representations were unlikely to have been made, or does it only have a bearing on the question of relianc e? Given the c onduc t of the parties before and after the alleged representations, as well as the various twists, turns and U-turns in the plaintiff’s pleaded c ase, was it likely, on a balanc e of probabilities, that the alleged representations were made by the 2nd defendant? The plaintiff also seeks to rec over several atypic al heads of damages. Can the plaintiff rec over the profits it would have earned _if_ the fraudulent misrepresentations were true? Can it rec over the losses it inc urred as a result of the sub-purc hasers’ lawful exerc ise of their rights not to c omplete the sub-purc hases? 

7       The alleged representations c ertainly invite probing questions. If there were truly ready subpurc hasers, why were the sales not c onc luded direc tly with the sub-purc hasers? Punitha c laims that t h e _special_ deal was offered to her bec ause she had previously helped the 2nd defendant. Furthermore, ac c ording to the plaintiff, the 2nd defendant had a financ ial interest in proc eeding on this basis as she would earn two sets of c ommission. Although it appears that Punitha and the 2nd defendant were onc e friends, the one, and perhaps only thing that is c lear about this c ase, is that their relationship has sinc e irretrievably broken down. 

**The parties** 

8       The plaintiff is a c ompany in the business of logistic s and transportation servic es. At the 

material time, Gopal and Punitha, who are husband and wife, were the plaintiff’s direc tors. [note: 1] 

9       The 2nd defendant is a registered real estate salesperson with Huttons Asia Pte Ltd (“the 1st defendant”). The plaintiff’s c laim against the 1st defendant is for vic arious liability in respec t of the 2nd defendant’s fraudulent misrepresentations. Whilst sc ant evidenc e was adduc ed as to the prec ise employment relationship between the 1st and 2nd defendant, it is undisputed that on eac h sale the 2nd defendant transac ts, she keeps 90% of the c ommission earned, while the 1st defendant retains 

the balanc e 10%. [note: 2] 

10     It is also undisputed that Punitha and the 2nd defendant were soc ially ac quainted sinc e 2005. 


[note: 3] The evidenc e suggests that they bec ame rather good friends over time. Prior to the purc hase 

of the eight warehouse units whic h are the subjec t of the present dispute, Punitha and Gopal had purc hased a number of properties through the 2nd defendant. These inc luded four units at Nusajaya 

Square in Iskandar, Johor Bahru, Malaysia bought in mid-2012 [note: 4] , and four units at Enc orp 

Marina @ Puteri Harbour in Malaysia bought in August 2012 [note: 5]. At trial, evidenc e was given that of the eight units in Nusajaya Square and Enc orp Marina @ Puteri Harbour, four were held in Punitha’s 

or Gopal’s names on trust for the 2nd defendant. [note: 6] The exac t trust arrangement between the parties was not explained during the trial probably bec ause it is stric tly not relevant to the present dispute. However, it is at least c lear that it is not unc ommon for Punitha and Gopal to purc hase multiple units in the same development. 

**The plaintiff’s claim** 

11     When the statement of c laim was first filed on 28 January 2014, the plaintiff’s c laim was only in tort for the losses it suffered as a result of its relianc e on the 2nd defendant’s fraudulent misrepresentations. The plaintiff alleged that on 12 Dec ember 2012, the 2nd defendant represented that she “had ready sub-purc hasers for all 8 warehouse properties” and that “the sub-sale pric e 

would be at least S$1,193.00 per square feet” (“the initial representations”). [note: 7] Subsequently, on or about 24 Dec ember 2012, the 2nd defendant allegedly produc ed four c heques from subpurc hasers for four of the eight warehouse units and further represented at the same time that she “would proc ure sub-purc hasers” for the remaining four warehouse units (“the further representations”). 

12     The statement of c laim was amended on 18 February 2014, but the amendments only pertained to c orrec ting the identity of the parties referred to in the statement of c laim where nec essary. 

13     On 12 January 2015, the statement of c laim was signific antly revised and a whole new c ause of ac tion in c ontrac t was introduc ed. The c ontrac tual c laim bec ame the _primary_ c ause of ac tion. The plaintiff had then just instruc ted new lawyers. Substantial c hanges to the plaintiff’s ac c ount of the events were made in Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2): 

 (a) First, in addition to c laiming that the initial representations about “ready sub-purc hasers” were made on 12 Dec ember 2012, the plaintiff c laimed that an oral agreement was reac hed on the same date ( ie , 12 Dec ember 2012) where the 2nd defendant allegedly promised that she “ will procure sub-purc hasers for the 8 warehouse properties at the pric e of, at least, S$1,193/per square foot by the time the Options to Purchase were to be exercised ” [emphasis added] if the plaintiff agreed to purc hase the said units (“the agreement”). [note: 8] 

 (b) Sec ond, while the plaintiff maintained that the further representations were made on 24 Dec ember 2012, the plaintiff added that on or about 8 January 2013 [note: 9] , a further agreement was entered into under whic h the 2nd defendant allegedly agreed that she “ will procure sub-purc hasers for the 8 warehouse properties at the pric e of, at least, S$1,193/per square foot by the time the purchase of the 8 warehouse properties was to be completed ” [emphasis added] (“further agreement”). [note: 10] 

14     The plaintiff made a further revision to its statement of c laim on 27 Marc h 2015. In Statement of Claim (Amendment No 3), the plaintiff maintained its separate c auses of ac tion in tort and c ontrac t. However, perhaps rec ognising (belatedly) the inc onsistenc ies in its pleaded c laims, the plaintiff replac ed all referenc es to the 2nd defendant stating that she “ _will procure_ ” sub-purc hasers 


with an assertion that the 2nd defendant had represented that she had “ _ready sub-purchasers_ ”. The terms of the agreement, further representations, and further agreement respec tively were likewise amended to reflec t the same amendment. 

15     New details were also added in Statement of Claim (Amendment No 3). The plaintiff added that as part of the initial representations, the 2nd defendant had also said that the warehouse units were 

to be sold to the sub-purc hasers _by the time the options to purchase were to be exercised_. [note: 11] This detail was not part of the initial representations in the earlier versions of the statement of c laim. The plaintiff also added that the 2nd defendant had on 24 Dec ember 2012 represented (as part of the further representations) that the plaintiff had “no c hoic e but to exerc ise the Options to Purc hase” 

sinc e Punitha and Gopal had, by then, ac c epted the four c heques from the sub-purc hasers. [note: 12] 

16     On the first day of trial, I asked Mr Christopher Daniel (“Mr Daniel”), c ounsel for the plaintiff, to identify the date of c ompletion, whic h was pleaded as part of the further agreement (see [13(b)] above). When Mr Daniel informed the c ourt that the date of c ompletion is 1 September 2018, it bec ame apparent to the plaintiff that there were serious problems with its c ontrac tual c laim given that on its own pleaded c ase, performanc e was not due until 1 September 2018. Eventually, after the c lose of the trial, Mr Daniel informed the c ourt by letter dated 12 August 2015 that the plaintiff had dec ided to abandon its c ontrac tual c laim. 

17     While the plaintiff might well have abandoned its c ontrac tual c laim, the pleaded oral agreement and further agreement nonetheless represent the plaintiff’s version of the fac ts, and must be taken into ac c ount in assessing the overall c redibility of the plaintiff’s c ase. 

18     As it stands, the only c laim before the c ourt is the plaintiff’s c laim in fraudulent misrepresentation, whic h was the original c laim brought by the plaintiff. Therefore, after several rounds of amendments, the plaintiff is bac k to square one, or perhaps _minus one_ given the several rounds of inc onsistent amendments to its statement of c laim. 

19     The plaintiff pleads that it relied on the initial representations _to pay the option fees_ for the eight warehouse units and it relied on the further representations _to exercise the options to purchase_. Although its relianc e on the initial and further representations was ostensibly for different purposes, they ultimately related to the same transac tions, _ie_ , the purc hase of the eight warehouse units. As suc h, I will examine them c ollec tively and draw distinc tions between them where appropriate. 

20     The plaintiff’s c laim for damages falls under several heads. [note: 13] 

 (a) In respec t of the five units that the plaintiff forfeited, the plaintiff c laims: 

 (i) $1,244,376 being the sum forfeited by the developer; 

 (ii) $76,099.69 for interest c harged by the developer for late settlement; 

 (iii) Loss of profit of $1,224,826; and 

 (iv) $10,613.50 for legal fees inc urred; 

 (v) Less the sum of $227,350 forfeited by the plaintiff from the three sub-purc hasers who dec ided not to exerc ise the options to purc hase. 


 (b) In respec t of the two units whic h the plaintiff c ompleted the purc hase, it c laims: 

 (i) Interest of $5,335.59 c harged by the developer for late settlement; 

 (ii) Loss of profit of $513,241; and 

 (iii) Loss of alternative use of money and loss of antic ipated profits (to be quantified). 

 (c ) The plaintiff also c laims for the losses arising from payments made towards loans and mortgages taken out to financ e the purc hase of the warehouse units, and for the late interest c harges of RM14,423.60 inc urred on Punitha and/or Gopal’s Malaysian properties. It c laims that these c harges were inc urred bec ause of the financ ial diffic ulties c aused by its purc hase of the eight warehouse units. [note: 14] 

These heads of c laim will be separately examined below. 

21     The plaintiff also c laimed damages pursuant to s 2 of the Misrepresentation Ac t (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed). However, Mr Daniel did not pursue this in his oral c losing submissions. 

22     Before examining the issues that arise for c onsideration, a few observations about the plaintiff’s pleaded c laim are apposite to set the c ontext for a proper assessment of its c laim. It is c lear that the plaintiff’s c ase on the prec ise c ontent of the representations allegedly made by the 2nd defendant has evolved quite signific antly. While it is understandable and not unusual for amendments to be introduc ed to pleadings following a c hange of lawyers, the fac tual substratum of the oral representations alleged by the plaintiff should remain largely unc hanged. Here, it underwent quite signific ant and c ontradic tory c hanges on a number of oc c asions. 

23     First, based on the plaintiff’s evolving c ase, it is unc ertain whether the 2nd defendant had represented that she had “ _ready sub-purchasers_ ” or that she “ _will procure_ ” sub-purc hasers. 

24     The distinc tion between these two representations is plain and obvious – the former is a representation of an existing fac t, while the latter is a promise of future c onduc t whic h is not ac tionable under the tort of misrepresentation (see _Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2003] 3 SLR(R) 307</span> at [20] and [21]). The fac t that c onstant referenc es were made to the latter ac c ount of the representations in previous versions of the statement of c laim c asts _serious_ doubt on the verac ity of the plaintiff’s c ase as set out in Statement of Claim (Amendment No 3) that the 2nd defendant had c onsistently represented that she had “ready sub-purc hasers”. 

25     Sec ond, it is also troubling, partic ularly in the c ontext of a c ase based on oral representations, that key details of the alleged representations were not pleaded from the start but were instead suc c essively added by way of a series of amendments to the statement of c laim. 

26     In my view, in assessing the fac tual verac ity of a plaintiff’s c laim, partic ularly one based on oral representations, the c ourt is entitled to examine the previous versions of the pleadings, and draw the nec essary inferenc es, if any, from the signific ant shifts in or additions to the fac tual ac c ounts narrated therein. The implic ations of this will be explored in greater detail below. 

27     In this c ase, it is c ommon ground that _if_ the initial and/or further representations were in fac t made by the 2nd defendant, there is no question that they were false and fraudulent, at least in relation to the four units for whic h sub-purc hasers were never found. Their alleged falsity in relation to the four units for whic h sub-purc hasers were found but who subsequently elec ted lawfully not to 


exerc ise the options to purc hase will be examined in relation to the losses allegedly suffered by the plaintiff. 

**Representations – were they made?** 

28     In _Goldrich Venture Pte Ltd and another v Halcyon Offshore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2015] 3 SLR 990</span> at [84] (“ _Goldrich Venture_ ”), I c onsidered the proper approac h in assessing the verac ity of a c laim based on alleged oral representations in c irc umstanc es where the main (if not only) evidenc e of suc h oral representations is the testimony of the plaintiff to whom the oral representations were allegedly made. In my view, a witness’s ac c ount of the alleged oral representations may be evaluated for its _internal consistency_ ( _ie_ , the c oherenc e of his testimony throughout trial) and its _external consistency_ ( _ie_ , the c onsistenc y between his evidenc e and extrinsic evidenc e suc h as the behaviour of the parties and the doc umentary evidenc e on rec ord). Needless to say, due c onsideration should also be given to a witness’s behaviour and demeanour on the witness stand ( _Sandz Solutions (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others v Strategic Worldwide Assets Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">[2014] 3 SLR 562</span> at [46]). 

29     It also bears mention that a more rigorous forensic lens should be applied to c laims grounded in fraudulent misrepresentation ( _Tang Yoke Kheng (trading as Niklex Supply Co) v Lek Benedict and others_ <span class="citation">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 263</span> at [14] and _Goldrich Venture_ at [82] and [83]). Given the gravity of both the nature and c onsequenc es of an allegation of fraud, a relatively high standard of proof is imposed on the party alleging fraud ( _Wee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another_ <span class="citation">[2013] 3 SLR 801</span> at [30] and [31]). 

30     In the present c ase, the key fac tual c laim that underpins the plaintiff’s c ase is that the oral representations about ready sub-purc hasers were made fraudulently by the 2nd defendant to Punitha and/or Gopal. Consequently, the plaintiff’s c ase largely rests on the testimony of Punitha and Gopal. Notably, as Mr K Anparasan (“Mr Anparasan”), c ounsel for the defendants, submits, there is a _paucity_ 

_of documentary evidence_ to prove the representations. [note: 15] As I observed in _Goldrich Venture_ at [90], where the subjec t matter was “neither trivial nor c asual in nature suc h that written c ommunic ation is not usually expec ted ... the absenc e of doc umentary evidenc e to support the alleged representations [would] be a glaring omission”. In the present c ase, the plaintiff’s investment in the eight warehouse units would have amounted to more than $10m if the purc hases were c ompleted. The absenc e of any _written evidence or correspondence_ supporting the representations or promises by the 2nd defendant about ready sub-purc hasers is inexplic able, to say the least. 

31     The gravity of the absenc e of written evidenc e must be viewed with referenc e to the impac t of the representations on the plaintiff – in general, the greater the impac t, the more inexplic able will be the absenc e of written evidenc e to support the alleged representations. It is important to bear in mind that ac c ording to the plaintiff, it was induc ed by the initial representations to pay the option fees for the eight warehouse units. The plaintiff’s financ ial exposure was then only $512,022. However, the further representations allegedly induc ed the plaintiff to _exercise_ the eight options, whic h exposed the plaintiff to a financ ial c ommitment in exc ess of $10m. Viewed in this light, it is inc onc eivable that the plaintiff would have proc eeded to exerc ise the eight options on the basis of the 2nd defendant’s oral representations without obtaining anything in writing from her partic ularly sinc e, by then, ac c ording to the plaintiff’s c ase, she had already failed to deliver on both the initial and further representations. 

32     It bears mention that it is Gopal’s own evidenc e that the plaintiff “would not have entered into any suc h transac tion _without being sure_ that there would have been ready sub-purc hasers for the properties” [emphasis added]. Yet, the plaintiff did prec isely the c ontrary. When the plaintiff exerc ised the options to purc hase all eight units on 10 January 2013, if the plaintiff’s c ase is to be 


believed, the 2nd defendant had _already failed_ to deliver on both the initial and further representations. Therefore, when the plaintiff exerc ised the options to purc hase, it would be fair to say that it must have been _far from being sure_ that the 2nd defendant’s representations were true. Moreover, given that the 2nd defendant had only given the plaintiff c heques for four of the warehouse units, it would have been illogic al for the 2nd defendant to have said, and for the plaintiff to have believed, that it had no c hoic e but to exerc ise the _eight_ options to purc hase. In my view, the fac t that the plaintiff nonetheless exerc ised all eight options irresistibly suggests that it was motivated to do so by its own investment dec ision. The inc oherenc e of the plaintiff’s ac c ount, as demonstrated by the points made above, strongly suggests that the alleged representations were not in fac t made by the 2nd defendant. This bec omes c learer when the objec tive evidenc e is examined below. 

33     It is also telling that there was no written protest whatsoever from the plaintiff, Punitha or Gopal about the failure of the 2nd defendant to deliver on either the initial or the further representations until the c ommenc ement of the present suit on 28 January 2014, more than a year after the representations were allegedly made. 

**_Content and nature of the representations_** 

34     I begin by expressing some misgivings about the c ontent and nature of the alleged initial and further representations. Taking the initial representations at fac e value, the representations do not make sense. The 2nd defendant is alleged to have represented to Punitha and/or Gopal on 12 Dec ember 2012 that she _had ready sub-purchasers_ for the plaintiff. However, as at 12 Dec ember 2012, the plaintiff had not yet dec ided to purc hase the warehouse units. So, who were the “ready sub-purc hasers” buying from? Ac c ording to Punitha, the 2nd defendant provided the names of some 

of the sub-purc hasers on 12 Dec ember 2012. [note: 16] But Gopal, whose attendanc e at this meeting 

is disputed, denies that the identities of the sub-purc hasers were revealed. [note: 17] Punitha’s evidenc e, whic h is at odds with Gopal’s, still does not address the fundamental gap – who were the sub-purc hasers buying from? They c ertainly c ould not have agreed to buy the warehouse units from t he _plaintiff_ as at 12 Dec ember 2012, and it is unlikely that a buyer would have c ommitted to subpurc hasing the warehouse units without knowing the identity of the seller. 

35     The plaintiff also c laims that the further representations were made on or about 24 Dec ember 

2012\. The 2nd defendant allegedly represented that she _had_ ready sub-purc hasers for the remaining four warehouse units (by then, the 2nd defendant had delivered four c heques for the sub-purc hase of 

four of the eight warehouse units). In Punitha’s affidavit of evidenc e in c hief (“AEIC”) [note: 18] , she provided more details of the further representations. She asserted that the 2nd defendant had represented that she _would procure_ the remaining sub-purc hasers “within the next few days”. This is in line with the further and better partic ulars (“F&BPs”) initially provided by the plaintiff in respec t of the further representations, wherein it was stated, _inter alia_ , that the 2nd defendant had said “give 

me [a] few more days to give you the balanc e c heques for the other units”. [note: 19] 

36     Again, the further representations do not appear to make any sense. First, if the 2nd defendant already _had_ sub-purc hasers for the remaining warehouse units by 24 Dec ember 2012, why were the options fees from those sub-purc hasers not produc ed to the plaintiff sinc e, by definition, the subpurc hasers would already have agreed to buy the warehouse units? No reason has been offered. More signific antly, on their own ac c ount of events, neither Punitha nor Gopal sought any suc h obvious c larific ation from the 2nd defendant. I would have expec ted them to do so if indeed the further representations were made. Sec ond, ac c ording to Punitha’s evidenc e and the plaintiff’s pleaded c ase, the option fees from the remaining sub-purc hasers were supposed to be delivered “within the next 


few days” _from 24 December 2012_. Even allowing for one week, whic h is a generous view of “a few days”, the option fees from the sub-purc hasers should have been delivered to the plaintiff latest by the end of the year _ie_ , 31 Dec ember 2012. Yet, when that date c ame and left, not only did the plaintiff not c omplain in writing, it proc eeded to exerc ise the options to purc hase _all eight_ warehouse units on 10 January 2013, thereby c ommitting itself to a financ ial obligation in exc ess of $10m. Initially, Punitha c laimed to have issued an _oral_ ultimatum to the 2nd defendant on 8 January 2013, whic h is already a c urious way to provide an ultimatum given the seriousness of the fraudulent misrepresentations both in terms of its nature and impac t on the plaintiff. However, Punitha eventually c onc eded on the stand that no suc h ultimatum was in fac t issued c ontrary to her initial oral testimony and AEIC (see [40(b)] below). 

37     So, even before examining the internal and external inc onsistenc ies of the plaintiff’s evidenc e, at fac e value, the plaintiff’s ac c ount of the events surrounding the initial and further representations does not make any sense. Punitha and Gopal are both savvy and experienc ed property investors. They are also both well-educ ated with university degrees. I find it inc redulous that they would have relied on suc h c ontradic tory and meaningless representations without seeking any substantiation and without any written protest when the representations did not hold true. Just to be c lear, these observations are not made to show that there was no relianc e on the representations by the plaintiff _per se_ , but rather to demonstrate that in all likelihood, the representations were not made at all. 

38     Looking at the evidenc e as a whole, it is unlikely that the 2nd defendant would have represented that she had sec ured ready sub-purc hasers to buy the warehouse units from the plaintiff should the plaintiff dec ide to buy the units. It is more likely that the plaintiff was _encouraged_ to purc hase the warehouse units given the unique features and its disc ounted pric e. Indeed, it is telling that when giving evidenc e, Punitha had, on one oc c asion, desc ribed the sub-purc hasers as 

“ _interested_ buyers” rather than “ready buyers”. [note: 20] _At most_ , the 2nd defendant’s representations would have related to an event in the future, _ie_ , that the 2nd defendant _will assist_ in proc uring sub-purc hasers for the plaintiffs in the event the plaintiff dec ides to go ahead with the purc hases. After all, this is entirely in line with Punitha’s polic e report against the 2nd defendant (whic h will be examined at [42] and [43] below) as well as the plaintiff’s initial pleaded c ase whic h was swiftly amended upon the plaintiff’s realisation that it would undermine its c laim. 

**_Internal consistency_** 

39     In my view, both the plaintiff’s c ase as a whole, as well as Punitha’s own testimony, reveals a substantial degree of _internal inconsistency_. The plaintiff’s evolving pleadings is an obvious starting point. While the statement of c laim _as it stands now_ asserts that the 2nd defendant had represented that she had _ready sub-purchasers_ , I have already highlighted the fac t that the plaintiff’s pleadings, as it evolved, had at several points asserted a representation whic h was quite different, _ie_ , that the 2nd defendant had instead said that she “ _will procure_ ” sub-purc hasers (see [13], [14] and [23] above). It bears mentioning that, at the very least, if the 2nd defendant had stated at any point that she “ _will procure_ ” sub-purc hasers, Punitha and Gopal must have been alerted to the fac t that her representation that she “had ready sub-purc hasers” c ould not have been true or ac c urate. It will also c ast doubt on whether the representation that she had “ready sub-purc hasers” was ever made. 

40     Apart from the seriously inc onsistent pleadings, there are several internal inc onsistenc ies in Punitha’s evidenc e: 

 (a) In her AEIC (at para 9), Punitha asserts that the initial representations made on 12 Dec ember 2012 were partly in writing and partly oral. However this c ontradic ts the F&BPs filed by the plaintiff on 25 Marc h 2015, where the plaintiff states without qualific ation that the 


 representations were made orally, and not in writing. This is also inc onsistent with Punitha’s testimony at trial that the representations were never reduc ed into writing. [note: 21] 

 (b) In her AEICs and initial oral testimony, Punitha c laimed to have issued two ultimatums to the 2nd defendant sometime on 20 Dec ember 2012 and sometime on 8 January 2013 demanding that she produc ed the sub-purc hasers as represented. [note: 22] However, the statement of c laim only referred to one ultimatum. [note: 23] When further questioned about the alleged ultimatums, Punitha c hanged her narrative and c laimed that the ultimatum was never given on 8 January 

2013\. [note: 24] 

 (c ) While Punitha initially stated in her AEIC that a friendly loan of $50,000 was extended to the 2nd defendant sometime in May 2013 [note: 25] , she subsequently amended her evidenc e at trial and explained that the loan was extended sometime between 10 and 15 January 2013. [note: 26] Irrespec tive of whic h of the two dates the loan was extended, it is c lear that either date would have post-dated the representations. More importantly, by either of the two dates, the plaintiff would have known that the 2nd defendant had failed to deliver on her representations, if they were made. In suc h c irc umstanc es, it is indeed inc ongruous that Punitha would have extended a friendly loan of $50,000 to the 2nd defendant, someone who had misled the plaintiff into a potentially financ ially ruinous transac tion. This loan was also the subjec t matter of Punitha’s c omplaint to a manager of the 1st defendant, Mr Lim Keng Chiang (also known as “Casey Lim”), whic h will be separately examined below as it has a material bearing on the c redibility of the plaintiff’s c ase. 

**_External consistency_** 

41     Next, I examine whether the extrinsic evidenc e supports or c ontradic ts the plaintiff’s c ase. 

_Police report_ 

42     First, a polic e report was filed by Punitha on 12 August 2013. In the report, Punitha c omplained about the 2nd defendant harassing her for the c ommission from the sub-sale of unit #02-05 to Shark 

Engineering Pte Ltd (one of the eight warehouse units). [note: 27] In the polic e report, Punitha stated that “[a]s an agreement for purc hasing the units [in the Development] through her, [the 2nd defendant] would _assist me_ to sell of [ _sic_ ] the units” [emphasis added]. When Punitha was c onfronted with her polic e report in c ross-examination, she testified “I would have ... used the wrong 

word bec ause I was---at that time, I was not c onsulting any lawyers or whatever”. [note: 28] Punitha c laimed that she “was not really c onc entrating on the top portion [ _ie_ , the portion where she desc ribed the agreement to assist] bec ause [her] main c onc ern was to ... get a report that [the 2nd 

defendant] was threatening [her]”. [note: 29] Mr Daniel’s only submission on this apparent inc onsistenc y is that lay people may not be c lear in their c hoic e of words. 

43     In my view, if the 2nd defendant had indeed misrepresented to Punitha that she had “ready sub-purc hasers” for the eight warehouse units, it would be entirely inc onsistent for Punitha to desc ribe her “agreement” as an agreement for the 2nd defendant to render _assistance_ to sell off the warehouse units. Punitha would have taken advantage of the opportunity to also c omplain about the 2nd defendant’s _misrepresentations_. Punitha appeared to me to be a self-assured person who would not hesitate to speak her mind if something was not properly done. In a muc h less serious c irc umstanc e, she rebuked the 2nd defendant for banking in c ertain c heques for the Nusajaya units 


despite her instruc tions to the c ontrary. [note: 30] If the misrepresentations were in fac t made, they would have been fraudulent. In other words, by the plaintiff’s c ase, the 2nd defendant had blatantly lied to Punitha and Gopal to earn c ommission for herself. Yet, there was no mention of these blatant lies at all in the polic e report. Even without the assistanc e of a lawyer, it is c lear to me that Punitha apprec iates the patent differenc e between an agreement to “assist” in selling the warehouse units, and a misrepresentation or promise that the 2nd defendant had “ready sub-purc hasers”. 

_Meeting with Casey Lim_ 

44     Sec ond, Punitha c ontac ted Casey Lim to c omplain about the 2nd defendant. Although there is no dispute that a meeting did take plac e at Punitha’s home on 19 June 2013 and that the 2nd defendant and Casey Lim were present, the _purpose_ of the meeting was disputed. Punitha c laims that she c alled the meeting to c omplain about the misrepresentations made by the 2nd defendant in relation to the ready sub-purc hasers, but ac c ording to both the 2nd defendant and Casey Lim, Punitha c alled the meeting to c omplain about the outstanding loan owing by the 2nd defendant. After examining the evidenc e, it is c lear that the meeting had nothing to do with the alleged misrepresentations. As Mr Anparasan points out, it is very telling that the meeting was not pleaded in the statement of c laim. If Punitha did indeed c all the meeting to c omplain about the 2nd defendant’s alleged misrepresentations, I would have expec ted it to be pleaded. This seems to me to be yet another afterthought of the plaintiff to shore up an ill-c onc eived c laim. 

45     It is undisputed that at the end of the meeting, the following note, at the suggestion of Casey Lim, was handwritten and signed by the 2nd defendant: 

 19/06/ 

 Attn: Mdm Punitha D/o Vasu Kalingarayar 

 1C Haig Avenue 

 I have only rec eived 3 signed c opies of option to purc hase for Novelty Bizc entre units #02-05, #02-04 and #03-07. There are no other options holding in my possession from Punitha D/o Vasu Kalingarajar. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 <2nd Defendant signed> 

 T. Tanabakiyam 

 SXXXXXXXF 

 Witnessed by 

 Casey Lim <Casey Lim signed> 

46     The note only refers to the 2nd defendant’s c onfirmation that she “only rec eived 3 signed c opies of option to purc hase for Novelty Bizc entre units #02-05, #02-04 and #03-07”. I agree with Mr Anparasan that Punitha would have insisted on some mention of the 2nd defendant’s 


 Punitha: Hi Casey, just to c onfirm you Shanti’s c heque of $30k was c leared on Monday. Thank you 

 Mr Lim: Welc ome. I presume everything settled right? Punitha: Yes 

 Mr Lim: Thank you. 

misrepresentations about the ready sub-purc hasers for all _eight_ warehouse units if Punitha’s primary 

grievanc e at the meeting was the alleged misrepresentations. [note: 31] The impression c onveyed by the note is that all parties were c ontent to c onc lude the meeting on the basis of the 2nd defendant’s c onfirmation that she had only rec eived “3 signed c opies of option to purc hase for Novelty Bizc entre units #02-05, #02-04 and #03-07”. Indeed, nowhere does Punitha assert otherwise. It is also worth mentioning that this note was exhibited in Punitha’s own AEIC without any qualific ation or protest that it did not ac c urately reflec t the disc ussions at the meeting. 

_Email and text messages_ 

47     Email and text messages that Punitha had sent to Casey Lim shortly after the meeting are also inc onsistent with the plaintiff’s c ase that Punitha had c omplained about the misrepresentations allegedly made by the 2nd defendant. 

 (a) On 20 June 2013 at 4.14pm, a day after the meeting, Punitha sent Casey Lim an email whic h I reproduc e in full: 

 Dear Mr. Casey, 

 Thank you very muc h for your time spent at my home from 11.30am to 2pm together with your fellow agent Ms. Shanti. 

 Indeed, apprec iate your involvement to settle the issues between your fellow agent Ms. Shanti and myself amic ably. I hope your effort will not go in vein. 

 The issue whic h was still unsettled is date of exerc ise of the option to purc hase for unit number #02-04 and #03-07 of Novelty Biz Centre. After the disc ussion with my husband the best we c ould extend the exerc ise date is on or by 31st August 2013 with the c lause mentioning unless the developer does not c all for/take bac k the units for non payment. 

 Please prepare the OTP ac c ordingly and return the others as disc ussed yesterday. 

 (b) On 24 and 25 July 2013, there was an exc hange of Short Message Servic e (“SMS”) c orrespondenc e between the parties [note: 32] : 

48     The referenc e to “Shanti’s c heque of $30k” c onc erned the outstanding loan due from the 2nd defendant to Punitha. This c learly supports the defendants’ c ase that Punitha c alled the meeting to c omplain about the loan. I note that while this SMS exc hange was exhibited in Punitha’s AEIC, only the first two messages quoted above were reproduc ed. Her c onfirmation that everything was settled 

was left out. [note: 33] No reasonable explanation was offered to explain why Punitha only exhibited the first half of the SMS exc hange in her AEIC. In my view, it is likely that the sec ond half of the SMS exc hange was deliberately omitted as it would severely undermine the plaintiff’s c ase. Even if the 


omission was not deliberate, Punitha nonetheless _positively confirmed_ to Casey Lim that everything with the 2nd defendant had been settled and expressed gratitude rather than unhappiness for his assistanc e in resolving the issues with the 2nd defendant. I therefore find that c ontrary to the plaintiff’s c ase, the purpose of the meeting was not to disc uss the 2nd defendant’s misrepresentations, but rather, to disc uss the outstanding loan the 2nd defendant owed Punitha and to sort out the sub-purc hasers whic h the 2nd defendant had already proc ured for the plaintiff. 

_Plaintiff sourcing for financing_ 

49     Further, it is not disputed that Punitha began sourc ing for financ ing in late Dec ember 2012. [note: 34] Ac c ording to the plaintiff, the 2nd defendant had represented that the eight warehouse 

units would be sold to the sub-purc hasers “by the time the Options to Purc hase were to be 

exerc ised”, _ie_ , 10 January 2013. [note: 35] If this were true, it would make no sense for the plaintiff to have been looking for financ ing in late Dec ember 2012 bec ause it would still have been operating under the belief that the units would be sub-sold by the time the next stage of payment was due. In fac t, Punitha’s evidenc e is that the 2nd defendant had told her that she would get bac k all her money by the time the options were to be exerc ised and henc e she “[did] not think about finding out from 

any banks or any financ ial institute or getting funds prepared”. [note: 36] The fac t that financ ing was being sourc ed from late Dec ember 2012, even before the 2nd defendant was expec ted to deliver on her representations, suggests that the plaintiff c ontemplated that it may have to exerc ise the options to preserve its investment in the eight warehouse units. Suc h a step is plainly inc onsistent with the pleaded representations. When questioned, Punitha c laims that the 2nd defendant had told her that there may be some delay in getting the other four c heques, and that she therefore had to prepare 

funds to exerc ise the options. [note: 37] Not only was this alleged delay not pleaded, it is plainly inc onsistent with the pleaded representations. 

_Appointing other property agents_ 

50     Finally, it is undisputed that sometime in February 2013, Punitha had asked the 2nd defendant for permission to approac h another property agent of the 1st defendant, Anna, to sell the warehouse 

units, and that the 2nd defendant did not objec t to this. [note: 38] In my view, this fac t does not sit c omfortably with the plaintiff’s allegations about the 2nd defendant’s misrepresentations. If the 2nd defendant had indeed promised but failed to deliver the “ready sub-purc hasers” to the plaintiff, there is no c onc eivable reason for Punitha to seek the 2nd defendant’s _consent_ before approac hing another property agent within the same c ompany. I would have expec ted the plaintiff to put the 2nd defendant on notic e for failing to deliver on her representations instead. 

_Evidence the plaintiff relies on_ 

51     The plaintiff sought to rely on several purported piec es of objec tive evidenc e to prove its c ase: (a) a handwritten note by the 2nd defendant; (b) the advertisements plac ed in the Strait Times and Tamil Murasu for sale of some units in the Development; (c ) an SMS from Punitha dated 12 July 2013 to the 2nd defendant; and (d) the four c heques from sub-purc hasers whic h the 2nd defendant managed to obtain for the plaintiff within a short span of time (on or about 24 or 26 Dec ember 2012). 

52     In my view, none of them furthers the plaintiff’s c ase. In its c losing submissions, the plaintiff ranked the handwritten note as its main supporting evidenc e. The plaintiff’s c ritic ism that the 2nd defendant did not address the handwritten note in her AEIC is c ompletely misplac ed. Not only was the handwritten note not pleaded to support the plaintiff’s c ase, its pleadings were in fac t to the c ontrary. The plaintiff c ategoric ally asserted in its F&BPs that the representations were made “ _orally_ ”. 


If it was evidenc ed in writing by the handwritten note, it would and should have been pleaded. Moreover, while the handwritten note was exhibited in Punitha’s AEIC, it was never expressly referred to and disc ussed in the main body of the AEIC. As suc h, little, if anything at all, c an be made of the fac t that the 2nd defendant did not c omment on the handwritten note in her AEIC until it was raised in c ross-examination. 

53     The handwritten note c ontained various sc ribbles and is, unsurprisingly, not dated. On its fac e, it does not c ontain any representation that the 2nd defendant has _ready sub-purchasers_ for the plaintiff’s eight warehouse units. Instead, the handwritten note only mentions _four_ units and therefore c annot possibly support the plaintiff’s allegation that representations about ready sub-purc hasers for a ll _eight_ units were made. Further, Punitha’s and Gopal’s evidenc e that the handwritten note was written at the 12 Dec ember 2012 meeting is not borne out by the handwritten note itself. Signific antly, the handwritten note referred to unit “02-05”, alongside the figure “1250”. This is c onsistent with the fac t that unit #02-05 was sold to Shark Engineering Pte Ltd at $1,250 per square foot, while the other three units were sold at $1,193 per square foot. Prec ise knowledge of suc h figures would only have been available to the parties _after_ the sub-sale c heques for four of the warehouse units were obtained on or about 24 or 26 Dec ember 2012. The listing of the four units (though I note that one was stated as “03-03” rather than “03-05” whic h I ac c ept was a mistake) and their c orresponding sub-sale pric e is c onsistent with the 2nd defendant’s ac c ount that she was 

rec apping what had taken plac e so far as at mid to end February 2013. [note: 39] Gopal sought to address these observations by suggesting that the same handwritten note (whic h was allegedly first written on 12 Dec ember 2012) was used in subsequent meetings when additional updated c omments were added. Not only is this a c ontrived explanation, it seeks to elevate the status of this otherwise innoc uous note to a key doc ument to support the initial representations. If so, there would be no reason why it was not referred to in the statement of c laim, espec ially sinc e the plaintiff is not averse to amending its c laim _repeatedly_. 

54     The plaintiff also relied on the advertisements to support its c ase. [note: 40] Mr Daniel did identify some inc onsistenc ies in the 2nd defendant’s evidenc e on the advertisements – the advertisement in the Strait Times inc luded fac tory units whic h the plaintiff did not buy, and the advertisement in the Tamil Murasu was only for _two_ warehouse units even though the plaintiff had _four_ unsold units. From this, it seems c lear that the advertisements are unlikely to have been plac ed at the request of Punitha for the plaintiff’s four warehouse units c ontrary to the 2nd defendant’s evidenc e. However, I do not see how this helps the plaintiff. The fac t that I rejec t the 2nd defendant’s assertion that the advertisements were plac ed on behalf of Punitha does not help to prove the plaintiff’s c ase. 

55     Mr Daniel also relied on an SMS whic h Punitha sent to the 2nd defendant on 12 July 2013 in whic h she enquired – “ _what is happening to yr buyers_ ”. The 2nd defendant testified that she did not reply to Punitha _via_ SMS, but c alled her instead to c larify what she was talking about. Under c rossexamination, the 2nd defendant c laimed that Punitha was referring to Shark Engineering Pte Ltd, one 

of the four sub-purc hasers. [note: 41] However, this is inc onsistent with para 60 of the 2nd defendant’s AEIC where she stated that she did not reply to the SMS and that the SMS was a 

referenc e to “the Selvakumars and Dr Raj”, the other sub-purc hasers. [note: 42] In my view, while the 2nd defendant may have provided inc onsistent evidenc e in relation to the SMS, this does not further the plaintiff’s c ase that the 2nd defendant had made the initial representations to Punitha and Gopal. It should be borne in mind that by 12 July 2013, the 2nd defendant had already found a few subpurc hasers for the plaintiff. Therefore, the fac t that Punitha had asked the 2nd defendant about “[her] buyers” c ould be explained as a query about the status of the sub-purc hasers whic h the 2nd defendant had already found for the plaintiff. It should be borne in mind that at this time, the sub


purc hasers were still c onsidering whether to exerc ise the options. [note: 43] Henc e, Punitha’s query about the status of these sub-purc hasers is understandable. 

56     Finally, the fac t that the 2nd defendant produc ed four c heques in a span of two weeks (either on 24 or 26 Dec ember 2012 – nothing turns on the different dates) does not in any way prove that she had made the initial representations to Punitha and/or Gopal on 10 or 12 Dec ember 2012. If anything, it might ac tually undermine the plaintiff’s c ase. First, it feeds into my earlier observation that the sub-purc hasers c ould not have been _ready_ to buy the units from the plaintiff before the plaintiff had dec ided to purc hase the eight warehouse units. Henc e, it would make no sense for the 2nd defendant to represent that she _had ready sub-purchasers_ to buy the same warehouse units from the plaintiff when the parties met on 10 or 12 Dec ember 2012. Sec ond, it supports the 2nd defendant’s evidenc e that she started looking for sub-purc hasers _after_ the plaintiff had paid the option fees. Ac c ording to the 2nd defendant, she met Mrs Kumar, one of the sub-purc hasers, on 19 Dec ember 2012 after the plaintiff had dec ided to proc eed with the purc hase of the eight 

warehouse units. [note: 44] Mr Daniel submits this is not true sinc e the 2nd defendant did not mention this meeting with Mrs Kumar in her AEIC. But this is amply supported by the fac t that the c heques from the sub-purc hasers (inc luding Mrs Kumar’s) all _post-dated_ the meeting of 12 Dec ember 2012. The plaintiff’s submission that assertions made by the 2nd defendant under c ross-examination c annot be true sinc e they were not stated in the AEIC is a very feeble one (whic h features regularly and prominently in the plaintiff’s c losing submissions) espec ially sinc e there are numerous glaring gaps, c ontradic tions and inexplic able defic ienc ies in the plaintiff’s own evidenc e. It must not be overlooked that the plaintiff bears the burden of proof and in that respec t, I find the plaintiff to be woefully off the mark. 

57     The speed at whic h the 2nd defendant was able to find four sub-purc hasers does not prove or support the plaintiff’s c ase. After all, this is a unique c ommerc ial development and all the remaining eight warehouse units had been snapped by the plaintiff. In any event, the 2nd defendant has every financ ial inc entive to sec ure sub-purc hasers sinc e she earns a c ommission on every sale she makes. While it may be unusual that the 2nd defendant managed to sub-sell the four units so quic kly, and while it may even be possible that the 2nd defendant had sub-purc hasers in mind before meeting Punitha and Gopal on 10 or 12 Dec ember 2012, this does not prove that she had made the initial representations to Punitha and Gopal that she _had ready sub-purchasers_ for _all_ eight warehouse units when they met on 10 or 12 Dec ember 2012. 

**_Conclusion_** 

58     I therefore find that the plaintiff has failed to disc harge its burden of proving that the 2nd defendant had made either the initial or further representations as pleaded in Statement of Claim (Amendment No 3). Not only are there several c ontradic tory inc onsistenc ies in the plaintiff’s pleaded c ase as it evolved, the plaintiff’s c ase is also entirely inc onsistent with the objec tive evidenc e before the c ourt. Indeed, by one version of the plaintiff’s c ase, though it has sinc e been amended, it admits as muc h that what was said by the 2nd defendant was, at best, that she “ _will procure_ ” subpurc hasers or _will assist_ to proc ure (as stated in the polic e report), rather than that she had “ _ready sub-purchasers_ ” for the plaintiff. 

59     I should add that even if I had found the 2nd defendant to be liable for the misrepresentations, I would have dismissed the c laim against the 1st defendant. There is simply insuffic ient evidenc e before the c ourt to show that the 1st defendant had exerc ised the requisite c ontrol over the 2nd defendant suc h that an employer-employee relationship exists for the purposes of vic arious liability. All that is adduc ed by the plaintiff is that for eac h sale transac ted by the 2nd defendant, the 1st defendant takes 10% of the c ommission while the 2nd defendant takes the balanc e 90%. This is 


manifestly insuffic ient to establish vic arious liability. 

60     For the above reasons, the plaintiff’s c laim is dismissed with c osts whic h I fix at $120,000, plus disbursements fixed at $13,100. 

61     It is worth mentioning that at the time the Development was introduc ed to Punitha (on 10 or 12 Dec ember 2012), there were only eight warehouse units left in the Development. Given the 16% disc ount offered to Punitha, as well as the uniquely attrac tive features of the Development, it is understandable for Punitha to have believed that the units c ould be “flipped” for a quic k and handsome profit and that this was a risk worth taking partic ularly sinc e the 2nd defendant had managed within a short time to find four sub-purc hasers. What she did not and c ould not have antic ipated was the implementation of the c ooling measures whic h reduc ed the marketability of the warehouse units. That this is so is evidently borne out by the fac t that three out of the four subpurc hasers forfeited their option fees to the plaintiff after the implementation of the c ooling measures. 

**Losses** 

62     Notwithstanding the dismissal of the plaintiff’s c laim, it is perhaps useful to provide some views in relation to several of the unusual heads of damages the plaintiff is c laiming for. 

63     The full details of the plaintiff’s c laim are set out at [20] above. In short, the plaintiff is c laiming for all the monies it had expended and/or forfeited arising from the purc hase of the eight warehouse units, as well as for the loss of profits it would have earned if the 2nd defendant’s representations had been _true_. It should be noted that no c laim is made in respec t of the unit whic h has sinc e been sold to Shark Engineering Pte Ltd. That unit was sold at $1,250 per square foot whic h was above the pric e of $1,193 allegedly promised by the 2nd defendant. 

64     The general rule in awarding damages in tort is to “put the vic tim into the position in whic h he would have been, if the tort had not been c ommitted”: _Wishing Star Ltd v Jurong Town Corp_ <span class="citation">[2008] 2 SLR(R) 909</span> (“ _Wishing Star_ ”) at [28]. 

65     Mr Anparasan raises, _inter alia_ , the following objec tions to the plaintiff’s c laim for damages: 

 (a) The defendants c annot be liable for the losses arising from the three units (#02-04, #0305 and #03-07) for whic h the 2nd defendant managed to proc ure sub-purc hasers. These three sub-purc hasers paid the option fees and were entitled as of right not to exerc ise the options whic h were extended to them. [note: 45] 

 (b) Any loss inc urred by Punitha and/or Gopal personally ( eg , on the UOB re-mortgage loan they took up) c annot be c laimed by the plaintiff bec ause it is not the plaintiff’s loss. [note: 46] 

 (c ) The plaintiff c annot c laim for loss of profits. [note: 47] 

**_Losses arising from the sub-purchasers’ failure to complete the sub-sale_** 

66     Mr Anparasan submits that even on the plaintiff’s own pleaded c ase, the 2nd defendant did not owe the plaintiff a duty to ensure that the sub-purc hasers would _complete_ the purc hase. Therefore, sinc e the 2nd defendant did find sub-purc hasers who paid the plaintiff option fees for three of the warehouse units, the plaintiff c annot c laim for any losses arising from the sub-purc hasers’ exerc ise of their right not to c omplete their purc hase of those three units. The effec t of Mr Anparasan’s 


submission appears to be that even if the alleged representations were made, they were not _false_ in relation to those three warehouse units bec ause the 2nd defendant did have ready sub-purc hasers for those units. 

67     Mr Daniel submits that the 2nd defendant at least implic itly represented that the sub-sales 

would be c ompleted. [note: 48] He reasoned that it would otherwise not have made sense for the plaintiff to exerc ise the options to purc hase the eight units as it c ould then end up bearing the risk of 

purc hasing the eight units with no assuranc e that the sub-sales would go through. [note: 49] 

68     This issue ultimately turns on the sc ope and meaning of the pleaded representations. Even if the 2nd defendant did represent that she had ready sub-purc hasers who would purc hase the warehouse units at a pric e of at least $1,193 per square foot, did this entail a representation that the “ready sub-purc hasers” would _complete_ the sub-sale? 

69     In my view, the parties must have understood “ready sub-purc hasers” to mean buyers who are prepared to buy the warehouse units by paying the option fees, and no more. Whether these ready sub-purc hasers would subsequently exerc ise the options and c omplete the sub-sales is a matter whic h would be _entirely_ out of the 2nd defendant’s knowledge and c ontrol. It follows that it is unlikely for the 2nd defendant’s representations to inc lude (or to be understood to inc lude) a guarantee in relation to the future c onduc t of the sub-purc hasers. Therefore, unless the 2nd defendant _expressly_ represented that her “ready sub-purc hasers” would also _complete_ the sub-sale, I am of the view that a reasonable interpretation of the pleaded representations, if made, should be c onstrued to mean sub-purc hasers who would be willing to pay the option fee for the right to purc hase the units. It would not make any c ommerc ial sense for the 2nd defendant to provide suc h an open-ended guarantee to earn a modest c ommission. 

**_Punitha and Gopal’s personal loss_** 

70     Mr Daniel ac c epts that some of the losses c laimed by the plaintiff in the present suit are Punitha’s and Gopal’s _personal_ losses. These inc lude the interest whic h the developer of Punitha’s 

Malaysian properties had c harged her due to delays in her c ompletion of those properties [note: 50] , as well as expenses that Punitha and Gopal might have inc urred on loans they took out in their own 

name to financ e the purc hase of the properties ( _eg_ , the UOB remortgage loan [note: 51] ). However, he submits that bec ause the loss flows direc tly from the plaintiff’s relianc e on the 2nd defendant’s 

fraudulent misrepresentation, the plaintiff’s c laim for rec overy of these losses should be allowed. [note: 52] 

71     Mr Daniel has c ited no authority for the proposition that the plaintiff c ompany, whic h is a _separate legal entity_ from its shareholders and/or direc tors ( _ie_ , Punitha and Gopal), c an c ommenc e an ac tion in its own name and c laim the losses that its shareholders and direc tors have _personally_ suffered. In my view, the plaintiff c annot c laim the losses whic h were inc urred personally by Punitha and Gopal. In addition, it seems to me that this c laim might be too remote to be rec overable as they related to different transac tions from the present c ase. However, sinc e no submission was made on this point, I shall say no more. 

**_Loss of profits_** 

72     The plaintiff also c laims for profits that it would have earned if the 2nd defendant’s representations were true. I agree with Mr Anparasan that the plaintiff’s c laim for loss of profits must fail. In support of his submission, Mr Anparasan relies on the dec ision of the Court of Appeal in _Wishing_ 


_Star_ at [28], quoting with approval Edwin Peel, _Treitel on The Law of Contract_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2007): 

 Tortious misrepresentation does, indeed, c reate new expec tations, but the purpose of damages even for that tort is to put the vic tim into the position in whic h he would have been, if the misrepresentation had not been made, and not to protect his expectations by putting him into the position in which he would have been, if the representation had been true. 

 [emphasis added] 

In short, the plaintiff c annot have its c ake and eat it too. It c annot, on the one hand, c laim that but for the misrepresentation, it would not have obtained and exerc ised the options to purc hase the warehouse units and c laim losses arising therefrom, and on the other hand, _additionally_ c laim for loss of the profits it would have made if the representations were true. It appears that the plaintiff’s introduc tion of the c ontrac tual c laim was targeted at ac hieving rec overy of the loss of profits, but that c laim has sinc e been abandoned. In the c irc umstanc es, it is disappointing that the c laim for loss of profits c ontinues to feature in the plaintiff’s c losing submissions. 

73     Nevertheless, Mr Daniel relies on _Wishing Star_ as well as _Vita Health Laboratories Pte Ltd and others v Pang Seng Meng_ <span class="citation">[2004] 4 SLR(R) 162</span> (“ _Vita Health_ ”) in support of his submission that in the c ase of _fraudulent_ misrepresentations, a more generous approac h to the quantific ation of damages should be taken. As stated above, _Wishing Star_ does not assist the plaintiff. While Mr Daniel is not inc orrec t in submitting that _Wishing Star_ does affirm a more generous approac h in the quantific ation of damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, it does not extend to putting the plaintiff into the position whic h it would be have been in _if the representations were true_. This muc h is made c lear from the passage quoted above. All _Wishing Star_ permits is for the c ourt to award all damages flowing direc tly from the plaintiff’s relianc e on the defendant’s fraudulent misrepresentation, _whether or not such loss was foreseeable_ (see also _Vita Health_ at [91]). 

74     In _Vita Health_ , the plaintiffs were a group of related c ompanies who sued the defendant, the group’s previous managing direc tor, for the losses they suffered arising, _inter alia_ , from the defendant’s fraudulent ac c ounting. The Vita Health brand started out as the defendant’s family business. However, when the defendant took over, he had aspirations to expand the business. In a bid to do so, the defendant falsified the ac c ounts of two of his c ompanies – Vita Health Laboratories Pte Ltd (the first plaintiff, referred to as “VHLS” in _Vita Health_ ) and Vita Health Laboratories (Hong Kong) Ltd (the sec ond plaintiff, referred to as “VHLHK” in _Vita Health_ ) – to give investors the false impression that the Vita Health business was enjoying strong revenue flow from an Indonesian c ompany (referred to as “Vitaton” in _Vita Health_ ) and a Philippines c ompany (referred to as “VHLP” in _Vita Health_ ). VHLS and VHLHK were subsequently bought over by Vita Life Sc ienc es Limited (the fourth plaintiff, referred to as “VLS” in _Vita Health_ ) pursuant to a share sale agreement. When the irregular ac c ounting was disc overed, the plaintiffs forc ed the defendant to step down from all management positions, and eventually c ommenc ed an ac tion against the defendant for the fraudulent ac c ounting. 

75     In determining the quantum of damages that should be awarded, V K Rajah JC (as he then was) made the following observations ( _Vita Health_ at [94]–[98]), whic h Mr Daniel has sought to rely on in his c losing submissions: 

 94 When ac c ounts are falsified there will nec essarily be different approac hes in measuring the loss. ... There is no universal test in view of the many imponderables c ompeting for primac y; an inflexible approac h c annot ac hieve justic e. It should also be noted that s 157(3)(a) of the CA 


 appears to ac c ept a broad test of liability against a director who , inter alia , fails to act honestly. The direc tor is responsible for “ any damage suffered by the c ompany as a result of the breac h”. 

 9 5 In the present circumstances , where the defendant c aused VHLS’s ac c ounts to inac c urately portray transac tions between VHLS and Vitaton/VHLP, it appears appropriate to c onc lude that VHLS and the other interested plaintiffs had a legitimate expectation and belief that its accounts were correct and that they would rec eive the amounts represented therein as genuine rec eivables due from Vitaton/VHLP. 

 ... 

 97 ... Another dimension pertaining to this issue may help place matters in perspective. There is no gainsaying that the defendant was a fiduciary. Direc tors who c ause c ompany funds to be misplac ed are liable to make good the misapplic ation with interest: In re Duckwari Plc [1998] Ch 253 at 262. This rule applies even if the direc tor does not personally benefit from the misapplic ation. 

 98 It is only appropriate in the present fac tual matrix, that the defendant bears the differenc e between what he led VHLS to believe it would rec over and what it ac tually rec overed. The wrong here is dec eiving VHLS and the plaintiffs that the ac c ounts represented the true financ ial relationship VHLS had with, what in truth was, its de facto subsidiaries in Indonesia and Philippines. The plaintiffs believed this. ... The true loss he caused is captured in this case by pinning the defendant personally to the false picture he painted. ... 

 [emphasis in italic s in original, emphasis added in bold] 

76     Rajah JC awarded VHLS and VHLHK, _inter alia_ , damages in terms of the outstanding sums due to it from Vitaton, the Indonesian c ompany, and VSLP, the Philippines c ompany, under the falsified ac c ounts ( _Vita Health_ at [99] and [105]). In other words, Rajah JC seemingly awarded the c ompanies whose ac c ounts had been falsified by the defendant the rec eivables that would have been due to them _on the basis that the accounts had been true_. However, it is important to bear in mind that this basis of c omputation was _not_ used to quantify the damages for _fraudulent misrepresentation_. In fac t, the c laim for damages for misrepresentation was dismissed sinc e the loss was not pleaded and no evidenc e was adduc ed to prove the true financ ial position of the Vita Health group of c ompanies had the ac c ounts of VHLS and VHLHK not been falsified ( _Vita Health_ at [76]). VLS was eventually awarded damages for the defendant’s breac h of the warranties in the share sale agreement rather than for misrepresentation ( _Vita Health_ at [66]–[68]). Rajah JC went on to observe at [77] that the c ourt was “not satisfied that having rec overed their losses under the indemnity, VLS c an really mount a further c laim for misrepresentation”. 

77     It is therefore plainly inc orrec t for Mr Daniel to rely on _Vita Health_ to ground the plaintiff’s c laim for loss of profits purportedly arising from the misrepresentations. _Vita Health_ ac tually dec ided to the c ontrary. In my view, the c ourt in _Vita Health_ did not intend to alter the c onventional basis in awarding damages for fraudulent misrepresentation. This is evident from the fac t that the c ourt demanded stric t proof of the losses VLS suffered in relianc e on the misrepresentations. 

78     Therefore, I find that the plaintiff’s c laim for loss of profits has no basis in law and would have failed in any event.
