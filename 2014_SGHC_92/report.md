**Introduction** 

1       Until 21 Dec ember 2011, ADJ, the plaintiff-husband herein was married to ADK, the defendantwife. On that date, an interim judgment for divorc e was made on an unc ontested basis on the ground that the plaintiff had behaved in suc h a way that the defendant c ould not reasonably be expec ted to live with him. The plaintiff was not happy with this outc ome. He filed an applic ation for the interim judgment to be resc inded. This applic ation having failed, he then appealed against the dec ision to the High Court. His appeal was heard by Choo Han Tec k J (“the Judge”) who dismissed it. Throughout the proc eedings, the plaintiff has ac ted in person. 

2       By this originating summons, the plaintiff seeks leave of c ourt to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the dec ision of the Judge. The Judge’s reasons for his dec ision are found in his written judgment identified as _AWN v AWO and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2012] SGHC 228</span> (“the Judgment”). 

3       The defendant resists this applic ation on the basis that the plaintiff has failed to satisfy any of the three presc ribed c irc umstanc es required for leave to appeal. Ms Alic e Tan (“Ms Tan”), c ounsel for the defendant, argues that: 

 (a) there has been no prima fac ie error of law applied to this matter by the c ourts; 

 (b) there is no question of general princ iple to be dec ided for the first time; and 

 (c ) there is no question of law on whic h a dec ision by a higher tribunal would be of public advantage. 

The issues that I need to dec ide are enc ompassed in the c irc umstanc es desc ribed in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c ) above. 

**Background** 

4       The plaintiff and the defendant were married in September 2007. In July 2008, they had a son. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed an originating summons in the Family Court asking for the sole 


c are and c ustody of the son. The defendant resisted this applic ation and while the c ustody proc eedings were on-going, on 3 Oc tober 2011, she filed divorc e proc eedings (“D 4739”). 

5       The plaintiff filed a memorandum of appearanc e in D 4739 on 13 Oc tober 2011 in whic h he indic ated his intention to c ontest the divorc e proc eedings and to apply for the c ustody, c are and c ontrol of the son. Thereafter, however, the plaintiff did not file a defenc e to the c laim for divorc e. In due c ourse, D 4739 was listed for hearing in c hambers as an unc ontested matter. As suc h on the appointed date, 21 Dec ember 2011, interim judgment was granted without a hearing at whic h the parties needed to attend. 

6       The plaintiff says that on 21 Dec ember 2011, he went to the Family Court to attend a hearing in ac c ordanc e with the “NOTICE OF HEARING OF WRIT/PETITION” whic h had been sent to him. He registered himself elec tronic ally at 2.10pm and waited outside the c hambers of the c ourt. At 2.50pm, seeing that there was no ac tivity, he approac hed the c ourt’s Help Centre and was informed that there was no hearing that he c ould attend and that his attendanc e had been dispensed with. He found out subsequently about the interim judgment issued that day. 

**The plaintiff’s various applications** 

7       On 14 Marc h 2012, the plaintiff filed a summons in D 4739 in whic h he asked for the interim judgment to be resc inded pursuant to s 99(2) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”). This applic ation c ame on for hearing before a Distric t Judge (“the DJ”) on 2 August 2012. The plaintiff represented himself whilst the defendant was represented by Ms Tan. During the hearing, the plaintiff made lengthy submissions. 

8       At the end of the hearing, the DJ dismissed the plaintiff’s applic ation and explained to him that the interim judgment stood. The plaintiff was upset and made the following protest: 

 Then what is the purpose of c oming to Court? We are going towards the path of divorc e, not issue, but c annot be that these allegations are wrong. My c hild is wrong, it should not be this way, should be amic able. Right now, the next follow up, the purpose of c oming to this Court, if already dec ided Dec ember 2011 someone made a mistake then and asked me to wait, then you all proc eed further. There is one date, they asked me to follow up, you asked me to wait and I did, then how c ome I went to the Court on that day and they told me I need not attend. There is something, someone made a genuine mistake, should not be the way. Someone has to dig into it. It doesn’t make logic al soc ietal good sense, for the value of it. You are ac tually enc ouraging it. I followed this ac c ordingly. And now someone told me need not c ome. 

9       On 13 August 2012, the plaintiff filed an appeal against the dec ision of the DJ. In the meantime, the plaintiff had been unsuc c essful in obtaining sole c ustody of the son: joint c ustody had been awarded to both parents with c are and c ontrol to the defendant and ac c ess to the plaintiff. The plaintiff filed an appeal against this dec ision as well. 

10     Both appeals were heard by the Judge at the same time and the Judgment c ontains his grounds for dismissing both of them. The plaintiff subsequently filed two separate applic ations for leave to appeal to the c ourt of appeal, one in respec t of eac h set of proc eedings. I heard both applic ations. I dismissed the applic ation for leave to appeal in respec t of the c ustody issue but reserved my dec ision in relation to the applic ation for the resc ission of the interim judgment. 

11     I think it is pertinent to emphasise that the plaintiff c onduc ted both sets of proc eedings entirely by himself although he may have had some assistanc e in preparing part of his submissions. He 


appeared before me on no fewer than three oc c asions and spoke at length on eac h of those oc c asions. The plaintiff is in his mid-forties and was previously an offic er in the navy. He is c urrently an independent c ontrac tor. He speaks English fluently although somewhat idiosync ratic ally. 

**The reasons for the decisions made by the DJ and the Judge** 

12     The DJ gave brief oral reasons for her dec ision when she dismissed the plaintiff’s applic ation for resc ission. She noted that under s 99(2) of the Charter, any person may apply for resc ission of an interim judgment by reason of material fac ts not having been brought before the c ourt. Under s 99(3), the party against whom the interim judgment was granted may apply for a resc ission but there is no spec ific reason stated in the provision. However, this was not the sec tion relied on. She held that it was for the judge to dec ide, after having c onsidered all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, whether the interim judgment ought to be resc inded. She noted that English authorities had held that to resc ind an interim judgment, c ause suc h as that the judgment had been obtained by c ollusion or by reason of material fac ts not having bought before the c ourt would have to be shown. 

13     On the fac ts of the c ase before her, the plaintiff was aware of the divorc e proc eedings: he sent e-mails to the Family Court after being served with the doc uments and he attended the pre-trial c onferenc es. While he had filed his memorandum of appearanc e, he did not file any pleadings subsequently. The plaintiff had also admitted that he was informed by the Help Centre that he needed to file his Defenc e and Counterc laim if he wanted to c ontest the divorc e and that he would need c ourt approval for an extension of time as he was late in doing so. Yet no applic ation was filed. The plaintiff c laimed that he had c alled the defendant’s lawyer to seek c onsent for the extension of time but that the c alls were unsuc c essful. The DJ noted that he c ould then have applied for leave to file his pleadings out of time but he did not do so. 

14     In his affidavits and at the hearing the plaintiff stated that his basis for setting aside the interim judgment was that he did not agree with the matters set out in the defendant’s Statement of Partic ulars filed in support of the divorc e. It also appeared that the plaintiff was not saying that he did not want a divorc e: in his affidavit he said that sinc e parties had been separated for three years, he wanted the defendant to re-file her proc eedings based on three years’ separation and he would then c onsent. 

15     Having c onsidered the above c irc umstanc es, the DJ c onc luded that there was no basis on whic h to resc ind the interim judgment. The judgment had been validly granted and the mere fac t that the plaintiff did not agree to the grounds for divorc e did not invalidate it and was not in itself a valid ground for resc ission. 

16     On appeal to the Judge, the plaintiff repeated many of the arguments raised before the DJ. The Judge noted that the plaintiff had made unnec essarily lengthy submissions and the only vaguely viable ground he was relying on to resc ind the interim judgment was his allegation that he had not been given a c hanc e to be heard in the proc eedings. He alleged he was not kept informed of the defendant’s filing of her statement of c laim for unc ontested divorc e proc eedings alleging his unreasonable behaviour; the defendant’s request for and the c ourt’s subsequent granting of dispensation of the parties’ attendanc e at the unc ontested divorc e hearing; and the setting down of the ac tion for hearing. 

17     The Judge noted that all these c omplaints had been made before the DJ and her notes showed that she was of the view that the plaintiff had been aware of the divorc e proc eedings at every stage. 

18     The Judge then observed that an applic ation under s 99(2) of the Charter was not the proper 


avenue to seek relief. To suc c eed in suc h an applic ation the applic ant had to show c ause why the judgment should not be made final by reason of material fac ts not having been brought before the c ourt. In doing so, the applic ant must satisfy the c ourt that the non-disc losure of suc h fac ts vitiates the foundation of the interim judgment. In the appeal, the plaintiff had not shown that there were any material fac ts whic h were not disc losed in the making of the interim judgment whic h would have fundamentally affec ted it. The plaintiff’s motivation seemed to be his unhappiness with being labelled as having behaved “unreasonably”. On the appeal, the plaintiff had expressed his hope that the interim judgment c ould be resc inded so that a mirac le c ould happen to lead to rec onc iliation with the defendant. This was plainly not a good ground for resc inding an interim judgment. 

19     In the c irc umstanc es, the Judge took the view that there was no merit in the appeal and dismissed it. 

**The plaintiff’s submissions on the application** 

20     I heard the parties on three separate oc c asions over three half days. Most of the time was spent on the plaintiff’s submissions. He had filed a lengthy affidavit in support of his applic ation whic h c ontained both assertions of fac t and submissions. It also c ontained many derogatory referenc es to the defendant and her lawyer as well as to the Judge. The plaintiff was long-winded and repetitive so I will summarise his main points very briefly. 

21     First, the plaintiff dealt with the Judgment. He noted that the salient fac ts had been summarised but asserted that the Judge was not c ognisant of the full bac kground of the c ase. He took issue with the statement in the Judgment that the divorc e was granted “on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage” bec ause he himself had never regarded the marriage as irretrievably broken down and had stated so on many oc c asions. In the c ourse of so doing he desc ribed the defendant as “my deluded psyc hotic wife” and c ritic ised the Legal Aid Bureau for granting her legal aid to deprive his son “of his healthy c ontac t with his previous involved father [meaning, the plaintiff] and mentally sound paternal family”. 

22     He also took issue with the statement in the Judgment that the ground for the divorc e was the “husband’s unreasonable behaviour”. He asserted that most if not all of the defendant’s assertions of unreasonable behaviour had been “premeditated fabric ation and some artfully disc ernible misrepresentation suc h as violenc e, restric ting ac c ess to her parents ... _etc_ ” and that he had refuted suc h allegations in his affidavit. 

23     The plaintiff took issue with the Judge’s desc ription of his ground of appeal as vaguely viable. He asserted that he had in fac t not been informed of the unc ontested divorc e proc eedings and had not been given a dec ent c hanc e to be properly heard in the proc eedings. Thus he had been prejudic ed. He said he had made a c onsc ientious effort to partic ipate but due to “opposing attorney underhanded unprofessionalism ( _sic_ ) underhanded thwarting stanc e” he had not been heard. Contrary to the views of the Judge and the DJ that he had been aware of the proc eedings at every stage, in fac t he had at best been only partly aware of the divorc e proc eedings. 

24     The above assertion was, however, in my view, c ontradic ted by what the plaintiff went on to say. In respec t of what he knew, the plaintiff referred to his email of 25 Oc tober 2011. There, he had stated that on 24 Oc tober 2011 he had approac hed the Help Centre for c larific ation and nec essary ac tions in relation to the false matters rec ited in the defendant’s Statement of Partic ulars in D 4739. 

25     He was told by the offic ers at the Help Centre that he had to file a Defenc e and Counterc laim by 26 Oc tober 2011. The plaintiff then told the offic ers that he needed an extension of time as he 


c ould not meet the deadline. He was advised to ask the defendant’s lawyer if she would agree to the extension. The plaintiff then c alled Ms Tan’s offic e three times the same day but Ms Tan either kept silent upon hearing his request or just hung up the phone or ran him off. He did not c all again for fear of being ac c used of harassment. The c ourt offic er also advised him to write in for an early status c onferenc e whic h the defendant did the same day. 

26     At this point it should be noted that the plaintiff did not explain why he did not file the Defenc e and Counterc laim in time or apply to c ourt for an extension of time. It must also be emphasised that the plaintiff was fully c ognisant of the fac ilities available to help litigants in person suc h as himself. Indeed, he availed himself of them. 

27     Having set out the fac tual bac kground, the plaintiff then addressed the Judge’s holding that an applic ation under s 99(2) of the Charter was not the proper avenue for him to seek relief. He retorted that he was not a lawyer and therefore did not know what the proper avenue was. He said the DJ and the Judge should have told him this during the hearing. He was not happy either with the Judge’s desc ription of his motivation as being his unhappiness with being labelled “unreasonable” as he regarded the “c harges” against him as being very serious and putting his liberty, integrity and dignity at stake. He asserted that his reputation had been tarnished and his “c areer/job/professional/emotional/financ ial [position]” have suffered as a result. 

28     The plaintiff submitted that there was no merit and no good grounds for divorc e made out at all in D 4739. He thought he had not been given an opportunity to be heard; that the Judge had not paid full attention to his submissions and had been influenc ed “by the opposing artful representing attorney”. In his view, the Judge, the DJ and the other distric t judge who handled the c ustody matter had a c ommon “utilitarian” approac h to family justic e that prioritised or inc lined towards the objec tives of women and leant towards the interests of women and c ourt effic ienc y over those of male litigants/fathers/husbands and this resulted in the c ourt “unknowingly suppressing merc ilessly the howl of the vic timised male litigants”. 

**Decision** 

29     As I pointed out at the beginning of this judgment, the litigant who seeks leave to appeal has to show that at least one of the three c riteria applies in his c ase. The plaintiff being a layman did not address any of these c riteria direc tly although I drew his attention to them at the start of the first hearing. Ms Tan for the defendant submitted that he had not met any of the prerequisites for leave and that the applic ation should be dismissed. 

30     I reserved judgment in order to go through the plaintiff’s submission in more detail to asc ertain whether or not he c ould satisfy any c riterion. After having c onduc ted this exerc ise, I hold that he c annot do so. I set out, briefly, my reasons for thus holding. 

31     The first matter to c onsider is whether there has been an error of law on the fac e of the rec ord. The plaintiff would probably say that there was bec ause a divorc e was granted without a hearing at whic h he c ould c ontest the allegations made by his wife. The plaintiff’s applic ation for resc ission of the interim judgment was, however, founded on s 99(2) of the Charter whic h requires him to establish that there has been non-disc losure of a material fac t leading to the grant of the interim judgment. 

32     The plaintiff c ould not establish that bec ause he was not able to point to anything whic h the defendant should have disc losed and did not. The plaintiff did not agree with the allegations of unreasonable behaviour that the defendant made but these were assertions whic h it was up to him to 


disprove by filing a defenc e and c ounterc laim and c ontesting the divorc e. That the plaintiff c onsidered the allegations to be untruthful c ould not amount in itself to c onc ealment of material fac ts. As far as the rec ord went, the divorc e was handled in ac c ordanc e with the proc edures laid down by the Women’s Charter (Matrimonial Proc eedings) Rules (Cap 353, R 4, 2006 Rev Ed). In the absenc e of the proper pleadings filed by the plaintiff, the divorc e had to be treated as unc ontested. I respec tfully agree with both the DJ and the Judge that the plaintiff’s resc ission applic ation did not meet the requirements of s 99(2). 

33     The sec ond ground is that there is a question of general princ iple to be dec ided for the first time. I have not been able to disc ern suc h a question in the present c ase. The legal princ iples in relation to the grant of a divorc e on the basis of one party’s unreasonable behaviour are well established and not in doubt. Taken at fac e value, the partic ulars set out in the defendant’s Statement of Partic ulars whic h inc luded allegations of physic al and verbal abuse visited on her by the plaintiff as well as of her being in fear of his unc ontrolled temper were suffic ient, if not rebutted, to support the plea for a divorc e on the ground of unreasonable behaviour. While the plaintiff had entered a memorandum of appearanc e to the divorc e ac tion he did not file any pleading whic h formally c ontested these allegations and ac c ordingly the ac tion was treated in the usual way as an unc ontested one. The c ourt has well-settled and published rules whic h permit the _ex parte_ hearing of unc ontested suits. Nothing in these c irc umstanc es gives rise to any novel question of general princ iple. 

34     The plaintiff seems to be under the impression that divorc e and the grounds for the same should be c onsensual. That is not and has never been the law. The plaintiff’s misguided belief c annot be the basis on whic h to formulate a question of law where none exists. 

35     By the same token, there is in this c ase no question of law in whic h a dec ision by a higher tribunal would be of public advantage. The princ iples and proc edures involved in the c ase are well established; no further eluc idation is required. 

36     The c omplaints made by the plaintiff against the Judgment, the Judge and the DJ are misc onc eived. Both were fully c ognisant of the fac ts and the plaintiff’s own state of knowledge. An objec tive reading of the Judgment reveals that the dec ision was arrived at after a c areful and c omplete c onsideration of the fac ts and the duties of an appellate judge. There was no bias against the plaintiff on the basis of his gender by the judic ial offic ers; nor indeed does suc h bias exist in the law. 

37     As was amply demonstrated by the way that the plaintiff c onduc ted his c ase, he is intemperate, verbally abusive and not able to take a detac hed or objec tive view of the situation. He has little, if any, insight into his own behaviour and how his words impac t others. The plaintiff is in his present situation bec ause he did not ac t on the advic e he was given by the Help Centre to file his pleading and/or get an extension of time to do so. Further, after the interim judgment was granted, he attempted to set it aside on a ground that he c ould not satisfy. Sinc e failing in this applic ation he has dragged the defendant bac k to c ourt on several oc c asions for the appeal and the present applic ation sinc e neither c ould be disposed of in one sitting. The plaintiff has been given every opportunity to make his c ase but he has not been able to put forward grounds that would entitle him to leave to appeal. 

38     In the result, this applic ation must be dismissed. The plaintiff shall pay the defendant’s c osts as taxed or agreed.
