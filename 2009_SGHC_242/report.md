**Introduction** 

1       This was an appeal against the Order of the Strata Titles Board (“the Board”) dated 4 Dec ember 2008 in Strata Titles Board No 33 of 2008 (“STB 33/2008”) pursuant to an applic ation under s 84E of the Land Titles (Strata) Ac t (Cap 158, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”) (as it stood prior to the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Ac t 2007 (No 46 of 2007) and the Statutes (Misc ellaneous Amendments) (No 2) Ac t 2008 (No 30 of 2008)) in respec t of the development known as Nos 134/134A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/J/K/L and Nos 136/136A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/J/K/L (known as Koon Seng House) and Nos 124/126/128/130/132/138/140/142/144 Koon Seng Road (“the terrac e houses”) c omprised in Land Lot No 6329V of Mukim 26 (“the Development”). 

2       The plaintiff, Goh Teh Lee, sought the following orders in these proc eedings: 

 (a) that the order of the Board under s 84E of the Ac t in respec t of the Development on 4 Dec ember 2008 in STB 33/2008 be set aside; 

 (b) that the c osts of and inc idental to this applic ation and at the Tribunal below be paid by the defendants to the plaintiff; and 

 (c ) suc h further and/or other relief as the c ourt deems fit. 

3       The Development c omprised Koon Seng House, a 4-storey bloc k c ontaining 24 flats, and nine terrac e houses on one piec e of freehold land that was not subdivided. The flats were not strata subdivided but were c omprised in 999,999 year leases with no share in the land. Koon Seng House Residents’ Assoc iation (the “Residents’ Assoc iation”), whose members were the owners of the 24 flats, provided for the maintenanc e of the flats and the c ar parks. The nine terrac e houses were owned by the landowner. 

4       To understand how the mixed development c ame about, it would be best to set out a brief history. The nine terrac e houses were already sitting on freehold land c omprised in Lot 2139 Mukim 26 (from whic h the present Lot 6329 is derived from) prior to the 1960s. On 2 Dec ember 1960, Lot 2139 was c onveyed by Asia Realty Company Ltd to Ng Guan Cheong. Ng Guan Cheong erec ted a bloc k of 4-storey flats c omprising 24 flats on the said lot. Subsequently, Lot 2139 was c onveyed to Tai Hong 


Realty Co Ltd whic h then applied to subdivide the bloc k of flats into 24 separate units. As the law then stood (prior to the introduc tion of strata subdivision) that c ould only be done by c reating long leases of eac h flat, in this c ase for 999,999 years. Lot 2139 was thereafter c onveyed to Tan Tok Phuang “together with the houses erec ted thereon ... subjec t to the existing leases for 999,999 years granted to the owners of the 24 flats ...”. Lot 2139 was later sub-divided into Lots 2147 and 2148 Mukim 26. On 29 August 1968, Lot 2147 Mukim 26 was c onveyed by Tan Tok Phuang to Lim Cher Joo, “TOGETHER with the houses erec ted thereon ... Subjec t to the existing leases for 999,999 years granted to the owners of the 24 flats ...”. Eventually Lot 2147 Mukim 26 itself was subdivided into Lots 6328 and 6329 Mukim 26 with Lot 6329 being that upon whic h the flats and terrac e houses stand. 

5       The plaintiff was the c o-owner of unit 136D Koon Seng Road (one of the flats) and sole dissenter in the c ollec tive sale of the Development. (The plaintiff is c urrently involved in divorc e proc eedings with his wife, the other c o-owner of unit 136D, who agreed to the c ollec tive sale.) The defendants were members of the sale c ommittee and representatives of the proprietors forming the majority in the applic ation for the c ollec tive sale of the Development. 

6       The idea of a c ollec tive sale was first mooted in the last quarter of 2006 when a real estate agent approac hed c ertain owners of the flats to c onsider the matter. At a meeting (loosely desc ribed as an “Extraordinary General Meeting”) held on 18 November 2006, 18 flat owners agreed to proc eed with the matter by appointing the sec ond and third defendants to form part of the sale c ommittee. At the first meeting on 23 November 2006 c onvened by the Residents’ Assoc iation to disc uss a possible c ollec tive sale of the flats together with the terrac e houses, the owner of the nine terrac e houses and 18 owners of the flats agreed to a c ollec tive sale of the property. The first defendant, representing the estate of the landowner Lim Cher Joo (dec eased), was therefore appointed to the sale c ommittee. Subsequently, a team headed by Lim Choo Koon from ERA Realty Network was appointed to market the property. There was a sec ond meeting on 29 Dec ember 2006 where the marketing agents explained the c ollec tive sale proc edure. The first c ollec tive sale agreement (“CSA”) stipulated an initial reserve pric e of $21,780,000. The first signature was thereunto appended on 29 Dec ember 2006. By 29 January 2007, the owners of 27 out of 33 units (inc luding the nine terrac e houses) had signed the agreement. 

7       Subsequently, however, when bids were invited for purc hase of the property, there was only one offer for $18,800,000. Realising that the reserve pric e then was too high, the owners agreed (after disc ussion) to reduc e the reserve pric e to $19,800,000. To effec t this variation in the CSA, a supplemental agreement was signed. The first signature to the supplemental agreement was appended on 24 Marc h 2007. By 7 May 2007, the owners of 27 out of 33 units (inc luding the nine terrac e houses) had signed the agreement. Other owners progressively added their signatures so that by 6 September 2007, the owners of 30 out of 33 units had validly signed the supplemental agreement. This inc luded the owners of 21 out of 24 flats. 

8       On 29 May 2007, an option to purc hase (“the Option”) for $21,200,000 was granted to KS Development Pte Ltd. 

9       Sometime in September 2007, the majority owners rec ognised that despite the additional signatures, they were unlikely to obtain unanimous agreement to the CSA and that there might be the need to apply for a c ollec tive sale order. On 20 September 2007, there was a third owners’ meeting c onvened by the sale c ommittee to disc uss this issue. 

10     On or about November 2007, the majority owners took steps with a view to applying for a c ollec tive sale order. As there were no share values attac hing to the flats units, they applied for an 


allotment of notional share value for eac h unit with the Singapore Land Authority (“SLA”) pursuant to s 84E(2) of the Ac t. In suc h applic ation, they also asked for alloc ation of a notional share value for eac h of the terrac e houses. Upon valuation and survey of the Development, the proposed share values were approved by the SLA on 7 Marc h 2008. The alloc ation was seven share values for eac h flat and six for eac h terrac e house. On 14 Marc h 2008, an applic ation to the Registrar of Titles pursuant to s 84E(2) and approval for notional shares in land under s 84E of the Ac t was made. 

11     On 16 April 2008, an applic ation to the Board for a c ollec tive sale order was lodged. On 24 April 2008, the plaintiff, together with Han Jung Kuang Lawrenc e and Lee Woei Shyuan (the c o-owners of unit 136H) objec ted to the applic ation. However, on the day of the hearing before the Board, Han Jung Kuang Lawrenc e and Lee Woei Shyuan withdrew their objec tions. 

12     The Board made an order for the c ollec tive sale of the Development on 4 Dec ember 2008. The Board applied to the Minister, under s 92(9) of the Building Maintenanc e and Strata Management Ac t 2004 (No 47 of 2004) (“BMSMA”), and obtained an extension of time to issue its grounds. The Board delivered its grounds of dec ision on 4 February 2009. 

13     Being dissatisfied with the order of the Board, the plaintiff brought this ac tion. On 24 February 2009, the plaintiff and defendants entered into a c onsent order (Summons No 581 of 2009) that the order of the Board be stayed pending the outc ome of this hearing. 

14     The plaintiff’s grounds of objec tion to the c ollec tive sale were as follows: 

 (a) whether it was possible to determine if the requisite majority had been obtained if notional share values were assigned after the exec ution of the CSA by the majority owners; 

 (b) that the method of distribution for the sale proc eeds stipulated in the CSA (whic h was that eac h unit share equally the sale proc eeds) was unfair bec ause it did not take into ac c ount the notional share value or floor area of eac h unit and, pursuant to s 84E(11) of the Ac t, the single owner of the nine terrac e houses was not entitled to the proc eeds of the c ollec tive sale; 

 (c ) that the applic ation to the Board for a c ollec tive sale order was out of time bec ause the applic ation was not made within 12 months from the date the agreement of the owners representing 80% of the notional share values to the first CSA was reac hed; 

 (d) that there were numerous instanc es of serious non-c omplianc e with the mandatory statutory provisions of the Ac t whic h c ould not be waived by the Board; and 

 (e) that the STB did not have the power to override the order of a Subordinate Court ordering that the plaintiff be prevented from disposing of his assets (inc luding the flat). 

15     During the hearing, I asked for submissions to inc lude c onsideration of the issue whether the applic ation for a c ollec tive sale order in respec t of the Development c ame within the provisions of s 84E of the Ac t, given that the sale inc luded the nine terrac e houses standing on the land. 

**Purposive interpretation of the Act** 

16     The c ourts have taken a purposive approac h towards interpreting the statutory provisions of the Ac t. Sec tion 9A(1) of the Interpretation Ac t (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) mandates as follows: 


 Purposive interpretation of written law and use of extrinsic materials 

 9A. — (1) In the interpretation of a provision of a written law, an interpretation that would promote the purpose or objec t underlying the written law (whether that purpose or objec t is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or objec t. 

17     The purposive interpretation of statutory provisions was c onsidered in _PP v Low Kok Heng_ <span class="citation">[2007] 4 SLR 183</span> (“ _Low Kok Heng_ ” _)_. V K Rajah JA, sitting in the High Court, held at [39]: 

 In Singapore, any disc ussion on the c onstruc tion of statutes nec essarily takes plac e against the bac kdrop of s 9A of the Interpretation Ac t. The provision seeks to highlight the importanc e of adopting a purposive approac h in the c ourse of the c ourts’ interpretation of statutes in order to promote the underlying purpose behind the legislation (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Offic ial Report (26 February 1993) vol 60 at c ol 517). ... 

18     A few points may be made with respec t to the applic ation of s 9A. First, s 9A mandates that a c onstruc tion promoting legislative purpose be preferred over one that does not promote suc h purpose or objec t: see Brady Coleman, “The Effec t of Sec tion 9A of the Interpretation Ac t on Statutory Interpretation in Singapore” [2000] Sing JLS 152 at 154; c ited in _Low Kok Heng_ at [41]. Sec ond, s 9A requires that the purpose or objec t of the statute be taken into ac c ount even if the meaning of the words are neither ambiguous nor inc onsistent: see _Planmarine AG v Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore_ <span class="citation">[1999] 2 SLR 1</span> at [22]; _Low Kok Heng_ at [43], [45] and [46]. Third, s 9A(2) permits c onsideration to be given to extrinsic material when c onfirming or asc ertaining that the meaning of the statutory provision is the ordinary meaning c onveyed by the text of the provision taking into ac c ount its c ontext in the written law and the purpose or objec t underlying the written law: see _Low Kok Heng_ at [44]. There are, however, limits to purposive interpretation of statutes. Statutory provisions should not be c onstrued in a manner that goes against all possible and reasonable interpretation of the express literal wording of the provision. Courts must be c autious to observe the limitations on their power and to c onfine themselves to administering the law: see _Low Kok Heng_ at [52]. 

19     Sec tion 9A of the Interpretation Ac t has been applied in the c ontext of c ollec tive sales pursuant to the Ac t: see _Ng Swee Lang v Sassoon Samuel Bernard_ <span class="citation">[2008] 1 SLR 522</span> (“ _Ng Swee Lang_ ”) and affirmed by the Court of Appeal in _Ng Swee Lang v Sassoon Samuel Bernard_ <span class="citation">[2008] 2 SLR 597</span>. 

20     In _Kok Chong Weng v Wiener Robert Lorenz (Ankerite Pte Ltd, intervener)_ <span class="citation">[2009] 2 SLR 709</span>, the appellants argued that s 84A of the Ac t did not apply to privatised HUDC estates bec ause, for the c omputation of the age of the development, there was a requirement for a temporary oc c upation permit (“TOP”) or c ertific ate of statutory c ompletion (“CSC”) under s84A(1) whic h, owing to an exemption from the requirements of the Building Control Ac t (Cap 29, 1999 Rev Ed), HUDC estates do not have. The Court of Appeal, upholding the dec ision of Choo Han Tec k J held at [25]: 


 In our view, the issue of the applic ability of s 84A(1) to privatised HUDC estates therefore boils down to this question: Why would Parliament want to exc lude privatised HUDC estates from the c ollec tive sale sc heme when the objec t or purpose of the sc heme was to rejuvenate old estates and to improve the quality of housing in Singapore? Parliament must also know that HUDC estates would need rejuvenation sooner than private strata developments, and therefore they should be prime c andidates for the sc heme. ... 

Therefore, despite the literal wording of s 84A seeming to prec lude its applic ability to privatised HUDC estates, the Court of Appeal took a purposive interpretation of the provision to allow for the c ollec tive sale of the HUDC estate in question. 

21     In _Mohamed Amin bin Mohamed Taib v Lim Choon Thye_ <span class="citation">[2009] 3 SLR 193</span>, two subsidiary proprietors of a unit in Regent Court objec ted to the c ollec tive sale on the ground that they would inc ur a financ ial loss as the proc eeds of sale of their unit would be less than the pric e they had paid for it. In light of that objec tion, the purc haser furnished an undertaking as well as entered into a supplemental agreement with the sale c ommittee to pay the objec tors an additional sum on c ompletion. However, the Board found that the objec tion had been made out on the basis that s 84A(7) provided that the Board shall not approve of an applic ation for c ollec tive sale where any minority owner will suffer a financ ial loss and dismissed the applic ation. Before Judith Prakash J, the question was whether the phrase “proc eeds of sale for his lot” in s 84A(8)( _a_ ) referred spec ific ally to the amount that an individual proprietor c ould expec t to rec eive for his lot on the basis of the sale pric e mentioned in the sale. The Board’s view was that in order to determine whether any objec tor would inc ur a “financ ial loss” within the meaning of s84A(7), the “proc eeds of sale” referred to in s84A(8) meant stric tly the proportion of the sale pric e in the c ollec tive sale agreement whic h was payable to that objec tor and would not inc lude any additional amount whic h the purc haser had agreed to pay the objec tor. The plaintiffs, however, submitted that the approac h taken by the Board in c onstruing s 84A(8) undermined the legislative purpose behind the Ac t. This was bec ause on the Board’s interpretation, any subsidiary proprietor with a paper loss of any amount would be entitled to refuse any offer made to c ompensate him, and thereby prevent the c ollec tive sale from going through. Therefore, the proper and purposive interpretation of “proc eeds of sale for his lot” under s 84A(8) would be that this phrase referred to the moneys whic h subsidiary proprietors would rec eive for their lot upon the c ompletion of the c ollec tive sale. This submission was ac c epted by Prakash J in [27]: 

 I ac c epted the above submission. I c onsidered that the Legislature would not have intended the adverse c onsequenc es to future en bloc sales that would arise from a stric t c onstruc tion of ‘proc eeds of sale’. I also agreed that the interpretation propounded by the plaintiff was not a strained interpretation of the Ac t. There was no reason why ‘proc eeds of sale’ should be limited to simply looking at the ‘purc hase pric e’ set out in the sale and purc hase agreement. Adopting the wider interpretation would further the legislative purpose of the Ac t by taking into ac c ount efforts to make good the financ ial loss of individual subsidiary proprietors and to ensure that no individual subsidiary proprietor would be prejudic ed by the c ollec tive sale. ... 

22     Therefore, I observe that where nec essary to effec t the legislature’s purpose behind the statutory provision, the c ourts are willing to depart from its literal interpretation. 

**_Purpose of the statutory provisions relating to collective sale schemes_** 

23     It would be useful at this junc ture to set out the purpose of the statutory provisions relating to 


the c ollec tive sale of a development. In _Ng Swee Lang_ ([19] _supra_ ), I made the following observations at [49]–[51]: 

 49 From a review of the provisions of the Ac t ([1] supra ) dealing with en bloc sales and the Sc hedule, it is obvious that the main purpose of the legislation is to make it easier for en bloc sales to take plac e. This is ac hieved by dispensing with the need for unanimity and requiring in lieu thereof the c onsent of only the requisite majority of the subsidiary proprietors more partic ularly set out in s 84A(1) of the Ac t. At the sec ond reading of the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Bill (Bill 28 of 1998) c ontaining the provisions for en bloc sales, the Minister of State for Law, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, said (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (31 July 1998) vol 69 at c ol 601): 

 I had informed this House on 19th November last year that Government would be amending the law to make it easier for en-bloc sales to take place. The current position is that a single owner, for whatever reason, can oppose and thwart the sale. Government has rec eived many appeals and feedbac k from frustrated owners whose desires to sell their flats or c ondominiums en-bloc have been so thwarted. As a result, these buildings cannot take advantage of enhanced plot ratios to realise their full development potential, which would have created many more housing units in prime 999-year leasehold or freehold areas for Singaporeans. A secondary benefit is that these developments, especially the older ones, could have been rejuvenated through the en-bloc process. 

 I said that the law would be amended to remove the need for unanimous c onsent. ... 

 [emphasis added] 

 50 Cogent reasons behind this move were c ited by the Minister of State: ‘I emphasised that in land-sc arc e Singapore, suc h an approac h was ... imperative as it would make available more prime land for higher-intensity development’ ( ibid ). Without suc h an approac h, as long as even a single owner objec ted, properties c ould not take advantage of enhanc ed plot ratios to yield more housing units; neither c ould old residential buildings be replac ed by new and better housing. 

 51 As the Minister explained, safeguards were introduc ed in the legislation to protec t the interests of minority owners. Henc e, the detailed proc edures set out in the legislation. As stated by the Minister, the purpose of these proc edures is to ( id at c ol 603): 

 ... ensure that all relevant parties will have adequate notic e of the sale and its terms, in order to decide whether or not to lodge objections with the Strata Titles Board. [emphasis added]. 

 The proc edures were not built in as absolute obstac les to be surmounted on pain of the Board being prec luded from exerc ising jurisdic tion if any of the proc edural requirements were not met, regardless of whether and to what extent the interests of the minority were affec ted. 

 [emphasis in original] 

24     In the same vein, the Court of Appeal in the same c ase held (at [5]–[8]): 


**The policy on collective sales** 

5       Before we deal with these grounds of appeal, we should understand the polic y c onsiderations applic able to the c ollec tive sale of c ondominiums and flats in Singapore. The c ollec tive sale, under whic h all the units and the c ommon property in a c ondominium development or a bloc k of flats (‘subjec t property’) may be sold if a suffic ient number of subsidiary proprietors agree to it (for ease of exposition, we will refer to the requisite body of c onsenting subsidiary proprietors as ‘majority owners’ in this judgment), notwithstanding the objec tions of dissenting subsidiary proprietors (‘minority owners’), is a pec uliar feature of the property market in Singapore. _It is a statutory construct to give effect to the Government’s policy to facilitate urban renewal by enabling old flat blocks to be redeveloped by the private sector_. Initially, a c ollec tive sale c ould take plac e only if the subsidiary proprietors of all the lots in the subjec t property c onsented to the sale. However, due to rapid c hanges in the ec onomic and environmental landsc ape of Singapore, the Government dec ided to modify its polic y on c ollec tive sales by relaxing the stric t statutory c onditions applic able to suc h sales. At the sec ond reading of the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Bill 1998 (Bill 28 of 1998) (‘the Bill’) to enac t these c hanges (‘the Sec ond Reading’), the Minister of State for Law [Assoc iate Professor Ho Peng Kee] said (see _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (31 July 1998) vol 69 (‘ _Singapore Parliamentary Debates_ ’) at c ol 601): 

 [The c ourt then quoted the exc erpt of the Minister of State’s speec h quoted in [23] above.] 

6       The new sc heme outlined above was enac ted by the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Ac t 1999 (Ac t 21 of 1999) (‘the 1999 Amendment Ac t’). It modified two main qualifying c onditions for a c ollec tive sale. The first c onc erns the age of the subjec t property; the sec ond c onc erns the proportion of the subjec t property’s share value and the total area of the lots held by majority owners. These two c onditions are reflec ted in s 84A(1) of the Ac t as follows: 

 (a) if the subjec t property is less than ten years old, the majority owners must hold not less than 90% of the share values and not less than 90% of the total area of all the lots in the subjec t property; 

 (b) if the subjec t property is ten years old or more, the majority owners need only hold not less than 80% of the share values and not less than 80% of the total area of the lots in the subjec t property. 

7       _The 1999 Amendment Act also introduced a large number of procedural steps and substantive safeguards to protect the interests of minority owners, such as ensuring that they are kept fully informed by the subject property’s collective sale committee of the progress of the sale and any developments in relation thereto_. ... 

8 ... _The legislative amendments made to the collective sale scheme in 1999 are intended to facilitate – and not to place unnecessary obstacles in the way of – collective sales, as can be seen from the ministerial speech quoted earlier (at_ [5] _above)_. 

[emphasis added] 


25     Although the c omments in _Ng Swee Lang_ ([19] _supra_ ) were made in relation to s 84A of the Ac t, they are equally apposite with referenc e to s 84E. The Minister of State’s speec h, in any event, was made with referenc e to the c ollec tive sale regime in general. Therefore, the c ollec tive sale sc heme is intended to fac ilitate the sale and rejuvenation of old developments, whilst ensuring adequate safeguards to protec t the interests of minority owners. This is also reflec ted in the wording of ss 84A, 84B, 84C, 84D, 84E, 84F and 84G of the Ac t, all of whic h are provisions that would help fac ilitate the proc ess of effec ting a c ollec tive sale. 

**Whether s 84E applied to the Development** 

26     Sec tion 84E of the Ac t provides as follows: 

 Application for collective sale where proprietors of flats own leasehold estate of at least 999 years or other estate in flats not registered under Act but do not own the land 

 84E. — (1) This sec tion shall apply where there are subsisting leases of flats in a development registered under the Registration of Deeds Ac t (Cap. 269) or the Land Titles Ac t (Cap. 157) for a leasehold estate of 999 years or more or for suc h other estate as the Minister may, by notific ation in the Gazette , spec ify and where the proprietors of the flats do not own the land c omprised in the development. 

 (2) The proprietors of 25% of the flats to whic h this sec tion applies may apply to the Registrar for notional shares in the land to be assigned to eac h of the flats based on the method used by the Commissioner for the alloc ation of share values. 

 (3) An applic ation to a Board for an order for the sale of all the flats and the land in a development to whic h this sec tion applies may be made by — 

 (a) the proprietors of the flats who own not less than 90% notional share of the land where less than 10 years have passed sinc e the date of the issue of the latest Temporary Oc c upation Permit on c ompletion of any building c omprised in the development or, if no Temporary Oc c upation Permit was issued, the date of the issue of the latest Certific ate of Statutory Completion for any building c omprised in the development, whic hever is the later; or 

 (b) the proprietors of the flats who own not less than 80% notional share of the land where 10 years or more have passed sinc e the date of the issue of the latest Temporary Oc c upation Permit on c ompletion of any building c omprised in the development or, if no Temporary Oc c upation Permit was issued, the date of the issue of the latest Certific ate of Statutory Completion for any building c omprised in the development, whic hever is the later, 

 who have agreed in writing to sell all the flats in the development to a purc haser under a sale and purc hase agreement whic h spec ifies the proposed method of distributing the sale proc eeds to all the proprietors of the flats (whether in c ash or kind or both), subjec t to an order being made under subsec tion (6) or (7). 

 (4) The proprietors of the flats referred to in subsec tion (3) shall also serve a c opy of the notic e to be served pursuant the Fourth Sc hedule on the proprietor of the land and every mortgagee, c hargee or other person with an estate or interest in the land and whose 


interest is notified on the land register for that land. 

(5) A proprietor of any flat in the development who has not agreed in writing to the sale referred to in subsec tion (3) and any mortgagee, c hargee or other person (other than a lessee) with an estate or interest in the flat and whose interest is notified on the land register for that flat may eac h file an objec tion with a Board stating the grounds for the objec tion within 21 days of the date of the notic e served pursuant to the Sc hedule or suc h further period as the Board may allow. 

(6) Where an applic ation has been made under subsec tion (3) and no objec tion has been filed under subsec tion (5), the Board shall, subjec t to subsec tion (9), approve the applic ation and order that the flats and the land in the development be sold. 

(7) Where one or more objec tions have been filed under subsec tion (5), the Board shall, subjec t to subsec tion (9), after mediation, if any, approve the applic ation made under subsec tion (3) and order that the flats and the land in the development be sold unless, having regard to the objec tions, the Board is satisfied that — 

 (a) any objec tor, being a proprietor, will inc ur a financ ial loss; or 

 (b) the proc eeds of sale for any flat to be rec eived by any objec tor, being a proprietor, mortgagee or c hargee, are insuffic ient to redeem any mortgage or c harge in respec t of the flat. 

(8) For the purposes of subsec tion (7) ( _a_ ), a proprietor — 

 (a) shall be taken to have inc urred a financ ial loss if the proc eeds of sale for his flat, after any deduc tion allowed by the Board, are less than the pric e he paid for his flat; 

 (b) shall not be taken to have inc urred a financ ial loss by reason only that his net gain from the sale of his flat will be less than the other proprietors. 

(9) The Board shall not approve an applic ation made under subsec tion (3) if the Board is satisfied that — 

 (a) the transac tion is not in good faith after taking into ac c ount only the following fac tors: 

 (i) the sale pric e for the flats and the land in the development; 

 (ii) the method of distributing the proc eeds of sale; and 

 (iii) the relationship of the purc haser to any of the proprietors; or 

 (b) the sale and purc hase agreement would require any proprietor who has not agreed in writing to the sale to be a party to any arrangement for the development of the flats and the land in the development. 

(10) Where no objec tion has been filed under subsec tion (5), the determination under subsec tion (9) shall be made by the Board on the basis of the fac ts available to the Board. 

(11) Where a Board has made an order for the sale of the flats and the land, the proprietor 


 of the land shall be deemed to have transferred his estate and interest in the land to the purc haser without c onsideration upon the registration by the Registrar of the transfers of all the flats (exc ept the flats deemed to be owned by the proprietor under subsec tion (14)) in the development and the Registrar shall enter a notific ation of the vesting of the land in the purc haser on the land register. 

 (12) The proprietors of the flats who have not agreed in writing to the sale, the proprietor of the land, a mortgagee, c hargee or other person with an estate or interest in land, where applic able, shall produc e the title deeds for the flats or the land to the person having c onduc t of the sale, the representatives appointed under sec tion 84A (2) or to their solic itors. 

 (13) If the title deeds for the flats or the land are not produc ed under subsec tion (12), the person having c onduc t of the sale shall not be required to produc e to the purc haser any title deed other than a c ertified true c opy of the title deed or a subsidiary c ertific ate of title. 

 (14) Where the proprietor of the land in a development referred to in subsec tion (1) has granted leases for some but not all the flats in the development, he shall be deemed to be the proprietor of the flats whic h are still owned by him. 

 (15) Sec tions 84A (2), (3), (5), (11), (12) and (13), 84B and 84C shall apply, with the nec essary modific ations, to any applic ation or order made under this sec tion. 

 (16) For the purposes of this sec tion — 

 “development” means any parc el of land with one or more buildings; 

 “proprietor” inc ludes a suc c essor in title. 

27     It is c lear that the paradigm c ase whic h s 84E c aters to is one where the only premises on the land are the flats eac h of whic h has been leased for 999 years. In these c irc umstanc es, given that the reversionary interest of the landowner is _de minimis_ , it is not unfair to require, as sub-s (11) does, that onc e the Board makes an order for c ollec tive sale of the flats, the landowner is deemed to have transferred his estate and interest in the land to the purc haser without c onsideration. (Exc eptionally, where the landowner retains ownership of one or more of the flats, he is deemed to be the proprietor of those flats and would be entitled to a share of the _en bloc_ sale proc eeds as suc h: see sub-s (14).) 

28     It might be argued, on a stric t interpretation, that s 84E does not apply to a mixed development suc h as the present one, where the terrac e houses are part of the freehold land. In suc h a c ase, the landowner owns more than a reversionary interest in the land. Sec tion 84E, whic h c ontemplates the landowner giving up the land without c onsideration, therefore would appear inapplic able. 

29     However, to ac hieve a sale of the flats together with the terrac e houses on the land, a twostage approac h c ould have been adopted. First, the owner of the land c ould have sold to the developer the land (together with the nine houses thereon) subjec t to the existing leases. For the developer’s protec tion the sale would be on c ondition that the flat owners agreed unanimously to sell, or that an order for c ollec tive sale was obtained. Failing unanimity, the flat owners c ould have applied for notional share values under s 84E(2) and, after having attained the agreement of flat owners 


holding not less than 80% of the aggregate notional share values, gone on to apply for a c ollec tive sale order pursuant to s 84E. However, that was not the approac h adopted. Had it been adopted, there would have been no doubt as to s 84E’s applic ability. 

30     As noted, the Board nevertheless allowed the applic ation under s 84E. Despite the wide definition of “flat”, it was inappropriate that the terrac e houses were assigned notional share values; in my view, the wording of s 84E(2) c ontemplated assignment of share values only to the leasehold “flats”. The question I fac ed was whether I ought to overturn the Board’s dec ision on the basis that the owner of the terrac e houses should not have shared in the proc eeds of sale nor have been c ounted amongst the majority agreeing to the sale. After deliberation, I c ame to the c onc lusion that I ought to uphold the Board’s dec ision and thereby give effec t to parliamentary intention. In arriving at that c onc lusion, I took into ac c ount the fac t that there would be no prejudic e either to the flat owners or to the landowner if I allowed the sale to proc eed. Firstly, with or without the landowner’s nominal share value, the requisite majority had been attained in any event. Leaving the landowner out, by 6 September 2007 (whic h was within the time allowed for the supplemental agreement to be exec uted), all but the owners of two flat units had signed the agreement. Sec ond, as to the sharing of sale proc eeds, the landowner would have been able to ac hieve the same via the two-stage method in any event. 

31     On the other hand, if I overturned the Board’s dec ision, the parties would have had to go bac k to the drawing board and start the proc ess of c ollec tive sale all over again adopting the two-stage approac h as outlined above. Assuming the majority remained resolute, that would result in the same outc ome. 

32     I was fortified in my view that the c ollec tive sale order should be upheld when I c onsidered the overall purpose of the legislation. From a perusal of ss 84A to 84FA, it was c lear that Parliament intended to fac ilitate c ollec tive sale in various c onc eivable settings. 

33     Although the c ollec tive sale sc heme was not intended to apply to landed properties as suc h (per Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee during the sec ond reading of the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Bill (Bill 28 of 1998)) in the present c ase, the terrac e houses and the flats sit on the same land; the owner of the land (and terrac e houses) holds his freehold interest subjec t to the leases of the flats. In suc h a c ase, an _en bloc_ sale of the flats with a view to redevelopment of the land c ould not proc eed without the c onc urrenc e of the landowner. As in _Chang Mei Wah Selena v Wiener Robert Lorenz_ <span class="citation">[2008] 4 SLR 385</span>, this was an instanc e where the literal interpretation of the provision would hinder and not ac hieve the overall objec t of the statute. In my view, a purposive interpretation was therefore required to fac ilitate the c ollec tive sale of the Development, suc h interpretation not being prejudic ial to the dissentient. I repeat my observation that had the two-stage approac h been taken, the same result would have been ac hieved and the plaintiff would have had no c ause for c omplaint on that sc ore. 

**Whether the application to the Board for a collective sale order was out of time** 

34     Paragraphs 1 and 1A of the Sc hedule of the Ac t provide that: 


 1. Before making an application to a Board, the subsidiary proprietors referred to in section 84A (1) or the proprietors of flats referred to in section 84D (2) or 84E (3), as the case may be, shall — 

 ( a ) execute within the permitted time but in no case more than 12 months before the date the application is made , a c ollec tive sale agreement in writing among themselves (whether or not with other subsidiary proprietors or proprietors) agreeing to agree to c ollec tively sell — 

 (i) in the c ase of an applic ation under sec tion 84A, all the lots and c ommon property in a strata title plan; or 

 (ii) in the c ase of an applic ation under sec tion 84D or 84E, all the flats and the land in a development to whic h sec tion 84D or 84E, as the c ase may be, applies; 

 ... 

 1A. For the purposes of this Sc hedule — 

 (a) the permitted time in relation to a c ollec tive sale agreement exec uted or to be exec uted by subsidiary proprietors or proprietors referred to in sec tion 84A (1), 84D(2) or 84E(3), means a period — 

 (i) starting from the date the first subsidiary proprietor or proprietor, or his duly appointed attorney, as the c ase may be, signs the c ollec tive sale agreement; and 

 (ii) ending not more than 12 months after the date the first subsidiary proprietor or proprietor, or his duly appointed attorney, as the c ase may be, signs the c ollec tive sale agreement; and 

 (b) the c ollec tive sale agreement shall be regarded as exec uted notwithstanding that it is exec uted on separate c opies thereof and at different times. 

 [emphasis added] 

35     The plaintiff c ontended that the applic ation to the Board, whic h was made on 16 April 2008 for a c ollec tive sale order, was out of time. In his view, the applic ation had to be made within 12 months after the first owner appended his signature to the first CSA, that is, by 28 Dec ember 2007. This view was erroneous for two reasons. 

36     First, where an earlier CSA had failed to ac hieve its intended purpose, _ie_ , to sell the land to a purc haser, the proprietors of the land c ould not be prec luded from making a new agreement with a lower reserve pric e. Henc e, the supplemental agreement c onstituted a fresh agreement. Therefore, time for the purpose of para 1A( _a_ ) of the Sc hedule should be rec koned from the date the first signature was appended to the supplemental agreement. 

37     Sec ond, s 84E(3)( _b_ ) provides that proprietors holding _not less than 80%_ of the aggregate share value _may_ apply to the Board for a c ollec tive sale order. At the earliest, the 12-month period within whic h applic ation may be made to the Board starts when 80% majority has been reac hed or first c rossed (as the c ase may be). The plaintiff was therefore wrong to say that time for this purpose 


started running from the date of the first signature. There are two distinc t 12-month periods. As I said, applic ation _may_ be made to the Board as soon as 80% majority has been reac hed or first c rossed. However, this does not mean that the 12-month period within whic h applic ation must be made to the Board nec essarily starts then (see para 1(a) of the Sc hedule). For example, it c ould start at a later date when a greater perc entage majority is reac hed so long as the time elapsed from the first signature to the time when suc h desired majority is reac hed is also not greater than 12 months (see para 1A of the Sc hedule). 

38     The first signature to the supplemental agreement was appended on 24 Marc h 2007 and the last was on 6 September 2007 (well within the 12-month period within whic h a majority of not less than 80% had to be reac hed). The other 12-month period ( _ie_ , that within whic h applic ation to the Board had to be made) c ommenc ed on 6 September 2007. Therefore, the applic ation made on 16 April 2008 was well within time. 

**Whether it was possible to determine if the requisite majority had been obtained if notional share values were assigned after the execution of the CSA by the majority** 

39     The plaintiff c ontended that it was not possible to determine if the requisite majority by share value had been obtained on the CSA bec ause the notional share values had not been obtained prior to the exec ution of the CSA by the majority. 

40     I dismissed the plaintiff’s c ontention. There is no requirement that the notional share value must be obtained before the owners appended their signatures to the c ollec tive sale agreement, in this c ase the supplemental agreement. What matters is that when the applic ation is made to the Board for a c ollec tive sale order, it must be shown that the c ollec tive sale agreement (in our c ase the supplemental agreement) had been signed by the requisite majority (suc h majority being c omputed by referenc e to the notional share values). 

**Whether the transaction was in good faith given the method of distribution of the sale proceeds** 

41     The plaintiff alleged that pursuant to s 84E(9)( _a_ )(ii) of the Ac t, the Board erred in approving the c ollec tive sale bec ause the transac tion was not in good faith due to the unfair method of sharing the share proc eeds. In his view, the method of distribution of the sales proc eeds stipulated in the CSA (whic h was that eac h unit of flats or terrac e house took an equal share of the sale proc eeds) departed from the established methods of distribution, _ie_ , by share value, strata area, valuation or a c ombination of all three. The plaintiff (relying on his valuer’s evidenc e) c ontended that the valuation method would be the best method of distribution bec ause the terrac e houses were built separately from the flat units and were of a muc h poorer c ondition, and the owner of the terrac e houses did not c ontribute to the maintenanc e or upkeep of the c ommon property. 

42     The Board found that, on the fac ts and upon c onsideration of the opinion of expert witnesses, the method of distribution agreed to by the majority was “fair” in the c irc umstanc es of the c ase. 

43     In the c ontext of _en bloc_ sales, the c onc ept of fairness is often both an elusive and subjec tive one. As between different owners, eac h might argue that his unit deserves a larger share of the sale proc eeds by reason of its larger area, greater share value, superior view, better state of repair or c ommanding height. If they remained intransigent, no _en bloc_ sale c ould ever be ac hieved. For this reason, in suc c essful _en bloc_ sales, disparate individualistic ambitions give way to group realism in rec ognition of the fac t that no unit sold piec emeal would fetc h as muc h as in a c ollec tive sale. Instead of presc ribing “fairness” as suc h, s 84E(9)( _a_ )(ii) provides that the Board shall not approve an 


applic ation if the Board is satisfied that the transac tion is not in good faith. (This does not mean that fairness has no part to play. A transac tion struc k down for lac k of good faith will inevitably reveal aspec ts of unfairness whether in the sale pric e or in the manner that it was arrived at or in the method for sharing of the sale proc eeds.) For the purposes of this appeal, the relevant question was whether the Board was in error when it determined that the transac tion was fair (and therefore presumably in good faith). In this c onnec tion, I refer to my earlier dec ision in _Dynamic Investments Pte Ltd v Lee Chee Kian Silas_ <span class="citation">[2008] 1 SLR 729</span> (“ _Dynamic Investments_ ”), where I held at [14]–[15]: 

 14 But in a partic ular set of c irc umstanc es the question whether a transac tion was lac king in good faith nevertheless requires an applic ation of the primary fac ts to the legal c riteria as to what ‘good faith’ is. As suc h, it is traditional (if somewhat inexac t) to desc ribe it as a question of fac t. The Board’s holding that it was not satisfied that the transac tion was not in good faith (regard being had to the method of distributing the proc eeds of sale) was a dec ision on the fac ts of the c ase and c ould not be c hallenged unless there was an error of law either ex facie (as to whic h there was none) or suc h as was desc ribed in Edwards v Bairstow. 

 15 I note also that whether or not the transac tion was lac king in good faith was something on whic h the Board had to be ‘satisfied’. To my mind, that further suggested that the Legislature, rec ognising an element of subjec tivity in suc h a dec ision, intended to prec lude c hallenge to the Board’s finding save where there was an error of law. 

As I explained in [28] to [30] above, the owner of the terrac e houses was entitled to payment for sale of the same. Without his agreement to sell his freehold interest (subjec t to the leases of the flats), _en bloc_ sale of the flats with a view to redevelopment of the land c ould not proc eed: (see [33] above). In any event, c omparing the terrac e houses’ “footprint” on the land with that of the bloc k of flats, it was inc omprehensible how the division of sale proc eeds c ould be assailed. It was signific ant to note that none of the other flat owners (inc luding those with flats similar in size to the plaintiff’s) objec ted to the method of distribution. 

44     Bearing that in mind, I found that it was not possible to say that the Board made an error of law or that the Board’s finding was suc h that “no person ac ting judic ially and properly instruc ted as to the relevant law c ould have c ome to the determination under appeal”: see _Edwards v Bairstow_ [1956] AC 14 at 36; _Dynamic Investments_ at [16]. There was therefore no basis on whic h the finding of the Board c ould be impugned. 

**Whether the statutory provisions of the Act were complied with** 

45     Paragraph 1 of the Sc hedule to the Ac t sets out the requirements that the proprietors must satisfy prior to making an applic ation to the Board. 

## REQUIREMENTS UNDER SECTION 84A, 84D OR 84E 

 1. Before making an applic ation to a Board, the subsidiary proprietors referred to in sec tion 84A (1) or the proprietors of flats referred to in sec tion 84D (2) or 84E (3), as the c ase may be, shall — 

 (a) exec ute within the permitted time but in no c ase more than 12 months before the date the applic ation is made, a c ollec tive sale agreement in writing among themselves (whether or not with other subsidiary proprietors or proprietors) agreeing to agree to c ollec tively sell — 


 (i) in the c ase of an applic ation under sec tion 84A, all the lots and c ommon property in a strata title plan; or 

 (ii) in the c ase of an applic ation under sec tion 84D or 84E, all the flats and the land in a development to whic h sec tion 84D or 84E, as the c ase may be, applies; 

(b) onc e every 8 weeks after the start of the permitted time, affix to a c onspic uous part of eac h building c omprised in the strata title plan or the development to whic h sec tion 84D or 84E applies, as the c ase may be, a notic e in the 4 offic ial languages spec ifying — 

 (i) the number of subsidiary proprietors or proprietors who, immediately before the date of the notic e, have signed the c ollec tive sale agreement; and 

 (ii) the proportion (in perc entage) that the total share value of suc h subsidiary proprietors’ lots bear to the total share value of all lots c omprised in that strata title plan, or that suc h proprietors’ total share or total notional share of the land bears to the total share or notional share of all proprietors in that land, as the c ase may be; 

(c ) c onsider the c ollec tive sale either — 

 (i) at an extraordinary general meeting of the management c orporation held in ac c ordanc e with Part IV of the Ac t or any other c orresponding written law; or 

 (ii) in the c ase of land in a development to whic h sec tion 84D or 84E applies, at a meeting held after sending a notic e of the meeting by registered post to all the proprietors to their last rec orded addresses at the Registry of Titles or the Registry of Deeds and plac ing a c opy of the notic e under the main door of every flat in the development; 

(d) advertise in the 4 offic ial languages the partic ulars of the applic ation in suc h loc al newspapers as approved by the Board; 

(e) serve notic e of the proposed applic ation on all the subsidiary proprietors of all the lots and c ommon property in the strata title plan c onc erned or on all proprietors of all flats in the development c onc erned, as the c ase may be, by registered post and by plac ing a c opy of the proposed applic ation under the main door of every lot or flat, together with a c opy eac h of the following: 

 (i) the c ollec tive sale agreement referred to in sub-paragraph ( a ); 

 (ii) the sale and purc hase agreement whic h is to be the subjec t of the applic ation to the Board; 

 (iii) a statutory dec laration made by the purc haser under the sale and purc hase agreement on the nature of his relationship (if any) or, if the purc haser is a body c orporate, the nature of the relationship of every one of its direc tors (if any), to any subsidiary proprietor of any lot c omprised in that strata title plan or any proprietor of any flat in the development, as the c ase may be; 


 (iv) the minutes of the extraordinary general meeting or meeting referred to in sub-paragraph ( c ); 

 (v) the advertisement referred to in sub-paragraph ( d ); 

 (vi) a valuation report that is not more than 3 months old; 

 (vii) a report by a valuer on the proposed method of distributing the proc eeds of the sale due under the sale and purc hase agreement; and 

 (f ) affix a c opy of the notic e referred to in sub-paragraph ( e ) in the 4 offic ial languages to a c onspic uous part of eac h building c omprised in the strata title plan or the development, as the c ase may be. 

46     Before the Board, the plaintiff alleged the following proc edural irregularities: 

 (a) Less than 80% of the units’ owners (or only 20 out of 33 units) had signed the CSA as late as 18 July 2007 in breac h of the requirements under s 84E(3)( b ) of the Ac t. In support of this, the plaintiff alleged that: 

 (i) there were disc repanc ies in signatures between the two versions of the CSA and between the CSA and SA; and 

 (ii) the defendants admitted that in the CSA the signatures of unit 136F in the CSA and unit 136A in the supplementary agreement were faulty. Adding to the allegedly suspic ious c irc umstanc es was the fac t that entire supplemental agreement and some of the signatures on the CSA were not witnessed. 

 (b) The meeting pursuant to para 1( c )(ii) of the Sc hedule to the Ac t to c onsider the c ollec tive sale was not held. 

 (c ) The mandatory 8 week notic e pursuant to paragraph was not furnished on the dates stated in the Statutory Dec laration of the defendants at the time of the applic ation to the Board for a c ollec tive sale order. There were disc repanc ies between the dates of the Notic es stated in the applic ation and the dates of the alleged ac tual Notic es. 

 (d) The valuation report by OPC Valuers Pte Ltd on 14 January 2008 was prepared more than 3 months before the date of the applic ation to the Board on 16 April 2008, in breac h of paragraph 1(e)(vi) of the Sc hedule to the Ac t. 

 (e) The CSA c ontained an illegal c lause 22 seeking to post date the c ommenc ement date of the CSA to the day when the last owner c omprising the 80% majority signs the CSA when the Ac t spec ific ally provides for the CSA to be dated on the day when the first owner signs the CSA. 

At the hearing before this c ourt and in his submissions, the plaintiff raised other proc edural irregularities: 

 (f ) The sale c ommittee signed the Option and not a sale and purc hase agreement, as required pursuant to s 84E(3)( b ) of the Ac t. 

 (g) The names in the first sc hedule of the Option differed from the names on the 


 advertisements pursuant to para 1(d) of the Sc hedule to the Ac t (I understood the plaintiff to be saying that there were some errors in the names of the majority owners set out in the first sc hedule of the Option. 

 (h) There was a breac h of the Option bec ause the deposit should be held by the vendors’ solic itors as stakeholder pursuant to c l 2 of the Option and not to the vendors’ and purc hasers’ solic itors as joint stakeholder. 

 (i) The Minister’s approval of the Board’s applic ation for an extension of time to c arry out its work was out of time. 

47     The plaintiff c ontended that in view of the foregoing, the sales c ommittee never obtained the requisite mandate to sell the estate below its reserve pric e and that the defendants had therefore no mandate to sell the estate on suc h terms. 

48     I c onsidered eac h of the alleged irregularities in turn. 

49     With respec t to (a), where proc edural irregularities had been ac knowledged, the disputed signatures were not nec essary to ac hieve the required 80% majority. In the supplemental agreement (whic h was the one relied upon for the applic ation to the Board), even disc ounting unit 136A, by 6 September 2007 the owners of 21 out of 24 flat units had signed the agreement. This was above the 80% majority required. As for the other allegations, the plaintiff failed to substantiate his c laims. There was no evidenc e adduc ed to show that the signatures were not genuine. Notably, none of the owners named as signatories to the CSA and supplemental agreement had c hallenged the authentic ity of their signatures. 

50     With respec t to (b), there was in fac t a meeting held on 20 September 2007. At the meeting, the owners were informed of the status of the sale, in partic ular, that the next step would be to apply to the Board for a c ollec tive sale order. In my view, this meeting satisfied the statutory requirement that prior to the applic ation to the Board, a meeting was c onvened to c onsider the c ollec tive sale. Paragraph 1( _c_ )(ii) of the Sc hedule (whic h is the relevant provision) does not require that it be an extraordinary general meeting. 

51     With respec t to (c ), at the hearing before the Board, Lim Choo Koon stated the following: 

 ... Mr Jason Lee [c olleague of Lim Choo Koon] and I – or rather, the team, we are c onstantly aware of this 8-week notic e. We are very sure that this is c ertainly a requirement, is put up. But what I not sure is how long it stays on the wall. 

The Board did not make any c onc lusive finding on this. In any c ase, the Board was satisfied that the plaintiff was kept aware of the developments in the sale agreement. 

52     With respec t to (d), under para 1( _e_ )(vi) of the Sc hedule, the 3-month period should be c omputed by referenc e to the date of servic e of notic e of the proposed applic ation to the Board and not the date of the ac tual applic ation to the Board. In other words, the valuation report should have been made no earlier than three months prior to the date of servic e of the notic e to the flat owners. There was therefore no breac h of the proc edural requirement. 

53     With respec t to (e), this was a point devoid of any signific anc e and nothing hangs upon it. As I already found, the supplemental agreement was validly exec uted within the permitted time pursuant to para 1A( _a_ ) of the Sc hedule to the Ac t, and an applic ation to the Board was lodged within the 


permitted time pursuant to para 1( _a_ ) of the Sc hedule as well. 

54     With respec t to (f), this was again a hopeless objec tion. The Option, upon ac c eptanc e, bec ame a sale and purc hase agreement and fulfilled the requirements of s 84E(3)( _b_ ). The allegation was therefore misguided. 

55     With respec t to (g), the minor errors in the names of the majority owners listed in the Sc hedule to the Option was a matter between the buyer and the sale c ommittee. If at all, this was a point for the purc haser to take up. In any event, in my view, suc h an error c ould be easily rec tified without vitiating the sale and purc hase agreement, as the majority had indeed signed the supplemental agreement. 

56     With respec t to (h), c ll 2, 15 and 16 of the Option provided that: 

2\. Option Money: 1% of Pric e to Vendors’ solic itors as stakeholder. 

 ... 

15\. This offer may be ac c epted by the Purc haser signing hereunder and returning this     Option to the Vendors’ solic itors M/s Leong Kwok Yan and payment of 5% of the Pric e (inc lusive of the Option Money) as a deposit before expiry of the Option. The said deposit will be held by the Vendors’ solic itors M/s Leong Kwok Yan and the Purc haser’s solic itors M/s Rajah & Tann as joint stakeholders pending c ompletion of the sale and purc hase. 

16\. Within 14 working days of the Vendors’ solic itor’s notific ation to the Purc haser’s solic itors that all the Part II Owners [the owners who have not signed the CSA] have agreed to sell or upon the STB Order being obtained the Purc hasers shall pay another 5% of the Pric e to the joint stakeholders as further deposit. ... 

The plaintiff’s allegation was mere nit-pic king as c ll 15 and 16 of the Option provided that the deposit would be held by the vendors’ and the purc haser’s solic itors as joint stakeholders pending c ompletion of the sale and purc hase. 

57     With respec t to (i), s 92(9) of the BMSMA reads as follows: 

 (9) A Board shall c arry out its work expeditiously and shall make a final order or determination within 6 months from the date it is c onstituted or within suc h extension of time as may be granted by the Minister. 

The plaintiff’s allegation was misc onc eived, given that the Board had made a determination on 4 Dec ember 2008 when they ordered the c ollec tive sale of the Development. That was within the 6month period allowed. 

**Whether the Board has the power to override the order of a subordinate court ordering that the plaintiff be prevented from disposing his assets including his flat herein** 

58     The plaintiff c ontended that bec ause his wife had obtained an injunc tion against him from disposing of assets owned by him, he was prevented from selling his flat. The Board found that this issue was not relevant in an applic ation for a c ollec tive sale before the Board. 

59     I agreed with the Board’s dec ision. The plaintiff’s wife had agreed to the c ollec tive sale. 


Therefore, there was no reason why the plaintiff c ould not apply to c ourt for a variation of the injunc tion. 

**Conclusion** 

60     For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the plaintiff’s applic ation with c osts.
