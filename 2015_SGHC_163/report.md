**Introduction** 

1       Originating Summons No 979 of 2014 (“OS 979/2014”) was the Plaintiffs’ applic ation for spec ific performanc e of an Option to Purc hase entered into between the Plaintiffs and the 1st Defendant, Rupesh Kumar (“Rupesh”), in relation to a property owned by Rupesh at 60 Chestnut Avenue #23Treehouse Singapore 679517 (“the Property”). The Plaintiffs’ applic ation for spec ific performanc e was made on the ground that they had satisfied the c onditions under the Option to Purc hase, whic h are the payment of an option fee and the payment of a deposit to exerc ise the option, thereby giving rise to a binding sale and purc hase agreement of the Property. Having heard the parties, I granted the Plaintiffs’ applic ation on 13 January 2015 and ordered the property to be transferred to the Plaintiffs upon payment of the balanc e sum under the Option to Purc hase. I also made the following orders to fac ilitate the transfer of the Property: 

 (a) Rupesh to pay interest, inc luding late c ompletion interest under Condition 9 of the Law Soc iety of Singapore’s Conditions of Sale 2012, to the Plaintiffs; 

 (b) Rupesh to deliver vac ant possession of the Property to the Plaintiffs free of all enc umbranc es upon c ompletion of the sale of the Property; 

 (c ) 4th Defendant to withdraw his c aveat on 21 January 2015 or on the c ompletion of the sale of the Property, whic hever date oc c urs earlier; 

 (d) Costs, damages, late c ompletion interest, and any other expenses inc urred by the Plaintiffs to disc harge any obligations of Rupesh in respec t of the Property to be deduc ted from the balanc e sum of sale proc eeds due to Rupesh; and 

 (e) There shall be liberty to apply. 

2       Having rendered my dec ision on the substantive matters, it remained for me to dec ide on the issue of c osts for OS 979/2014. On this matter, the Plaintiffs, who had suc c eeded in OS 979/2014, made an oral applic ation during the 13 January 2015 hearing for a personal c ost order against 


Rupesh’s solic itor. I reserved judgment after hearing the Plaintiffs and Rupesh’s solic itor on this issue. 

**Facts** 

**_Background facts of OS 979/_** 

3       The Plaintiffs were a married c ouple looking to purc hase a c ondominium c lose to the 1st Plaintiff’s mother’s house. A friend of theirs by the name of Nagasaravanan s/o Uttamasegeran (“Saravanan”) informed them that his friend, Rupesh, wanted to sell the Property on an urgent basis. Rupesh asked for a selling pric e of $1.45m, but as he needed the funds urgently, he requested for half the sum to be paid on or before exerc ising the Option to Purc hase and for the balanc e sum to be paid upon c ompletion of the sale. The Plaintiffs agreed and entered into an Option to Purc hase with Rupesh on 23 September 2013 (“OTP”) reflec ting this arrangement: 

 IN CONSIDERATION of the sum of Singapore Dollars Six Hundred and Seventy Five Thousand Only (S$675,000.00) (hereinafter c alled “the option money”) rec eived by (Mr. Rupesh Kumar ...) (hereinafter c alled “the Vendor”) from the Purc haser this day by way of option money, the Vendor hereby grants the Purc haser and/or Nominee(s) this Option to Purc hase the above desc ribed property ... upon the terms set out below. ... 

4       Under the OTP, the Plaintiffs had to pay an additional sum of $50,000 before 4.00pm on 24 Oc tober 2013 in order to exerc ise the OTP. The c lause bearing out this obligation read as follows: 

 ... This Option shall be exerc ised by the Purc haser by signing at the portion of this Option marked “ACCEPTANCE COP Y” and delivering the same duly signed together with a c heque for the sum of [$50,000] paid to the Vendor ... 

5       The parties intended for a sale and purc hase agreement to arise upon the Plaintiffs’ exerc ise of the OTP, as is evident from the following c lauses in the OTP: 

 This Option and the Ac c eptanc e Copy signed by the Purc haser shall c onstitute a binding c ontrac t of the sale and purc hase of the property. The option money shall form part of the purc hase pric e paid upon proper exerc ise of this Option in the manner stipulated therein. 

 ... 

 The sale pric e shall be [$1,450,000]. 

6       The Plaintiffs’ c ase was that they had paid Rupesh two separate sums of $675,000 and $50,000, and that upon whic h, a binding sale and purc hase agreement arose between the parties. They tendered the following doc uments to support their c ase: 

 (a) Two separate notes bearing Rupesh’s signature, ac knowledging that he had rec eived sums of $675,000 and $50,000 from the Plaintiffs for the purc hase of the Property. 

 (b) A letter dated 22 Oc tober 2014 from Rupesh’s former solic itors, Wong, Gopal & Rai (“WGR”), who had represented him in the sale and purc hase of the Property, c onfirming that Rupesh had rec eived the sums of $675,000 and $50,000 from the Plaintiffs. 

7       Unfortunately, c ompletion was not forthc oming. The original c ompletion date of 15 November 2013 was delayed and postponed a number of times. Rupesh was adjudged a bankrupt on 18 


September 2014, following whic h the Plaintiffs dec ided to c ommenc e OS 979/2014 on 17 Oc tober 2014 against him to fac ilitate the c ompletion of the sale and purc hase agreement. 

**_Facts pertaining to the issue of costs_** 

8       I pause to point out the signific anc e of Rupesh’s status as a bankrupt. Under s 131(1)( _a_ ) of the Bankruptc y Ac t (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the BA”), a bankrupt is inc ompetent to maintain any ac tion without the sanc tion of the Offic ial Assignee (“OA”). The prerogative in dec iding whether to defend an ac tion against the bankrupt and if so, when and how to go about doing that rests entirely with the OA unless otherwise sanc tioned by the OA. What this means is that onc e Rupesh was dec lared a bankrupt on 18 September 2014, he would have had to seek the OA’s authorisation in order to defend himself against the Plaintiffs. 

9       Rather than leaving the OA to determine the appropriate c ourse of ac tion to take in OS 979/2014, Rupesh wanted to defend the ac tion by himself. He instruc ted Mr Gunaseelan S E Selvadurai (“Mr Gunaseelan”) to represent him. Mr Gunaseelan, who was aware of Rupesh’s status as a bankrupt, knew he had to obtain the OA’s c onsent before he c ould do so. He wrote to the OA on 3 November 2014 seeking the requisite c onsent: 

 We have been approac hed by [Rupesh] to ac t for him ... 

 We c onfirm that a third party has agreed and ac c epted to pay all our fees and disbursements in this matter. 

10     On the same day, the OA emailed the Plaintiffs’ solic itors, Mr Vijai Parwani (“Mr Parwani”) informing him that the OA had authorised Mr Gunaseelan to ac t for Rupesh: 

 The bankrupt’s solic itors, [Mr Gunaseelan], had written to our offic e today to obtain the [OA’s] c onsent to ac t for the bankrupt in OS 979/2014. As a third party is paying for the bankrupt’s legal c osts inc urred in this matter, the Offic ial Assignee has granted [Mr Gunaseelan] c onsent to ac t for the bankrupt in OS 979/2014. Please note that parties are not to look to the [OA] or the [bankrupt’s] estate for c osts inc urred in the matter. 

11     The first Pre-Trial Conferenc e (“PTC”) was held the next day. Mr Parwani and Mr Gunaseelan appeared in the PTC whereas the OA was absent. Later on in the evening, the OA sent a follow-up email to Mr Gunaseelan stating as follows: 

 We wish to c larify that the [OA’s] sanc tion for you to ac t for your c lient, [Rupesh], in the matter of OS 979/2014 is on the basis that a third party is bearing all c osts inc urred in this matter, inc luding any adverse c osts made against the bankrupt. 

12     Mr Gunaseelan did not issue a response to the OA’s c larific ation in the prec eding paragraph. On 12 November 2014, the OA sent another email to him, requesting him to forward the OA a third party undertaking that indemnifies the OA of all c osts inc urred in defending OS 979/2014. A subsequent email was sent to Mr Gunaseelan on 21 November 2014 wherein the OA reminded Mr Gunaseelan of the same, although in the same email the OA requested Mr Gunaseelan to appear in the next PTC sc heduled on 25 November 2014 on its behalf. 

13     At the PTC held on 25 November 2014, the Assistant Registrar direc ted a reply affidavit and response affidavits from Rupesh and the Plaintiffs respec tively to be filed and served. Ac c ordingly, Mr Gunaseelan updated the OA of these developments on the same day. 


14     The OA c ontinued to make no appearanc e in the third and final PTC held on 16 Dec ember 2014. On that same day, Mr Gunaseelan requested a template c opy of the deed of indemnity from the OA. The OA obliged his request on 31 Dec ember 2014. 

15     OS 979/2014 c ame before me on 13 January 2015, during whic h all parties, inc luding the OA, were present. By then, the OA had yet to rec eive the third party undertaking. Following an oral judgment granted in favour of the Plaintiffs during the hearing, the Plaintiffs applied for their c osts to be borne personally by Mr Gunaseelan. 

16     A signed c opy of the deed of indemnity finally arrived at the OA’s offic e on 16 January 2015 – three days after I had delivered judgment on the substantive matters in OS 979/2014. In response to this development, the OA took the position that throughout the proc eedings the sanc tion given was a c onditional one, and the absenc e of a third party undertaking rendered the sanc tion ineffec tive. The OA further dec lared that it had no power to grant “retrospec tive sanc tion” in respec t of a deed of indemnity tendered after the disposal of the matter. 

**Discussion and decision** 

17     The Plaintiffs’ c ase for Mr Gunaseelan to bear their c osts rests upon _Tan King Hiang v United Engineers (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 529</span> (“ _Tan King Hiang_ ”). In _Tan King Hiang_ , a bankrupt filed a motion seeking an extension of time to file his notic e of appeal against a summary judgment entered against him in a suit c ommenc ed by the respondent. The bankrupt’s solic itors proc eeded to serve the papers on the respondent’s solic itors without obtaining the sanc tion of the OA. Almost two months later, and ten days before the motion was due to be heard, the bankrupt’s solic itors wrote to the OA for approval to c ontinue with the proc eedings. The OA gave unc onditional c onsent at first, but three days later the OA qualified its earlier c onsent by requiring the bankrupt to deposit a sum of $40,000 as the OA’s sec urity for c osts in relation to the motion. No sec urity for c osts was furnished by the date of the hearing of the motion. In the c irc umstanc es, the Court of Appeal dismissed the motion on the ground that the bankrupt was inc ompetent to pursue the matter as he had failed to satisfy the prec ondition to the OA’s c onsent. Further, in the absenc e of sec urity furnished by the bankrupt, the Court of Appeal ordered the bankrupt’s solic itors to bear the respondent’s c osts of the motion pursuant to O 59 r 8(1)( _c_ ) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed), whic h reads as follows: 

 Subjec t to this Rule, where it appears to the Court that c osts have been inc urred unreasonably or improperly in any proc eedings or have been wasted by failure to c onduc t proc eedings with reasonable c ompetenc e and expedition, the Court may make against any solic itor whom it c onsiders to be responsible (whether personally or through an employee or agent) an order direc ting the solic itor personally to indemnify suc h other parties against c osts payable by them. 

18     The reason for imposing personal c osts against the bankrupt’s solic itors was that the solic itors c ontravened the prohibition against bankrupts maintaining any ac tion (other than for damages in respec t of a personal injury) by pursuing the motion on behalf of their c lient without the prior sanc tion of the OA despite knowing that their c lient was a bankrupt (see s 131(1)( _a_ ) of the BA). Having been adjudic ated a bankrupt, the bankrupt’s c ause of ac tion vested in the OA and as suc h only when the bankrupt, or in turn his solic itor, has rec eived the OA’s sanc tion c an he take further steps in the proc eedings. Given that the motion was pursued without the OA’s sanc tion, the Court of Appeal found that the solic itor in question had wasted c osts by his “failure to c onduc t proc eedings with reasonable c ompetenc e”, and ac c ordingly ordered personal c osts against him. 

19     Insofar as the issue of whether a solic itor ac ting on behalf of a bankrupt should be made 


personally liable for c osts is c onc erned, I am satisfied that that the princ iples in _Tan King Hiang_ are applic able, and would adopt them to analyse the present c ase. In my judgment, the princ ipal issue arising for determination is whether Mr Gunaseelan failed to c onduc t proc eedings with reasonable c ompetenc e and expedition. 

20     As mandated by s 131(1)( _a_ ) of the BA, a bankrupt, or in turn his solic itor, may take further steps in proc eedings after the c ommenc ement of bankruptc y only upon rec eipt of the OA’s sanc tion. The Plaintiffs, relying on the authority of _Tan King Hiang_ , argue that c onsent had not been given by the OA. They argue that the c ondition upon whic h the OA’s c onsent rests – whic h was for Mr Gunaseelan to furnish a third party undertaking – was not satisfied and ac c ordingly c onsent was not given. Mr Gunaseelan argues that the OA had already issued its c onsent, and seen in this light, the request for him to issue a third party undertaking was more of a formality rather than a prec ondition. 

21     What was relevant to my mind in these proc eedings was whether from the surrounding c irc umstanc es, inc luding the words and c onduc t of the OA in evidenc e, the Plaintiffs c an show that Mr Gunaseelan’s c onduc t of the proc eedings was wanting. In _Tan King Hiang_ , the Court of Appeal looked to the issue of existenc e of ac tual c onsent, and nothing was raised in that c ase about reasonable c onduc t and expedition arising out of a reasonable interpretation of events. 

22     An email sent by the OA on 3 November 2014 whic h allowed Mr Gunaseelan to ac t for Rupesh in OS 979/2014. This email did not c ontain any qualific ation of the permission to ac t. However, the next day, the OA proc eeded to, in its own words, “c larify” its previous email to Mr Gunaseelan that suc h c onsent was given “on the basis that a third party [would be] bearing all c osts inc urred in this matter”. About a week later on 12 November 2014, the OA sent another email requesting for a signed indemnity bearing all c osts inc urred in OS 979/2014. The Plaintiffs’ (and the OA’s) position is that these two emails, taken together, had the effec t of suspending the OA’s earlier c onsent until Mr Gunaseelan submits a third party undertaking. While that might be true on the fac e of it, it is equally important to note that the OA’s subsequent c onduc t may be taken as being inc onsistent with the intent expressed in these two emails. Most signific ant is its email sent to Mr Gunaseelan on 21 November 2014, as follows: 

 2 We understand that there is a PTC fixed for OS 979/2014 on 25 November 2014 at 9.30am. Please assist to mention on our behalf at the PTC. Please also provide us with an update on the direc tions given by the Judge and the next hearing dates. 

 3 Please let us have the undertaking from the third party that we have requested in our email of 12 November 2014 as soon as possible. 

 [emphasis added] 

23     The 21 November 2014 email c ould reasonably be interpreted as the OA authorising Mr Gunaseelan to represent Rupesh in the proc eedings on its behalf, and suc h authorisation was not attac hed with a prec ondition of a third party undertaking. On this interpretation, if the OA had intended otherwise, the OA would have asked for the third party undertaking to be submitted _before_ Mr Gunaseelan attends the next PTC instead of asking for it to be submitted “as soon as possible”. It c ontinued to be absent from the subsequent (and final) PTC held on 16 Dec ember 2014, allowing Mr Gunseelan to represent Rupesh on its behalf despite not having rec eived the third party undertaking. In doing so, I find that the OA was essentially permitting Mr Gunaseelan to take further steps in the proc eedings. It bears emphasis that suc h c onduc t on the part of the OA must be viewed in the light of the fac t that Mr Gunaseelan had yet to submit a third party undertaking throughout this period of time. That being the c ase, it seems immaterial to me whether or not the 4 and 12 November 2014 


emails had the effec t of qualifying the OA’s c onsent. Even if they did, I am satisfied that the OA’s email dated 21 November 2014 c ould be interpreted as having waived suc h a prec ondition, and there is no evidenc e of substantial work done in the interim period. Indeed, it was only at the 25 November 2014 PTC that the AR direc ted reply and response affidavits from Rupesh and the Plaintiffs to be filed. 

24     In my judgment, it is useful to analyse the question of the apparent c onsent against the statutory bac kground of s 131(1)( _a_ ) of the BA. The provision vests in the OA the right to c ontrol proc eedings on behalf of the bankrupt, and having been so empowered, the OA was in a position to do a number of things. It c ould apply to stay the proc eedings and request the Plaintiffs to file a proof of debt in bankruptc y; it c ould c ontest the Plaintiffs’ applic ation; it c ould ask for an adjournment if it required more time to c onsider what position to take; or it c ould simply c onc ede to the Plaintiffs’ applic ation before the matter even c omes to the c ourts. On what was before me, the OA did none of these. A total of three PTCs were c onduc ted before the matter c ame before me of whic h the OA attended none. Several affidavits were filed by both sides, whic h the OA was kept informed of, and yet it did not say anything. It did not exerc ise the powers vested in it by virtue of s 131(1)( _a_ ) of the BA, allowing and even requesting Mr Gunaseelan to c arry on with the proc eedings. It further gave Mr Gunaseelan no direc tions whatsoever, giving the plausible interpretation of leaving him with the c onduc t of this matter. 

25     Looking at the c ontext of this c ase as a whole, while the requirements stipulated by the OA were not in the end fulfilled by the time of the hearing of the substantive applic ation, I c ould not find in light of the reasonable interpretation that c ould be given to the OA’s c ommunic ations at the time with Mr Gunaseelan that there was lac k of reasonable c ompetenc e on his part. 

26     I now turn to examine the Plaintiffs’ sec ond argument. The sec ond plank relied on by the Plaintiffs to mount the negligenc e allegation is that Mr Gunaseelan did not furnish the deed of indemnity in good time, whic h goes to the issue of reasonable expedition. This, as they emphasised in their oral submissions on 6 April 2015, purportedly prejudic es their right to file a proof of debt against the bankrupt’s estate with the OA. I agree that Mr Gunaseelan c ould have been more expeditious in furnishing the third party undertaking. He furnished the deed on 16 January 2015, some two months after the OA first requested for it on 12 November 2014. However, while this may suggest some form of delay on his part, it is important to view this not in isolation but in the c ontext of all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase. More important is the fac t that the OA had at no point in time presc ribed a deadline for Mr Gunaseelan to furnish the deed of indemnity. I further c onsider that Mr Gunaseelan was in c onstant c ontac t with the OA, asking for a template of the deed on 16 Dec ember 2014 to whic h the OA obliged on 31 Dec ember 2014. Even by 31 Dec ember 2014, the OA did not hurry Mr Gunaseelan to submit the deed by a c ertain date, knowing full well of the steps Mr Gunaseelan had taken in OS 979/2014 by then. Against this bac kground, I am not satisfied that the length of time Mr Gunaseelan took to proc ure a deed of indemnity is suffic iently inordinate as to justify a personal c ost order against him on the ground that he had been inc ompetent or negligent. 

27     The Plaintiffs further argue that the disposal of the matter renders Mr Gunaseelan’s applic ation for the OA’s sanc tion nugatory, and on the authority of _Standard Chartered Bank v Loh Chong Yong Thomas_ <span class="citation">[2010] 2 SLR 569</span>, the OA was in no position to grant a “retrospec tive sanc tion” for the deed that c ame in only after the matter had already been disposed of. Given my c onc lusions above, the issue of whether the OA has powers to grant “retrospec tive sanc tion” is now moot. 

28     In summary, I find that Mr Gunaseelan’s representation of Rupesh in the proc eedings c ould not be said to be without reasonable c ompetenc e or expedition, and as suc h I refuse the Plaintiffs’ applic ation for the c osts of OS 979/2014 to be ordered against him. Given the OA’s authorisation for Mr Gunaseelan to take further steps in the proc eedings, I order c osts of OS 979/2014 out of Rupesh’s 


estate. I note that the OA took a different position in its latest c orrespondenc e with the Plaintiffs on this matter, wherein it stated that its c osts would not be admitted as a provable debt against Rupesh’s estate as these c osts were inc urred after the c ommenc ement of bankruptc y. At present, I am not inc lined to agree with the OA as its position appears to be out of line with the law stated in c ases suc h as _Re Wilson Lovatt & Sons Ltd_ [1977] 1 All ER 274, whic h suggest that the Plaintiffs’ c osts are to be taken as the OA’s expenses in the distribution of Rupesh’s estate, and thus payable in ac c ordanc e with the priorities provided for under s 90(1) of the BA. I would however say no more on this issue at this time as the OA was not before me at the hearing on c osts. Whether or not the Plaintiffs’ c osts ranks as the OA’s expenses should only be determined after the OA’s arguments are heard. In that event, whether or not the OA may rec over the sum payable to the Plaintiffs from Saravanan on the basis that he had undertaken to indemnify the OA of the same will also have to be determined separately. 

**Conclusion** 

29     I therefore dismiss the Plaintiffs’ applic ation.
