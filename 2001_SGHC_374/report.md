## Judgment 

### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

1\. The ac c used was 26 years old and first c ame to Singapore in 1992 to work as a maid. She returned after a c ouple of years when her work permit expired. Her mother refused to let her leave India again after that and kept her passport. She then used her sister, Kanagi's passport to leave India for Singapore. This sec ond journey here was made in 1998. She worked as a maid with a family until about August 1999 when she left her employers on ac c ount of ill-treatment. She then worked as a part-time help and one of those who employed her as suc h was 67-year old Anjella Nagalingam who lived at Bloc k 121 Tec k Whye Lane #05-830 with one of her sons, Leslie Joseph and his wife Catherine Tan Poh Gek. 

2\. In the evening of 26 Marc h 2001 Anjella Nagalingam was found dead in her bedroom by Catherine Tan. It was not in dispute that Anjella Nagalingam was assaulted and c onsequently c ollapsed in her room sometime after 2pm that day. The ac c used was c harged with her murder. The fac ts of that day as are largely undisputed by the ac c used were as follows. 

3\. Sometime before Christmas of 1998 the ac c used was introduc ed to work for Anjella Nagalingam on a part-time basis, c leaning her flat. She would be paid about $10 an hour, but when she worked for Anjella Nagalingam she was paid $20 an hour. She usually worked in the morning. On 26 Marc h 2001 the ac c used arrived at the flat about 10 am. Catherine Tan had already left for work that morning at 8.40am. Leslie Joseph, however, was still at home that day although he would normally have left for work and would not see the maid. That morning, he was awakened by the family dog barking at the arrival of the ac c used to the flat. He emerged from his room at 11am and saw the ac c used and Anjella Nagalingam in c onversation whic h he did not intrude. Instead, he had his lunc h. He remembered the ac c used leaving the flat about 11.45am. He left for work about 12.30pm. 

4\. The ac c used testified that before she left the flat that morning Anjella Nagalingam had sold her a pair of ear studs for $80. She also asked the ac c used to stay but she said she had work elsewhere, but agreed to return later. She returned to the flat about 2 o'c loc k in the afternoon after a vain attempt to get work in Bukit Batok. Anjella Nagalingam let her in and invited her into her (Anjella Nagalingam's) bedroom where they sat down, she on a stool and Anjella Nagalingam on her bed, eating fruit and watc hing television. The ac c used testified that Anjella Nagalingam bemoaned the c onduc t of her daughters-in-law as well as her brother-in-law who she said was reluc tant to buy her jewellery. She told the ac c used that in those c irc umstanc es she might as well sell the jewellery to her maid, meaning the ac c used. At some point in the c ourse of that c onversation the ac c used felt ill and went to the kitc hen where she vomited. Upon her returning to the bedroom, Anjella Nagalingam asked if she was pregnant. The ac c used said that she c ould not be. She told Anjella Nagalingam that she 


should banish suc h thoughts bec ause if she c ould be heard to utter them what, the ac c used enquired, would others think. Anjella Nagalingam then retorted severely by referring to the ac c used as "thevadiyah" a Tamil word, used derogatorily for prostitute. This quic kly led to a fight between the two women. The ac c used said that Anjella Nagalingam pushed her and she (the ac c used) pushed her (Anjella Nagalingam) in retaliation. Anjella Nagalingam then slapped her, and in the c ourse of the fight, the ac c used fell but got up again; Anjella Nagalingam also fell and pulled at the leg of the ac c used. Anjella Nagalingam then tried to hit the ac c used with a telephone whic h the ac c used wrestled from her and hit her instead. The ac c used admitted that she had hit Anjella Nagalingam about four or five times but c annot remember the details as to how many blows ac tually landed, where they landed, how hard they landed and where the two protagonists' respec tive positions were at that time although the prosec uting DPP persisted in trying to extrac t c lear and definite answers from her on those points. The ac c used also admitted that she had used the stool to hit Anjella Nagalingam in the c ourse of the fight, whic h in response to the DPP in c ross-examination, she estimated to be about two to three minutes, steadfastly rejec ting the DPP's suggestion that the fight itself took between 30 to 45 minutes. 

5\. The ac c used testified that in the c ourse of the fight Anjella Nagalingam grabbed a telephone and tried to hit her with it. This telephone was subsequently thrown into a c anal near Sim's Drive. However, the prosec ution proc ured a telephone at trial whic h Leslie Joseph identified as being similar to the one in Anjella Nagalingam's room - only the c olour was different. The ac c used admitted in c ourt that she had hit Anjella Nagalingam about four to five times with it; but she was frightened and trembling and c ould not remember more. The pathologist Dr. Teo testified that the eight lac eration wounds found on Anjella Nagalingam's sc alp at the autopsy were c onsistent with injuries c aused by a blunt objec t, suc h as the telephone, delivered with moderate to severe forc e. One of the eight lac erations also resulted in a frac ture of the skull. This partic ular injury was, in Dr. Teo's opinion, the one that c aused the subdural haemorrhage at the bac k of the skull. It was probably delivered with a severe forc e. In his opinion, death was c aused by this subdural haemorrhage. In addition to the injuries to the head, Anjella Nagalingam suffered frac tures to her left middle finger and right ring finger. These injuries were desc ribed as defensive injuries. The defenc e does not c hallenge the assertion that these injuries were c aused by the ac c used with the telephone set. Dr. Teo also found c ompression injuries in the oral c avity. He was of the view that these injuries were c onsistent with someone trying to suffoc ate the dec eased with the palm of a hand. He testified that the forc e used c ould have lasted "a few sec onds or a few minutes". The ac c used admitted under c ross-examination that she had used her palm to push against the fac e of the dec eased but denied that she tried to suffoc ate her. 

6\. The prosec ution's c ase was based on s 300(c ) of the Penal Code, Ch 224, namely that the c ulpable homic ide was "done with the intention of c ausing bodily injury and the bodily injury intended to be inflic ted was suffic ient in the ordinary c ourse of nature to c ause death". Dr. Teo ac c epted that, first, blunt forc e of moderate to severe strength may not nec essarily c ause frac tures; sec ondly, frac tures may not nec essarily result in subdural haemorrhage; thirdly, subdural haemorrhage may not nec essarily result in death. When asked what he understood by the term "injury suffic ient in the ordinary c ourse of nature to c ause death" he gave the following answer: 

 "If the subdural haemorrhage was left untreated it is potentially fatal in the ordinary c ourse of events. How soon it is fatal may range from minutes to hours and it depends to a large extent on the size and loc ation of the subdural haemorrhage; and whether vital c entres in the brain were also affec ted by the same forc e that c aused the subdural haemorrhage in this c ase, the injuries, that is the subdural haemorrhage, would have been [of ] suffic ient severity to c ause death in the ordinary c ourse of events". 


That is, of c ourse, the expert medic al evidenc e, and it must be blended with the legal requirements under s.299 and s.300 of the Penal Code. When a doc tor c ertifies that any given wound, whether treated or not, would be suffic ient to lead to death he is stating a medic al fac t, and although he or indeed anyone else, might c onc lude that whoever c auses that wound c auses the death, only the c ourt may determine whether that death was inflic ted with the requisite intention under ss 299 and 

300\. Otherwise, these solemn and onerous provisions will be reduc ed to the simple effec t that onc e medic al evidenc e attributes a death to the injury c aused by an ac c used, murder is, by that fac t alone, established. That is, in my view, not the purport of the homic ide and murder provisions in the Penal Code. 

7\. In every c ase c onc erning a c harge of murder it is most pertinent to start with the definition of c ulpable homic ide bec ause there is no offenc e of murder unless c ulpable homic ide is proved. That definition is set out in s 299 of the Penal Code in the following words: "Whoever c auses death by doing an ac t with an intention of c ausing death, or with an intention of c ausing suc h bodily injury as is likely to c ause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by suc h an ac t to c ause death, c ommits the offenc e of c ulpable homic ide." It was not the prosec ution c ase that the ac c used intended to c ause death. The prosec ution proc eeded on its c ase throughout the trial on the basis of s 300(c ). But there is a signific ant differenc e between the legal ingredients under s 300(c ) and s 299; that is, the differenc e between "c ausing an injury whic h is suffic ient in the ordinary c ourse to c ause death" and c ausing an injury whic h is likely to c ause death. 

8\. Whether a partic ular injury is likely to c ause death is a question of fac t whic h the c ourt will have to make with suc h assistanc e as it may get from the experts suc h as Dr. Teo the pathologist. Dr. Teo was not asked whether the injuries c aused were "likely to c ause death" but he has given some illuminating evidenc e whic h has greatly assisted me in my c onc lusion that the injuries c aused by the ac c used were not likely to c ause death. In the c ourse of the trial, I am satisfied that Anjella Nagalingam was struc k with about eight blows on the head with a plastic telephone set. The weight of the set was not given but handling the replic a myself it felt no heavier than one would expec t a plastic telephone set to weigh; and no expert is required to opine that anyone would think that a person was likely to be killed when struc k with it. Being seriously hurt, perhaps, but not killed. It will be appropriate at this point to rec all that the c ertified c ause of death was a subdural haemorrhage, as Dr. Teo testified. But more importantly, although there were eight lac erations on the skull of Anjella Nagalingam, Dr. Teo was able to foc us on one in partic ular, that resulted in a frac ture and whic h he believes c aused the subdural haemorrhage. Given this evidenc e and the use of the telephone as the instrument of death, I am not satisfied that the injury was suffic ient in the ordinary c ourse of nature to c ause death. But more importantly, before this aspec t is to be c onsidered, the prosec ution must satisfy the c ourt under s 299, as the prosec ution's stated c ase here, that the intention of the ac c used was to c ause an injury that was likely to c ause death. I need not restate what has been so c learly pronounc ed _in Virsa Singh v State of Punjab_ (1958) Sup Ct Report 1495 as well as the numerous oc c asions in our c ourts in c ases suc h as _Tan Chee Hwee v PP_ [1993] 2 SLR 657, from the Court of Appeal, as to what is required to be proved in a c ase under s 300(c ) of the Penal Code. 

9\. I am satisfied that the ac c used had no intention of killing the dec eased. The c hoic e of instrument largely indic ates this, but more so, the evidenc e shows that there were a number of kitc hen knives on a c ounter in the kitc hen nearby. Whatever might have happened in the bedroom of the dec eased, it is abundantly c lear that something happened whic h threw the ac c used into an unc ontrollable rage. Notwithstanding the number of eight blows delivered with the telephone set, whic h upon examination, felt lighter in my hands than a c opy of the Chambers Dic tionary, I am of the view that the ac c used did not intend the injury whic h resulted in the death of Anjella Nagalingam. She c learly had an intention to hurt Anjella Nagalingam with the telephone set, but is a different matter from an intention to c ause the injury whic h c aused death within the meaning of ss 299 and 300. The DPP Mr. Chan 


submitted that the motive of the ac c used was robbery, but this is a red herring c onsidering that the prosec ution c ase was not dependent on motive. Nonetheless, the evidenc e suggests very strongly that although the ac c used c learly misappropriated some of Anjella Nagalingam's personal effec ts inc luding jewellery, I ac c ept her explanation that she did so initially to get rid of inc riminating items whic h might have her blood stained prints. It is important not to overlook the fac t that no other item elsewhere (save a bottle of Calvin Klein perfume) was missing from the flat. In addition to nec klac e, and brac elets the dec eased had two rings on eac h hand (four rings in all). These not insubstantial jewellery were also untouc hed. If any intention to rob had been formed by the ac c used, I am satisfied that it was formed after the death of Anjella Nagalingam. 

10\. Weighing the evidenc e of Dr. Teo Eng Swee the pathologist, with the selec tion by the ac c used of a lightweight plastic telephone set as the weapon of c hoic e I form the view that the vital element under s 299 was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. In forming this view I had studied the written statements as well as the oral evidenc e of the ac c used, espec ially the aspec t c onc erning the fight with Anjella Nagalingam. While I respec t the able submission of the DPP, I gave the benefit of doubt to the ac c used on her testimony, without forgetting that Anjella Nagalingam's side of the story was not told. The law requires only that the ac c used raises a reasonable doubt in her defenc e. I ac c ept that in a traumatic event some portions will appear in abjec t c larity and indelible from the mind of the partic ipants while other portions will vanish without trac e or rec all. I therefore do not exac t upon the ac c used the onus of proving or rec alling the entire episode c omprehensively, blow by blow. Evidenc e of this nature must not be evaluated too sc ientific ally or tec hnic ally; but simply by being aware of the wide range of human reac tion under extraordinary c irc umstanc es. 

11\. The two taxi drivers c alled to rebut the evidenc e of the ac c used but suc c eeded only in rebutting eac h other. Ganesan Arunasalam testified that on the oc c asion when he was with the other taxi driver Sahul Hameed and the ac c used, he and Hameed spoke in Malay so that the ac c used would not know what they were disc ussing. When Hameed took the stand he said that they spoke only in Tamil and was adamant that not onc e did they speak in Malay. On the other hand, Hameed denied any knowledge that Ganesan was oc c upying a flat at Kempas Road only to be promptly c ontradic ted by Ganesan. I find neither witnesses reliable, and in partic ular, the fac etious and flippant manner that punc tuated his testimony. 

12\. Mr. Rajarh raised various defenc es inc luding self-defenc e, provoc ation, exc eeding private defenc e, and sudden fight. Had any of these defenc es suc c eeded the c harge ought to be reduc ed to c ulpable homic ide not amounting to murder. Henc e, in view of my finding and judgment I need not review the law on these defenc es, but so far as the fac ts that may be relevant to these defenc es, I will set out my findings as follows. So far as the oral testimonies of the c ruc ial witnesses of fac t are c onc erned, and in this c ase, there was only the ac c used, I find her to be a forthright witness. Some parts of her evidenc e under c ross-examination were patc hy, but in this c ase, I am of the view that they were not intentional or affec t in any way the substanc e of her integrity. She was not well educ ated and spoke through an interpreter, rec alling an event that left her trembling and in fear. In these c irc umstanc es, her testimony was remarkable for its c onsistenc y, not only in c ourt, but also against her polic e statements. Finally, it will be seen from the photographs that there were signs of a struggle if not a fight in the dec eased's bedroom. 

13\. For the above reasons, I found the ac c used not guilty of murder, but I am satisfied that the prosec ution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the ac c used had c ommitted the offenc e under s 322 of the Penal Code, namely c ausing grievous hurt. After taking into ac c ount the fac t that she was genuinely remorseful, having asked her c ounsel to plead forgiveness from the family of Anjella Nagalingam whatever the outc ome of the trial, the fac t that she had no previous antec edents, and that the c rime was c ommitted without premeditation; and weighing all that against the fatal 


c onsequenc es of her ac t, I sentenc ed her to four and a half years' imprisonment with effec t from 14 Dec ember 2001.
