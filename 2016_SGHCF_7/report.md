**Valerie Thean JC:** 

**Introduction** 

1       These grounds of dec ision disc uss the appropriate anc illary financ ial provisions to be made for a home-maker wife in a long marriage. 

**Facts** 

2       The plaintiff (“the Wife”), and the defendant (“the Husband”), were married almost forty years ago on 21 November 1978. The Wife is 56 and the Husband is 60 years old. The parties have three c hildren, all of whom have attained the age of majority. The c hildren are 37, 34 and 28 years old respec tively. 

3       The Wife bec ame a homemaker shortly after parties married. The Husband, who is a direc tor in a listed c ompany (“the Company”), was the main fee-earner throughout the marriage. First an odd job labourer, he later started the Company with a few business partners. In time, the Company bec ame public ly listed. His assets are essentially derived from the suc c ess of the Company. Unfortunately, the fortunes of the Company have been in dec line sinc e 2012. 

4       On 27 Marc h 2013, the Wife c ommenc ed divorc e proc eedings against the Husband premised upon his behaviour. The divorc e was unc ontested. Interim Judgment was granted on 14 May 2013. The issues before me in the anc illaries on 22 February were as follows: (1) division of the matrimonial assets; (2) maintenanc e for the Wife; and (3) c osts (together, “the issues”). 

5       After hearing the parties, I gave oral judgment in relation to the anc illary matters on 2 Marc h 

2016\. In brief, I ordered an equal division of the matrimonial assets valued at $5,200,670 and, in 


keeping with the need for a c lean break, that a lump sum maintenanc e of $171,517 be paid to the Wife by the Husband. The parties have appealed, and I now set out the reasons for my dec ision in relation to the issues. 

**Division of assets** 

**_Delineation of pool of matrimonial assets_** 

6       The asset pool was determined from the joint table of assets prepared by c ounsel for the Husband and the Wife. The parties _mutually agreed_ on the date the assets should be valued for the purposes of the anc illaries. The issue of the relevant operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets therefore did not arise for c onsideration. The asset pool is set out in Table 1 below. 

 Table 1: Asset Pool [note: 1] 

7       The values assigned to all but one item in Table 1 were undisputed. The parties differed on the valuation of the Matrimonial Home, _viz_ , a three-storey terrac e house in Singapore (see S/No. 1 of Table 1) (“the Matrimonial Home”). The Husband submitted that the “estimated value” of the 


Matrimonial Home was $2,800,000; [note: 2] however, no evidenc e was adduc ed in support of this valuation. The Wife arranged for a valuation of the Matrimonial Home and provided evidenc e that the 

market value of the Matrimonial Home was $2,900,000. [note: 3] In the premises, I used the value pinned on the Matrimonial Home by the Wife, as it was supported by evidenc e that was not, in any sense, undermined by the Husband during the proc eedings. I highlight for c ompleteness that the Husband was able to provide the latest doc uments for one of the Wife’s insuranc e polic ies (see S/No. 8 of Table 1), _viz_ , AIA LXXXXXX640. In the hearing on 22 February 2016, c ounsel for the Wife, Mr Irving Choh (“Mr Choh”), agreed that the value in the doc ument produc ed by the Husband should be used in the c omputation of the Wife’s insuranc e polic ies. This figure was used in the c omputation of the value of the Wife’s insuranc e polic ies. 

_Disputed assets_ 

8       There were three c ategories of disputed assets. They were as follows: 

 (a) proc eeds from the surrender of two of the Wife’s insuranc e polic ies; 

 (b) proc eeds from the sale of a jointly-owned apartment; and 

 (c ) sums withdrawn by the Wife from the joint ac c ount and put by the Wife into a joint ac c ount with their daughter (“the Daughter”) and used thereafter by the Daughter to purc hase property. 

 (together, “the Disputed Assets”). 

9       After hearing parties, I dec ided not to return any of these sums into the pool, for the reasons that follow. 

_(a) Proceeds from surrender of the Wife’s two insurance policies_ 

10     The Wife surrendered two insuranc e polic ies for a total value of about $78,253. These were: (1) AIA UXXXXXX265 (“the AIA Polic y”), whic h was surrendered on 20 June 2007 at a surrender value of $43,848.20; and (2) Great Eastern XXXXXX506 (“the GE Polic y”), whic h was surrendered on 19 July 2010, at a surrender value of $34,404.50. The parties disputed how these assets should be 

ac c ounted for. [note: 4] 

11     The Wife c ontended that the AIA Polic y was surrendered by the Husband and that the 

proc eeds were taken by him on surrender. [note: 5] The Wife adduc ed no evidenc e to support her position. In fac t, during the hearing on 22 February 2016, Mr Choh ac knowledged that the Wife had not stated how the proc eeds were taken by the Husband despite the fac t that she was both the owner and benefic iary of the AIA Polic y. The Husband’s c ase was that the Wife took the proc eeds from the AIA Polic y bec ause the proc eeds would have been paid to her when the AIA Polic y was surrendered. Given the lac k of evidenc e adduc ed by the Wife to support her position, I agree with the Husband. 

12     There was the sec ond issue of the proc eeds in relation to the GE Polic y. The Wife c ontended that she surrendered the GE Polic y to maintain herself, bec ause _after she commenced divorce proceedings_ , the Husband stopped paying the premiums in relation to those polic ies. She said that the proc eeds from surrendering the GE Polic y were used to supplement the $2,000 monthly expenses that the Husband used to pay her before she c ommenc ed the divorc e proc eedings. Counsel for the 


Husband, Ms Lim Poh Choo (“Ms Lim”), pointed out that the Husband had not stopped paying maintenanc e to the Wife at the material time when the GE Polic y was surrendered. He only stopped paying maintenanc e in July 2015 when the Wife left the Matrimonial Home with the Daughter. In fac t, the Husband only c anc elled the supplementary c redit c ard and the automatic teller mac hine (“ATM”) c ard for the parties’ joint ac c ount with POSB Bank at the end of 2012. In the fac e of these fac ts, Mr Choh c onc eded that no explanation had been adduc ed by the Wife as regards the proc eeds in relation to the GE Polic y. 

_(b) Proceeds from the sale of a jointly-owned apartment_ 

13     The parties at one time jointly owned an apartment at the Interlac e at 208 Depot Road (“the Interlac e Apartment”), whic h was purc hased in August 2009. The Husband sold the Interlac e Apartment in January 2013. The sale pric e was $1,129,800. As noted from the c ompletion ac c ounts prepared by the Husband’s solic itors in relation to the sale transac tion, the Husband rec eived $331,058 (“the Sale Proc eeds”) after, _inter alia_ , redeeming the mortgage on the Interlac e Apartment. [note: 6] The proc eeds were initially deposited in the parties’ OCBC joint ac c ount (“the EasiSave 

Ac c ount”) in Marc h 2013. 

14     In July 2013, slightly over three months after divorc e proc eedings were c ommenc ed by the Wife, the balanc e in the EasiSave Ac c ount had dwindled to about $1,676. It was unc lear where the Sale Proc eeds went to, and the Wife held the Husband ac c ountable. The Husband, on his part, pointed out that the Wife had the same ac c ess to the EasiSave Ac c ount that he did. At the same time, the Wife pointed out that the Husband had not assisted with disc overy in this regard. He failed to c omply fully with a c ourt order to disc lose c omplete sets of his ac c ount statements between July 

2011 and July 2014. [note: 7] The thrust of her submission was that there had been no full and frank disc losure by the Husband as regards the Sale Proc eeds. The Husband on the other hand c ontended that he used the Sale Proc eeds to, _inter alia_ , maintain the family. He itemised the use of the Sale 

Proc eeds as follows: [note: 8] 

 (a) $43,000 to buy a c ar for his son; 

 (b) about $20,000 to help his son buy a flat; 

 (c ) $18,000 to partially repay a c ar loan; 

 (d) $63,000 as a loan to an errant friend that had not been repaid; 

 (e) $60,000 in shares, whic h were purc hased in another friend’s name and have drastic ally plunged in value; 

 (f) maintenanc e and expenses of the household; and 

 (g) agent’s c ommission, legal fees and misc ellaneous c harges. 

15     Based on the Husband’s c heque rec ord, only item (c ) was disbursed in 2013. Items (a) and (b) were disbursed between February and Marc h 2014, whic h would be after the monies in the EasiSave 

Ac c ount had been spent. [note: 9] As regards the alleged bad loan and investment (items (d)–(e) above), the Husband did not adduc e evidenc e to support those assertions. Separately, he mentioned 

paying $20,000 for his elder son’s renovation loan [note: 10] and expending $200,000 on a failed 

business venture with his younger son. [note: 11] 


_(c) The Wife’s joint account with the Daughter_ 

16     In the c ourse of disc overy, the Wife revealed a joint ac c ount with the Daughter with POSB 

Bank (“the POSB Ac c ount”), whic h the Husband hitherto had no knowledge of. [note: 12] It was evident from the Wife’s passbook that about $139,000 (“the Withdrawn Sum”) had been withdrawn by the Daughter in two tranc hes of about $32,000 and $107,000 in early Marc h 2013, slightly before the 

divorc e proc eedings were c ommenc ed by the Wife. [note: 13] About $1,276 remained in the POSB Ac c ount after the said withdrawals and as at the date of the anc illaries. The Wife c ontended that the monies in the POSB Ac c ount belonged to herself and the Daughter. The Wife stated that the monies in the POSB Ac c ount c omprised allowanc es given to her by her c hildren, whic h varied from $300 to 

$500. [note: 14] It was not disputed that the monies were withdrawn to financ e the Daughter’s flat, where the Wife now lives together with the Daughter’s family. 

17     The Husband submitted that the Withdrawn Sum should be added to the matrimonial pool, as it was siphoned from the matrimonial pool. In this regard, he argues that the sums in the POSB Ac c ount (inc luding the Withdrawn Sum) were ac c umulated either from his monies or from the parties’ joint bank 

ac c ount. [note: 15] 

18     The Daughter filed an affidavit and averred that the sums in the POSB Ac c ount, while held 

jointly, were her own savings from “working for several years”. [note: 16] The Husband c ontended that the Withdrawn Sum c ould not belong to the Daughter, as she had no means to save that muc h 

money. [note: 17] Therefore, the affidavit filed by the Daughter “c ontain[ed] half-truths or [were] not 

true at all”. [note: 18] Ac c ording to the Husband, the Daughter had all along worked as “[a 

telec ommunic ations] [o]perator, a c ar agent and in [the Company] for [six to seven] years”. [note: 19] 

19     I noted that the Daughter was not a high earner – her last drawn salary at the Company was $1,500 a month; by her own admission she c ould not pay for her c ar instalments of $700 a month, and had not been earning enough to pay inc ome tax. Having c onsidered the evidenc e, I was of the view that _some proportion_ of the Withdrawn Sum must have c ome from the Wife. 

20     Mr Choh mounted an alternative argument to address the legal effec ts that, in his view, should flow from a finding that the Wife must have deposited monies into the POSB Ac c ount from the parties’ joint ac c ount. He submitted that the presumption of advanc ement applied to suc h monies deposited into the POSB Ac c ount by the Wife, suc h that the monies belonged to her. His argument assumed that the Wife would be thus free to c hannel the money onward to the Daughter. 

21     Mr Choh relied on _In re Eykyn’s Trusts_ (1877) 6 ChD 115 (“ _In re Eykyn’s Trusts_ ”). The c ourt there had to, _inter alia_ , dec ide whether the presumption of advanc ement operated in relation to c ertain investments transferred by the husband to the wife. The c ourt held ( _per_ Malins VC) that the investments were advanc ements for benefit of the wife. Malins VC made c lear (at 118) that the presumption only applied _where the property is held in the sole name of the wife_ , as follows: 

 The law of this Court is perfec tly settled that when a husband transfers money or other property into the name of his wife only , then the presumption is, that it is intended as a gift or advancement to the wife absolutely at once , subjec t to suc h marital c ontrol as he may exerc ise. And if a husband invests money, stock, or otherwise, in the names of himself and his wife, then also it is an advancement for the benefit of the wife absolutely if she survives her husband , but if he survives her, then it reverts to him as joint tenant with his wife. 


 [emphasis added]. 

22     As noted in the dec ision of the House of Lords _Pettitt v Pettitt_ [1970] AC 777 (“ _Pettitt v Pettitt_ ”) (at 815) _per_ Lord Upjohn, when the property is held jointly and not in the sole name of one party, “the presumption is in effec t no more than a joint benefic ial tenanc y”. Lord Upjohn summarised suc c inc tly the legal position as follows (at 815): 

 So that, in the absenc e of all evidenc e, if a husband puts property into his wife's name he intends it to be a gift to her, but if he puts it into joint names, then (in the absenc e of all other evidenc e) the presumption is the same as a joint benefic ial tenanc y. ... 

23     I note also the c ase of _In re Young_ (1885) 28 ChD 705 (“ _In re Young_ ”). In that c ase, the spouses, who died within five days of one another, had opened a joint ac c ount mainly c ontributed to by the wife. The husband drew out monies from the ac c ount to make investments for himself. It was held (at 708) _per_ Pearson J that the joint ac c ount belonged benefic ially to the spouses jointly and so passed to the survivor by survivorship but that the investments purc hased by the husband in his own name belonged to his estate. 

24     The dec ision in _In re Young_ may be explained by referenc e to _In re Bishop, decd_ [1965] Ch 450 (“ _In re Bishop_ ”) (endorsed along with _In re Young_ in _Pettitt v Pettitt_ , at 815). The husband in that c ase drew on the joint ac c ount with the wife to make investments in his own name and in the wife’s own name. It was held (at 456) _per_ Stamp J that _as long as it can be treated that the spouse drawing out money from the account has the authority of the other_ , an asset purc hased by that party in his or her own name belongs to him. In my view, _In re Bishop_ makes a very important point. The question of whether the presumption of advanc ement applies in relation to monies drawn out from a joint ac c ount depends on whether it c an be asc ertained if the spouse drawing out money had the authority of the other. 

25     This approac h is in keeping with the Court of Appeal’s guidanc e in _Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye_ [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“ _Lau Siew Kim_ ”). In that c ase, the Court of Appeal held (at [56]) that a presumption of advanc ement must _first_ be premised on a gift that, outside of the relationship, would result in the operation of the presumption of a resulting trust. The issue of a resulting trust c ould only arise if the Wife had the authority to withdraw the Withdrawn Sums from the joint ac c ount in order to c reate the sec ond ac c ount. Sinc e, in this c ase, the Husband was totally unaware of the sec ond ac c ount, there c ould be no question of authority having been given. 

26     On the fac ts, it was likely, on balanc e, that the Wife would not have had the authority to withdraw the Withdrawn Sum from the matrimonial assets, whic h she did just three weeks before she c ommenc ed the divorc e proc eedings. Therefore, the presumption of advanc ement did not apply. The Withdrawn Sum was not hers to deal with as she pleased. The Court c ould put this sum bac k into the matrimonial pool for division. 

27     The Husband made an argument in his affidavit and his Fac t and Position Sheet that he wished to go one step further to assert an interest in the Daughter’s flat. I did not think this argument had any merit. First, the Daughter was not party to the divorc e proc eedings. There were no pleadings and no evidenc e led to trac e the amounts given by the Wife (even if we assume for one moment that these amounts c ame _solely_ from the joint ac c ount held by the Husband and Wife) to the Daughter’s flat. The Husband would have to ventilate these matters in separate c ivil proc eedings. Sec ond, as a matter of law, there will be serious diffic ulties in employing the c ommon law trac ing rules to trac e monies into the Wife’s joint bank ac c ount with the Daughter, as there would have been a mixture of funds (see _Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson_ [1989] 3 WLR 1367 at 1382 _per_ Millett J (as he then was) 


affirmed on appeal in _Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson_ [1991] 1 Ch 547). I note also that the presumption of advanc ement would apply in respec t of the sum of money passing from the Wife to the Daughter; the Wife would have intended to make a gift to the Daughter who was setting up a new home. The short point is that _the issue of the Wife taking money without authority out of the matrimonial assets_ c ould not c reate a c laim for the Husband _on the Daughter’s property_. The Husband’s 

tangential averment that he should be entitled to a share in the Daughter’s flat was misplac ed. [note: 20] Given my dec ision that the Withdrawn Sum was taken without authority and thus c ould be 

returned to the matrimonial pool for division and observations on why the Husband’s arguments were unsustainable, the Husband has no basis for a separate c laim on the Daughter’s property. 

28     In the above c ontext, I was mindful that the presumption of advanc ement traditionally applies between father and c hild. However, I note the Court of Appeal’s guidanc e in _Lau Siew Kim_ (at [67]) that the c ategories where the presumption of advanc ement applies are not treated as c losed. Indeed, in _Lee Tso Fong v Kwok Wai Sun_ [2008] HKCFI 385, the High Court of Hong Kong held (at [17]) that the presumption of advanc ement applied equally between mother and c hild as it did between father and c hild. I note also that the fac t that the c hild is an adult would not be fatal to the _prima facie_ operation of the presumption of advanc ement. In this regard, the Court of Appeal held in _Low Gim Siah and others v Low Geok Khim and another_ [2007] 1 SLR(R) 795 (at [46]) that the presumption of advanc ement was _prima facie_ applic able as between a father and an adult son in relation to c ertain bank ac c ounts. 

_Conclusion on the Disputed Assets_ 

29     To summarise, there were allegations on both sides that money ought to be returned to the pool bec ause of dissipation of assets by the other. 

30     As noted, I found that the Wife had retained, without satisfac tory explanation, the proc eeds whic h she obtained on surrendering the AIA Polic y and the GE Polic y. 

31     It was also c lear that some part of the monies in the POSB Ac c ount that were then applied by the Daughter to purc hase the flat must have c ome from money within the matrimonial pool. In the premises, at the very least, part of the Withdrawn Sum would have formed part of the matrimonial pool. 

32     At the same time, on the Husband’s part, I noted that Sale Proc eeds in relation to the Interlac e Apartment were deposited into the EasiSave Ac c ount in Marc h 2013; however, the bulk was withdrawn by July 2013. This was a joint ac c ount to whic h both parties had ac c ess, and the proc eeds were not stric tly ac c ounted for. Instead, the Husband’s c ase appeared to be that over the c ourse of time, he has spent at least the same amount of money on failed ventures (one of whic h involved $200,000 in a business with his younger son) and c ar, insuranc e, assistanc e with a home purc hase and other expenses for the three c hildren. 

33     The Husband and Wife both had merit in their respec tive c ontentions about money eac h had taken. One option would be to take the final sum outstanding after rec onc iling the three unexplained sets of assets, and make the Husband liable for another $113,805 within the pool. There were two reasons why I did not do so. First, from the affidavits, it seemed that the Husband did not keep good ac c ounts throughout the marriage. He was not well educ ated and his expertise was in c onstruc tion. Viewing the parties’ ac c ounts of their lives together, the Husband’s c ontention that he did not have a full ledger of his failed ventures was not a surprising one. For example, this was also the c ase _vis-àvis_ his household money or money given to the Wife, who had free ac c ess to the safe deposit box at home and on one oc c asion in 2003 appears to have taken $180,000. He had not queried the insuranc e 


proc eeds in 2007 or 2010, and was not even aware when the Wife took out the Withdrawn Sum from their joint ac c ount for the Daughter’s benefit. A sec ond important c onsideration was that his c ontention that his new investments had failed was also not surprising. It appeared, on balanc e, that the Husband was not a sharp businessman or investor. He had worked his way up the Company, and the family wealth was ac c umulated through his years there. The Company is a public ly listed one and the c hange in management and falling share pric e have been public ly doc umented. In line with the Company’s ailing health, he had been pushed out of the management of the Company, henc e his attempts to build up new businesses, whic h had unfortunately failed. 

34     I ac c epted the Husband’s evidenc e that he was not in possession of any other hidden sums. The money has been spent in his attempts to build a new life in the light of his planned departure from the Company. _The question which arises is whether it should be returned_. In my judgment, it would not be equitable to do so on the fac ts of this c ase. Between the parties, throughout the time they were married, there seemed little expec tation that they would eac h hold the other to prec ise line items and balanc e sheets. In the good years, large c ash sums were kept at home. The Wife had full ac c ess to the Husband’s safe deposit box, from whic h she had taken various sums, and in addition he gave her substantial sums in c ash from time to time. The parties also owned a joint ac c ount from whic h the Wife had free ac c ess for household use through the issuing of c heques (and an ATM c ard for many years). The Husband c ontended that the Wife had a history of overspending, whic h required him to sell Interlac e. Viewing all the fac ts of this c ase in their totality, with partic ular referenc e to how parties c onduc ted their joint lives and dealt with their joint ac c ounts, I c onc luded that no adverse inferenc e need be drawn nor any notional sum be added bac k into the pool. It was just and equitable to use the known and undisputed asset pool remaining at the end of their marriage (see Table 1) for the purposes of division. 

35     In this c ontext, I draw a distinc tion between c ases where the c ourt _excludes a known asset_ from the pool, and c ases where the c ourt is asked to _add a sum_ to the pool. In the first c ategory, there exists _an asset_ amenable to division. For this c ategory, the Court of Appeal has given guidanc e that generally, assets ought not to be exc luded from the pool although one party may have a larger or smaller share in the division, depending upon the equities of the situation (see _Tan Hwee Lee v Tan Cheng Guan and another appeal and another matter_ [2012] 4 SLR 785 (“ _Tan Hwee Lee_ ”), at [41]). In the sec ond c ategory, where there is no spec ific asset, the c ourt may be asked to _add_ a sum to the pool. Again, two different sc enarios arise here. One c ould be c irc umstanc es where an adverse inferenc e has been drawn and the c ourt is asked to infer that the sum exists and has been squirrelled away. In suc h a c ase, it follows that _the asset exists_ , and thus the Court of Appeal’s guidanc e must still apply. Where the money has been _spent_ , on the other hand, the role of the Court is to dec ide whether the party who has spent the money _ought to account for it_. In effec t, the Court is penalising that party, as the party thus held ac c ountable would do so _out of his share of the assets_. Where there has been c lear misc onduc t, this would be reasonable. In the present c ase, however, I did not think it equitable to take the Husband to task for the extra notional sum, given the c ontext of their joint lives and all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase. 

**_Division of the pool_** 

36     The Court of Appeal set out the struc tured approac h in _ANJ v ANK_ [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“ _ANJ v ANK_ ”) (at [22]–[26]) to work out a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets. This approac h, may be summarised, with referenc e to _Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast_ [2015] SGCA 52 at [17] and _ANJ v ANK_ at [28], as follows: 

 (a) express as a ratio the parties’ direc t c ontributions relative to eac h other, having regard to the amount of financ ial c ontribution eac h party made towards the ac quisition or improvement of 


 the matrimonial assets; 

 (b) express as a sec ond ratio the parties’ indirec t c ontributions relative to eac h other, having regard to both financ ial and non-financ ial c ontributions; and 

 (c ) derive the parties’ overall c ontributions relative to eac h other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as “the average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the c irc umstanc es of eac h c ase, the direc t and indirec t c ontributions may not be ac c orded equal weight, and one of the two ratios may be ac c orded more signific anc e than the other. Adjustments c ould also be made in respec t of other relevant fac tors under s 112 or 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”). 

I shall hereinafter refer points (a)–(c ) above as “Step 1” to “Step 3”. 

_Step 1: Direct contribution ratio_ 

37     The Husband c omputed the Wife’s c ontribution as 8.8% and his at 91.2%. In this regard, the Husband took into ac c ount the following amounts c ontributed by the Wife to the Matrimonial Home: 

$17,000 from her Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) and $50,000 in c ash. [note: 21] 

38     The Wife initially c omputed her c ontribution as 24.2%. Two c omponents were used to derive this perc entage. First, the Wife c onsidered her c ontribution to the Matrimonial Home to stand at 19.6% by reason of the following spec ific c ontributions: $17,000 from her CPF and $100,000 in c ash. Sec ond, she c onsidered the assets in her name, whic h exc eed $700,000 (see Table 1), to also form 

her c ontributions to the pool. [note: 22] 

39     Mr Choh relied, in parts of his submissions, on the presumption of advanc ement for sums of money passing from the Husband to the Wife. In his analysis, the monies given by the Husband to the Wife absolutely would form gifts. The Wife took as her financ ial c ontribution the money saved from sums given to her. The Husband, on the other hand, c ontended that most – if not all – of those amounts originated from money he had provided to the Wife. The nub of the issue was how the c ontributions as regards inter-spousal gifts should be _allocated_ in relation to the division of matrimonial assets. 

40     A starting point for c onsidering this argument would be the Court of Appeal’s guidanc e in _Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye_ [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520 (“ _Lock Yeng Fun_ ”) (at [40]) that the law treats the matrimonial assets as c ommunity property and to that extent is _agnostic as to ownership_ in dec iding whether the _asset is liable to be divided_ under s 112 of the Charter. 

41     Further, the Court of Appeal in _Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee and another appeal and another matter_ [2012] 4 SLR 405 (“ _Wan Lai Cheng_ ”) subsequently drew a distinc tion between interspousal gifts and gifts that emanate from a third party. It noted (at [40]) that a “pure” inter-spousal gift should be inc luded in the matrimonial pool and should not be denied rec ognition, as it involved the initial effort expended by the donor spouse in the original ac quisition of the gift. Thus, (at [41]) “pure” inter-spousal gifts were not “gifts” for the purpose of s 112(10) of the Charter, as it was, by its very nature, always ac quired by one spouse during a marriage, and thus fell to be divided as a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)( _b_ ) of the Charter, whic h enc ompasses assets whic h are ac quired by one party during the marriage or by both parties during the marriage. 

42     The Court of Appeal re-affirmed its position in _Wan Lai Cheng_ in _Tan Hwee Lee_ and held (at [30]) that “pure” inter-spousal gifts may be divided at the end of the marriage. 


43     It follows from these authorities that gifts of money that the Husband gave to the Wife that remained in her ac c ounts ought to be attributed as the Husband’s direc t c ontribution in the Step 1 analysis. A distinc tion ought to be drawn, nonetheless, between, first, the assets c urrently in the Wife’s name that the Husband had paid for; and sec ond, money given to her whic h she had c hannelled into the Matrimonial Home. For the former, it followed from the approac h in _Wan Lai Cheng_ and _Tan Hwee Lee_ that these “pure” inter-spousal gifts _prima facie_ embodied the Husband’s financ ial c ontribution, as he paid for the insuranc e polic ies and arranged for her shares and CPF. In this regard, it was not disputed that the assets in the Wife’s sole name (see Table 1 above) were ac quired by the Husband. 

44     The monies from the Wife in relation to the purc hase of the Matrimonial Home, however, stood on a different footing. When these monies were given by the Husband to the Wife absolutely for her c onsumption, the money had been at the Wife’s disposal. She c ould have spent it on the household or herself, but she c hose instead to save it in order to alleviate the Husband’s financ ial burden of purc hasing the Matrimonial Home. It c ould be said that by so doing she c onverted the gift into a direc t financ ial c ontribution to the Matrimonial Home. This approac h is c onsonant with that of the Court of Appeal in _Lock Yeng Fun_. 

45     In _Lock Yeng Fun_ , the parties were married for almost 30 years with two c hildren. The wife was predominantly a home-maker, while the husband was a suc c essful banking exec utive. In the High Court, the wife was awarded a 40% share of the assets. On appeal, the Court of Appeal found (at [20]) that apart from her c aring for the household, the wife had managed to amass a sizable sum of c lose to $500,000 from her investments (albeit from the monies given to her by the husband for household and misc ellaneous expenses). The Court of Appeal, in revising the wife’s share of the assets to 50%, stated that “[the wife] must be given due c redit for this _direct financial contribution_ in the division of matrimonial assets” (at [41]) [emphasis added]. The Court of Appeal here was referring to the investment gains amassed by the wife. In my judgment, I found that there was merit to the Wife’s argument that the monies she applied to the Matrimonial Home should be rec ognised as her c ontributions to the Matrimonial Home. 

46     As regards the Wife’s direc t c ontributions under Step 1, I was left with two figures in parties’ 

submissions: 19.6% suggested by the Wife and 8.8% by the Husband [note: 23]. Both parties were unable to argue with c redible evidenc e how muc h c ash the Wife c ontributed to the Matrimonial Home (whic h was essentially the only asset she c ontributed to in the Asset Pool). On a “ _rough and ready approximation_ ” (see _ANJ v ANK_ (at [17])) on the exerc ise of disc retion in relation to Step 1, I set the direc t c ontribution ratio for the pool at the mid-mark: 14:86 in favour of the Husband. 

_Step 2: Indirect contribution ratio_ 

47     This was a very long marriage that had lasted 35 years up to the time of the Interim Judgment. The Wife’s submissions foc used on how she devoted herself c ompletely to the management of the family and three c hildren, while the Husband worked extremely long hours. The Husband had done well for himself, progressing from an odd-job labourer to a businessman of not insubstantial means. The Wife submitted that their division of dominion – the Husband’s in the c orporate sphere and hers in the domestic – allowed the Husband to foc us on his c areer. The Wife thus argued that rec ognition had to be given to her indirec t c ontributions. The Wife proposed a ratio of 25:75 in her favour in relation to 

Step 2. [note: 24] 

48     The Husband ac c epted that the Wife made indirec t c ontributions to the marriage. In some part 

of his submissions, he ac c epted that this might even amount to 70%. [note: 25] He then however 


dec ided to spec tac ularly dilute this figure to a Step 2 ratio of effec tively 35:65 in his favour by assigning 100% of indirec t non-financ ial c ontributions to himself. He also pointed out that the Wife had the assistanc e of a maid sinc e 1997 to do household c hores and argued that this, in addition to various gifts he made to, _inter alia_ , his sons, should be taken into ac c ount in reduc ing the Wife’s c ontribution ratio in Step 2. I noted that while the Wife agreed that the parties had a maid, her 

evidenc e was that the maid was only engaged in 2003 and not in 1997. [note: 26] I pause to note that based on the Husband’s purported applic ation of _ANJ v ANK_ , he proposed the Wife rec eive 26% of the matrimonial assets in this very long marriage. 

49     In my judgment, it would not be c onsonant with _ANJ v ANK_ to c alc ulate an indirec t financ ial ratio separate from an indirec t non-financ ial ratio as suggested by c ounsel for the Husband. While the c ourt has to _have regard_ to _both_ indirec t financ ial c ontributions and non-financ ial c ontributions in Step 2, the approac h proposed in _ANJ v ANK_ should not be reduc ed into a c ategoric al and sc hematic addition of the parties’ indirec t financ ial c ontributions and non-financ ial c ontributions and pitting them against eac h other. The Step 1 ratio analyses the direc t c ontribution to the assets, the Step 2 ratio analyses, _in the round_ , all the other kinds of c ontribution nec essary to building up the family. Where the husband has c ontributed financ ially to the expenses of the home, it should be taken into ac c ount; but _not in a manner that dilutes the non-income earner’s substantial intangible contribution to the family_. A holistic assessment must be made. 

50     Here, the Wife played a vital part in running the household and c aring for the c hildren. At the beginning of the marriage she also c ontributed her savings from prior to the marriage when she worked part time as a c arpenter’s help while studying. By the Husband’s own admission, he worked from dawn to dusk and the home was left entirely to the Wife. Even taking the Husband’s c ase that the maid was appointed in 1997 and not 2003 as c laimed by the Wife, the Wife managed without a maid for about 20 years. Additionally, even with the maid, the Wife would have to give instruc tions and c o-ordinate the household. In this regard, the Court of Appeal has held on numerous oc c asions that ensuring the smooth running of the household by training, managing and supervising the exec ution of duties assigned to maids is at least as essential and important as the direc t performanc e of the c hores itself (see _Tan Hwee Lee_ at [89]; _Pang Rosaline v Chan Kong Chin_ [2009] 4 SLR(R) 935 at [20]). The Wife also highlighted that she managed the household throughout the marriage while 

simultaneously c oming to terms with the Husband’s various affairs he had sinc e 1985. [note: 27] 

51     No analytic al tool c an fully c apture the non-financ ial or indirec t financ ial c ontributions of the parties. The diverse fac tual c irc umstanc es that c hange over the c ourse of a marriage would affec t these indirec t c ontributions. These c ontributions are therefore to be asc ertained as “a matter of impression and judgment” (see _ANJ v ANK_ (at [24])). In light of the parties’ very long marriage and c lear alloc ation of roles in the marriage that the Wife was assigned very substantially the task of managing the household. In the premises, I ac c epted the Wife’s submission that the ratio in relation to Step 2 should be 25:75 as between the Husband and herself. 

_Step 3: Adjustment of the average ratio_ 

52     I derived the average ratio from Step 1 and Step 2 before c onsidering the exerc ise of my disc retion under Step 3. For c onvenienc e, I have set out the c omputation in Table 2 below. 


53     As seen from Table 2, the average ratio was 44.5%. In _ANJ v ANK_ (at [27]), the Court of Appeal highlighted as non-exhaustive fac tors, three c onsiderations that would affec t the weightage of the ratios: the length of the marriage, the size of the assets and its c onstituents, and the extent and nature of indirec t c ontributions. 

54     Of partic ular relevanc e to this c ase was the Court of Appeal’s observation in that passage that indirec t c ontributions, in general, tended to feature more prominently in long marriages. In my judgment, the Step 2 ratio had to be awarded 60% weight in this c ase. My c omputation of the Step 3 adjusted ratio is set out in Table 3 below. 

55     In relation to Step 3, I dec ided that a “just and equitable” division in the present c ase would be an equal division. In the present c ase, the Husband’s financ ial c ontributions and the Wife’s nonfinanc ial c ontributions were made c onsistently, in an unstinting manner and over a **_very long_** period of time; therefore, an equal division was appropriate in keeping with the parties’ understanding that eac h will take sole c harge respec tively of the financ ial and non-financ ial aspec ts of running the entire family unit. 

_Observations on the way the case was argued and contingent analysis_ 

56     Ms Lim stated in her written submissions that the ratio alloc ated to the Wife under Step 1 should be 8.8%. As noted, I fixed the ratio at middle mark between the figures proposed by the Husband (8.8%) and Wife (19.6%) in relation to Step 1 at 14%. It is noteworthy that Ms Lim’s analysis of the Step 1 ratio appears to not take into ac c ount the entire Asset Pool. It is unc lear why this was the c ase. On the one hand, it c ould be an ac knowledgement by the Husband that a 


startlingly low figure c annot be asc ribed to the Wife’s direc t c ontributions, given that she did c ontribute to the Matrimonial Home and her c ommitment to alleviate the Husband’s financ ial burden. To that extent, the Husband might be attempting to put before the c ourt a palatable division via the applic ation of _ANJ v ANK_. Of c ourse, this c ould also be an omission on c ounsel for the Husband’s part. Fortunately, the outc ome of the division _in this case_ does not depend on these c ontingenc ies; the streams c onverge on either analysis. Let me elaborate with a c ontingent analysis. 

57     Taking instead the 14% as the Wife’s c ontributions to the Matrimonial Home, the Wife’s direc t c ontribution figure to the Asset Pool would be about 8%. Under that sc enario, the Step 1 ratio would then have been 8:92 as between Wife and Husband respec tively. With suc h a low perc entage awarded under Step 1 to the Wife, as a matter of law, the weightage under Step 3 would need to be reviewed and inc reased to reflec t the full extent of the Wife’s indirec t c ontributions to this very long marriage (see disc ussion below from [59]–[68] below). Moving modestly from the 60% weightage to about 62% (the band of Step 3 weightages for **_very long_** marriages, in my judgment, being 60–65% in favour of the Step 2 ratio) _the Step 3 adjusted ratios would be almost the same_ ; that is, 49.5:50.5, albeit swapped in favour of the Husband. An equal division would therefore have still have been appropriate on this c ontingent analysis of the parties’ submissions. 

58     In long marriages, with the extended passage of time under sc rutiny, the evidenc e would not give a prec ise answer as to financ ial c ontribution; non-financ ial c ontribution would be even more diffic ult to quantify with exac titude. Just as an example, if the Wife’s figures as to direc t c ontribution to the Matrimonial Home had been used and the original 60% weightage applied, the adjusted ratio would be 50.6:49.4 for the Husband and Wife respec tively. Ultimately, the framework is a _guide_ that must remain sensitive to the fac tual c irc umstanc es of eac h c ase. The deeper point I make is that one must apprec iate that _ANJ_ v _ANK_ plac es in the hand of the Court a very robust and dynamic tool that must be used in a nuanc ed manner. An analysis of c ontingent sc enarios, as outlined above, when dealing with the submissions of the parties therefore both anc hors the c ourt’s analysis and gives the Court a sense of the ultimate division. Nevertheless, as the Court of Appeal c onc luded in _ANJ v ANK_ (at [30]): “The c ontrolling princ iple has always been and remains that the c ourt must approac h the exerc ise with broad strokes based on its feel of what is just and equitable on the fac ts of the c ase.” 

_Comparison with previous cases_ 

59     I analysed the division derived from the applic ation of _ANJ v ANK_ with the previous c ases, whic h I now elaborate upon. 

60     Ms Lim relied on the dec ision of the Court of Appeal in _Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and another appeal_ [2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“ _Yeo Chong Lin_ ”). In that c ase, over the c ourse of the 49year marriage, the husband was the breadwinner while the wife was a full-time homemaker. They had four c hildren all of whom had grown up by the time of the divorc e. The High Court awarded the wife 35% of the assets to the wife. On appeal the wife sought half the assets. The Court of Appeal highlighted (at [80]) that it would only exerc ise its direc tion to disturb the division of the High Court if the judge erred in law or had taken into ac c ount irrelevant c onsiderations and failed to take into ac c ount relevant c onsiderations. On the fac ts, the Court of Appeal found no spec ific basis to question the division made in the High Court. 

61     Of note was the Court of Appeal’s observation (at [2]) of the exc eptional feature of the c ase: the pool of matrimonial assets was _exceptionally large_ , estimated at about $69m (at [71]). In my view, the sheer quantum in _Yeo Chong Lin_ made it a very different c ase from the present. That c ase c ould not be used to advanc e a general proposition that a home-maker wife in a long marriage should be awarded 35% of the assets. In a post_ANJ v ANK_ sc enario, the weightage in that c ase in deriving 


the Step 3 adjusted ratio would have been adjusted in favour of the direc t c ontribution bec ause of the substantial size of the asset pool. 

62     Mr Choh relied on the dec ision of the Court of Appeal in _Tan Hwee Lee_ (whic h the Court of Appeal also referred to in _ANJ v ANK_ ). I found this c ase, where the matrimonial assets were worth about $6.5m, relevant. In _Tan Hwee Lee_ , the parties were married for 28 years and the husband was the sole bread winner throughout the marriage. The High Court awarded the wife 50% of the matrimonial assets. The Court of Appeal’s illuminating observations as regards the trend of “approximating equality for the homemaker for long marriages with c hildren” (whic h it endorsed) were as follows: 

 85 Although it has been stated by this c ourt that equality in division is not the starting point or the norm in the division of matrimonial assets between spouses (see Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520 (“ Lock Yeng Fun ”) at [57]), it also remains true that the “c ourts would nevertheless not hesitate to award half (or even more than half ) of the matrimonial assets if suc h a dec ision is justified on the fac ts” ( Lock Yeng Fun at [58]). This is espec ially so in long marriages where “the law ac knowledges the equally important c ontributions of the homemaker to the partnership of marriage” (see NK v NL at [41]), as the ac ademic c ommentators above (at [82]–[83]) have helpfully observed. 

63     The husband in _Tan Hwee Lee_ argued on appeal that the wife should be awarded merely 14.3% of the overall total assets, as she was a home-maker. The Court of Appeal disagreed (at [82]) with the husband’s c ontention that the wife should be awarded merely 14.3%. While the wife did not work and therefore provided no direc t financ ial c ontributions, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s equal division. In this regard, the c ourt took into ac c ount the marriage having lasted 28 years, over whic h the wife made signific ant non-financ ial c ontributions to the household. She managed the household and took c are of the c hildren, espec ially when the husband was at work or away. The c ourt found this to be so even though the family had a maid (see observations at [50] above). On the other hand, the Court of Appeal found that there was little to show that the husband made signific ant non-financ ial c ontributions at all. 

6       4 _Tan Hwee Lee_ is not a single prec edent standing in the Wife’s favour, but a rec ent example of a long line of Court of Appeal c ases whic h rec ognise the importanc e of intangible c ontributions made to the home. 

65     In _Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim Heng_ [2001] 2 SLR(R) 260 (“ _Lim Choon Lai_ ”), the Court of Appeal in stated (at [14]) that non-financ ial c ontributions c an be just as important as financ ial c ontributions, depending on the c irc umstanc es of the c ase. More rec ently, in _Lock Yeng Fun_ (at [50]), the Court of Appeal, while dec iding that there was no starting point of equality, stated that the “ _fullest_ effec t” must be given to non-financ ial c ontributions. Both Court of Appeal dec isions endorsed the approac h in _Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan_ [2000] 2 SLR(R) 659 (“ _Yow Mee Lan_ ”), the fac ts of whic h bear some resemblanc e to the c ase at hand_._ 

6       6 _Yow Mee Lan_ c onc erned a suc c essful businessman husband whose wife was predominantly a homemaker who did some work in the husband’s business. The High Court judge c onsidered that the marriage was long and that the parties had built themselves up from sc ratc h with very little educ ational qualific ations. While the husband had c apitalised on his skills to develop the business, the wife was totally and unstintingly c ommitted to the marriage and the household. The judge emphasised that a party’s financ ial c ontributions towards the ac quisition of any partic ular matrimonial asset c ould not be primarily determinative of how it was divided. She therefore disagreed with the distric t judge’s great emphasis on the husband’s role as an inc ome generator. The judge c onsidered that an equitable 


division in the c irc umstanc es was an equal division. She held (at [43]) that in a marriage, “partners often have unequal abilities whether as parents or inc ome earners but as between them, this disparity of roles and talent should not result in unequal rewards where the c ontributions are made c onsistently and over a long period of time”. 

67     In _AYQ v AYR_ [2013] 1 SLR 476, when dec iding that indirec t c ontribution ought to be c onsidered at the end of the marriage, the Court of Appeal held (at [23]) that this approac h was adopted in order not to _undervalue_ the indirec t c ontribution, explaining: 

 ...This approac h would ac c ord with the view of the marital enterprise being a partnership of efforts of both spouses and that, during the c ourse of marriage, the spouses c ontribute to the betterment of it in ways that they c an without c onsc iously ac c ounting with mathematic al prec ision as regards the quantum and type of their respec tive c ontributions. 

68     In _ANJ v ANK_ (at [17] and [26]) the Court of Appeal reiterated the guidanc e of _Lim Choon Lai_ (at [14]) and _NK v NL_ [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 (at [41]) that spousal c ontributions in both the ec onomic and homemaking spheres are equally fundamental to the well-being of a marital partnership. 

_Closing observations on the final ratio used_ 

69     In this partic ular c ase, neither party was well educ ated. The Wife was a c arpenter’s helper who gave up work after marriage and the Husband was an odd-job labourer when they married. The assets within the pool had been entirely built up in their years together. While the Husband c onc entrated on his employment, the Wife’s domain was the home. In their good years, the parties shared a joint ac c ount and neither expec ted the other to explain how they spent money. They fully c ooperated in the joint enterprise of their lives together, eac h doing their role in providing for their c hildren. In my judgment, this was a marriage where spouses had c ontributed in a partnership of efforts. These were therefore c irc umstanc es where their overall c ontributions to the marriage had to be _weighed equally_. 

70     I should mention two final matters. The first is that in the c ourse of oral submissions, Ms Lim suggested that _ANJ v ANK_ had rendered the matrimonial jurisprudenc e in relation to long marriages irrelevant: in her view, _ANJ v ANK_ c hanged the law. I have sought to show here that _ANJ v ANK_ does not overturn a long established line of Court of Appeal authority. 

71     The sec ond, in c losing, is that the power of the _ANJ v ANK_ struc tured analysis is that it ensures a logic al flow in dec iding a division. This is important bec ause the division the c ourt makes is fundamental to the family that the c ase brings to the attention of the c ourt: thus, arbitrariness ought to be minimised and a princ ipled approac h used as far as possible. At the same time, while the c ourt follows struc tured steps, its singular statutory duty is to ensure that the final result, weighing up all relevant fac tors, brings a just and equitable c losure to parties’ joint lives and allows them a sensible future. Arising from this, the steps of the proc ess are not disparate, but c onnec ted in their purpose: the delineation of the asset pool and its division are linked by the final objec tive that the alloc ation ac hieves. Thus, in exc luding the outstanding sum from the Husband at [34] above, I also bore in mind that I would adjust the Step 3 weightage in favour of the Wife, and that the Husband would have the final burden of liquidating the assets as nec essary. The objec t, in the final result, was to set a just and equitable division: fair to both parties in the c ontext of how they had ordered their joint lives, and, at the same time, a sound basis upon whic h they c ould reasonably move forward, their shared partnership of efforts having now c ome to an end. 

**_Allocation of the assets_** 


72     Half the Asset Pool was $2,600,335. Eac h party was entitled to this amount. In order to implement the division, I deduc ted the assets held in the Wife’s name (see Table 1) from the Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets and found that $1,826,883 remained payable to the Wife, who will return her CPF monies with interest to her CPF ac c ount. 

73     I gave the Husband the first option to purc hase the Matrimonial Home. The property was to be sold if the Husband did not wish to do so or did not have suffic ient means to ensure that the Wife rec eives her stipulated share of the pool. The Wife’s outstanding share of the Asset Pool would then be taken out of the proc eeds of sale. 

**Maintenance for the Wife** 

74     The Husband is now 60 years old, and is on a c ontrac t with the Company, the share values of whic h have been plummeting for some years. In line with rec overy efforts at the public ly listed c ompany, a new management team had been put in plac e. His employment (at $8,000 a month for this year) was therefore not sec ure beyond the end of this year. The Court of Appeal noted in _AYM v AYL and another appeal_ [2014] 4 SLR 559 (at [18]) that a lump sum payment allowed a c lean break in the marriage and should be used whenever feasible. I determined that a lump sum payment was suitable in the present c ase, taking into ac c ount the Husband’s projec ted inc ome stream in the future and his assets at hand. 

75     In her submissions, the Wife asked for $4,000 a month to be paid for 19 years to her. In this 

regard, the Wife tabulated a long list of monthly expenses whic h slightly exc eeded $4,000. [note: 28] Ms Lim on the other hand submitted in the hearing that the Husband should be asked to provide monthly maintenanc e of $800, as the Wife rec eived allowanc es from the c hildren. 

76     Having c onsidered all the relevant fac tors, I determined that it was appropriate to quantify the lump sum maintenanc e at $3,000 for five years. Calc ulated on the basis of an annual effec tive interest rate of 2%, the present value at the date of payment of this lump sum whic h was payable to the Wife was $171,517. In fixing this lump sum, I took into ac c ount that the Husband stopped giving the Wife maintenanc e after she moved out of the Matrimonial Home with the Daughter’s family in July 2015 (although she had possession of one of his two c ars and ac c ess, via the use of c heques, to their joint ac c ount). 

77     In the present c ase, the objec t of the dec ided sum was to give the Wife a suffic ient amount to weather the transition of the divorc e. Three fac tors were in play. The first was the desirability of a c lean break through a lump sum payment. The sec ond was the dec lining fortunes of the Husband and the Company. In _NI v NJ_ [2007] 1 SLR(R) 75, the Court of Appeal c autioned (at [16]) that the statutory direc tive in s 114 of the Charter, whic h the c ourt c onsidered in awarding maintenanc e, had to be applied in “a c ommonsense holistic manner that ac c ords with and takes into ac c ount the new realities that follow a failed marriage”. Here, both parties would have to make adjustments as one household transitioned into two. It would not be tenable for the Husband to pay a lump sum c alc ulated over 19 years as suggested by the Wife. The third, as highlighted by the Court of Appeal in _ATE v ATD_ [2016] SGCA 2 (at [33]), is that the power of the c ourt to order maintenanc e is _supplementary_ to that to order a division of matrimonial assets. In this c ase, the total financ ial provision for the Wife would amount to about $2.8m. On the assumption that the Wife would not be expec ted to seek employment, this amount, if wisely invested, was suffic ient to sec ure her future. 

**Costs** 

78     Having regard to the c irc umstanc es, I made no order on c osts of the anc illaries. As for the 


c osts of the divorc e, previously adjourned into c hambers by the judge granting the divorc e, this was initiated by the Wife arising from the Husband’s behaviour. I ordered c osts of $2,000 to the Wife. 

**Conclusion** 

79     In summary, I made the following orders: 

 (a) Upon the Husband’s transfer of $1,826,883 to the Wife within four months of 2 Marc h 2016, the Wife will do all that is nec essary to transfer her rights, title and interest in the Matrimonial Home to the Husband, with the Wife responsible to return the sum owing to her CPF ac c ount with interest. The c osts and expenses of the transfer shall be borne by the Husband. 

 (b) The Matrimonial Home is to be sold if the Husband c annot pay the Wife $1,826,883 within four months of 2 Marc h 2016. The Wife will authorise the Husband to sell the Matrimonial Home and the Husband shall have sole c onduc t of the sale. The c osts and expenses of sale shall be borne equally. The Wife will rec eive the remainder of $1,826,883 after deduc tion of her share of the c osts and expenses of sale from the proc eeds of sale and is to return the requisite amount with interest to her CPF ac c ount. 

 (c ) The Husband is entitled to withdraw the balanc e in his joint bank ac c ount with the Wife. He may c lose the joint ac c ount and the Wife is to do all that is nec essary to assist.
