22 June 2011 Judgment reserved. 

**Judith Prakash J:** 

**Introduction** 

1       This is an applic ation to set aside an arbitration award on the ground that the award is in c onflic t with the public polic y of Singapore as expressed and embodied in the Sec urities and Futures A c t (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the SFA”) and the subsidiary legislation thereunder, namely the Sec urities and Futures (Lic ensing and Conduc t of Business) Regulations 2002 (Cap 289, 2004 Rev Ed) (“t he Regulations”) and is thus in breac h of Art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (“UNCITRAL”) Model Law on International Commerc ial Arbitration (“the Model Law”) whic h has been made a part of Singapore law by the International Arbitration Ac t (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”). 

2       The originating summons c ontained a sec ond ground but at the hearing that was not proc eeded with. 

**Background** 

3       The plaintiff (“the Client”), the respondent in the arbitration, is a c ompany inc orporated in Australia. The defendant (“the Advisor”), the c laimant in the arbitration, is a Singapore c ompany that c arries on the business of giving c orporate financ e advic e inc luding in relation to mergers, ac quisitions and restruc turing. 

4       On 31 July 2007, the Client and the Advisor entered into a Consultanc y Servic e Engagement Agreement (“the Agreement”). At that time, the Client was listed on the Australian Exc hange (“ASX”) and the purpose of the Agreement was, as stated by Mr Nigel Jones (“Mr Jones”), the Advisor’s managing direc tor, to sec ure a Singapore listing for the Client through either a reverse take-over in Singapore (“Singapore RTO”) or an initial public offering (“IPO”) on the Singapore Stoc k Exc hange (“SGX”) and thereafter to generate additional shareholder value by the possible sale of the listed ASX shell c ompany through a reverse takeover in Australia (“Australia RTO”). The Advisor’s role was to advise the Client on and manage its c orporate exerc ise in Singapore. 

5       Clause 3 of the Agreement provided that the Client would pay the Advisor the sum of $10, 


per month for the servic es of the Advisor. The Advisor duly provided its servic es from August 2007 to April 2008 and rendered the Client monthly invoic es for the same. The Client paid the invoic es for the months of August and September 2007 in full and paid half of the invoic e for the month of Oc tober 

2007\. The total paid was $25,000 leaving an amount of $65,000 outstanding as at May 2008. The Agreement was terminated at the end of April 2008 by the Client. 

6       Clause 12 of the Agreement provides as follows: 

 Applicable law and dispute resolution. The governing law of this Agreement shall be the substantive law of Singapore. Any c laim or c ontroversy arising out of this Agreement inc luding a n y question regarding its existenc e, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in Singapore in ac c ordanc e with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC Rules”) for the time being in forc e whic h rules are deemed to be inc orporated by referenc e to this Clause. The Tribunal shall c onsist of one (1) arbitrator to be appointed by the Chairman of SIAC. The language of the arbitration shall be English. 

7       The Advisor submitted a Notic e of Arbitration on 3 July 2009 to rec over the amounts due to it. On 10 September 2009, the Chairman of the SIAC c onfirmed the appointment of Mr Nic holas Stone (“the Arbitrator”) as the sole arbitrator for the proc eedings. 

8       The hearing of the arbitration proc eedings took plac e in Singapore in April 2010 and submissions were c ompleted in June 2010. By the award dated 31 August 2010 (“the Award”), the Arbitrator awarded and ordered that the Client was to pay the Advisor $73,368 in respec t of unpaid invoic es and interest thereon c alc ulated up to 31 August 2010. He also ordered the Client to pay various sums as legal c osts, disbursements and c osts of the arbitration. All other reliefs c laimed in the arbitration by either party were rejec ted. 

**Issues and decision in the Award** 

9       The Advisor’s c laim in the arbitration was straight forward. It c laimed the balanc e amount of $65,000 in respec t of the unpaid invoic es and a further sum of $11,225 for interest. In its statement o f defenc e, the Client rejec ted liability on four grounds but, at the hearing, it abandoned two grounds. Consequently, the Arbitrator had to c onsider only the following defenc es: 

 (a) the assertion that the Agreement was void for illegality; and 

 (b) the assertion that the Advisor lac ked the legal c apac ity to enter into the Agreement. 

The Client also mounted a c ounterc laim by whic h it sought restitution of the sum of $25,000 paid to the Advisor, and interest thereon. 

10     The Client’s defenc e was based on the provisions of the SFA. This statute regulates the c onduc t of business involving the provision of c apital market servic es. Generally speaking, persons who provide c apital market servic es in Singapore need to be lic ensed under Part IV of the SFA. There is, however, provision for exemption from the lic ensing requirements provided that c ertain c riteria are met and the business is c arried on in a c ertain way. It was the Advisor’s position that it c arried on business as an exempt financ ial advisor and therefore did not need a c apital market servic es lic enc e. The Client’s c ontention was that by entering into and performing the Agreement, the Advisor was operating outside the exemptions to whic h it was subjec t with the result that the Agreement was void through illegality and/or lac k of c apac ity of the Advisor to enter into it. The spec ific c ontentions that the Client made were that: 


 (a) the Client did not qualify as a “ac c redited investor” under c l 7 of the Sec ond Sc hedule of the Regulations; and 

 (b) the advic e given by the Advisor did not meet the c riterion that it had to be “advic e [that] is not spec ific ally given for the making of any offer of sec urities to the public by the ac c redited investor to whom the advic e was given”. 

11     The Arbitrator found against the Client on both c ounts. First, in relation to the “ac c redited invest or” issue, the Arbitrator noted that under s 4A(1)(a)(ii) of the SFA, the term means a c orporation with net assets exc eeding $10m as determined by the most rec ent audited balanc e sheet of the c orporation. He stated that it was not disputed that at the time the Agreement was entered into, namely 31 July 2007, the audited balanc e sheet c ontained in the Client’s Financ ial Report as at 31 Dec ember 2006 was the most rec ent audited balanc e sheet of the Client available in the public domain. This showed the Client’s net assets as being A$9,331,000 whic h at the time was in exc ess of $10m. The Client argued that the audited ac c ounts for the period ending 30 June 2007 whic h showed a net asset balanc e of less than $10m were available at the time the Agreement was entered into. The Arbitrator found that no evidenc e had been produc ed by the Client to substantiate its assertion that these ac c ounts were available but the Advisor had not asked for them. He found that the balanc e sheet of 31 Dec ember 2006 was the most rec ent audited balanc e sheet of the Client in ac c ordanc e with the terms of s 4(a)(1)(ii)(A) and, whilst the 30 June 2007 ac c ounts may have been in the c ourse of preparation, that did not meet the statutory definition. Ac c ordingly, the Client was an “ac c redited investor” when the Agreement was c onc luded. 

12     On the sec ond issue, the Client had argued that the primary purpose of the rendering of the servic es by the Advisor under the Agreement was the raising of funds by the Client by making an offer o f sec urities to the public and therefore the Advisor c ould not provide the servic es under the exemption set out in c l 7(1)(b) of the Sec ond Sc hedule of the Regulations. The Advisor’s stand was that the c orporate exerc ise c ontemplated in the Agreement and the advic e that was given by the Advisor involved a range of options and therefore was not spec ific ally given for the making of any offer of sec urities to the public. 

13     The Arbitrator noted that the sec ond paragraph of c l 2 of the Agreement limited the servic es to be provided by the Advisor and spec ific ally envisaged that if in the future there was to be an IPO or a Singaporean or Australian RTO, other professional advisors would be appointed to deal with these matters. The Arbitrator also c onsidered that the deal struc tures c ontemplated in the Agreement appeared to fall under the exemptions c ontained in c l 7(1)(c ) rather than c l 7(1)(b) of the Sec ond Sc hedule. 

14     After reviewing the evidenc e, the Arbitrator found that the advic e given by the Advisor to the Client was not spec ific ally given for the making of any offer of sec urities to the public and therefore did not fall outside the exemption c ontained in c l 7(1)(b)(i) or that in c l 7(1)(c )(i). He also found the sc ope of servic es c ontemplated in the Agreement would fall within the exemption set out in c l 7(1) (c ). 

15     Clause 7(1)(d) of the Sec ond Sc hedule of the Regulations provides that a person is exempted from the requirement to hold a c apital market servic es lic enc e if he c arries on business in giving advic e to another person c onc erning c omplianc e with or in respec t of any laws or regulatory requirements related to the raising of funds not involving any sec urities. Before the Arbitrator, the Advisor had c laimed to be suc h a person. It said that the advic e it gave to the Client related to c omplianc e with loc al rules and regulations and that it also gave advic e in respec t of a take-over whic h would have involved the issuanc e of shares in the Client to a Chinese c ompany’s princ ipal 


shareholder. However, this advic e on the issuanc e of sec urities was not given to the public. Further, the Advisor did not require a lic enc e to provide servic es under c l 7(1)(d) as the Agreement c learly provided that if sec urities were to be offered, the Client would have to engage other professionals for that purpose. The Arbitrator agreed with the Advisor and found the advic e given did not fall outside the exemption provided by c l 7(1)(d). If the Agreement had c ome to fruition and funds were to be raised either by reverse take-over or initial public offering, the Agreement expressly provided that other professionals would be engaged for the purpose of issuing sec urities to raise funds. 

**The application** 

**_The law_** 

16     It is c ommon ground that the arbitration proc eedings at issue in this c ase were subjec t to the provisions of the Ac t. The Ac t and the Model Law do not permit appeals against arbitration awards. Instead, they provide c ertain limited grounds on whic h dissatisfied parties may apply to set aside an arbitration award. Under Art 34(2)(b) of the Model Law as implemented by the Ac t, an award may be set aside if the c ourt finds that it is in c onflic t with the public polic y of Singapore. In _PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA_ <span class="citation">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 597</span>, the Court of Appeal gave valuable guidanc e on the situations in whic h an award might be found to be in c onflic t with the public polic y of Singapore. It said at [59]: 

 Although the c onc ept of public polic y of the State is not defined in the Ac t or the Model Law, the general c onsensus of judic ial and expert opinion is that public polic y under the Ac t enc ompasses a narrow sc ope. In our view, it should only operate in instanc es where the upholding of an arbitral award would “shoc k the c onsc ienc e” ... or is “c learly injurious to the public good or ... wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of the public ” ... or where it violates the forum’s most basic notion of morality and justic e ... This would be c onsistent with the c onc ept of public polic y that c an be asc ertained from the preparatory materials to the Model Law. 

17     In the present c ase, the Client’s c ontention is that the Award offends the public polic y of Singapore bec ause it upholds an illegal c ontrac t. The extent to whic h illegality c an found a c hallenge to an award was c onsidered by Chan Seng Onn J in _AJT v AJU_ <span class="citation">[2010] 4 SLR 649</span>. He stated at [15] and [16]: 

 15 Thus, in order for [AJT] to suc c eed in setting aside the Award on the ground that upholding the Award would be in c onflic t with the public polic y of Singapore, it has to establish, first, that the Tribunal dec ided erroneously on the issue of illegality of the Conc luding Agreement. Next, it has to show that the error was of suc h a nature that enforc ement of the Award would “shoc k the c onsc ienc e,” be “c learly injurious to the public good” or would c ontravene “fundamental notions and princ iples of justic e”. 

 16 In determining whether the Tribunal dec ided c orrec tly on the issue of illegality of the Conc luding Agreement, the approac h of the Court in exerc ising its supervisory jurisdic tion has to be borne in mind. In Robert Merkin and Johanna Hjalmarsson, Singapore Arbitration Legislation Annotated. (London Informa, 2009) the authors stated the following at p 75: 

 The mere fac t that an award c ontains an error of law is not enough. The c ases rec ognise public polic y issues in the following situations: 

 ... 


 (c ) [T]he award is tainted by illegality. If the arbitrators have jurisdic tion under the arbitration c lause to determine the legality of the underlying c ontrac t, and have c onc luded that the c ontrac t is valid under its applic able law, the award is generally enforc eable ... Equally, if the arbitrators have ignored ‘palpable and indisputable illegality’ the award will not be enforc ed. By c ontrast, if illegality under the applic able law has not been raised before the arbitrators, the c ourt may c onsider whether the underlying c ontrac t was illegal under its applic able law although the presumption is in favour of enforc ement. 

18     Chan J also c onsidered that the c ourt has the inherent jurisdic tion to rec onsider the issue of illegality although the arbitral tribunal may have determined that the c ontrac t in question was not illegal. At [24], Chan J held: 

 Thus, on the fac ts of this present c ase, while the Tribunal determined that the Conc luding Agreement was not illegal, this was not c onc lusive. In an appropriate c ase, the c ourt, in exerc ising its supervisory jurisdic tion, may examine the fac ts of the c ase and dec ide the issue of illegality. While there is a need to uphold the public interest in ensuring the finality of arbitral awards, the c ourt must also safeguard the c ountervailing public interest in ensuring that its proc esses are not abused by litigants. 

19     From the above authorities, it appears that I must first determine whether the Arbitrator c ame to an erroneous c onc lusion on the issues relating to illegality under the SFA. If he did, I would have to determine whether the illegality was of suc h a nature that to enforc e the Award would c onflic t with the public polic y of Singapore. In dec iding the issue of illegality, I have the power to examine the fac ts of the c ase afresh. 

**_The statutory regime governing the Agreement_** 

20     The relevant sec tions of the SFA provide as follows: 

 Need for capital markets services licence 

 82. — (1) Subjec t to subsec tion (2) and sec tion 99, no person shall, whether as princ ipal or agent, c arry on business in any regulated ac tivity or hold himself out as c arrying on suc h business unless he is the holder of a c apital markets servic es lic enc e for that regulated ac tivity. 

 (2) Subsec tion (1) shall not apply to any person spec ified in the Third Sc hedule. 

 (3) Any person who c ontravenes subsec tion (1) shall be guilty of an offenc e and shall be liable on c onvic tion to a fine not exc eeding $150,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exc eeding 3 years or to both and, in the c ase of a c ontinuing offenc e, to a further fine not exc eeding $15,000 for every day or part thereof during whic h the offenc e c ontinues after c onvic tion. 

 ... 

 Exemptions from requirement to hold capital markets services licence 

 99. —(1) The following persons shall be exempted in respec t of the following regulated ac tivities from the requirement to hold a c apital markets servic es lic enc e to c arry on business in suc h regulated ac tivities: 

 ... 


 Exemption from requirement to hold capital markets services licence to advise on corporate finance 

7\. (1) The following persons shall be exempted from the requirement to hold a c apital markets servic es lic enc e to c arry on business in advising on c orporate financ e, subjec t to the c onditions and restric tions spec ified: 

 (a) ... 

 (b) a person resident in Singapore who c arries on business in giving advic e on c orporate financ e to ac c redited investors, provided that – 

 (i) suc h advic e is not spec ific ally given for the making of any offer of sec urities to the public by the ac c redited investor to whom the advic e was given; and 

 (ii) where the ac c redited investor is – (A) a public c ompany; 

 (B) listed on a sec urities exc hange; or 

 (C) ... 

 suc h advic e is not c irc ulated to the shareholders (other than shareholders who are ac c redited investors) of (in the c ase of sub-paragraph (A) or (B)) the ac c redited investor or (in the c ase of sub-paragraph (C)) the listed c orporation, or is otherwise made known to the public ; 

 (h) suc h other person or c lass of persons in respec t of any regulated ac tivity as may be exempted by the Authority. 

21     In s 2 of the SFA, “regulated ac tivity” is defined as an ac tivity spec ified in the Sec ond Sc hedule to the SFA. Part I of the Sec ond Sc hedule sets out the various types of regulated ac tivities and inc ludes among these “advising on c orporate financ e”. This phrase is defined in Part II of the Sec ond Sc hedule as meaning: 

 ... giving advic e — 

 (a) to any person (whether as princ ipal or agent, or as trustee of a trust) c onc erning c omplianc e with or in respec t of laws or regulatory requirements (inc luding the listing rules of a sec urities exc hange) relating to the raising of funds by any entity, trustee of a trust on behalf of the trust or responsible person of a c ollec tive investment sc heme on behalf of the c ollec tive investment sc heme; 

 ... 

 (c ) c onc erning the arrangement, rec onstruc tion or take-over of a c orporation or any of its assets or liabilities ... 

22     To find out who is exempted from holding the presc ribed lic enc e one must turn to the sec ondary legislation. The Sec ond Sc hedule to the Regulations is entitled “Exemptions from Holding Capital Markets Servic es Lic enc e or Representative Lic enc e”. The c lauses in the Sec ond Sc hedule to the Regulations c reate exemptions to the types of regulated ac tivities set out in the SFA. The relevant c lause in this portion of the Regulations is c l 7 and the relevant parts of that c lause provide as follows: 


 (c ) a person who advises another person c onc erning any arrangement, rec onstruc tion or take-over of any c orporation or any of the c orporation’s assets or liabilities, provided that 

- 

 (i) suc h advic e is not spec ific ally given for the making of any offer of sec urities to the public by the sec ond-mentioned person; and 

 (ii) where the sec ond-mentioned person is – 

 (A) a public c ompany;

23     The term “ac c redited investor” in respec t of a c orporation is defined in s 4A(1)(a)(ii) of the SFA as meaning: 

 a c orporation with net assets exc eeding $10 million in value (or its equivalent in a foreign c urrenc y) or suc h other amount as the Authority may presc ribe, in plac e of the first amount, as determined by – 

 (A) the most rec ent audited balanc e-sheet of the c orporation; or 

 (B) where the c orporation is not required to prepare audited ac c ounts regularly, a balanc e-sheet of the c orporation c ertified by the c orporation as giving a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the c orporation as of the date of the balanc e sheet, whic h date shall be within the prec eding 12 months ... 

**_The submissions made on behalf of the Client_** 

24     Mr Aqbal Singh, c ounsel for the Client, took me through the evidenc e in the arbitration proc eedings in some detail in order to establish the illegality he c omplained of. Dealing first with the Agreement, he pointed out that it had several referenc es to an IPO in Singapore. First, under c l I of the Introduc tion, the Client had stated that it wished to c onsider c ertain c orporate exerc ises whic h might lead it to pursuing its own IPO on SGX. In c l II, it was provided that one of the ways in whic h 


t he Advisor’s assignment would c onc lude would be with the ac c omplishment of a suc c essful IPO on SGX. He noted also that the Agreement stated that the Advisor would not be required to provide legal, tax, independent financ ial advic e (“IFA”) or other spec ialist servic es and that it envisaged that the Advisor would assist the Client in appointing suc h additional professional advisors if nec essary. The Agreement spec ific ally stated that in the event of an IPO, a Singapore underwriter and Australian IFA would be required. However, c ounsel submitted, this exc lusion left untouc hed the area of advising generally on the strategy and tec hnique for an IPO. In addition to the $10,000 monthly fee, the Agreement also provided for different levels of suc c ess fee depending on what c orporate exerc ise was eventually ac hieved. If a Singapore IPO was undertaken, the suc c ess fee payable for suc c essful listing would be $100,000. 

25     The Client’s c ase was that from day one, the Advisor plunged into advising on an IPO in Singapore. The Advisor did not say that it c ould not give suc h advic e. The Arbitrator had noted at para 36 of the Award that the Advisor’s own ac c ount of the work it had done for the Client had the following in respec t of the month of August 2007: 

 In the first few weeks of the Agreement, the [Advisor] worked with the [Client’s] CEO to review the [Client’s] financ ial status and eligibility for an IPO in Singapore. The [Client] advised the [Advisor] that it was in disc ussions to ac quire a business in China [this is what the parties referred to as the “Anheal deal”] and that a Singapore listing would be integral to sec uring the nec essary funding to ac quire the business. Further, the Chinese ac quisition would provide the [Client] with the nec essary profitability to meet the Singapore SGX listing c riteria. 

The Client’s managing direc tor, Mr Jones, had in his witness statement for the arbitration, stated that on 12 August 2007, there had been a disc ussion of the Client’s c orporate strategy and this inc luded assessing the pros and c ons of sec uring an SGX listing by way of a Singapore IPO or RTO. Mr Jones had also c onfirmed the various events that had taken plac e during the c urrenc y of the Agreement. The summary of this ac c ount provided to the Arbitrator, inc luded preparing a memorandum in Oc tober 2007 giving an initial analysis of the China ac quisition, and meeting, together with the Client’s c hief exec utive offic er, with a number of Singapore broking firms to disc uss the potential for listing the Client on the new SGX Catalist market that was due to be launc hed in 2008. Then, in November and Dec ember 2007, there were further enquiries with the Singapore IPO brokers about the listing rules for the new SGX Catalist market. In February 2008, the Advisor made a presentation to the Client’s board of direc tors whic h inc luded updating findings on the potential to move the listing to the SGX Catalist board. 

26     Mr Aqbal Singh (“Mr Singh”) submitted that the IPO in Singapore was very important and this is what the advic e was required for. He pointed to the management disc ussion note dated 12 August 2007 whic h c ontained a whole sec tion entitled “Moving the listing” whic h dealt with listing on SGX. Then, in a presentation whic h the Advisor gave to the Client’s board on 17 August 2007, the Advisor disc ussed the benefits of the Anheal deal and also disc ussed the various options available to the Client inc luding primary listing on SGX, sec ondary listing on SGX and dual listing on SGX and ASX. These options were disc ussed in some detail. Counsel submitted that Singapore IPO advic e was c onstantly reiterated during this presentation and it was inseparable from all the other advic e given. 

27     There was c onsiderable e-mail c orrespondenc e passing between the Client and the Advisor during the c urrenc y of the Agreement. Many of these e-mails referred to possible listing plans. In one dated 24 August 2007, sent out by one of the offic ers of the Client, two employees of the Advisor were introduc ed to a third party as having been engaged by the Client for “funding and listing plans in Singapore”. In an e-mail from Mr Jones sent on 5 Dec ember 2007, he asked the Client whether the Advisor should review the Catalist market during its wait for some financ ial doc uments from Anheal. In 


his response the same day, Dr Tan Sze Wee of the Client agreed to the review of the Catalist market and mentioned a firm that was willing to be the Client’s sponsor for a Catalist listing. He also said “We’re aiming for listing sometime in late sec ond quarter or early third quarter next year, so ... we’re not the first few to go out”. In an e-mail to a third person on the preparation of preIPO reports, 

dated 16 January 2008, Dr Tan mentioned the possibility of the Client’s IPO being pushed to “3rd quarter 2008 due to the volatility in the market and the c larity of the Catalist sec tor”. In the same email Dr Tan informed the rec ipient that he had c opied Mr Jones in the e-mail sinc e the latter was the Client’s financ ial advisor and would get bac k to the rec ipient “with further details on [their] listing plans”. 

28     Counsel also drew my attention to a presentation whic h the Advisor had made to the Client sometime in February 2008. Part of the presentation was entitled “Related issues – the listing domain” and dealt with a possible listing on Catalist. 

29     Mr Singh emphasised that the evidenc e of the Advisor itself was c ruc ially important as showing the work that it had done. In this regard, matters were enc apsulated in paras 30 and 31 of Mr Jones’ witness statement whic h read as follows: 

30\. The Agreement very c learly states that ‘[the Client] wishes to c onsider and review c ertain c orporate exerc ises whic h may inc lude either the sale of its business through a Reverse Take-     Over in Singapore (“Singapore RTO”) or pursue its own public offer (“IPO”) on the Singapore Stoc k Exc hange (“SGX”). 

31\. The purport and intention of the [Client] as set out above were very c lear in that the [Client] had engaged the [Advisor] to advise the [Client] on the possibility of either a sale of the [Client’s] business through a RTO or an IPO in Singapore. The various presentations, e-mails and notes to the [Client] are all in relation to this aim. From the first meetings with the Singapore stoc kbroking firms it was c lear that the [Client’s] business was too small for a Singapore listing.     Ac c ordingly, the [Advisor] was instruc ted by the [Client’s] CEO (and later c onfirmed during the     Board Meeting in August, 2007) to expedite the Anheal ac quisition to give the [Client] the nec essary c ritic al size for the SGX listing. 

30     Mr Singh submitted that the evidenc e c learly showed that the advic e given by the Advisor to the Client was spec ific ally given for the purpose of a listing in Singapore and therefore was outside the sc ope of the exemption given to the Advisor. Ac c ording to the dic tionary definition, the word “spec ific ” means “express” or “prec ise”. It does not mean “only limited to”. In Mr Singh’s submission, the Arbitrator had wrongly interpreted the word “spec ific ” as meaning “exc lusive” and that wrong interpretation had led to his erroneous c onc lusion that the Agreement was not illegal under Singapore law. 

**_Analysis_** 

31     It was c ommon ground both in the arbitration and before me that the Advisor’s business was to give advic e on c orporate financ e and that therefore unless it was exempted under s 99 of the SFA, it required a c apital markets servic es lic enc e to c arry on suc h ac tivity. The Advisor’s position was that it was so exempt bec ause it and the advic e it gave fell within c l 7(1)(b), or c l 7(1)(c ) or c l 7(1)(d). The question before me was whether the Arbitrator had wrongly interpreted c ll 7(1)(b) and (1)(c ) in relation to the ac tivities of the Advisor. 

32     The differenc e between c ll 7(1)(b) and (1)(c ) is that the first relates to a person who gives advic e on c orporate financ e to ac c redited investors whilst the sec ond relates to a person who 


advises another person c onc erning any arrangement, rec onstruc tion or takeover of any c orporation or any of the c orporation’s assets or liabilities. There are other c onditions to be met whic h are c ommon to both c ategories but for present purposes, the important one is that the advic e given under sub-c l (b) and sub-c l (c ) must in both c ases not be “spec ific ally given for the making of any offer of sec urities to the public ”. As c an be seen from my summary of the Client’s submissions, the Client did not c hallenge the Arbitrator’s finding in the Award that it had been an ac c redited investor at the time t he Agreement was entered into or the basis of the Arbitrator’s further holding that the loss of that status subsequently did not invalidate the Agreement. Therefore, I do not have to deal with that issue. What I have to deal with is whether the advic e was “spec ific ally given for the making of any offer of sec urities to the public ”. This is an issue of statutory interpretation. 

33     In this c onnec tion, it is worth noting some of what was said in Parliament on 5 Oc tober 2001 when the Sec urities and Futures Bill (“SF Bill”) c ame up for its sec ond reading. The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong) who was presenting the Bill stated, _inter alia_ : 

 ... 

 Part IV of the SF Bill will require an intermediary to hold only a single lic enc e, known as a Capital Markets Servic es lic enc e, to c onduc t one or more regulated ac tivities. These regulated ac tivities will inc lude sec urities dealing, futures trading, leveraged foreign exc hange trading, advising on c orporate financ e, fund management, sec urities financ ing and c ustodial servic es for sec urities. 

 The single lic ensing regime will reduc e both c apital and c omplianc e c ost, and allow our intermediaries to be c ompetitive ac ross a broader spec trum of financ ial servic es. 

 The SF Bill will provide for lic ensing exemptions so long as these do not c ompromise the standard of investor protec tion. 

34     During the ensuing debate, Mr Sin Boon Ann expressed the hope that the c onditions to be set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore relating to the applic ation proc ess for a c apital markets lic enc e c ould be made easier for the boutique firms c omprising ex-bankers and employees of financ ial institutions providing servic es in the area of c orporate financ e bec ause suc h persons performed a useful func tion by providing advic e and servic es to small and medium enterprises and to c lients who might not have the wherewithal to engage the servic es of merc hant bankers or other financ ial institutions. In response to that point, BG Lee Hsien Loong said: 

 I would just like to address one point whic h Mr Sin raised, whic h is the issue of boutique firms or individuals who are small and who want to bec ome market intermediaries. It is not our intention to make it diffic ult for ex-bankers and employees of financ ial institutions to start up on their own and enter c orporate financ e or other ac tivities. So we will have a level playing field. And if they are able to do it and if they have the expertise, I think the framework will enable them to do so. 

35     As c an be seen from the foregoing extrac ts of the debate, one of the aims of the SFA was to protec t the investing public whilst at the same time allowing for diversity of servic e providers in the c apital markets servic es sec tor by ensuring that there were areas within whic h boutique firms c ould operate and reac h c lients who would find it expensive to engage the servic es of investment banks. 

36     It is in the light of the foregoing intention that I think the phrase “spec ific ally given for the making of any offer of sec urities to the public ” must be interpreted. It is not enough to c onc entrate on the meaning of “spec ific ally” without bearing in mind the “public ” at whom the offer c onc erned is to be direc ted. In this c ase, the public means the investing public who would purc hase sec urities in a 


listed c ompany. The dic tionary definitions of “spec ific ” given to me by both c ounsel show that generally it means “c learly defined or identified” or “prec ise”. Counsel for the Client emphasised that “exc lusively” is not one of the meanings of the word. That may be so but it appears to me that the way in whic h “spec ific ally” is used in the phrase in question does imply a degree of exc lusivity in that it implies that the advic e must be prec isely c onc erned with or direc ted to an offer of sec urities to the public whic h is imminent or ongoing. Thus, the advic e must relate direc tly to an ac tual offer to the public. If the purpose of the advic e is to put a partic ular c ompany in suc h a position that it may qualify to subsequently make an offer of sec urities to the public , it appears to me that suc h advic e would not be spec ific ally given for the making of any offer of sec urities to the public even though that may be the ultimate purpose for whic h the advic e is taken. The fac t that after the advic e is implemented, the c ompany c onc erned may want, and may thereby be in a position, to initiate steps to make suc h an offer to the public is in my view not material for the purpose of the interpreting c l 7. The exemptions in c l 7 are aimed at insuring that when sec urities are to be sold to the investing public , for the protec tion of that public , the persons advising the issuer or seller of the sec urities are qualified to do so and are not persons who are only exempted from the lic ensing requirement pursuant to that c lause. The Regulations, however, do not stop firms like the Advisor from giving advic e to c lients to put suc h c lients into a position in whic h they c an subsequently c onsider whether to implement an ac tual public offering and to hire suitably qualified professionals to advise them on the same. 

37     As the legislation was enac ted, boutique firms like the Advisor were exempted from holding a c apital markets servic es lic enc e as long as they ensured that the business that they did and the c lients they servic ed fell within the desc riptions in c l 7. The Regulations envisage that among the servic es to be provided by suc h boutique firms would be the provision of c orporate financ e inc luding advic e on ac quisition of c orporations. Suc h advic e must of c ourse inc lude the methodology of financ ing ac quisitions. This c ould take various forms suc h as c ash or the issue of sec urities or a c ombination of the two. In financ ing an ac quisition, however, an offer to the public need not nec essarily be involved. In this partic ular c ase, an offer to the public was not envisaged in relation to the ac quisition of Anheal whic h was the immediate c orporate ac quisition on whic h the Advisor was working. 

38     From an examination of the fac ts, it is c lear that the Client had, as one of its ultimate purposes, a listing on a stoc k exc hange in Singapore. Muc h of the advic e given by the Advisor was direc ted at c onsidering how the Client c ould be put into a position suc h that it would be able to go on to apply for a listing. The Advisor determined that the Client needed to ac quire another c orporation suc h as Anheal in order to qualify for a Singapore listing and therefore c onsidered in some detail how this c ould be ac hieved. In that c onnec tion, advic e was given for the issue of sec urities but the sec urities would not have been issued to the public at large but rather to the owner of Anheal. 

39     Mr Jones in his evidenc e was quite c ategoric al that the advic e given was c orporate financ e advic e on arrangement, rec onstruc tion and takeover and that the Advisor had at all times c arried on business within the bounds permitted by c l 7. He emphasised that to the extent that something needed “to touc h the public ” _ie_ when advic e had to be given for the making of an offer of sec urities to the public , a Singapore underwriter or Singapore broker had to be employed and that what the Advisor did did not touc h the public. 

40     If the phrase “spec ific ally given for the making of any offer of sec urities to the public ” is c onstrued in the manner suggested by c ounsel for the Client, the result would be to greatly limit the sc ope of work whic h c ould be done without a lic enc e pursuant to c l 7. As it is, c l 7 c ontains a number of restric tions whic h must be observed by the c orporate advisor and I think it would be wrong to further restric t the sc ope of the advisor’s ac tivities by reading the phrase in the rather wide manner 


that c ounsel has suggested. To so interpret it would inc rease the c osts of small and medium sized firms who are in the initial stages of c onsidering listing and prevent them from c onduc ting the nec essary investigatory work with the help of a c orporate advisor like the Advisor. 

41     Notwithstanding the events and advic e emphasised by c ounsel for the Client, it is c lear that nothing the Advisor did pertained immediately to the issue of sec urities in the Client whic h would be offered to the public. There was advic e on what steps had to be taken if the Client wanted an IPO in Singapore but that advic e related generally to the matters needed to have a suc c essful IPO and did not direc tly relate to an immediate or ac tually impending offer of shares to the public. There was also advic e on the issuanc e of sec urities but the proposed ac quirer of those sec urities was Anheal’s princ ipal shareholder and that proposal c ould not, in the c ontext of the Anheal ac quisition, be c onsidered a proposal of a public offering. Although the Agreement envisaged an IPO in Singapore as one of the ultimate purposes to be ac hieved, I am satisfied, as was the Arbitrator, that in implementing the Agreement, the advic e given by the Advisor was not spec ific ally given for the making of any offer of sec urities to the public. 

42     Further, the Agreement, as the Arbitrator pointed out too, envisaged that if the work that the Advisor did under it resulted in the need or desire to raise funds from the public , other duly qualified professionals would be engaged to run the public offering. I do not ac c ept, as c ounsel suggested, that this provision was simply for show. In my judgment, it indic ates not only that the Advisor was aware of the limitations on its ability to advise but also that it wanted to make it plain to the Client that the Client c ould not look to it for advisory servic es relating to a public offering and would have to engage a person who was qualified under the SFA to handle suc h issue. I ac c ept, as did the Arbitrator, that the Advisor ac ted within the bounds of the exemptions in c l 7 and that it was not wrong to understand the prohibition against giving advic e spec ific ally on an offering of sec urities to the public as allowing it to give the kind of advic e that it did. I also agree with the Arbitrator’s holding that the servic es provided by the Advisor fell more within the remit of c l 7(1)(c ) than of c l 7(1)(b ). 

**Conclusion** 

43     For the reasons that I have given, there was no illegality involved in the Agreement or in the way that it was implemented. Ac c ordingly, I do not have to c onsider the next issue whic h would have been whether the illegality found was against public polic y and would justify the setting aside of the Award. This applic ation must be therefore dismissed with c osts.
