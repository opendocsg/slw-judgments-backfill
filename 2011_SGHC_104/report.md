_Civil Procedure_ 

29 April 2011 Judgment reserved. 

**Kan Ting Chiu J:** 

1       The plaintiff in these proc eedings, Doc tor’s Assoc iates Inc ., is a c orporation inc orporated in the USA with its princ ipal plac e of business in the state of Florida. The plaintiff is suing the defendant, Lim Eng Wah, who is trading in Singapore under the name Subway Nic he, for relief against the defendant for infringing and passing off of the plaintiff’s “SUBWAY” trade mark whic h is registered under the Trade Marks Ac t (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”) by the use of the “SUBWAY NICHE” trade mark. 

2       In these proc eedings, the princ ipal reliefs that the plaintiff is praying for are, inter alia: 

 A dec laration that the plaintiff’s trade mark “SUBWAY” is well known in Singapore, for the purposes of the Ac t; 

 A dec laration that the c ontinuing use of “SUBWAY NICHE” by the defendant amounts to an infringement of the plaintiff’s registered trade mark in Singapore; 

 Further or alternatively, a dec laration that the plaintiff is entitled to restrain by injunc tion the use in Singapore, in the c ourse of trade and without the plaintiff’s c onsent, the trade mark “SUBWAY NICHE” whic h inc orporates or employs the plaintiff’s well known trade mark “SUBWAY”, in relation to any goods or servic es; and 

 Further or alternatively, an order that the defendant, whether by himself, his offic ers, servants, agents or any of them be retrained from passing off by advertising, marketing, selling or otherwise distributing goods and servic es by referenc e to the use of the word “SUBWAY”, when suc h goods or servic es of the defendant are ac tually not assoc iated or c onnec ted to the plaintiff. 

and the plaintiff also seeks to restrain the defendant from further ac ts of trade mark infringement and

## 2. 

passing off, damages and delivery up of any offending material. 

3       Viewed on its own, this is an unexc eptional ac tion by one trader against another for the infringement of its intellec tual property. There is, however, a history to this c ase. The bac kground is that the plaintiff had sued the defendant for infringement of the trade mark in an earlier ac tion, Suit No. 764 of 2008 (“Suit 764”). 

4       In Suit 764, the plaintiff c laimed as the registered proprietor of several SUBWAY trademarks that the defendant had c ommitted ac ts of infringement and passing off against those registered trade marks by the use of the name “SUBWAY NICHE”. The plaintiff sought to restrain the defendant from c ommitting those wrongful ac ts, delivery up of any offending material and damages. 

5       Suit 764 was not litigated on its merits bec ause it was struc k out after the plaintiff had failed to c omply with an unless order. On 7 September 2009, an Assistant Registrar had issued an unless order that: 

 The Plaintiffs do by 12.00 pm, Thursday, 10 September 2009 give further sec urity for the Defendant’s c osts in this ac tion to the sum of S$19,000.00 in the form of a banker’s guarantee from a first c lass Singapore bank, the terms of whic h are to be subjec t to the Defendant’s solic itors’ approval; 

 In default of c omplianc e, the Plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim be struc k out and the ac tion dismissed with c osts without further order; 

6       That was not the first order for the plaintiff to furnish sec urity for c osts. There was an earlier c onsent order of 26 August 2009 by whic h the plaintiff was to furnish sec urity in the sum of $19, within seven days of the order. The c onsent order also provided that pending the provision of the sec urity, the ac tion was to be stayed. The c onsent order was different from the order of 7 September 2009 in that it was not an unless order; it did not dec ree that the ac tion was to be struc k out if the sec urity was not furnished. 

7       The plaintiff failed to c omply with the unless order of 7 September 2009 and appealed against the order. When the plaintiff’s applic ation for a stay of proc eedings pending the appeal was heard on 14 September 2009, it was dismissed with the result that the appeal was not heard, and a further order was made striking out the plaintiff’s ac tion. The plaintiff was aggrieved by the order, and filed an applic ation on 13 Oc tober 2009 to set it aside. This applic ation was heard on 26 Oc tober 2009 and was dismissed. There was no appeal against the order of c ourt of 26 Oc tober 2009. 

**The present appeal** 

8       The plaintiff filed the present originating summons on 12 May 2010. On 31 May 2010, the defendant applied to strike it out on the ground that it was an abuse of proc ess of c ourt, or alternatively, it was frivolous and vexatious, but the arguments presented were made on the first ground. 

9       The defendant’s argument was that as Suit 764 was struc k out and judgment was entered against the plaintiff, it was an abuse of proc ess of c ourt for the plaintiff to c ommenc e the sec ond ac tion on the same c ause of ac tion. When the plaintiff applied to set aside the judgment in Suit 764, the defendant argued that as the plaintiff did not appeal against the c ase of 26 Oc tober 2009: 

 [I]t is c lear law that if the Plaintiffs took the view that their c onduc t in Suit 764 had not been 


## 13. 

 c ontumelious and that they should be allowed to pursue their c laim for alleged trade mark infringement and passing off against the Defendant, the onus was on them to file an appeal against the [dismissal order]. It is c ompletely wrong for the Plaintiffs not to pursue this avenue of appeal and instead file a fresh ac tion for the same c ause of ac tion against the Defendant. 

 [emphasis in original] 

10     That submission has to be examined against the rec ord of the proc eedings. An Assistant Registrar (“AR”) who dismissed the plaintiff’s applic ation to set aside the judgment, wrote: 

 This is a frivolous applic ation and an abuse of proc ess of c ourt. As I said earlier on 7 September 2009. SUM4258/2009 – the applic ation for sec urity for c osts – was entered into by c onsent before AR Daphne Chang, whereby both parties agreed that Plaintiff was to provide sec urity within 7 days (i.e. 3 September 2009). It lies foul in Plaintiff’s mouth to state that the unless order applic ation was unreasonable given that trial was originally to be fixed on 14 September but for Plaintiff’s c onduc t (Plaintiff has not even set down the ac tion for trial!). I also note that this is the sec ond unless order made by this c ourt against Plaintiff – the first was o n 29 July 2009 whereby AR Jeyendran Jeyapal ordered Plaintiff to file and exc hange the AEIC. Plaintiff’s c ontumelious c onduc t c annot and will not be tolerated by this c ourt. 

11     It is to be noted that the AR had found the plaintiff’s c onduc t _prior to_ the making of the unless order of 7 September 2009 c ontumelious and intolerable. However, the AR did not refer to the ac tions the plaintiff had taken to c omply with the unless order of 7 September 2009, and did not make any finding that it was the result of the plaintiff’s c ontumely. That being the c ase, the failure of the plaintiff to appeal against the AR’s refusal to set aside the judgment entered c annot be regarded as its ac c eptanc e that its nonc omplianc e with the unless order was c ontumelious, and does not bar the plaintiff from asserting that it was not c ontumelious. 

12     The defendant’s applic ation to strike out the originating summons was heard on 14 July 2010, and dismissed on 22 July 2010. The defendant was not satisfied with the order, and brought the present appeal. 

**Preliminary issue** 

13     There is a preliminary issue of whether the present ac tion is based on the same c ause of ac tion as Suit 764. The defendant’s applic ation was founded on the c ontention that it was. The plaintiff, however, argued that it was not. 

14     This issue c an be dealt with quite simply. A c ause of ac tion is “[a] fac tual situation the existenc e of whic h entitles one person to obtain from the c ourt a remedy against another person” per Diploc k LJ, _Letang v Cooper_ [1965] 1 QB 232 at 242–243. It is c lear beyond sensible disagreement that both the ac tions brought by the plaintiff proc eeded on the defendant’s alleged trade mark infringement and passing off against the plaintiff’s “SUBWAY” trade mark. The plaintiff’s former attorney and inhouse c ounsel, Valerie Poc hron, had deposed in an affidavit filed on 2 July 2010 in the present ac tion that: 

 The Plaintiffs initiated a fresh proc eeding against the Defendant in OS No.462 of 2010/Q (“OS 462”) sinc e Suit 764 was never tried by the Court and thus remains unresolved, and that the Plaintiffs verily believe that there are substantial issues to be tried in this matter whic h were prevented from being heard in the Court due to proc edural defaults. 


The plaintiff’s c ontention that the present ac tion as a distinc t c ause of ac tion is a futile attempt to deny the simple fac t that it was the same c ause of ac tion, _ie_ , that the defendant’s use of the Subway Nic he trade mark was an infringement and passing off of the plaintiff’s SUBWAY trade mark. 

**The law** 

15     A party’s right to c ommenc e ac tion after a previous similar ac tion has been struc k out for the failure to c omply with a peremptory order has been disc ussed and settled by the Court of Appeal in _Changhe International Investments Pte Ltd (formerly known as Druidstone Pte Ltd) v Dexia BIL Asia Singapore Ltd (formerly known as Banque Internationale A Luxembourg BIL (Asia) Ltd)_ [2005] 3 SLR(R) 344 (“ _Changhe_ ”) where it held at [6]: 

 Sinc e the 1980s, it has been settled law that the c ourt has the disc retion to strike out an ac tion as an abuse of proc ess of the c ourt where there had been a failure by a litigant to c omply with a peremptory order of the c ourt in a previous ac tion. 

It referred to the landmark English dec isions in _Janov v Morris_ [1981] 1 WLR 1389 and _Samuels v Linzi Dresses Ltd_ [1981] QB 115 and the Court of Appeal’s dec ision in _Syed Mohamed Abdul Muthaliff v Arjan Bhisham Chotrani_ [1999] 1 SLR(R) 361 (“ _Syed Mohamed_ ”) and c onc luded at [11] that: 

 [I]t is established law that where a litigant, whose first ac tion has been struc k out for failure to c omply with a peremptory order, brings a sec ond suit based on the same c ause of ac tion, that sec ond suit may be struc k out as being an abuse of the proc ess of the c ourt unless the litigant c an give a proper explanation to establish that his failure to comply with the peremptory order was not c ontumelious. It should be noted that Tolley v Morris [[1979] 1 WLR 592] also stands for the princ iple that disobedienc e to a peremptory order would generally amount to c ontumelious c onduc t. 

 [emphasis added] 

16     In _Syed Mohamed_ the Court of Appeal gave thought to the meaning of “c ontumelious” and “c ontumac ious”. It referred to the judgment of Sir John Megaw in _Jokai Tea Holdings Ltd_ [1992] 1 WLR 1196 whic h went bac k to where the root words of “c ontumelious” and “c ontumac ious” were. The judge’s definition of “c ontumely” as “insolent reproac h or abuse” and “c ontumac y” as “perverse and obstinate resistanc e to authority” were ac c epted without qualific ation, and “c ontumelious” and “c ontumac ious” must be c onstrued in ac c ordanc e to those definitions. 

17     The Court of Appeal in _Changhe_ went on to add at [10] that: 

 [I]n c ases in whic h it had to dec ide what were to be the c onsequenc es of a failure to c omply with an unless order, the relevant question was whether suc h failure was intentional and c ontumelious. The c ourt should not be astute to find exc uses for suc h failure sinc e obedienc e to orders of the c ourt was the foundation on whic h its authority rested. The c rux of the matter was that the party seeking to esc ape the c onsequenc es of his default would have to show that the failure was not c ontumelious bec ause he had made positive efforts to c omply but was prevented from doing so by extraneous c irc umstanc es, and that he had no intention of ignoring or flouting the order. 

and the Court then found at [27] that the party would have to show that its disobedienc e in respec t of an earlier peremptory order was “not c ontumelious in that it was not intentional and arose from an extraneous c irc umstanc e over whic h [it] had no c ontrol.” 


 (a) 

 (b) 

18     The law c an be summarised as follows: 

 the disobedienc e of a peremptory order whic h resulted in the striking out of an ac tion would generally be regarded as c ontumelious, and 

 a party whose first ac tion has been struc k out for the failure to c omply with a peremptory order may bring a sec ond ac tion on the same c ause of ac tion if it c an show that the failure t o c omply with the peremptory order was not c ontumelious in the sense that it was not intentional and it arose from extraneous c irc umstanc es over whic h the party has no c ontrol. 

**The burden on the plaintiff** 

19     The plaintiff has the burden to show that its failure to c omply with the Order of Court of 7 September 2009 whic h led to the striking out of the first ac tion was not c ontumelious in that it was not intentional, and had arose from an extraneous c irc umstanc es over whic h it had no c ontrol. 

20     The burden on the plaintiff, or any party in a similar position, is to show that despite the earlier ac tion being struc k out, it should be allowed to proc eed with a sec ond ac tion. As the c ritic al fac tor is that the previous ac tion was struc k out bec ause of its failure to c omply with a peremptory order, the reason for that failure is the primary matter for c onsideration. I make this observation bec ause the defendant had referred to the c onduc t of the plaintiff before and leading to the making of the c onsent order of 26 August 2009 and the unless order of 7 September 2009. Under the law as set out in _Changhe_ , suc h matters are not relevant in determining whether the sec ond ac tion should also be struc k out. While they may have been taken into c onsideration for the making of the unless order, it is the _non-compliance with the unless order_ , and not the previous c onduc t, that led to the striking out of the ac tion. The Court of Appeal had made it c lear in _Changhe_ that the party had to explain its nonc omplianc e with the unless order (and only that order). 

**Has the plaintiff discharged the burden?** 

21     The plaintiff did not c omply with the unless order of 7 September 2009 to furnish the sec urity by noon 10 September 2009. The time for c omplianc e was only two and a half days, an unusually and imprac tic ally short time for the plaintiff in Americ a to arrange for a Singapore bank to issue the guarantee and for it to be delivered to the defendant’s solic itors. 

22     Valerie Poc hron affirmed an affidavit on 12 Oc tober 2009 in Suit 764 to explain the plaintiff’s failure to furnish the banker’s guarantee in time. In her affidavit, she deposed that: 

 I am verily advised by the Ac c ount Department of the Plaintiffs that the proc edure for in [sic ] order to obtain a bank guarantee in Singapore the estimated time frame is 4 to 5 weeks from request to c ompletion. 

and added that: 

 In this c ase, and as outlined above, the Plaintiffs have not been tardy or c ontumelious in respec t of obtaining the Banker’s guarantee. It is due to administrative diffic ulties that the Plaintiffs have not been able to c omply with the orders made by the learned Assistant Registrar. 

She also exhibited a banker’s guarantee issued by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation 


Limited to the defendant dated 18 September 2009 for the sum of $39,000.00. Counsel for the defendant pointed out that the guarantee in fac t did not take four to five weeks to be issued, and the guarantee of 18 September 2009 was obtained within nine days from the date of the unless order. 

23     It should also be noted that Valerie Poc hron did not state the time and the steps the plaintiff took to apply for the guarantee. The only evidenc e available is in her email to the plaintiff’s solic itors dated 9 September 2009 where she informed them: 

 Our ac c ounting department is working as best they c an, but are enc ountering issues with the bank and getting the additional funds into the Bank Guarantee. The funds are available, but needless to say it has not yet been transferred into the form of a Bank Guarantee. Our accounting department is doing everything it can to comply with the order , but I c annot be assured that it will be in plac e by the 10th. 

 [emphasis added] 

That c ould be the reason the guarantee was issued in nine days instead of four to five weeks. 

24     On the basis of the available evidenc e, I ac c ept that it was diffic ult for the plaintiff to c omply with the exc eptionally tight timeline imposed. The fac t that the plaintiff obtained the guarantee on 18 September 2009 is evidenc e that its failure to furnish the bank guarantee in time did not arise out of c ontumely, or even c ontumac y. 

25     The plaintiff’s willingness and readiness to furnish sec urity is further affirmed in an affidavit filed in the present proc eedings on 2 July 2010 by Max Ng, a direc tor of the law c orporation ac ting for the plaintiff, in whic h he c onfirmed that the plaintiff had plac ed with the c orporation $40,000.00 to ensure that should there be a similar requirement for sec urity, the plaintiff will be able to c omply in time. 

26     Against the bac kground of the evidenc e, I find that the plaintiff has shown that its failure to c omply with the unless order of 9 September 2009 did not arise from its c ontumely but bec ause of the very tight timeline. The plaintiff’s produc tion of the guarantee, albeit out of time, and the plac ement of $40,000.00 with its solic itors to ensure that it is able to c omply with any future order for sec urity c orroborated the plaintiff’s plea that it had always wanted to c omply with the unless order. 

**Conclusion** 

27     The plaintiff should be allowed to proc eed with its present ac tion so that the issues of trade mark infringement and passing off c an be determined on their merits. The failure to c omply with the unless order should not disentitle the plaintiff from proc eeding to have these matters determined. 

28     The defendant’s appeal is dismissed with c osts.
