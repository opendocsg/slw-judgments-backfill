Lai Siu Chiu J: 

1       These proc eedings c onc ern a dispute over the sale and purc hase of a property situated at No. 13, Jalan Sindor, Singapore (“the property”). Teo Beng Ngoh, Teo Yeow Khoon (“the sec ond vendor”), Teo Yeow Hing and Teo Jean Seng Holdings (“the developer”) were the sellers (“hereinafter they will be referred to c ollec tively as “the Vendors”) of the property while Quek Kheng Leong Nic ky (“the first defendant”) and Lee Pheng who are husband and wife respec tively (hereinafter c ollec tively referred to as “the Purc hasers”) were the buyers. In Originating Summons No. 1833 of 2007 (“the first OS”) the Vendors sued the Purc hasers while in Originating Summons No. 72 of 2008 (“the sec ond OS”), the Purc hasers were the plaintiffs. 

**The facts** 

2       The Purc hasers agreed to buy the property by an Option to Purc hase dated 26 May 2007 (“the Option”) at a c onsideration of $1.36m (“the purc hase pric e”). The Purc hasers paid 1% of the purc hase pric e amounting to $13,600/to sec ure the Option. The Purc hasers exerc ised the Option on 11 June 2007 by paying the sum of $54,400 equivalent to 4% of the purc hase pric e, to make up the requisite 5% deposit required to exerc ise the Option. 

3       The property is part of a development whic h c omprised of seven units of dwelling houses erec ted by the developer, under a joint venture with the other three vendors. Under the joint venture, five adjoining properties along Jalan Sindor were ac quired en bloc by the developer and subsequently redeveloped into seven new houses for resale (“the development”). In the proc ess, the lots of the five ac quired properties underwent amalgamation and subdivision in three phases. The property was sold by the Vendors to the Purc hasers before an individual subdivided lot number or Certific ate of Title (“CT”) was issued. 

4       The original lots numbers of the five ac quired properties were as follows: 

 Name of registered proprietor Address Lot (Mukim18) 


 Teo Yeow Hing 5 Jalan Sindor 2751 

 Teo Jean Seng Holdings Pte Ltd 7 Jalan Sindor 2752 

 Teo Jean Seng Holdings Pte Ltd 9 Jalan Sindor 2753 

 Teo Beng Ngoh 11, Jalan Sindor 2754 

 Teo Yeow Khoon 15, Jalan Sindor 2755 

5 (a) Under Phase 1 of the amalgamation proc ess, lots 2751, 2752 and 2753 (Nos. 5, 7 and 9 Jalan Sindor) were amalgamated and thereafter subdivided into 5 plots, to be developed as follows: 

 (i) Plots 1 to 4 (lots 16271L, 16272C, 16273M and 16274W 

 4 new terrac e houses were erec ted viz 5, 7, 9 and 9A Jalan Sindor. 

 (ii) Plot 5 (lot 16275V) 

 to be amalgamated with lot 2754 and part of lot 2755 (known as Plot 7) to form a single plot for development under Phase 3. 

 (b) Under Phase 2, lot 2755 (No 15 Jalan Sindor) was subdivided into 2 plots to be developed as follows: 

 (i) Plot 6 (lot 16276P) 

 One semi-detac hed house was erec ted viz a new No 15 Jalan Sindor 

 (ii) Plot 7 (16277T) 

 This was amalgamated with Plot 5 and lot 2754 (No 11 Jalan Sindor) to form a single plot for development under Phase 3 (see below). 

 (c ) Under Phase 3, Plot 5 (lot 16275V), Plot 7 (lot 16277T) and lot 2754 (No 11 Jalan Sindor) were amalgamated and subdivided into 2 plots, to be developed as follows: 

 (i) Plot 8 (lot 16842T) 

 One semi-detac hed house was erec ted viz a new No 11 Jalan Sindor 

 (ii) Plot 9 (lot 16843A) 

 One semi-detac hed house was erec ted viz a new No, 13 Jalan Sindor. 

6       The new No. 13 Jalan Sindor whic h has now been assigned a new lot number 16843A following phase 3 above, sits on the whole of the former lot 16277T and on part of the former lot 2754. The adjoining property whic h is the new No.11 Jalan Sindor sits on the other part of the former lot 2754 and the whole of the former lot 16275V.

8       Under c l 1 of the Option, the balanc e 95% of the c ontrac t pric e was payable as follows: 

 (a) within twelve (12) weeks from the date of exerc ise of the Option a sum representing 94% of the purc hase pric e shall be given to the Vendor in exc hange for vac ant possession of the property to be delivered by the Vendor to the Purc haser; 

 (b) the balanc e 1% shall be on legal c ompletion in ac c ordanc e with c lause 3 hereof. 


9       On 22 July 2007, at their request, the Purc hasers were given vac ant possession of the property by the Vendors for the purpose of c arrying out renovation works. Thereafter, the Purc hasers were given permission to oc c upy the property on 28 August 2007. Despite having given vac ant possession of the property on 22 July 2007, the Vendors did not request payment of 94% of the purc hase pric e until 15 Oc tober 2007. 

10     However, the Purc hasers refused to pay the required 94% ($1,278,000) of the purc hase pric e for the reason that there were c ertain c aveats lodged against the parent lots of the development in partic ular on lot 16275V by the purc hasers (and mortgagees) of the adjoining new No. 11 Jalan Sindor (hereinafter the c aveats will be referred to as “the Lot 16275 c aveats”). 

11     The Purc hasers’ solic itors had requested that the Lot 16275 c aveats be removed. In their letter dated 7 November 2007 to the Vendors’ solic itors; they wrote: 

 We refer to your letter dated 8 June 2007 whic h c onfirms that lot 16275V (ie together with lots 2754 and 16277) is a parent lot for lot 16843A whic h is the lot for No 13 Jalan Sindor. 

 Therefore, all c aveats whic h affec t the parent lots will similarly be reflec ted in the title for lot 16843A when the c ertific ate of title is issued. 

 Please proc ure the withdrawal of these c onflic ting c aveats as soon as possible. 

12     The Vendors’ solic itors disagreed with the Purc hasers’ interpretation of the Lot 16275 c aveats on the basis that lot 16275V against whic h those c aveats were filed did not form part of the property; it was pointed out that lot 16275V sat entirely on part of the adjoining property (No. 11 Jalan Sindor). 

13     Consequently, the Vendors’ solic itors demanded payment of 94% of the purc hase pric e on 28 September 2007 and again on 15 Oc tober 2007, 24 Oc tober 2007 and 9 November 2007, all to no avail. In their letter dated 24 Oc tober 2007, the Vendors’ solic itors also demanded that the Purc hasers return possession of the property by 29 Oc tober 2007, if payment was not made in ac c ordanc e with the Vendors’ solic itors’ previous notic e dated 15 Oc tober 2007. 

14     Purely out of goodwill as they said their c lients were not obliged to, the Vendors’ solic itors proc ured the Partial Withdrawals of Caveat of the lot 16275 c aveats by the purc hasers of No.11 Jalan Sindor and their c hargee/mortgagee viz the Central Provident Fund Board (“CPF Board”) and United Overseas Bank Ltd in relation to: 

 (a) that part of Lot 2754V Mukim 18 whic h formed part of the property; 

 (b) the whole of Lot 16843A Mukim 18 whic h was the new lot number for the property. 

15     In their last demand letter dated 9 November 2007, the Vendors’ solic itors gave notic e that unless payment of the requisite 94% of the purc hase pric e was made by the Purc hasers by noon of 12 November 2007, the Vendors would treat the Purc hasers’ refusal to make payment as a repudiation of the Option. In the same letter, it was stated that the Vendors would present the Purc hasers with good title to the property on c ompletion. 

16     The withdrawal of the Lot 16275 c aveats set out in [14] did not satisfy the Purc hasers’ solic itors. The Purc hasers did not make payment within the deadline stipulated by the Vendors’ solic itors as their solic itors insisted on the removal of the c aveat registered against the whole of 


Lot 16275V. Neither did the Purc hasers return possession of the property to the Vendors. 

17     The Vendors’ (new/present) solic itors then wrote a lengthy letter on 16 November 2007 to the Purc hasers’ solic itors pointing out that even if (whic h was denied), any of the Lot 16275 c aveats registered against lot 16275V were in c onflic t with the Purc hasers’ interest as buyers of the property, that did not absolve the Purc hasers from their obligation to pay 94% of the c ontrac t pric e whic h was to be in exc hange for vac ant possession. The Vendors’ obligation to transfer title of the property to the Purc hasers free from enc umbranc es only arose at the time of legal c ompletion. The solic itors added that it was wholly inappropriate and premature for the Purc hasers to raise any objec tions well before c ompletion. Consequently, the Vendors’ solic itors gave notic e of the Vendors’ ac c eptanc e of the Purc hasers’ repudiation of the Option as well as notic e of the termination of the Option with immediate effec t. The letter stressed that the parent lots of the property were Lots 2754V and 16277T not 16275V. The Vendors’ solic itors reinforc ed this argument by forwarding to the Purc hasers’ solic itors on 22 November 2007 a title searc h c onduc ted on Lot 16277T (on 16 November 2007) whic h showed no c aveats lodged against the property other than those of or on behalf of, the Purc hasers. 

18     In their reply dated 19 November 2007 to the letter in [17], the Purc hasers’ solic itors: 

 (a) disagreed that the Purc hasers’ non-payment up to then amounted to repudiation of the agreement for sale and purc hase; 

 (b) reiterated that the Lot 16275 c aveats c onflic ted with the Purc hasers’ rights as buyers 

but noted that the Lot 16275 c aveats and all enc umbranc es would be removed at legal c ompletion. The Purc hasers’ solic itors also enc losed two c ashier’s orders one dated 7 November 2007 in the sum of $204,000 and the other dated 9 November 2007 in the sum of $1,074,400. The two amounts totalled he c ompletion sum of $1,278,400 and were in favour of the developer. 

19     The Vendors’ solic itors rejec ted the payment; they returned the two c ashier’s orders to the Purc hasers’ solic itors on 21 November 2007 for the reason that the Option had already been terminated on 16 November 2007. The Vendors’ solic itors demanded that the Purc hasers reinstate the property to its original c ondition and deliver vac ant possession to the Vendors by 30 November 2007 failing whic h legal proc eedings would be c ommenc ed to c ompel the Purc hasers to do so. 

20     The Purc hasers refused to reinstate the property and failed to deliver vac ant possession of it to the Vendors within the deadline stipulated by the Vendors’ solic itors or at all. In fac t, they c ontinue to reside there to this day. 

21     The CT for the property (Volume 653 Folio 163) was issued on 22 January 2008 without the Lot 16275 c aveats endorsed as enc umbranc es thereon. In fac t the only c aveats that appeared on the CT were those lodged by the Purc hasers on 12 June 2007 and those of their c hargee and mortgagee, viz the CPF Board and Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation Limited respec tively. 

**The proceedings** 

22     In the first OS, the Vendors c laimed against the Purc hasers for: 

 (a) a dec laration that the Purc hasers were in repudiatory breac h of the Option in failing, refusing and/or neglec ting to make timeous payment of the sum of $1,278,400 being 94% of the purc hase pric e of the property, in ac c ordanc e with c l 1(a) of the Option; 


 (b) a dec laration that the Vendors were entitled to ac c ept and had ac c epted the Purc hasers’ breac h of the Option and had validly terminated the Option with effec t from 16 November 2007 by reason of suc h repudiatory breac h; 

 (c ) an order that the Purc hasers forthwith reinstate the property to its original c ondition and deliver vac ant possession to the Vendors; 

 (d) that the Purc hasers pay damages to the Vendors to be assessed. 

23     In the sec ond OS, the Purc hasers sought spec ific performanc e from the Vendors of the Option (whic h they said had been varied by three letters exc hanged between the parties’ solic itors) and c laimed damages for breac h of c ontrac t. Both OS were dealt with simultaneously for expedienc y. 

24     At the c onc lusion of the hearing, I granted the Vendors’ applic ation as per prayers (a) and (b) of the first OS with anc illary orders (see [59] below) and dismissed the sec ond OS. The Purc hasers have now filed notic es of appeal (in Civil Appeals No. 122 and 121 of 2008 respec tively) against my dec ision. 

**The issues** 

25     The main issue that the c ourt had to determine was whether the Purc hasers were in repudiatory breac h of the Option in: (i) not making payment within the deadline stipulated by the Vendors and (ii) in seeking to impose a c ondition that the Vendors remove the c aveats registered by the purc hasers and mortgagees of the adjoining property No. 11 Jalan Sindor against lot 16275V (whic h was not the parent lot of the property). The sec ondary issue was whether (as the Purc hasers c ontended) the c aveats registered by the purc hasers and mortgagees of No. 11 Jalan Sindor against lot 16275V c onflic ted with the Purc hasers’ interest in the property. 

26     Affidavits for the first OS (whic h were adopted for the sec ond OS), were filed by the sec ond vendor and by the Vendors’ (previous) solic itors while the first defendant and the Purc hasers’ (previous) solic itors filed affidavits on behalf of the Purc hasers. It will not be nec essary to look at the affidavits in detail for the reason that the fac ts and the opposing stands taken by the parties have already been set out in the foregoing paragraphs. My only c omment is that while the Vendors’ solic itor in his affidavit gave a detailed ac c ount of what transpired in his telephone c onversations with the Purc hasers’ solic itor, the latter (who filed two affidavits) c ould only depose (in her sec ond affidavit) to the best of her rec ollec tion what was said between them, when her version of events was c hallenged by the former. 

_The expert’s opinion_ 

27     With the c onsent of the parties, Miss Phyllis Tan (“Miss Tan”) an experienc ed prac titioner was appointed as the expert witness on c onveyanc ing prac tic e in Singapore. Miss Tan (EW1) was c rossexamined by c ounsel for the Purc hasers on her opinion dated 22 July 2008(“the Opinion”) whic h in essenc e supported the position adopted by the Vendors’ solic itors. 

28     After she had set out the salient fac ts in paras 1 to 5 in the Opinion, Miss Tan framed the issue as follows: 

 6 I am asked my opinion as a c onveyanc er whether I take the view of the Purc hasers solic itors that the c aveats, if not removed at the time the Vendor requested for payment of the 94% meant that the Vendor c ould not give the Purc hasers a good title to the property as the 


 c aveats would be c onsidered enc umbranc es on the property. 

29     Miss Tan then gave the following views in the remaining paragraphs of the Opinion: 

 7 It is c lear from the Contrac t that the Purc hasers are to pay the Vendor 94% of the purc hase pric e on being given vac ant possession of the property within 12 weeks from the exerc ise of the Option. The Option was exerc ised on 11 June 2007 bringing the last date for vac ant possession to be given to 3rd September 2007. 

 8 Vac ant possession was given on 22 July 2007 and payment of the 94% should have been made then “in exc hange”. 

 9 By letter to the Purc hasers’ solic itors dated 15 Oc tober 2007 and by another letter dated 9 November 2007 the Vendor’s solic itors requested payment of the 94% “whic h was due and payable on 29 Oc tober 2007. 

 10 The Purc hasers refused to pay unless the c aveats lodged against the parent lots were withdrawn. The Purc hasers’ reason for not paying was that the title was enc umbered with the c aveats and unless removed the Vendor c ould not give the Purc hasers a good title to the property i.e a title free from enc umbranc es. 

 11 I am of the opinion that the objec tion to the title is premature. It is established law that so long as a vendor is able to give a purc haser good title on the date of c ompletion he will have performed his part of the bargain for the c ontrac t of the land to a purc haser. 

 Addendum 

 My opinion is based on the fac ts provided in the Bac kground of Fac ts set out in the Appendix whic h makes no mention of the variation of the terms of the Option-Contrac t. 

 The variation is referred to in:

 i the Purc hasers’ solic itors’ letter dated 9 November 2007 

 “Please note that the agreement c reated by the duly exerc ised Option between the parties was varied by the terms set out in our letter to your firm dated 20 August 2007 and your firm’s reply on 27 August 2007.” 

 ii the letter dated 19 November 2007 from Purc hasers’ solic itors to Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC -3rd paragraph item (b). 

 It is noted also that the Purc hasers have at no time repudiated the Contrac t and that the Vendor has resc inded the same due to the Purc hasers’ breac h in not paying the 94% after having been given vac ant possession of the property. 

 The remedy of restitution does not entitle the Vendor to damages exc ept in spec ial c irc umstanc es. The objec t of resc ission is to restore the parties to their original positions: the Vendor refunding the Purc hasers the 5% deposit and the Purc hasers returning the property to the Vendor in its original state. 

**_The submissions_** 


30     Before I set out the reasons for my findings, I shall first refer briefly to the submissions tendered by the parties, starting with those presented for the Purc hasers. 

_(i) the Purchasers’ arguments_ 

31     Counsel for the Purc hasers submitted that prior to the Vendors’ solic itors’ letter dated 9 November 2007, the Vendors’ solic itors had not made time the essenc e for payment. Their letter dated 15 Oc tober 2007 merely requested payment of 94% of the purc hase pric e within two weeks; that did not _ipso facto_ make time of the essenc e for payment. By the Vendors’ solic itors’ follow-up letter dated 31 Oc tober 2007, the Vendors merely reserved their rights to c harge reasonable rent for the Purc hasers’ c ontinued oc c upation of the property, after the Purc hasers failed to pay by 29 Oc tober 2007 (to whic h the response from the Purc hasers’ solic itors was to the effec t that the Vendors were not entitled to c harge rent). So time as the essenc e for payment was only made known to the Purc hasers for the first time on 9 November 2007. Letters sent after 31 Oc tober 2007 and before 9 November 2007 by the Vendors’ solic itors were merely reminders for payment. 

32     Counsel c omplained that it was unreasonable of the Vendors to give notic e on Friday 9 November 2007 that they required payment by the following Monday 12 November 2007. He c ited the UK Court of Appeal c ase of _Behzadi v Shaftesbury Hotels Ltd_ [1991] 2 All ER 477 (“ _Behzadi’s_ c ase”) to reinforc e his argument. 

_(ii) the Vendors’ arguments_ 

33     Counsel for the Vendors pointed out that while the Purc hasers had taken possession of and enjoyed oc c upation of the property after paying only 5% of the purc hase pric e, they unreasonably insisted on an impossible c ondition to fulfil (removal of the c aveat on the parent lot) to deny the Vendors rec eipt of 94% of the purc hase pric e. The Vendors’ stand that the lodgement of the Lot 16275 c aveats did not affec t their ability to deliver a good title to the Purc hasers was vindic ated in that the CT that was eventually issued on 22 January 2008 reflec ted no enc umbranc es on the title (save for the c aveats lodged by the Purc hasers and their c hargee/mortgagee). Consequently, the Purc hasers were c learly in breac h of the payment terms under the Option (see [8]) and the Vendors were entitled to treat their non-payment as repudiation of the Option. 

34     Counsel for the Vendors took issue with the Purc hasers’ c ontention that time was not made the essenc e of payment by the Vendors before 9 November 2007. He drew the c ourt’s attention to the Vendors’ solic itors’ earlier letter dated 24 Oc tober 2007 to the Purc hasers’ solic itors whic h paras 2 and 3 stated: 

 Our c lients have, on a stric tly without prejudic e basis and in good faith, made every effort to ac c ommodate your c lients’ request and we take the view that all areas of c onc ern has been addressed in the manner you have requested. We are therefore surprised with the c ontents of your last letter indic ating that you are not in a position to abide by the deadline of 29 Oc tober 2007. 

 Stric tly without prejudic e to the rights of our c lients, pending the issues allegedly unresolved, our c lients hereby demand that your c lients return possession of the property immediately by the 29 Oc tober 2007 if payment is not made in ac c ordanc e with our notic e of 15 Oc tober 2007. 

It was c lear from the above extrac ts that the Vendors’ solic itors had indeed made time the essenc e of payment. 


35     Counsel for the Vendors further rebutted his opponent’s c omplaint on the unreasonably short period (over a weekend) in whic h the Purc hasers were required to make the 94% payment. He pointed out that in the first affidavit filed by the Purc hasers’ own solic itors, she had deposed that the c ashier’s order from the CPF Board was ready by 7 November 2007 (although it was not forwarded to the Purc hasers’ solic itors by the CPF Board’s solic itors until Monday 19 November 2007). 

36     Counsel for the Vendors then posed the question to the c ourt – what had the Vendors done to the Purc hasers that was so inequitable and unc onsc ionable as to deny the Vendors their remedies for breac h of c ontrac t on the part of the Purc hasers? He pointed to the inequities of the situation. The Vendors’ solic itors had done their best to ac c ommodate the Purc hasers’ demands to the extent of even agreeing to proc ure the withdrawal of c aveats of the neighbouring lot before c ompletion. The Vendors’ solic itors proc ured the removal of c aveats on the middle lot 2754 and the Purc hasers’ solic itors then assured his c lients on 1 November 2007 that they would let the Vendors have payment as soon as possible. Six days later, the Purc hasers’ solic itors did a _volte face_ on the basis that there were further c aveats filed on the parent lot whic h c onflic ted with the Vendors’ title even though they did not affec t the Vendors’ CT. The Purc hasers had fooled the Vendors into c omplying with their demands. 

37     Counsel for the Vendors ac c used the Purc hasers of being high-handed. Having taken possession of the property on 22 July 2007 and having paid only 5% of the purc hase pric e at that stage, they then c ame up with unmeritorious c laims when it c ame to paying a further 94% of the purc hase pric e. In support of his c omplaint that the Purc hasers’ c onduc t had been less than forthright, Mr Ling referred to the Purc hasers’ solic itors’ letter dated 23 Oc tober 2007 to the Vendors’ solic itors. There, the Purc hasers’ solic itors said: 

 Please note that the irregularities prevent the release of both CPF Funds and the housing loan of the purc hase pric e required by yourselves i.e. title is, simply, not in order. 

Yet, on 19 November 2007, having been informed by the Vendors’ solic itors that their c lients had repudiated the Option, the Purc hasers’ solic itors tendered the two c ashier’s orders in [18] notwithstanding that the ‘irregularities’ remained. It c alled into question the _bona fides_ of the Purc hasers’ objec tions. 

38     Earlier [23], in referring to the sec ond OS, I had stated that the Purc hasers had c laimed that the c ontrac t as evidenc ed in the Option had been varied by three letters; these were: 

 (a) a “without prejudic e” letter dated 20 August 2007 from the Purc hasers’ solic itors to the Vendors’ solic itors; 

 (b) a letter dated 27 August 2007 from the Vendors’ solic itors to the Purc hasers’ solic itors, and 

 (c ) a letter dated 28 August 2007 from the Purc hasers’ solic itors to the Vendors’ solic itors. 

39     In the affidavit filed by the Vendors’ solic itor who handled the abortive c onveyanc e, he had objec ted to the referenc e by the Purc hasers’ solic itor in her first affidavit to the letters in (a) and (b) above as, (a) was c learly marked “without prejudic e”, while the reply in (b) was similarly written in the same vein. It was a valid objec tion raised by the Purc hasers. Consequently I ignored the Purc hasers’ referenc e to the letters in (a) and (b). As for (c ), the Purc hasers’ solic itors’ letter dated 28 August 2007 states:

 Thank you for your letter dated 27 August 2007. 


 Notwithstanding the postponement we trust that the Vendor is attending to all matters nec essary to regularise all outstanding issues expeditiously. 

 Further, we note from your letter that our c lients were granted vac ant possession with effec t from 22 July 2007. However, the enc losed letter of undertaking refers spec ific ally to possession for the purposes of renovation works only. Please c onfirm as soon as possible that our c lients may oc c upy the property henc eforth. 

40     As it was not disputed that vac ant possession of the property was handed to the Purc hasers on 22 July 2007 for renovation purposes and subsequently for oc c upation on 22 August 2007 (see [9]), the question of variation of the Option by the above letter has no bearing on the issues that c ame up for determination. In any c ase, c ross-examination of Miss Tan by c ounsel for the Purc hasers revealed she had indeed taken into ac c ount the “without prejudic e” letter (at 2AB 67) in (a) in the Opinion and the same did not c hange her view. 

**_The decision_** 

41     Based on the fac ts (whic h were largely undisputed) as extrac ted from the affidavits and the Opinion in [27] to [29] together with Miss Tan’s c ross-examination, I was of the view that it was the Purc hasers not the Vendors, who had breac hed the terms of the Option and whose repudiation of the c ontrac t had been ac c epted by the Vendors. To adopt Miss Tan’s language in the Opinion, the Purc hasers’ objec tions (as c onveyed through their solic itors) to the existenc e of the Lot 16275 c aveats was “premature”. The Purc hasers c ontinued to adopt an unreasonable stand, notwithstanding the fac t that the Vendors’ solic itors arranged for the owner and mortgagees of No. 11 Jalan Sindor to file Partial Withdrawals of the Lot 16275 c aveats pertaining to Lot 16843A ( _viz_ that of the property) on 1 November 2007. As early as 21 August 2007 (see 1AB54), the Vendors’ solic itors had informed the Purc hasers’ solic itors that the c aveats lodged against the property belonged to the purc hasers of No. 11 Jalan Sindor and their respec tive c hargee and mortgagee. 

42     The Vendors’ solic itors (and c urrent c ounsel) had c onsistently informed his c ounterpart for the Purc hasers in their exc hange of c orrespondenc e that the Vendors would deliver to the Purc hasers good title to the property free from enc umbranc es upon c ompletion. This assuranc e did not satisfy the Purc hasers’ solic itors who c ontinued to maintain an unreasonable stand. 

43     I should point out that although the Purc hasers’ solic itors demanded that the Vendors proc ure the withdrawal of the c aveats on the parent lot (16275V Mukim 18) before c ompletion, the Purc hasers themselves lodged c aveats on 23 Oc tober 2007 over lot 16275V oc c upied by No 11 Jalan Sindor. 

44     The Purc hasers’ c omplaint in [32] that the Vendors’ solic itors’ letter dated 9 November 2007 requiring payment of the 94% in three days over a weekend was too short was not borne out in the reply from the Purc hasers’ solic itors whic h full test I set out below: 

 We refer to your letter today. 

 We reiterate our letter dated 7 November 2007. 

 Please note that the agreement c reated by the duly exerc ised option between the parties was varied by the terms set out in our letter to your firm dated 20 August 2007 and your firm’s reply on 27 August 2007. 


 Ac c ordingly, we do not agree that our c lients are in breac h, nor would they be in breac h if they fail to meet the deadline set out in your letter today. We reserve our c lients’ rights ac c ordingly. 

 Please proc ure the withdrawal of the Caveats registered against the whole of the parent lot 16275V Mukim 18 insofar as they affec t our c lients’ property as soon as possible. Until then we regret we c annot ac c ept that any liability for payment has arisen. 

There was no c omplaint that the notic e period for payment was too short nor was there a request for an extension of time to make payment. 

45     Muc h was made by the Purc hasers’ solic itor (in her first affidavit) that the objec tion to the Vendors’ lac k of good title c ame from the solic itors of the CPF Board. Unfortunately, save for one letter dated 16 August 2007 (at 1AB 50) from the CPF Board’s solic itors (Aptus Law Corporation), no c orrespondenc e between the Purc hasers’ solic itors and the CPF Board’s solic itors was produc ed to lend c redenc e to this exc use and/or to disprove the suspic ion that the Purc hasers’ solic itors were not the ones who were being diffic ult. 

46     In the aforesaid letter, Aptus Law Corporation requested the c hild lot number of the property and c onfirmation that the same was ‘live’ in the lot base system. On 27 September 2007, the Chief Surveyor of the Singapore Land Authority emailed the developer’s c hartered surveyor to advise that the new lot number alloc ated to No 13 Jalan Sindor had been made ‘live’ in the lot base system. In turn the c hartered surveyors informed the Vendors’ solic itors that Lot 16843A Mukim 18 was No 13 Jalan Sindor while Lot 16842T Mukim 18 was No 11 Jalan Sindor. On the following day, the Vendors’ solic itors duly c onveyed the information to the Purc hasers’ solic itors. In that same letter dated 28 September 2007, the Vendors’ solic itors requested for payment of the 94% of the purc hase pric e from the Purc hasers. The immediate response from the Purc hasers’ solic itors was that their searc h did not show that the two lot numbers were ‘live’. On 15 Oc tober 2007, the Vendors’ solic itors responded to say that Lot 16843A had been made ‘live’. They repeated their request for payment of 94% of the purc hase pric e. Thereafter nothing more was said about the new Lot number (16843A) as the foc us of the parties’ arguments c entred on the withdrawal of the lot 16275 c aveats filed by the purc hasers of No. 11 Jalan Sindor. 

_The law_ 

47     I noted that Miss Tan’s testimony and her views in the Opinion (whic h c ounsel for the Purc hasers did not c hallenge or question) vindic ated the Vendors. I had pointed out more than onc e to c ounsel for the Purc hasers in the c ourse of the proc eedings, that his c lients wanted c ompletion but always on their terms, not in ac c ordanc e with the Option. The Purc hasers’ inflexible stand c ompletely ignored the fac t (as the Vendors submitted) that their predic ament was of their own making. On the authority of suc h c ases as _See Bee Hoon v Quah Poe Hoe_ [1989] SLR 639, _Siti & Anor v Lee Kay Li_ <span class="citation">[1996] 3 SLR 310</span> and _Tian Teck Construction Pte Ltd v Exclusiv Auto Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR 390</span>, the Purc hasers were in repudiatory breac h of the Option when their solic itors’ letter dated 7 November 2007 (see [44]) insisted their liability for payment had not arisen, thereby evinc ing an intention not to be bound by the terms of the Option. 

48     The Purc hasers’ c laim in the sec ond OS was for spec ific performanc e of the Option. It is trite law that spec ific performanc e is an equitable relief and equitable remedies are disc retionary. It is also axiomatic that he who c omes into equity must c ome with c lean hands and that he who seeks equity must do equity. Above all, equity ac ts on the c onsc ienc e. 

_Relief against forfeiture_ 


49     Even after I had dismissed the c laim for spec ific performanc e in the sec ond OS, c ounsel applied for the Purc hasers to be granted relief against forfeiture, repeated Purc hasers’ desire to be allowed to retain the property and c ompletely ignored the fac t that the Purc hasers had already repudiated the Option whic h repudiation the Vendors had ac c epted. This was yet another example of the Purc hasers’ unreasonable c onduc t. 

50     Relief against forfeiture for leases is provided for under s 18A of the Conveyanc ing & Law of Property Ac t (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed) (“the CLPA”) whic h provision states: 

 Relief against forfeiture by action for non-payment of rent. 

 (1) This sec tion has effec t where a lessor is proc eeding by ac tion to enforc e against a lessee a right of re-entry or forfeiture in respec t of any immovable property for non-payment of rent. 

 (2) If, within the time presc ribed by rules of c ourt for ac knowledging servic e of the writ by whic h the ac tion was c ommenc ed, the lessee pays into c ourt all the rent in arrear and the c osts of the ac tion, the ac tion shall c ease, and the lessee shall hold the land ac c ording to the lease without any new lease. 

51     The Vendors’ c ounsel had argued (arguments whic h I ac c epted) that bec ause of their c onduc t, the Purc hasers were not entitled to the c ourt’s sympathy let alone that they should be granted relief against forfeiture, the reason being (drawing a parallel with s 18A of the CLPA) that they had not made payment into c ourt. He added that the authorities c ited by the Purc hasers’ c ounsel viz _Behzadi’s_ c ase ([32] _supra_ ) and _Pacific Rim Investments Pte Ltd v Lam Seng Tong & Anor_ <span class="citation">[1995] 3 SLR 1</span> (“ _Pacific Rim_ ”) in support of his arguments were not in point. I did not think the c ases were helpful to the Purc hasers’ c ase as c an be seen from their fac ts set out below. 

52     In _Behzadi’s_ c ase, c ontrac ts for the purc hase of a London hotel were exc hanged between the purc haser/appellant and the vendor/respondent on 20 June with a deposit of £120,000 payable on or before 4 July (whic h was paid) and c ompletion sc heduled for 31 August. On 22 June, the purc haser requested the vendor to deduc e title by supplying her with offic e c opy entries, file plan and the vendor’s authority to inspec t the register. The vendor c ould not c omply with the request bec ause of delay by the Land Registry. The purc haser repeated the request several times and eventually on 30 August gave notic e making time of the essenc e and giving the vendor seven days to deduc e title. On 7 September the purc haser gave notic e resc inding the c ontrac t and requested the return of the deposit. The vendor refused to return the deposit c laiming that the purc haser was not entitled to resc ind the c ontrac t and had therefore forfeited the deposit. On 12 September, the purc haser issued an originating summons c laiming a dec laration that she had been entitled to resc ind the c ontrac t and an order that for the return of the deposit. 

53     The judge held that the vendor had not been guilty of unreasonable delay by the time that the purc haser served the notic e of 30 August and that the seven-day period within whic h she then required title to be deduc ed was unreasonable. He c onc luded that the purc haser had not been entitled to resc ind the c ontrac t and that she c ould not rec over her deposit. The purc haser’s appeal was dismissed. 

54     _Behzadi’s_ c ase has no applic ation bec ause as pointed out earlier at [34], the vendors’ solic itors gave notic e on 24 Oc tober 2007 that if payment was not made by 29 Oc tober 2007 (the deadline of 2 weeks stated in their earlier letter dated 15 Oc tober 2007), they required return of possession of the property. Time had therefore been made the essenc e of the c ontrac t on 29 Oc tober 2007. This was followed by the vendors’ solic itors’ letter dated 9 November 2007 requiring payment by Monday 


12 November 2007. The notic e period of 17 days (24 Oc tober–12 November 2007) c annot by any standards be said to be unreasonably short, partic ularly as one of the c heques ($204,000) for c ompletion was dated 7 November 2007 and presumably had been ready even before the vendors’ solic itors’ letter dated 9 November 2007. It bears remembering that the vendors’ solic itors had c hased for payment four times altogether (see [13]). 

5       5 _Pacific Rim_ likewise involved a sale and purc hase agreement of a property that was under c onstruc tion. By c l 3, payment of the purc hase pric e by instalments had to be made within 14 days after rec eipt of a notic e from the vendor/appellant that a partic ular stage of c onstruc tion had been reac hed. Interest was payable on late payments of the instalments of the purc hase pric e. Under c l 4, time was made the essenc e of the c ontrac t. By c l 5(1), if any of the instalments were unpaid for any period in exc ess of 14 days after the expiry of the period stated in the notic e, the vendor was entitled to give the purc hasers a further notic e of its intention to treat the agreement as being repudiated by the purc hasers and upon the expiry of the notic e, the agreement would be annulled. By c l 11, the vendor was required to deliver vac ant possession to the purc hasers on or before 30 September 1993. In the event of delay, liquidated damages were payable by the vendor. 

56     The vendor did not give notic e of possession until 10 Dec ember 1993, at the same time it asked for payment of 20% of the purc hase pric e ($200,000) by 24 Dec ember 1993. The purc hasers failed to pay by the deadline whereupon the vendor gave notic e on 5 January 1994 to c omplete the purc hase by 19 January 1994. The purc hasers made part-payment of $100,000 to the vendor on 8 January 

1994\. On 10 January 1994, the vendor served a notic e under c l 5(1) expiring on 25 January 1994 demanding payment of the balanc e instalment and interest. On 12 January 1994, the purc hasers paid the balanc e $100,000. On 18 January 1994 the purc hasers wrote to inform the vendor that they had dec ided to set off the interest of about $900 against liquidated damages payable by the vendor (subsequently quantified at $13,616.38). The vendor did not agree. Completion did not take plac e on 19 January 1994 and on 25 January 1994, the vendor informed the purc hasers that the agreement had been annulled. The trial judge granted the purc hasers’ applic ation for spec ific performanc e of the sale and purc hase agreement. 

57     The Court of Appeal dismissed the vendor’s appeal holding _inter alia_ , that the vendors’ purported termination was based on c l 5(1) notic e in respec t of the purc hasers’ failure to pay the interest on the late payment of the instalment due under c l 3(1)(h), not on the failure to c omplete the purc hase. The vendor was not entitled to treat the agreement as having been repudiated by the purc hasers’ failure to pay the amount due on c ompletion. It was further held that the Court had jurisdic tion to grant relief against forfeiture of an interest in land where there was a breac h of a c ontrac tual provision as to payment, in respec t of whic h time was of the essenc e but it would not ordinarily c ountenanc e a departure from c ontrac tual rights and obligations. _To invoke successfully the court’s jurisdiction, the circumstances of the case must be exceptional and must also reveal elements of unconscionability and injustice_ (emphasis added). 

58     As stated earlier, the Purc hasers’ c onduc t did not warrant the c ourt extending sympathy to them let alone granting them relief against forfeiture. I rejec ted their c ounsel’s argument that it would be unc onsc ionable and unjust to forc e the Purc hasers to reinstate the property and return possession to the Vendors when they had only paid 5% of the purc hase pric e, lived there rent-free for more than a year and rejec ted the Vendors’ request for rent when c ompletion did not take plac e as sc heduled, when their predic ament was of their own doing. 

59     Even so, I gave the undeserving Purc hasers an opportunity to remedy their breac h and granted them relief against forfeiture on terms. I disallowed the Vendors’ prayer for reinstatement of the property to its original c ondition (see [22(c )]) but granted them damages under para (d) of [22] being 


the differenc e between the c ontrac t pric e and the valuation of the property as at 16 November 2007 (the date of the repudiatory breac h). I further granted the Purc hasers relief against forfeiture on the following c onditions:

 A. The Purc hasers would pay the Vendors all outgoings of the property from 22 July 2007 to 16 November 2007 plus rental from 16 November 2007 to the date for c ompletion for whic h the Vendors would on Monday 4 August 2008 give notic e to the Purc hasers, pursuant to c lause 6(a) of the Option. 

 B. In the event the Purc hasers failed to ac c ept the terms for relief against forfeiture and failed to c omplete the sale and purc hase as ordered (whic h would be subjec t to the Law Soc iety’s Conditions of Sale, save that the 21 days’ notic e to c omplete under Condition 29. would not apply) the Vendors were at liberty to resell the property in the open market and the Purc hasers would then be liable to the Vendors for damages to be assessed by the Registrar, suc h damages to be the differenc e between the purc hase pric e and the market pric e that the Vendors would have obtained as of 16 November 2007. 

**_Costs_** 

60     The parties had exc hanged Offers to Settle (“OTS”) pursuant to Order 22A (“O 22A”) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed). The Vendors’ two OTS were dated 31 January 2008 while the Purc hasers’ OTS was dated 23 July 2008. 

61     The Vendors’ OTS required the Purc hasers to c onsent to judgment in terms of the first OS and to disc ontinue the sec ond OS against and pay c osts to, the Vendors. The Purc hasers’ OTS required the Vendors to allow the Purc hasers to c omplete the purc hase of the property within three weeks by payment of $1,292,000 and a goodwill sum of $3,152.25. The proc eedings in both OS were to be disc ontinued with eac h party bearing its own c osts. The Purc hasers’ c ounsel argued that the Vendors’ OTS did not offer any c ompromise at all and he was not relying on the OTS of his c lients. The Vendors’ c ounsel c ountered that his c lients’ two OTS were genuine. Although both OTS were open for ac c eptanc e for 14 days only, it was obvious from the Purc hasers’ OTS that they would not have ac c epted even if the Vendors’ two OTS were open for ac c eptanc e until trial. 

62     After hearing the parties’ arguments, I dec ided against granting indemnity c osts to the Vendors. I awarded them c osts on a standard basis in the first OS but allowed them disbursements on a full indemnity basis against the Purc hasers inc luding the c osts of Miss Tan as the expert witness. I awarded no c osts for dismissal of the sec ond OS but similarly allowed the Vendors all reasonable disbursements inc urred therein.
