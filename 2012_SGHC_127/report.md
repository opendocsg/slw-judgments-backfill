**Belinda Ang Saw Ean J:** 

**Introduction** 

1       The parties, Mr Wong Kien Keong (“the Plaintiff”) and Mdm Khoo Hoon Eng (“the Defendant”), divorc ed after more than 28 years of marriage. Before the hearing of the anc illary proc eedings relating to the maintenanc e and the division of the matrimonial assets, the Defendant filed Summons No 1553 of 2011 (“SUM 1553/2011”) for an order that a Deed of Separation dated 28 Marc h 2003 entered into by the parties (“the Deed”) be set aside or, in the alternative, for a dec laration that the same is void and unenforc eable. 

**Chronology of procedural applications** 

2       SUM 1553/2011 was dismissed on 21 Marc h 2012. I held that there were no vitiating fac tors to invalidate the Deed. As suc h, it was a valid agreement and the Deed would be a fac tor to be taken int o c onsideration in the division of the matrimonial assets pursuant to s 112(2)(e) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”). 

3       The hearing of the anc illary matters started immediately after my dec ision on SUM 1553/2011. I asked c ounsel for the Defendant, Ms Suc hitra Ragupathy (“Ms Ragupathy”), to explain why the terms of the Deed should be given little weight. In other words, what were the Defendant’s reasons for maintaining that the division of the matrimonial assets in the Deed was disadvantageous to the Defendant, and how was it unreasonable in the c irc umstanc es of this present c ase? I also wanted to know how muc h the Defendant was getting under the Deed – was it 20% of the total assets as indic at ed in the Plaintiff’s e-mail of 21 Marc h 2003 (see [32] below), or at least 40% of the 

matrimonial assets as stated in the Plaintiff’s affidavit of 9 Dec ember 2010. [note: 1] It turned out to be a fairly short hearing as there was no affidavit evidenc e on the purc hase pric e of the properties and the financ ial c ontributions eac h had made to c omplete the sale and purc hase of the properties. An adjournment of the hearing was granted to enable the parties to provide the missing information. 

4       At that point, Ms Ragupathy, who was understandably keen not to be c aught “out of time” if 


the Defendant wished to appeal, expressed c onc ern that given the time required for lodging an appeal against my dec ision in SUM 1553/2011 and that the anc illary proc eedings would not be c onc luded within a month with the adjournment. Ordinarily, pursuant to O 57 r 4(a) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”), the Defendant has to file and serve her Notic e of Appeal within one month from the date of dismissal of SUM 1553/2011 ( _ie_ , 21 Marc h 2012), if she wishes to appeal. Counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Randolph Khoo (“Mr Khoo”), had no objec tion with an order for the time for lodging an appeal against my dec ision on SUM 1553/2011 to run after a dec ision on the anc illaries was made. 

5       Therefore, I exerc ised my power under O 57 r 17 of the ROC and ordered that the time for appeal in respec t of SUM 1553/2011 was to run from the time of the orders for the anc illary matters. The intention was c lear: in the event of an appeal to the Court of Appeal, both SUM 1553/2011 and the orders made on the anc illary matters should go up on appeal together and at the same time. Henc e, the exac t wording of my order, as it appears in the Notes of Arguments, is as follows: 

 Time will run from the time the division of matrimonial assets is dec ided. 

6       On 3 April 2012, Ms Ragupathy filed the Defendant’s Notic e of Appeal against the dismissal of SUM 1553/2011 _vide_ CA 32 of 2012/S (“CA 32/2012”). On 18 April 2012, Ms Ragupathy filed Summons No 1904 of 2012 (“SUM 1904/2012”) to stay the anc illary proc eedings pending the outc ome of CA 32/2012. SUM 1904/2012 has not yet been heard. I should mention that allied to SUM 1904/2012 is the question of whether CA 32/2012 was filed prematurely. Needless to say, these matters will be fully argued when SUM 1904/2012 is next listed for hearing before me. 

7       For now, I will explain in detail the reasons for the dismissal of SUM 1553/2011. 

**The Parties to the Deed** 

8       The parties were married on 10 Dec ember 1977 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. They have two sons to the marriage. Their sons are now 27 and 30 years old respec tively. The parties are highly educ ated, bright and ac c omplished individuals. They have been extremely suc c essful in their respec tive c areers, and they c ontinue to do well. By all c ounts, they were an exc eptional c ouple. The Plaintiff is a well-known legal personality in the legal profession. The Defendant is an eminent ac ademic ian. She is c urrently teac hing at the National University of Singapore (“NUS”). 

9       At the time of their marriage, the Plaintiff had graduated from Massac husetts Institute of Tec hnology, and the Defendant obtained a Ph.D from St Mary’s Hospital, University of London. Both were university lec turers in Malaysia and they lived in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. On 5 June 1981, the elder son was born. 

10     In Oc tober 1982, the Plaintiff obtained a Commonwealth fellowship to pursue his doc torate degree in engineering at Imperial College in London. The Plaintiff also c onc urrently enrolled to read law at Oxford University. 

11     The Defendant took a sabbatic al for a year from Oc tober 1982 to August 1983 to be with the Plaintiff and the family in Oxford. In August 1983, the Defendant returned to Kuala Lumpur with the elder son and returned to lec turing. 

12     In July 1984, the Plaintiff c ompleted his law studies at Oxford University and returned to Kuala Lumpur. On 22 August 1984, the younger son was born. The Plaintiff returned to London to study for the UK Bar Examinations in Oc tober 1984. In August 1985, the Plaintiff returned to Kuala Lumpur after 


passing the UK Bar Examinations. He also c ompleted his doc torate thesis in Dec ember 1985 in Malaysia. He then went on to c hamber as a pupil at Shearn & Delamore, a Malaysian law firm. 

13     In July 1987, the Plaintiff moved to Singapore to work for a foreign law firm at its Singapore offic e. Later in Dec ember 1987, the Defendant moved with the c hildren to Singapore after the Defendant was employed by the NUS. The Plaintiff was made a loc al partner of the foreign firm in June 1989 and an international partner in 1993. After moving to Singapore, the parties enjoyed good fortune and in the c ourse of the marriage ac quired various properties and investments. 

14     Sometime in November 2002, the Defendant c onfessed to the Plaintiff that she had an affair with her c olleague. Their marriage subsequently fell apart. 

15     On 12 Marc h 2003, the parties separated. The Defendant moved out of the c ouple’s residenc e at Blk 130 Tanjong Rhu Road, #12-02, Pebble Bay, Singapore to live in an apartment at Aspen Heights. 

16     After living apart, the parties signed the Deed on 28 Marc h 2003. The c irc umstanc es surrounding the plac e and time the Defendant signed the Deed was c ontested by the parties. In my view, nothing signific ant turned on the disc repanc ies in light of the undisputed evidenc e that the Defendant looked perfec tly normal at the Plaintiff’s birthday dinner on 28 Marc h 2003 and did not appear to be depressed. 

17     The Defendant filed a divorc e petition on 29 June 2004 whic h was later disc ontinued on 20 Marc h 2006. The Plaintiff then filed a divorc e petition on 28 Marc h 2006. The dec ree nisi dissolving the marriage was granted on 28 May 2006. 

**Parties’ opposing positions in SUM 1553/** 

18     Ms Ragupathy argued that the Deed should be set aside bec ause the Defendant was c oerc ed, 

abused and/or threatened into signing the Deed. [note: 2] Ms Ragupathy further argued that the Defendant was suffering from depression at the material time suc h that she did not fully understand the c onsequenc es and risks of signing the Deed, and that the Defendant signed the Deed in the hope 

that ac c eding to the Plaintiff’s requests as set out in the Deed would result in rec onc iliation. [note: 3] Ms Ragupathy pointed to various allegations of abuse made by the Defendant in her affidavits and relied on a report prepared by one Dr Pushpa Bose (“Dr Bose”), the Defendant’s psyc hiatrist, whic h tried to shed light on the Defendant’s mental state at the time she signed the Deed. 

19     On the other hand, Mr Khoo argued that the Deed was not tainted by any vitiating fac tors. Ac c ording to Mr Khoo, the Defendant knew the legal signific anc e of the Deed as she obtained legal advic e on the Deed and admitted that she understood the effec t of the Deed in one of her e-mails to the Plaintiff. It was pointed out that the Defendant was not a simple woman. She had exc ellent 

c redentials and a range of ac c omplishments. [note: 4] The Defendant was also ac tively bargaining over 

the split of assets. [note: 5] Mr Khoo rejec ted the Defendant’s allegation that she signed the Deed 

bec ause the Plaintiff made a false promise that he would rec onc ile with her if she did so. [note: 6] Mr Khoo noted that the Defendant’s allegations of abuse inflic ted by the Plaintiff on the Defendant were 

denied and explained by the Plaintiff in his affidavits [note: 7] and relied on a medic al report of one Dr 

Brian Yeo (“Dr Yeo”) to debunk the findings in Dr Bose’s report. [note: 8] 

**Should the Deed be set aside?** 


**_Relevant legal principles_** 

20     It is not c ontroversial that for a pre-nuptial or post nuptial agreement (c ollec tively referred to hereinafter as “marital agreement”) to have the effec t of a valid and subsisting agreement, it should satisfy the requirements of the law of c ontrac t: see _Chia Hock Hua v Chong Choo Je_ [1994] 3 SLR(R) 

159\. The Court of Appeal in _TQ v TR and Another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 961</span> (“ _TQ v TR_ ”), affirmed that for a pre-nuptial agreement to subsist, it must c omply with the requirements of the law of c ontrac t. Andrew Phang JA’s observations in _TQ v TR_ apply equally to post nuptial agreements like the Deed in this c ase, and they are as follows: 

 94 It is our view that prenuptial agreements ought generally to c omply with the various legal doc trines and requirements that are an integral part of the c ommon law of c ontrac t. ... This is only logic al as well as just and fair, given that suc h agreements are, ex hypothesi , contracts to begin with. 

 ... 

 96 The prenuptial agreement in question must obviously have been validly formed in the first plac e in ac c ordanc e with the general rules and princ iples relating to offer and ac c eptanc e (and see the dec ision of this c ourt in Wee Ah Lian). Henc e, for example, an absenc e of a requisite offer or ac c eptanc e would be fatal to any relianc e on an alleged prenuptial agreement as it would not have c ome into proper legal existenc e. 

 [emphasis in original] 

21     As marital agreements are not c ommerc ial c ontrac ts, the c ourt retains a residuary disc retion even though the marital agreement does not c omply with the legal doc trines of c ontrac t law to give some weight to the marital agreement where the c irc umstanc es justify it. Phang JA remarked (at [105]): 

 ...The c ourt also retains a residuary disc retion, in limited c irc umstanc es, to give some weight to a prenuptial agreement that does not c omply with one or more of the legal doc trine and requirements under the c ommon law of c ontrac t. 

 [emphasis in original] 

22     I now c ome to another related point, namely the presenc e of any of the standard vitiating fac tors suc h as duress, fraud or misrepresentation that will negate the marital agreement. Phang JA in _TQ v TR_ identified various vitiating fac tors. They inc lude (at [97]): 

 At the other end of the c ontrac tual spec trum are to be found the various vitiating factors. These inc lude standard c ontrac tual doc trines suc h as misrepresentation, mistake, undue influenc e, duress, unc onsc ionability, as well as illegality and public polic y...[inc luding] the possibility of ‘saving’ that part of the prenuptial agreement that is objec tionable via the doc trine of severanc e... There has also been mention of the safeguard relating to the availability of independent legal advic e... 

 [emphasis in original] 

**_Analysis and Decision_** 


23     With these princ iples in mind, I now turn to the fac ts of this c ase, and the vitiating fac tors raised by the Defendant in argument, namely the Defendant was c oerc ed, abused and/or threatened into signing the Deed or that she did not understand the c onsequenc es and risks of signing the Deed. 

24     The Defendant alleged [note: 9] that after the Defendant c onfessed to having her affair in November 2002, the Plaintiff, at various times and amongst other things, threatened to report the affair to the Dean of her fac ulty and Vic eChanc ellor of the NUS and get the Defendant sac ked, urinated on the Defendant and made her drink his urine, verbally and physic ally abused the Defendant and made her do degrading ac ts and humiliated the Defendant’s mother by asking her to kneel and beg for forgiveness from the Plaintiff. The Defendant alleged that by January 2003, she was c ompletely broken and in a state of depression, she suffered from insomnia and experienc ed 

signific ant weight loss. [note: 10] 

25     The Defendant adduc ed a polic e report [note: 11] made by her on 17 Oc tober 2003 stating the various inc idents of violenc e involving the Plaintiff between November 2002 and January 2003 and in September 2003, as well as photos of mobile messages purportedly sent by an apologetic Plaintiff on 

7 January 2003. [note: 12] The Defendant also filed an affidavit of her son [note: 13] a nd her brother [note: 14] in support of her allegations. 

26     Furthermore, to shed light on the Defendant’s alleged state of mind at the time she signed the Deed, it is useful to quote from a relevant paragraph in the Defendant’s Affidavit dated 25 January 2008 wherein the Defendant proffered her reasons for signing the Deed: 

69\. After years of being abused by the [Plaintiff], I was very afraid he would c arry out his threats [ _ie_ , to make public the Defendant’s affair, have her sac ked and to make it impossible for her to live in Singapore [note: 15] ] and at the material point in time, I was not able to stand up for myself, and neither did I have any support from friends and family. I eventually broke, and signed the Deed without addressing my mind to it, or the c onsequenc es of the same. I had also signed it to please the [Plaintiff ], and in the hope that we would be able to rec onc ile. I did not have the c ourage or the strength to re-order my life after being with the [Plaintiff ] for 25 years, and as suc h, I was prepared to do anything to rec onc ile with him. The [Plaintiff ] had told me that if I signed the Deed, he would c onsider rec onc iling with me. The relevant e-mail dated 6th of Marc h 2003 is at pages xxx to xxx of Exhibit KHE -53. 

27     In response, the Plaintiff c ategoric ally denied all the Defendant’s allegations, [note: 16] and relied 

on affidavits of his relatives like his brothers [note: 17] and eldest sister [note: 18] t o attest to various matters: that the Plaintiff was not a violent and c ruel man; and that the Defendant looked perfec tly normal at the Plaintiff’s birthday dinner on 28 Marc h 2003 and she did not display any signs of depression. As to the Defendant’s c harac ter, she has been desc ribed by the Plaintiff and his relatives 

a s strong-willed with a very strong mind of her own; [note: 19] a very independent and c onfident 

woman [note: 20] ; and a very c apable and self assured individual. [note: 21] 

28     In the absenc e of c ontemporaneous and objec tive evidenc e, the allegations of physic al abuse were basic ally not satisfac torily c orroborated. The Defendant’s polic e report narrated various violent ac ts c ommitted by the Plaintiff on her person between November 2002 and January 2003. Notably, t h e polic e report was only made on 17 Oc tober 2003 several months after the alleged violent inc idents took plac e. Mr Khoo questioned the verac ity of the polic e report and, to support his c ontention, he went through some e-mails written by the Defendant around the time of the alleged 


inc idents to show that none of the e-mails alluded to anything untoward. I note that the polic e report was made after the Defendant had engaged a firm of lawyers to c ommenc e divorc e proc eedings in 

August 2003 [note: 22] , and the Defendant, in fac t, c onfirmed in her affidavit that it was her then 

lawyers who had advised her to file the polic e report. [note: 23] Indeed her Divorc e Petition No 2545 of 2004 (“DT 2545 of 2004”) filed on 29 June 2004 was based, _inter alia_ , on the Plaintiff’s unreasonable 

behaviour. DT 2545 of 2004 was eventually withdrawn by agreement. [note: 24] As for the other affidavits provided by the Defendant, the son in his affidavit stopped short of saying that he saw or knew that the Defendant was physic ally abused; instead, the son only c laimed that he saw bruises on the Defendant’s arm in the period between November 2002 and January 2003. Similarly, the Defendant’s brother in his affidavit only c laimed to have seen a bruise on the Defendant’s lip and 

stated that the Defendant told him that the Plaintiff had c aused the bruise. [note: 25] 

29     Taking the Defendant’s c ase at its highest, that is, the alleged abuses did happen (whic h I make no finding on), it must still be shown that the Defendant signed the Deed out of fear of her safety and well being. Or that she was so traumatised that she was inc apable of understanding or apprec iating the legal effec t of the Deed. It is ac c epted that the psyc hologic al effec t of repeated abuse c an have a lingering effec t in that the person may well c ontinue to be traumatised and mentally affec ted by abuse he or she suffered over a period of time or even a long time ago. In the final analysis, what is important is whether the Defendant was in fac t too affec ted and depressed to think c learly and rationally and to apprec iate the legal signific anc e of the Deed when she signed it on 28 Marc h 2003. 

30     In this regard, there is overwhelming evidenc e pointing to the fac t, and I so find, that the Defendant had apprec iated the legal signific anc e of the Deed and was not c oerc ed, abused or threatened into signing the Deed. The exc hange of e-mails between the parties at or about the time of the signing of the Deed on 28 Marc h 2003 is material; it showed that the Defendant perfec tly understood and apprec iated the signific anc e and effec t of the Deed. 

31     In partic ular, an e-mail titled “separation matters” sent by the Defendant to the Plaintiff on 21 Marc h 2003, just seven days before the signing of the Deed, is important. It c learly showed that the Defendant knew the legal reperc ussions of signing the Deed in that it was going to be binding, that she was not getting 50% of the matrimonial assets, and that sinc e she was entitled to 50%, it w a s diffic ult for her to ac c ept what he had proposed. The salient parts of the e-mail are quoted 

below: [note: 26] 

 Dearest Wong, 

 ... 

 I also did not understand what a separation agreement meant or implied. I thought it was a temporary agreement suc h that we c ould work towards rec onc iliation. I talked to my c ousin about it and she c onsulted a lawyer. I now understand that it is a binding agreement if we eventually get divorced. I had not realized that. The lawyer’s advice was that under Singapore law, I am entitled to 50% of our matrimonial assets. When I said that I was only interested in getting enough for me to live for the rest of my life without financ ial diffic ulty, the advic e was that I should not just think about myself alone but also my c hildren bec ause I should also have the right to give them my share of the matrimonial assets. 

 ... 


 Therefore to protec t our sons’ interest too, I think you should rec ognise my entitlement to half share of our matrimonial assets so that I c an bequeath this half share to our sons. 

 To insist that I should c omply with the way you have proposed that our matrimonial assets should be divided would be very unfair to me, partic ularly, when you reserve the right to withdraw whatever you propose to give me based only on your perc eption of any failure on my part to meet with your expec tations of the manner I c onduc t my life. For the purpose of this separation agreement, as far as the matrimonial assets are concerned, I therefore find it very difficult to comply with your request. 

 Now that you insisted on the separation and c lear division of the matrimonial assets, you should recognise my basic rights as a wife that I am entitled to at least 50% of whatever we have acquired during our marriage. 

 [emphasis added] 

32     In a e-mail dated 21 Marc h 2003, the Plaintiff replied: [note: 27] 

 I am very annoyed by your letter below as I have stated over the phone. There is no split of 50% to you. I do not agree and will never agree. The only way for you to hope to ac hieve that is for us to have a full blown legal dispute over our matrimonial assets. This will mean that there will be no holds barred and I will disc lose all the unsavoury aspec ts of our marriage to the public. I do not mind that if you wish to fight me. But it will be very bloody for both of us. 

 ... 

 Thirdly, I believe that if I split 20% of our total assets as of end 2002 to you, it would be a fair split. The proposal that I gave you had more than a 20% split. In addition, there are some ongoing payments by me whic h will stop should you be out with another man or are unfaithful to me. 

 ... 

 As for the c hildren’s sake type of argument, please do not give me that. Ming will graduate. He should stand on his own feet. It is better for him. I love him dearly and will always c ome to his assist anc e should he need it during my lifetime. En is about to enter c ollege. Can I be so heartless as to withdraw my assistanc e?...So let us not bring the c hildren into the pic ture. You are the last person I expec t to look to in relation to them. I will help them till my last breath. So let us not try to be so good in words. .... 

 I do not wish to fight with you but I will if you forc e my hand. 

 The separation deed will be drafted. It will be binding. If you love me you do not fight with me and take what I think is fair. If you fight me you will lose me forever. 

 [emphasis added] 

33     As c an be seen from the exc erpts above, the Defendant herself stated that the intended separation agreement would be “a binding agreement if [the parties] eventually get divorc ed” and was openly bargaining for a larger share of the matrimonial assets a few days before the Deed was signed. The Plaintiff indic ated c learly in his reply to the Defendant that the Deed would be “binding”. The 


Defendant’s e-mail is telling. It showed that she had put thought into her e-mail. It showed that she was not afraid to speak up and indeed told the Plaintiff that she wanted a larger share of the matrimonial assets, and sought to justify her stand. This e-mail militated against the Defendant’s c laim that she was not thinking, was irrational and inc apable of apprec iating the legal signific anc e of the Deed. After the Deed was exec uted, the Defendant even made enquiries together with the Plaintiff to begin to c arry out the terms of the Deed, as seen from an e-mail from the Defendant to 

the Plaintiff dated 10 April 2003. [note: 28] 

34     I am aware that the Plaintiff is a lawyer and had drafted the Deed. Nonetheless, I was satisfied on the evidenc e before me that the Defendant signed the Deed with full apprec iation of its implic ations. There was no lac k of legal advic e for the reasons stated below. 

35     The Plaintiff alleged in his affidavits that the Defendant rec eived legal advic e on the Deed from 

at least two sourc es, namely Peter Moe (“Peter”) and the lawyer friend of her c ousin. [note: 29] Peter, a family friend, gave the Plaintiff at the latter’s request a spec imen c opy of a deed of separation. The Plaintiff’s draft was shown to Peter who c onfirmed that he spoke to the Defendant on various oc c asions about the draft inc luding the finalised version. He also stated in his affidavits that he told t h e Defendant on numerous oc c asions before the signing of the Deed to seek independent legal 

advic e, [note: 30] and that he ac tually explained to the Defendant the purport of the Deed whic h was a c ontrac t between her and the Plaintiff and that if they divorc ed, the terms of the Deed would be 

reviewed by the c ourt and c ould be upheld if found to be fair. [note: 31] However, the Defendant alleged in her affidavit that she did not rec eive any legal advic e on the Deed but she did inform the 

Plaintiff that her c ousin had sought legal advic e on her behalf. [note: 32] She insisted that she never 

rec eived any legal advic e from Peter. [note: 33] I n her reply affidavit to Peter’s first affidavit, she 

alleged again that she did not rec eive any legal advic e from Peter. [note: 34] However, the Defendant’s 

telephone rec ords [note: 35] f ro m 1 February 2003 to 31 Marc h 2003 c learly showed that the Defendant did have c onversations with Peter on numerous oc c asions in the period leading up to the signing of the Deed. The telephone rec ords from 1 February to 27 Marc h 2003 showed that there were at least 27 telephone c onversations between Peter and the Defendant. It is worth noting that the Defendant in her reply affidavit to Peter’s affidavit neglec ted to mention the various telephone c alls between the Defendant and Peter made before 27 Marc h 2003 and instead selec tively foc used on the c alls made on 27 Marc h 2003 to show that Peter did not advise her on the subjec t matter of 

the Deed. [note: 36] What exac tly was said between Peter and the Defendant in all the phone c alls was disputed as c an be seen from the differing ac c ounts of Peter and the Defendant in their respec tive affidavits, but the inc ontrovertible fac t is that Peter and the Defendant did have numerous c onversations up till the signing of the Deed. The Defendant’s neglec t to explain what transpired in the telephone c onversations before 27 Marc h 2003 gave c redenc e to Peter’s assertions that he explained to the Defendant the effec t of the draft separation deed, his views on its terms as requested by the Defendant as well as reminded her to obtain independent legal advic e. 

36     At any rate, in light of her e-mail to the Plaintiff quoted above at [31], the Defendant was c ontent to ac c ept and rely on the legal advic e c ommunic ated through her c ousin who c onsulted a lawyer on the Defendant’s entitlement to the matrimonial assets and the legal signific anc e of the Deed. This legal advic e was spec ific ally in relation to Singapore law. The Defendant herself wrote in the e-mail that “the lawyer’s advic e was that under Singapore law, [she was] entitled to 50% of [the] matrimonial assets”. Her insistenc e on an equal division of the matrimonial assets in the e-mail was deliberate and made on the basis of qualified legal advic e obtained regarding the division of matrimonial assets under Singapore law. 


37     Ms Ragupathy relied on a report prepared by Dr Bose, the Defendant’s psyc hiatrist, [note: 37] to prove that the Defendant was suffering from depression suc h that she c ould not understand what she was signing when she signed the Deed. In response, the Plaintiff produc ed a report from Dr Brian Yeo to rebut Dr Bose’s report. 

38     Dr Bose opined on the mental state of the Defendant between January 2003 and Oc tober 2003 and, in partic ular, on 28 Marc h 2003 (the day of the signing of the Deed) and c onc luded that the Defendant was “unable to think c learly or rationally in the fac e of these various fac tors that were affec ting her mental state in Marc h 2003”. It is important to note that Dr Bose did not spec ific ally state that the Defendant was so depressed that she did not know what she was signing. 

39     Ac c ording to Dr Bose’s report, the Defendant had her first c onsultation with Dr Bose on 23 January 2003, and was presc ribed anti-depressants for her depression. Subsequently, she spoke over the phone with Dr Bose on 7 Marc h 2003. It was not until 19 August 2003, more than 3 months after the Deed was signed that Dr Bose saw the Defendant for a sec ond c onsultation. It was only then that the Defendant disc losed to Dr Bose the alleged abuse c ommitted against her by the Plaintiff. Subsequently, the Defendant had c onsultations with Dr Bose on 12 September 2003, 6 Oc tober 2003 and 12 January 2004. Clearly, Dr Bose did not examine the Defendant from 23 January 2003 to 19 August 2003, apart from rec eiving a phone c all from the Defendant on 7 Marc h 2003. Dr Bose’s report on 9 Marc h 2004 was almost a year after the Deed was signed. 

40     In my view, Dr Bose’s expert opinion is of limited evidential value and weight as it is sc arc ely c ontemporaneous and was made on the basis of c onsultations and observations made on dates well after the Deed was signed. For c ompleteness, I should refer to Dr Brian Yeo’s expert report. Dr Yeo was engaged by the Plaintiff for his opinion on Dr Bose’s report on the mental state of the Defendant at the time she exec uted the Deed. In Dr Yeo’s opinion, it would be diffic ult for Dr Bose to express an opinion on the mental state of the Defendant at the time she signed the Deed without having 

examined the Defendant “at or near the exec ution of the Separation Deed.” [note: 38] As for the phone c all to Dr Bose on 7 Marc h 2003, Dr Yeo opined that the c onversation Dr Bose had with the Defendant was inadequate to reac h a c onc lusion that she was not able to think rationally or c learly in Marc h 2003. Based on Dr Bose’s narration of the first c onsultation with the Defendant, the Defendant 

did not appear to Dr Yeo to be an “individual that was unable to think c learly or irrationally”. [note: 39] This is what Dr Yeo wrote: 

 Even at the first c onsultation in January 2003, Dr Bose had ac knowledged that Mdm Khoo had been guarded with her c onsc ious desire to protec t her husband’s name and status. She was able to give the history of her problems to Dr Bose, inc luding c onfidential information regarding her affair, yet expressing her wish to Dr Bose that she was seeking her husband’s forgiveness and her hopes of attaining a rec onc iliation with him. 

 This is in my view not of an individual that was unable to think c learly or rationally. 

41     It is also important to understand the signific anc e of the fac t that the Defendant went bac k to see Dr Bose only on 19 August 2003, months after the first c onsultation and exec ution of the Deed. 

42     Based on the evidenc e, it seemed to me that the Defendant c onsulted Dr Bose again on 19 August 2003 after she realised that the Plaintiff had started a serious relationship with Li Hongxia (“Hongxia”) as his partner, and that it was not on ac c ount of the alleged abuse inflic ted by the Plaintiff on the Defendant as she had c laimed. The Defendant was probably depressed bec ause months after the Deed the Plaintiff had moved on with his life and any sliver of hope to rec onc ile was 


gone. It must be noted that the Defendant did not appear to have informed Dr Bose of the Plaintiff’s serious relationship with Hongxia; Dr Bose’s report did not mention anything about this. 

43     In Marc h 2003, the Defendant was in all likelihood prepared to ac c ept a situation where the Plaintiff c ould have liaisons with other women but not enter into a serious relationship. When the parties separated in Marc h 2003, the Plaintiff made it c lear to the Defendant that he might and would 

date other women. In his e-mail to the Defendant dated 6 Marc h 2003, [note: 40] t he Plaintiff told the Defendant that she must c ontinue to be faithful and loving to him while he may engage in c asual relationships with other women: 

 If you must have c larity, you c annot date any man so long as you are married to me, notwithstanding the separation, nor show any interest in any man other than me. You shall c ontinue to be warm, wifely and loving to me at all times without expec ting anything from me ot her than the financ ial assistanc e. On my part, I will respond in ac c ordanc e with firstly any assessment of your sinc erity and genuine desire to atone for your sin and unfaithfulness, and sec ondly, of c ourse, my own development of feelings for other women who may turn up in my life. I intend to have girlfriends as I do need a lot of love, and you know that. I need someone to take c are of me, be faithful to me and not forsake me for another. In turn I will shower that person with my love, as I did to you and the boys. To the extent that you c ould share some of that love if you c ontinue to devote yourself only to me, I will try my very best to make it possible. 

 [emphasis added] 

44     In another e-mail to the Defendant dated 7 Marc h 2003, [note: 41] the Plaintiff reported to the Defendant his suc c ess at dating women and reiterated to the Defendant that she must c ontinue to show him love in order for them to have a hope of rec onc iliation: 

 I am just about trying to recover my ego by dating women and I am surprising myself. Without exceptions, everyone accepted my date the first time I tried. Maybe they are after my money. But not all of them. Many men too have said I am c harming, handsome, honest, princ ipled, brilliant etc. I do not need re-validation, so I am beginning to disc over. You were the real problem in my view, your looseness and your dec eitfulness. 

 ... 

 I am not sure I c an get over this with you. That is why I want you to maintain your faithfulness to me. If you c annot, then there is nothing more I c an say or do. If you can, at least we both have a chance of giving this a shot again , as the c ouple we should have been. I will try to reform my behaviour, whic h I have done to a great extent over the years, and you have to love me like you did for the past months sinc e November 2002 till early February 2003. 

 ... 

 Going forward you will have to love me like you never did even though we are separated. If you make me feel loved , pour all the love you c an to me without being too hypoc ritic al, show deeds more than words, show c are and attention, show remorse, show that you want to enjoy a part of me, even a small part would make you happy, show that you have only me in your heart, mind and soul, then there may be a possibility of my returning to you. 

 [emphasis added] 


45     In addition, the Defendant stated herself in her affidavit that the Plaintiff told his friends and relatives that she had agreed to him having a mistress and would go on dates with women from China before informing her about the details of his dates. In another affidavit, the Defendant stated that the Plaintiff was dating several Chinese nationals in November 2002 and already had a mistress by 

February or Marc h 2003. [note: 42] 

46     The Plaintiff had stated in his affidavit that he believed the Defendant found out sometime in June 2003 that he had met Hongxia, and he sensed a c hange in the Defendant’s attitude towards him 

then. [note: 43] Hongxia stated in her affidavit [note: 44] that she has known the Plaintiff sinc e sometime in the middle of 2003 and started going steady with the Plaintiff in the later part of 2003. All these were not rebutted or denied by the Defendant in her affidavits; in fac t, the Defendant has been silent about Hongxia throughout all her affidavits and talked about an unidentified “mistress” instead, [note: 45] exc ept for one notable instanc e where she averred that the Plaintiff had digressed in his 

affidavit when he stated that she was unable to ac c ept Hongxia as his partner bec ause it was 

irrelevant to the proc eedings. [note: 46] 

47     I now c ome to the Defendant’s allegation [note: 47] that she signed the Deed on the Plaintiff’s false promise that he would rec onc ile with her if she did so and she bore the hope then that the Plaintiff would ac c ept her bac k. I find it diffic ult to believe that the Defendant was misled in the way she had c laimed. In the same e-mail dated 21 Marc h 2003 that the Defendant wrote to the Plaintiff already referred to above at [31], the Defendant herself ac knowledged that the Plaintiff has been seeing other women on a c asual basis. By then, the Plaintiff had announc ed that he c ould live without her and she was devastated by his announc ement. It was the Defendant who expressed hope of getting bac k together in the future and that she would happily tear up the Deed. The Defendant wrote: 

 Dearest Wong, 

 I wrote you a long letter explaining how I have loved you and c ontinue to still love you and it is not nec essary to repeat it here. Sinc e this nightmare began, my first priority has always been that we rec onc ile. You know how happy I was when you told me just before Chinese New Year that we c ould c ontinue to love together after Chinese New Year. I think I have continued to be a warm and loving wife to you despite your going out with and pursuing other women since the beginning of this year. Unfortunately, when you returned from Harbin and Shanghai, you decided that you would be better off and could live without me. That c ompletely devastated me suc h that I really needed to take my medic ation to get through the days and the nights and had to inc rease the dosage. I am still dependent on medic ation now. 

 ... 

 I still hope we can get back together again and I shall be so happy to tear up the separation agreement. I will continue to be devoted, warm and faithful even as you go looking for other women. Now that we are living separately, I do not know how to help you heal exc ept c ontinue to love you and be c onc erned about you and hopefully we could get back together against some time in the future. 

 [emphasis added] 

48     In my view, the Defendant had overstated her c laim of the Plaintiff’s promise of rec onc iliation. The Deed c ontained two c lauses whic h are telling. First, the Deed c ontemplates a divorc e between 


t he parties and obliges the Defendant to give her c onsent to a divorc e based on their separation when the time c ame (see c lause 8). Sec ondly, on the outside c hanc e that the c ouple should get bac k together, the Deed would bec ome void if they c o-habited as man and wife for over a c ontinuous period of six months after the date of the Deed (see c lause 9). Furthermore, the Deed would be void save for ac c rued rights under the Deed whic h remained enforc eable against the wrongdoer. 

49     I now c ome to the final piec e of evidenc e that militated against the vitiating fac tors raised by the Defendant. The evidenc e showed that the Defendant was able to fully func tion at work. As 

disc losed in the Plaintiff’s affidavit, [note: 48] the Defendant held important appointments in her field as well as in other areas she was involved in. At various times, the Defendant was the Vic e Dean of her Fac ulty, the President of the Singapore Soc iety for Bioc hemistry and Molec ular Biology, and the Vic e President for Ac ademic Planning at the Asian University for Women. To further buttress the point that the Defendant had no diffic ulties func tioning for the large part of the year of 2003 during the time the 

Defendant was on study leave to pursue a diploma in medic al educ ation, [note: 49] t h e Plaintiff adduc ed doc umentary evidenc e to show that the Defendant rec eived several grants for researc h 

projec ts, worked on various projec ts and published numerous papers during 2003. [note: 50] She also wrote an artic le regarding the improvement of the medic al graduate programme and supervision of postgraduate students, whic h was published in June 2003 for the Centre for Development of Teac hing 

and Learning. [note: 51] From these examples, I agreed with Mr Khoo that it was hard to ac c ept the Defendant’s c laim that she was c ompletely broken and was in a state of depression so as to diminish her ability to think c learly and rationally to fully understand what the Deed would entail during the months leading up to the signing of the Deed. The evidenc e pointed to the Defendant’s energy and c apac ity for mentally c hallenging work during 2003. It is highly unlikely that she was unable to apprec iate the signific anc e of the Deed when she c onsidered and signed it in Marc h 2003. This view is 

reinforc ed by Dr Yeo’s c omments on the Defendant’s ability to fully func tion at work in 2003: [note: 52] 

 In Dr Bose’s affidavit, there was no mention to ac c ount for Mdm Khoo’s ability to func tion at suc h a high intellec tual level while holding her opinion that Mdm Khoo c ould not think rationally or c learly at that period in Marc h 2003. 

 ... 

 There is no mention of Mdm Khoo not being able to func tion in her ac ademic duties or in her ability to c ontinue in her post-graduate c ourse work during this period. I note that sinc e then, Mdm Khoo had rec eived a teac hing award and had taken up higher ac ademic posts both loc ally and abroad. 

 It is obvious that Mdm Khoo is blessed with high intelligenc e and is an individual that had identified and had taken on may leadership roles in ac ademia. 

 Thus, unless there are c orroborating evidenc e to show that Mdm Khoo was not able to func tion at work due to her stress and mental state in Marc h 2003, I am of the opinion that her innate superior intellec tual c apac ity would make it very diffic ult to c onc lude, espec ially without examining her then, that Mdm Khoo was not able to think c learly or rationally and thus not understand what she was signing in Marc h 2003. 

50     In the light of all the above, I was unable to ac c ept Ms Ragupathy’s c ontention that the Defendant was c oerc ed, abused and/or threatened into signing the Deed or did not understand the c onsequenc es and risks of signing the Deed. I c onc luded that the Deed was not tainted by any of the vitiating fac tors suggested by Ms Ragupathy. 


51     Ms Ragupathy’s fallbac k argument is that if the Deed was valid, it was repudiated or terminated by reason of the alleged breac hes of its terms by the Plaintiff. I agreed with Mr Khoo that there were no c lear statements in the Defendant’s affidavits alluding to the termination of the Deed or that she had ac c epted the Plaintiff’s repudiatory breac h. In fac t, the premise of her affidavits was of a subsisting agreement and her foc us was on setting it aside bec ause of vitiating fac tors. 

**Conclusion** 

52     For the reasons set out above, I dismissed SUM 1553/2011. I reserved the issue of c osts for SUM 1553/2011 until after the anc illary matters are dec ided by me. 

53     I wish to point out that even though the Deed was not set aside, the Deed would have to be sc rutinised in order to determine the weight to be given to it in dec iding the anc illary matters. Sec tion 112(1) of the Charter gives the c ourt the power to order a division of matrimonial assets “in suc h proportions as the c ourt thinks just and equitable”. Matrimonial agreements do not and c annot oust the c ourt’s jurisdic tion to order a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets. An agreement between parties to a marriage relating to the division of matrimonial assets like the Deed c annot automatic ally be enforc ed in and of itself and is only one of the fac tors listed under sec tion 112(2) of the Charter to be c onsidered by the c ourt in determining a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets, and the weight to be ac c orded to suc h an agreement depends on the prec ise fac ts and c irc umstanc es of the c ase itself: see _TQ v TR_ at [73]-[75], [77], [80], [103]; _AOO v AON_ <span class="citation">[2011] 4 SLR 1169</span> at [19]; _AFS v AFU_ <span class="citation">[2011] 3 SLR 275</span> at [17]-[18]. As the c ourt noted in _TQ v TR_ (at [80], [86]), suc h an agreement may be given c onc lusive weight and effec tively enforc ed in its entirety if the fac ts and c irc umstanc es warranted so. Similar sentiments have been expressed by Chao Hic k Tin JA in a rec ent dec ision of the Court of Appeal in _AQS v AQR_ <span class="citation">[2012] SGCA 3</span>. Chao JA reiterated (at [35]): 

 In any c ase, an agreement between the parties made in c ontemplation of divorc e c ould not be dec isive. It is only one of the fac tors listed in s112(2) of the Women’s Charter that the c ourt must take into ac c ount as part of its overarc hing duty to reac h a just and equitable division in light of all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase. This Court affirmed in TQ v TR and another appeal <span class="citation">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 961</span> at [75] that even though post-nuptial agreements c ould be ac c orded more weight than pre-nuptial agreements, how muc h weight was to be alloc ated to a postnuptial must ultimately depend on the prec ise c irc umstanc es of the c ase. 

54     As for the c irc umstanc es to be taken into c onsideration in the determination of the weight to be given to a matrimonial agreement, the oft-c ited dic tum of Ormrod LJ in _Edgar v Edgar_ [1980] 1 WLR 1410 is relevant and provides valuable guidanc e (see, _eg_ , _Granatino v Radmacher_ [2011] 1 AC 534 at [38]; _MacLeod v MacLeod_ [2010] 1 AC 298 at [25], [42]; _NA v MA_ [2007] 1 FLR 1760 at [13]; _A v B (Financial Relief: Agreements)_ [2005] 2 F.L.R. 730 at [13]; _X v X (Y and Z Intervening)_ [2002] 1 F.L.R. 508 at [84]; _Benson v Benson (Deceased)_ [1996] 1 F.L.R. 692 at 704G-705B). Ormrod LJ said (at 1417): 

 To dec ide what weight should be given, in order to reac h a just result, to a prior agreement not to c laim a lump sum, regard must be had to the c onduc t of both parties, leading up to the prior agreement, and to their subsequent c onduc t, in c onsequenc e of it. It is not nec essary in this c onnec tion to think in formal legal terms, suc h as misrepresentation or est oppel; all the c irc umstanc es as they affec t eac h of two human beings must be c onsidered in the c omplex relationship of marriage. So, the c irc umstanc es surrounding the making of the agreement are relevant. Under pressure by one side, exploitation of a dominant position to sec ure an unreasonable advantage, inadequate knowledge, possibly bad legal advic e, an important c hange 


 of c irc umstanc es, unforeseen or overlooked at the time of making the agreement, are all relevant to the question of justic e between the parties. Important too is the general proposition that formal agreements, properly and fairly arrived at with c ompetent legal advic e, should not be displac ed unless there are good and substantial grounds for c onc luding that an injustic e will be done by holding the parties to the terms of their agreement. There may well be other c onsiderations whic h affec t the justic e of this c ase; the above list is not intended to be an exc lusive c atalogue. 

55     Essentially, where the marital agreement is valid and subsisting, the c ourt will look at the fac ts and c irc umstanc es that are likely to reduc e or eliminate the weight to be attac hed to the marital agreement. I have in mind, unc onsc ionable c onduc t as suc h undue pressure (falling short of duress). Another example is unworthy c onduc t suc h as exploitation of a dominant position to sec ure an unfair advantage. An important c hange of c irc umstanc es, unforeseen or overlooked at the time of entering into the marital agreement may be relevant. 

56     The appropriate weight to be given to the Deed is yet to be argued and determined and this will take plac e at the adjourned hearing of the anc illary matters.
