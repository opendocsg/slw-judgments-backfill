**Introduction** 

1       The plaintiff (“Loh”) brings this c laim for oppression under s 216 of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“s 216”) as a minority shareholder in the sixth defendant (“Hexa Chemic als”). He seeks relief against his fellow shareholders (the first to fifth defendants), asking that Hexa Chemic als be wound up or that his shares be bought on terms that this c ourt deems fit and just. 

**Facts** 

**_The parties and the business_** 

2       Loh and the first to fifth defendants (“the shareholder defendants”) had previously worked together in the Chemic al Division of Getz Bros & Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Getz Bros”) where the first defendant, Gilbert Foo, (“Foo”), as General Manager of that Division headed the team. Their business c omprised the purc hase of industrial and c ommerc ial c hemic als from suppliers abroad and selling them, usually in smaller quantities, to various manufac turers here and in the surrounding region. Their c ustomers inc luded in the main those in the food, plastic s and paint industries. Their business therefore involved obtaining the supply of c hemic als that were needed, stoc king them and selling them. Like all stoc kists, unsold or obsolete inventory, espec ially of c hemic als whose demand for one reason or another had diminished, would direc tly hit the bottom line. Prompt c ollec tion from c ustomers and prompt payment to suppliers was c ruc ial. 

3       Besides overseeing the operations of the Chemic al Division, Foo was also involved in sourc ing and maintaining agenc y lines from the suppliers or manufac turers of these c hemic als. The defendants and Loh himself were all part of Foo’s team and their spec ific roles were as follows: 

 (a) Loh, aged 61 at the time of the trial, was a Produc t Manager in the team. He was involved in the sales and marketing of a portfolio of c hemic als. 


 (b) The sec ond defendant (“Ko”), 49 years old at the time of the trial, was a Tec hnic al Sales Manager in Getz Bros. He was also involved in sales and marketing of c hemic als. 

 (c ) The third defendant (“Goh”), 51 years old at the time of the trial, was a Marketing Exec utive who assisted Foo in Getz Bros. She also had knowledge of the ink industry and was Foo’s sec retary. 

 (d) The fourth defendant (“Wee”), 63 years old at the time of the trial, was a Sales Exec utive in Getz Bros. 

 (e) The fifth defendant (“Chua”), 38 years old at the time of the trial, was a Sales Coordinator in Getz Bros. 

4       It is not in dispute that as c olleagues in Getz Bros, they worked c losely as a group. Loh said they lunc hed together often and formed the bac kbone of the Chemic al Division. Loh had been working together with Foo sinc e 1982, starting their working relationship in another c ompany; and by 1997, Loh had worked with the other parties for at least seven years. Eventually, as a group, they had ideas of striking out on their own. This arose, ac c ording to Loh, around 1995, but Foo said this was not the first time it had been disc ussed. Foo was not ready to do so in 1995. It was only in 1997 that the parties dec ided to leave and set up on their own. 

5       Hexa Chemic als was inc orporated in Singapore on 2 September 1997. Just prior to that, in August 1997, Foo, Loh, Ko and Goh, the main drivers of the group, resigned from Getz Bros. They staggered their joining Hexa Chemic als as, unsurprisingly, Getz Bros were quite unhappy with this turn of events and c ommenc ed an ac tion against them for c onspirac y. This was subsequently resolved. 

6       The position in Hexa Chemic als was as follows: 

 (a) Loh joined on 1 November 1997, as a Marketing Manager, and bec ame a direc tor together with Foo, Ko and Goh on 5 May 1998. Loh held 21% of the shares. 

 (b) Foo joined on 1 April 1998 and bec ame its Managing Direc tor on 5 May 1998. Foo held 31% of the shares. 

 (c ) Ko, together with Goh, were the first to leave Getz Bros to set up Hexa Chemic als; (they initially used proxies, Ko’s brother-in-law and Goh’s friend). Ko was appointed a direc tor together with Foo and Loh on 5 May 1998 and like Loh, holds 21% of the shares. Ko started off as a Tec hnic al Sales Manager and was later promoted to General Manager in 2006, after Loh retired. His work involves sales and marketing, managing the inventories and rec eivables, as well as managing the c ompany’s financ es and c omputer systems. 

 (d) Goh, the other ‘founding’ member of Hexa Chemic als, bec ame a direc tor on 5 May 1998 and holds 15% of the shares. She is the Commerc ial Manager in Hexa Chemic als and oversees the areas of human resourc e, financ e and c ustomer servic e. She also manages sales in the ink industry. 

 (e) Wee joined Hexa Chemic als on 1 November 2000 but only bec ame a shareholder later in June 2002 by buying his shares from Loh, Foo and Ko. He is a Produc t Manager in Hexa Chemic als and his work involves promoting agenc y lines in the food, plastic and paint sec tors; maintaining c lose relationships with agenc y princ ipals; monitoring inventory; and c ollec ting debts. Wee is not one of the major movers of the business, the main players being Foo, Loh and Ko, and Wee’s 10% 


 shareholding reflec ts this. 

 (f ) Chua joined Hexa Chemic als on 1 November 1998, but only bec ame a shareholder a year later in November 1999 by buying her shares from Goh. She is the Customer Servic e Exec utive in Hexa Chemic als and her work involves taking c alls, rec eiving orders and arranging deliveries. She also has duties pertaining to inventory management, administration, financ e and rec eivables, as well as shipping. Chua is also not a main mover of the business and is a 2% shareholder. 

7       Hexa Chemic als was initially financ ed with $500,000 in equity (500,000 shares of $1 eac h) and $600,000 in shareholder loans. The loans would be extended by eac h shareholder in proportion to his or her equity ratio. By prior agreement, Wee purc hased his shares later from Loh, Foo and Ko, and Chua purc hased her shares from Goh when they were in a position to do so and take on their proportion of the loan to Hexa Chemic als. Like all new ventures, everyone worked hard to build up Hexa Chemic als. They ran a tight ship and managed with a lean team. Their monthly salaries were kept low and in the c ase of the main shareholders, their monthly salaries were lower than what they used to get at Getz Bros to help ease the c ashflow. Until the latter part of 2005, the c ompany only c onsisted of these six individuals, with no c lerks or sec retaries, and one part time book keeper. 

8       Loh retired from Hexa Chemic als on 31 Dec ember 2005 but remains a 21% shareholder of the c ompany. Even after Loh retired, Hexa Chemic als only hired sparingly and remained a lean and trim business unit. 

9       Hexa Chemic als has never paid dividends sinc e its formation. The money made by the c ompany was retained as reserves or distributed to the shareholders through salaries, direc tors’ fees and inc entive payments. While the salaries were modest and saw little c hange, the shareholders would share in a portion of the profits of the c ompany _via_ the variable direc tor’s fees and inc entive payments. 

10     Around the middle of September eac h year, the direc tors (Loh, Foo, Ko and Goh) would rely on the latest unaudited management ac c ounts to dec ide how muc h of the gross profits would be distributed to the shareholders (through direc tors’ fees for direc tors and inc entive payments for nondirec tors) and how muc h would be retained as reserves. The position before Loh retired was that eac h year, eac h shareholder would be paid a share of the gross profits (through direc tors’ fees and inc entive payments) that were alloc ated for distribution among the shareholders. Eac h shareholder would rec eive a share proportionate to their shareholdings in Hexa. Notably, Wee and Chua were distributed a share of the gross profits even before they were shareholders. For Wee, a Direc tors’ Resolution dated 28 September 2001 resolved that he would rec eive an amount approximately equivalent to 10% of the sum alloc ated for distribution. For Chua, minutes from a Direc tors’ Meeting of 16 September 1999 rec orded that she would rec eive 1% of the sum alloc ated for distribution. They were treated as if they were shareholders bec ause the agreement was that they would buy their shares and assume their proportion of the shareholders’ loan when they were ready to do so. 

11     After Loh retired, Ko and Goh approac hed Foo, asking for Hexa Chemic als to revise its remuneration struc ture. Foo took some time to think about it and finally agreed. The gross profits that were alloc ated for distribution would be divided into three portions: 

 (a) One portion would be set aside for flat inc entive payments ( ie eac h working shareholder would rec eive the same amount). 

 (b) The sec ond portion, c onsisting of half the remaining gross profits alloc ated for distribution, would be distributed to the working shareholders based on equity perc entage. 


 (c ) Finally, the remainder third portion would be distributed to the working shareholders based on performanc e. For working shareholders who were direc tors, a part of this third portion would be distributed to them as direc tors’ fees. 

 Loh, having retired, was not entitled to any of these payments as he was not a working shareholder. This gave rise to the dispute whic h eventually led the parties to c ourt. 

**The plaintiff’s case** 

12     First, Loh c laimed that the shareholders of Hexa Chemic als ( _ie_ Loh himself and the shareholder defendants) c onduc ted themselves on the basis of mutual trust and c onfidenc e as if they were partners and Hexa Chemic als were a partnership. On that basis, Loh said he was entitled to and did repose trust in all the defendants and that they must be held to a higher standard of c orporate governanc e. Bec ause of the informality in whic h they ran the c ompany, they c onduc ted themselves as partners, trusting that eac h would do right by the other. 

13     Sec ondly, Loh c laimed that by failing to distribute the profits of Hexa Chemic als to all shareholders, the defendants had c learly c onduc ted themselves in a manner oppressive to him. The c ont inued distribution of the profits to the shareholder defendants in total disregard of Loh’s shareholdings unfairly disc riminated against or was otherwise prejudic ial to him as a shareholder of Hexa Chemic als. He protested but it was in vain. 

14     Thirdly, Loh c laimed that he was not paid direc tor’s fees even though he was a direc tor from 1 Oc tober 2005 to 31 Dec ember 2005. 

**The defendants’ case** 

15     First, the defendants denied that the shareholders of Hexa Chemic als had c onduc ted themselves on the basis of mutual trust and c onfidenc e as if they were partners and that Hexa Chemic als were a partnership. Rather, they argued that Hexa Chemic als was and always had been run as a c ompany both in fac t and in form. Further, the relationship between the shareholders of Hexa Chemic als _inter se_ was and had always been governed solely by the c ompany’s Memorandum and Artic les of Assoc iation (“M & A”). 

16     Sec ondly, the defendants stated that the direc tors of Hexa Chemic als had dec ided that it would be prudent not to distribute the c ompany’s profits to the shareholders by way of dividends; and that it would be proper to set aside the profits as business reserves for, _inter alia_ , the maintenanc e of c ash flow. Further, the defendants stated that the direc tors of Hexa Chemic als were paid direc tors’ fees; and the employees of Hexa Chemic als were paid inc entives as part of the remuneration pac kage for employees. There was a c lear understanding that eac h shareholder would have to work in order to be remunerated, no one was allowed to play a passive role and expec t his shares to generate passive inc ome like an investment. There were many more allegations made in defenc e to Loh’s c laim and they will be dealt with below. 

17     Thirdly, the defendants argued that Loh was not paid direc tor’s fees from 1 Oc tober 2005 to 31 Dec ember 2005 due to the non-performanc e of his duties as a direc tor. The defendants alleged that Loh had ordered stoc k without performing due diligenc e and thus c aused losses to Hexa Chemic als. Further, Loh was on leave from 29 November 2005 until he left Hexa Chemic als on 31 Dec ember 2005. 

**The law on minority oppression in relation to quasi-partnerships** 


## 163) 

## 164) 

18     The law on minority oppression, espec ially in relation to quasi-partnerships, has been well eluc idated by both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. Little will be gained by repeating them save to mention those princ iples that are applic able here. In my view, this c ase turned on its fac ts. 

19     From his c ase and written submissions tendered after the trial, Loh was in effec t applying for relief under s 216: 

 The Plaintiff’s prayer is in the alternative – 

 a) either that the 6th Defendant be wound up; or 

 b) the 1st to 5 th Defendants be ordered to purc hase the Plaintiff’s share in the 6th Defendants at suc h pric e and on suc h terms as the Court may deem fit and just. 

 In dec iding whic h of the 2 prayers would be the more appropriate in the c urrent c irc umstanc es, the Court’s discretion under s 216 “should be exerc ised with a view to bringing to an end or remedying the matters c omplained of.” 

 [emphasis added] 

20     Sec tion 216(1) of the Companies Ac t provides as follows: 

 Personal remedies in cases of oppression or injustice 

 216.(1) Any member or holder of a debenture of a c ompany or, in the c ase of a dec lared c ompany under Part IX, the Minister may apply to the Court for an order under this sec tion on the ground 

 ( a ) that the affairs of the c ompany are being c onduc ted or the powers of the direc tors are being exerc ised in a manner oppressive to one or more of the members or holders of debentures inc luding himself or in disregard of his or their interests as members, shareholders or holders of debentures of the c ompany; or 

 ( b ) that some ac t of the c ompany has been done or is threatened or that some resolution of the members, holders of debentures or any c lass of them has been passed or is proposed whic h unfairly disc riminates against or is otherwise prejudic ial to one or more of the members or holders of debentures (inc luding himself). 

21     In _Over & Over Ltd v Bonvests Holdings Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">[2010] 2 SLR 776</span> (“ _Over & Over_ ”), the Court of Appeal ruled at [70] that s 216 provides four alternative limbs under whic h relief may be granted oppression, disregard of a member's interest, unfair disc rimination or otherwise prejudic ial c onduc t. It went on to observe that “the four limbs are not to be read disjunc tively” and that “[t]he c ommon thread underpinning the entire sec tion is the element of unfairness.” It also affirmed (at [77]) the formulation of a test for s 216 whic h was set out in the Privy Counc il c ase o f _Re Kong Thai Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd_ [1978] 2 MLJ 227 and later c ited with approval in the Court of Appeal c ase of _Low Peng Boon v Low Janie and others and other appeals_ <span class="citation">[1999] 1 SLR(R) 337</span> at [43]: 

 "a visible departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation of the c onditions of fair play whic h a shareholder is entitled to expec t" 

22     There is unfairness when a shareholder’s legitimate expec tations are dashed. In _Over & Over_ , 


the Court of Appeal also highlighted the spec ial treatment of quasi-partnerships in relation to s 216 at [78], stating that in quasi-partnerships, members might well have legitimate expec tations not embodied in the c ompany’s c onstitutive doc uments: 

 “[C]ourts, in dec iding whether to grant relief under s 216 of the Companies Ac t, must take into ac c ount both the legal rights and the legitimate expec tations of members. While these legal rights and expectations are usually enshrined in the company's constitution in the majority of cases, a special class of quasi-partnership companies form an exception to this rule .” 

 [emphasis added] 

23     More spec ific ally, legitimate expec tations might arise from informal understandings between shareholders. The Court of Appeal went on to hold at [84] that: 

 Consistent with the above c onc erns, it is well-established that informal understandings and assumptions may be taken into account in determining whether the minority has been unfairly treated. Hoffman LJ insightfully summed up the position in Re Saul D Harrison & Sons plc [1995] 1 BCLC 14 (" Harrison ") when he stated, at 19-20: 

 Thus the personal relationship between a shareholder and those who c ontrol the c ompany may entitle him to say that it would in c ertain c irc umstanc es be unfair for them to exerc ise a power c onferred by the artic les upon the board or the c ompany in general meeting. I have in the past ventured to borrow from public law the term 'legitimate expectation' to desc ribe the c orrelative 'right' in the shareholder to whic h suc h a relationship may give rise. It often arises out of a fundamental understanding between the shareholders which formed the basis of their association but was not put into contractual form ... 

 [original emphasis in italic s; emphasis added in bold italic s] 

24     Not unexpec tedly, suc h informal understandings have been held to be more easily found in quasi-partnerships than in ordinary c ompanies (per Chan Seng Onn J in _Eng Gee Seng v Quek Choon Teck and others_ <span class="citation">[2010] 1 SLR 241</span> at [18] to [19]): 

 18 Quasi-partnerships, however, are formed based on mutual trust and c onfidenc e, and their c ontrollers ought to govern with a c ertain degree of integrity. Ac c ordingly, a higher standard of governanc e is expec ted of them as c ompared with c ontrollers of ordinary c ompanies. Therefore, there should be greater leeway for finding informal understandings and expectations. This view has been c learly eludic ated in c ases suc h as Sim Yong Kim v Evenstar Investments Pte Ltd <span class="citation">[2006] 3 SLR(R) 827</span> (" Sim Yong Kim ") and Borden. 

 19 Sim Yong Kim was a c ase c onc erning a quasi-partnership dec ided under s 254. Applying the reasoning of Re A Company , Re Saul D Harrison & Sons plc and O'Neill , it is also applic able in the present instanc e. There, the Court of Appeal distinguished between situations involving ordinary companies and that involving quasi-partnerships, implying that the court would be more willing to find informal understandings and expectations which could triumph over the formal documents in the latter situation when equitable considerations make it unfair for those conducting the affairs of the company to rely upon their strict legal powers. 

 [emphasis added] 

25     Chan J, however, also held (at [10]) that the onus is on the minority to show the existenc e of 


an informal understanding giving rise to the dashed expec tation whic h the minority c laims: 

 10 These "rational princ iples" [upon whic h the c onc ept of fairness is applied judic ially] c an be found in the law of c ontrac t as c omplemented by princ iples of equity. They apply so as to reflec t the princ iple that promises should be kept and agreements should be honoured. Thus, in the c ase of an ordinary c ompany, prima facie , the c ompany's formal doc uments lay down the basis of the assoc iation exhaustively. However, there c an also exist agreements, understandings or promises as between members of an assoc iation, whic h are not in those formal doc uments, but whic h may give rise to reasonable or legitimate expec tations on the part of minority members. The onus will then be on the minority members to show that such informal or implied understandings, giving rise to certain expectations, exist. Conduc t of the majority whic h c onflic ts with suc h expec tations may be c hallenged for being unfair. 

 [emphasis added] 

**Issues** 

26     I now c onsider the three issues that arise in this c ase: 

 (i) The first issue is whether Loh and the shareholder defendants had formed Hexa Chemic als as a quasi-partnership on the basis of mutual trust and c onfidenc e. 

 (ii) Following from that, the sec ond issue is whether Loh rightfully held any legitimate expec tations whic h were unfairly dashed by the defendants when they failed to distribute the profits of Hexa Chemic als to Loh in his c apac ity as a shareholder who had sinc e retired from the c ompany’s employment. If so, Loh would be entitled to remedies under s 216. 

 (iii) The third issue is whether Loh was entitled to direc tor’s fees for the period from 1 Oc tober 2005 to 31 Dec ember 2005. 

**(i) Quasi-partnership, mutual trust and confidence** 

27     The burden is on Loh to show that the relationship of the parties was akin to that of a partnership. In his pleaded c ase, Loh c ontended that Hexa Chemic als was entered into and run from it s inc eption as if it were a partnership. In his c losing submissions, Loh bac ktrac ked and submitted that a quasi-partnership does not require Hexa Chemic als to be entered into or run as if it were a partnership. Loh admitted that they c onsc iously c hose the c ompany as a vehic le and that no one used or disc ussed setting up a partnership. Only the direc tors were involved in the management dec isions. Wee and Chua never presumed to be entitled to partake in management of Hexa Chemic als, leaving that to Foo, Loh, Ko and Goh. That is c lear on the evidenc e and I so find. 

28     The parties c learly treated the c ompany struc ture as relevant and they were c onsc ious of the position of direc tors, shareholders and employees. They had a c orporate hierarc hy in plac e and they c ertainly did not behave like a partnership in any sense. They paid themselves salaries, direc tor’s fees and inc entives and suc h payments were booked as expenses. In addition they also ploughed bac k the profits. That too was by agreement. The princ ipal movers of Hexa Chemic als c onsc iously adopted a c orporate struc ture to limit liability. They also ran Hexa Chemic als in ac c ordanc e with their M & A. Loh admitted that no one disc ussed a partnership set-up when they were planning to set up on their own [note: 1] and indeed Foo testified emphatic ally that a partnership would not work, and that there had 

to be a hierarc hy and the ac c ountability system whic h flowed from that. [note: 2] 


## Q. 

## A. 

29     The group did not operate as a partnership in any sense whilst in Getz Bros. They were employees and they c ertainly did not assoc iate on the basis of a personal relationship involving mutual c onfidenc e there or in Hexa Chemic als. They were unrelated to eac h other. There was no evidenc e 

that they met soc ially outside work. [note: 3] On the c ontrary, there was evidenc e, whic h I ac c ept, that Loh was in the habit of ignoring people and Ko was surprised at Loh’s wedding when Loh introduc ed his wife to him. Loh did not introduc e his wife to the other defendants and the fac t that Ko was surprised shows they were not as c lose-knit as Loh put forward. In fac t when pressed, Loh c ould not point to anything muc h more than that they lunc hed often together in Getz Bros and that they all worked hard and “were very c lose” as a team. At the end of the day, he added they were a quasi-partnership bec ause they also plotted to c ome out together to do their business, they dreamt the same dream, they “ac tualised” their dream, they went through the ordeal of being sued and went 

through great pain. [note: 4] The defendants’ evidenc e, whic h I ac c ept, did not support suc h a sanguine view of their c loseness. Eac h person had his own individual interest when c onsidering when to join. Loh c lashed a number of times with Foo. Although the others wanted to, Foo was not ready to move from Getz Bros until there was a c hange of management whic h gave him no support. Wee only joined Hexa Chemic als in 2002. 

30     During the c ourse of c ross-examination it emerged that when Loh subsc ribed for his shares as well as a portion of Wee’s shares, in antic ipation of Wee taking up his shares at some later point in time, Loh c harged Wee, unknown to the rest, interest on the amount advanc ed. None of the others c harged Wee or Chua interest for holding their portion of the shares or taking up their proportion of the shareholders’ loan. I find this, as I find Loh’s retort to the fac t that the others did not c harge an 

interest element: “That’s their c hoic e”, rather ironic given his c laim as to how c lose they were. [note: 5] 

31     From my findings of fac t above, Loh has failed to prove that the parties assoc iated as a quasipartnership with mutual trust and c onfidenc e in eac h other. The evidenc e c learly shows the parties deliberately adopted a c orporate struc ture and ran it in ac c ordanc e with that struc ture and their M&A. 

**(ii) Legitimate Expectations** 

32     Even if I had found that Hexa Chemic als was indeed a quasi-partnership between Loh and the shareholder defendants as Loh submitted, I hold that Loh would still fail as he did not rightfully hold any legitimate expec tations whic h were unfairly dashed by the defendants. 

**_Loh’s evidence_** 

33     In essenc e, Loh said that when he retired, the shareholder defendants had an obligation to c onsider how to c ontinue sharing Hexa Chemic als’ gross profits with him as a non-working shareholder. Loh took that position on c ross examination: 

 I see. If that's the c ase, then all the direc tors' fees has nothing to do with equity distribution, right? 

 Oh yeah. After I've left -I mean, things have c hanged. Only when I say "equity distribution", it's only when I was there. After I left there is a new situation, a new struc ture. Then bec ause it was originally formed with all the working shareholders, now the situation has c hanged.

## A. 

 One has retired because of health reasons. Things have changed. So you must change the structure, the dividend structure, the way you give directors' fees. You have to re-look on all of this so that everyone will benefit. It's not that you just give myself dividend and then the rest, don't give them. Everyone will get dividends ac c ording to the shareholding, then they also will get the direc tors' fees if they are direc tors. 

 [emphasis added] 

34     In simple terms, Loh was asserting his entitlement to a share of the gross profits c urrently set aside for the working shareholders whic h were distributed in the form of direc tors’ fees and employee inc entive payments. As a non-working shareholder, he c ould only have rec eived suc h a share in his c apac ity as a shareholder – in the form of dividends. 

35     Loh founded his expec tation of dividends on the basis that c ommon shareholders should be taken c are of: 

 And the proper resolutions would have to be passed for dividends to be dec lared in Hexa Chemic als, right? 

 Because the situation has changed, because there is now a common shareholder, so I presume that they should actually take care of the shareholder. 

 [emphasis added] 

36     Further, Loh seemed to have viewed his entitlement as a form of pension, available to working shareholders who retire bec ause of health reasons: 

 Mr Loh, you see, if you can get -if a person can get 80 per cent of his previous drawings 

- let's use that word for the moment -- _even after he resigns, don't you think that all the shareholders would probably resign?_ 

 No, they have no health reason. I have health reason. I actually not resigned, I retire. I retired for health reasons, as stated in my letter. So it is not the same as just walking away. And you press me for 80 per c ent: ac tually to me it doesn't matter whether 80, 70 per c ent or 60 per c ent. If I c an some kind of return, I would be happy, but this is already gone bec ause there is no going bac k. 

 [emphasis added] 

37     As for how muc h Loh would have been satisfied with, he was not sure: 

 Let me bring you bac k to my question before you talked about public c ompanies. My question was this: how muc h more would the direc tors' fees be, than the dividend you think should be paid to you? 

 I don't have a fixed mind. I just want some return for my shareholding. I don't demand what numbers and all that. I never have thought any demand, but up to now I get zero.

## A. 

_The 1999 “no work, no pay” understanding_ 

38     The defendants’ strongly denied Loh’s c laims, and alleged that on the c ontrary, there was in fac t an informal but very c lear understanding between the parties that “no work” meant “no pay”. The defendants c ontended that this informal understanding arose in 1999. 

39     In 1999, Foo c onsidered taking no-pay leave to pursue a business opportunity in Indonesia for a period of two years. He c ommunic ated this to the other direc tors as well as his expec tation of a share of Hexa Chemic als’ profits if it did well. However, the other direc tors would not pay or share profits with him if he took no-pay leave. Foo testified under c ross-examination: 

 And in princ iple, they already disagreed that you c ould leave the c ompany; you c ould take no pay leave? 

 In princ iple, if I want to do it, then I have to abide by the direc tors' dec ision on whether I c an go on leave, go on two years leave, but the c ondition is that there will be no pay and there is no share of profit. And bec ause of that, I hesitated, and in the end I abort the whole projec t.” 

40     This was further substantiated by Wee’s testimony in c ourt, stating that at the age of 63, he c ontinued to work bec ause he knew that retirement meant no inc ome. 

 And have you heard of the views of these direc tors that, if you don't work, you don't get money? 

 This sentenc e has been haunting my mind for many, many years before I get into Hexa. When I was still with Getz, the 2nd defendant told that they made up some kind of a landmark, landmark understanding that no work, no pay, in relation to the 1st defendant who wanted to leave to Indonesia to his, I heard something like that, for 2 years. 

 But bec ause of the plaintiff, 2nd defendant, 3 rd defendant's dec ision, and they enforc e it, the 1st defendant dec ided to abort his plans to go to Indonesia. And that was told to me by the 2nd defendant, and that goes into my mind that I have to work in order to get money. I don't have a free ticket. Your Honour, I'm 63 years old. 

 I was just going to ask you that. 

 I nurse the desire to retire, but if I stop, I have no money. At the moment, I still need money for a while, until suc h time, if I prove myself that I'm useless, not providing, not an asset to the c ompany, I will bow down and c all it a day. 

 [emphasis added] 

41     On c ross-examination, Goh also gave testimony that was c onsistent with that Foo’s and Wee’s statements. As regards the “no work no pay” understanding, she said: 

 And if Mr Loh, after his retirement, if he was not working and yet rec eive money, then you felt that the situation would be unfair to you who was working? 

 That is definitely. Bec ause there is a prec edent set in1999 where the plaintiff was there too. He knew about it.

Also, like Wee, she said she would prefer to resign and rec eive payouts in the c apac ity of a nonworking shareholder if this was possible: 

 Did you go to Mr Foo to say that if Mr Loh was given a good pac kage when he left, then you would also c onsider leaving the c ompany? 

 I c annot remember, but if suc h thing happen, why not? I rather -I mean, resign and stay at home and be a housewife, to look after my c hildren. 

**_Findings_** 

42     On the evidenc e, I find and hold that Loh has not made out his c ase that he rightfully held legitimate expec tations whic h were unfairly c rushed by the defendants when they failed to distribute the profits of Hexa Chemic als to him in his c apac ity as a shareholder after he had retired from the c ompany’s employment. As a preliminary point, Loh was unable to give any evidenc e on how or when this informal understanding c ame about muc h less elaborate on the terms or details of this understanding whic h gave rise to his alleged legitimate expec tations. The only point that initially stood out like a flag was that after he retired, there was a c hange in the remuneration struc ture. But when the reasons for that c hange are examined, it shows that the c hange had a legitimate basis. There was no c ommerc ial unfairness, prejudic ial c onduc t or unfair disc rimination. 

43     I begin by setting out three important fac tual findings whic h pertain to the bac kground of this dispute. The first important fac t was that Hexa Chemic als needed c apital to c arry out its business. The evidenc e shows that the starting point was the c apital base Hexa Chemic als needed to c arry on its business of buying industrial and c ommerc ial c hemic als in large quantities and re-selling them in smaller quantities to its retail c ustomers. Borrowing the entire c apital would have entailed a high c ost. Henc e they reduc ed the c ost of their c apital by their equity subsc ription and shareholders’ loans. They were “stoc kists” who had to know what c hemic als were needed by their c ustomers and therefore what to buy and where to buy it from. They also needed a good inventory and c ollec tion c ont rol as well as c apital to fund the lag between having to pay their suppliers and princ ipals and rec eiving payment from their c ustomers. It was balanc ed by a proportion from the subsc ription for shares and the shareholders’ loan. The share c apital was therefore not seen by the shareholders as an investment in the c ommerc ial sense, it was for working c apital. How many shares eac h person was to hold was worked out and the loan would be in proportion to their shareholding. Loh was not able to dispute this. It was best put by Goh who gave the following evidenc e on c ross-examination that the equity c ontributions of the shareholders were made to fund Hexa Chemic als’ business and not for investment gain: 

 Did it ever oc c ur to you, after the plaintiff left the c ompany, that as a shareholder, he should have a share of the profits of the c ompany? 

 In Hexa c ontext, I never think of that. 

 Right. 

 Why did you not think of it? 

 Bec ause you see, your Honour, we put in the shares. It is actually for the funding of the business. We never think about -it is not an investment company, you know. I put in my equity side, is actually to fund the business. That's about all. 


## Q. 

## A. 

## Q. 

## A. 

 I mean, we never think about how much the appreciation of the share and all that. I really never think about it. And the reserve that we put it inside is actually to maintain the cashflow, your Honour -We never think about the appreciation of the share , bec ause if I want to buy share, I c an always buy when the ec onomy is down, like SQ, DBS and all this, where I c an make a lot of money. 

 That's what I think, I don't know, bec ause we are a private c ompany, it's a small c ompany. That's what my feel. I don't know. 

 [emphasis added] 

44     The sec ond most important point was that everyone had to work hard to produc e the inc ome. Their main asset was their personal skills. The agenc ies were mostly non-exc lusive and their suc c ess would depend upon their knowledge of the business and the goodwill they had built up with their suppliers, princ ipals and c ustomers over the years. The business was a c ompetitive one, there were others around, and some with deeper poc kets, who c ould do the same thing. I also ac c ept the defendants’ evidenc e that towards the end of 2005, the going got rough from the mergers of suppliers (inc luding a major supplier whic h c aused Hexa Chemic als to lose its sole importer status) and c hanges 

in the market plac e, whic h threatened Hexa Chemic als’ c ustomer base. [note: 6] T hat is why Hexa Chemic al’s work forc e was, until the end of 2005, only the six of them and one part-time book-keeper, (henc e the name ‘Hexa’ representing the six of them). That was why they all ac c epted low salaries, and for the princ ipal movers, lower than what they obtained from Getz Bros. The reward would c ome from the profits they made. They c ould not and did not c arry any passengers. The c learest expression of this c ame from an agreement in 1999 amongst the princ ipal shareholders, and ac c epted by the two minority shareholders, that if someone did not work, he would not get paid. 

45     Thirdly, it is undeniable that from inc eption to 2005, Hexa Chemic als did not dec lare any dividends. It was also c lear, and I so find, that there was an agreement to plough bac k profits. Loh 

himself agreed that the direc tors set a target reserve of at least $500,000. [note: 7] However, as noted above until the end of 2005, all the shareholders were working shareholders. 

_The 1999 “no work, no pay” understanding_ 

46     I also find the following fac ts as proved by the defendants. In 1999, Foo wanted to stop working in Hexa Chemic als for two years to pursue a business opportunity with his brother-in-law in Indonesia. Foo also expressed the expec tation that he would c ontinue to share in the profits of Hexa Chemic als while he was gone. The others protested, some vigorously. One of the latter was Loh. There was some argument and debate on this issue. 

47     Loh quite naturally did not want to ac knowledge any “no work, no pay” agreement. He said he objec ted to Foo taking two years off bec ause Hexa Chemic als needed Foo as the c aptain of its ship: 

 And my instruc tions are, and my c lients will testify, that everyone in the disc ussion, inc luding you, agreed that if the 1st defendant was not working in Hexa Chemic als, he c ould not get any remuneration, inc luding share of profits? 

 I disagree. 

 That never happened? 

 The disc ussion didn't even progress to that stage, bec ause when he said he wanted to go to

 Indonesia to help his brother-in-law to develop the China market, I was the first one to objec t. 

 So, we didn't even go to disc uss about profit and all that, bec ause I was telling him: how can a ship without captain. That means who is going to steer the ship. And we didn't even progress to the next stage of disc ussion. It was a very short disc ussion, in a very informal environment, and there was no proc ession to the next stage. 

 [emphasis added] 

However, when pressed, Loh also ac c epted that if Foo was not doing his job, he should not be paid: 

 You wanted the 1st defendant to stay and bear his share of the responsibilities for the work of Hexa Chemic als, right? 

 That's c orrec t, to lead the c ompany. 

 That was his job in Hexa Chemic als; right? 

 Exac tly. 

 And if he wasn't doing his job, he should not be paid by Hexa Chemicals; right? 

 Correct. 

 [emphasis added] 

48     Counsel for the defendants suggested to Loh that a sec ond reason for Loh’s objec tion was prec isely what Loh had just ac c epted, _ie_ that if Foo was not doing his job, he should not be paid. However, Loh denied that and reiterated that his objec tion was bec ause Hexa Chemic als needed a leader: 

 No, I'm asking you this: I'm saying to you, that is why you objec ted. 

 Let me make it c lear to you. I don't want to be unfair to you. I asked you, if he wasn't doing his job, the 1st defendant should not be paid by Hexa Chemicals. 

 You said "Correct", and then I asked you, "And that was why you objected?"; correct? 

 Not c orrec t. 

 What is not c orrec t about it? 

 Because I objected, not because of pay or profit sharing; it's because we need a leader, and he should be there , and he should be there to lead us, and not go away to develop China market for his brother-in-law. 

 That -the pay issue and all that, was not -never in my mind, because it shouldn't happen in the first place, so there was -it never in my mind about pay or profit. 

 [emphasis added]

In answer to a question I put to him, Loh also said that if Foo was not doing his job, he should not be 

paid and if Foo had wanted to go to Indonesia nonetheless, he might as well resign. [note: 8] 

49     Against Loh’s evidenc e, the defendants testified that the “no work, no pay” agreement was the outc ome of the debate among the direc tors arising from Foo’s proposal to leave Hexa Chemic als to pursue the opportunity in Indonesia. Although, as stated above, Loh had said that if Foo wanted to go to Indonesia then he would have told Foo that Foo might as well _resign_ , I note that c ounsel for Loh herself asked Foo (in c ross-examination) whether there was an agreement among the direc tors that Foo c ould take _no pay leave_ : 

 And in princ iple, they [inc luding Loh] already disagreed that you c ould leave the c ompany; you c ould take no pay leave? 

 [emphasis added] 

50     Foo answered that he was allowed to go on leave but the c ondition was that he would not be paid and not be allowed to share in the profit. Thus, he did not go to Indonesia: 

 In princ iple, if I want to do it, then I have to abide by the direc tors' dec ision on whether I c an go on leave, go on two years leave, but the c ondition is that there will be no pay and there is no share of profit. And bec ause of that, I hesitated, and in the end I abort the whole projec t. 

 You see, at that time when I brought this up, is bec ause we only have two agenc ies, the rest are still not c oming yet. So of c ourse I don't blame, you know, the rest of the direc tors of their worry about the survival of the c ompany. So I understand, and I understand that, and I support their dec ision for having all these c onditions laid. 

 So sinc e then, we also have a disc ussion that, you know, we must be working in this c ompany, otherwise none of us will have remuneration. So that is the agreed principle that we set and we follow through until now. 

 ... 

 And you didn't have -this was not reduc ed into writing? 

 As far as I c an rec all, we have a disc ussion in the c onferenc e room among ourselves, among the direc tors. 

 But we don't minute it up, I don't remember writing anything on that. 

 [emphasis added] 

51     The establishment of the “no work, no pay” princ iple as stated by Foo was c orroborated by Ko’s testimony on c ross-examination, when he referred to a meeting in 1999 whic h was attended by Loh, Foo, Goh and himself. With respec t to the outc ome of that meeting, he stated as follows: 

 To be fair to you, are you referring to paragraph 27 of your affidavit, on page 9? 

 Yes, this is the one I am referring to. This is the meeting that we had in the c onferenc e room of Hexa Chemic als, and we all sat down at the c onferenc e table and we were talking about

 Gilbert's intention to take no pay leave, to work in Indonesia for his brother-in-law. 

 The final decision that we have reached was that no work, no pay, including a share of the profit, if the business does well. 

 At this alleged meeting in 1999, it was agreed that if you do not work, you do not get paid? 

 Yes. 

 And this was a meeting of all the direc tors of the c ompany? 

 1999, four direc tors -yes. 

 Yes. This agreement is not minuted, isn't it? There is no written evidenc e of this agreement; isn't that so,Mr Ko? 

 That is true. There is no written minutes of this -

 [emphasis added] 

52     Goh, who was present at that meeting in 1999, was not c ross-examined on Foo’s proposal to leave Hexa Chemic als to pursue the opportunity in Indonesia. However, she too made a referenc e to the “no work, no pay” princ iple, whic h she said Loh knew about: 

 And if Mr Loh, after his retirement, if he was not working and yet rec eive money, then you felt that the situation would be unfair to you who was working? 

 That is definitely. Because there is a precedent set in1999 where the plaintiff was there too. He knew about it. 

 [emphasis added] 

53     As for Wee and Chua, Wee testified that Ko had told him of the “no work, no pay” understanding (whic h Wee desc ribed as “landmark”) when he was still with Getz (see [41] above); Chua also testified that she thought she heard about the dec ision on the “no work, no pay” princ iple 

from Goh, even though she did not partic ipate in the debate whic h led to it. [note: 9] 

54     I found two points signific ant. The first was that when Foo and Ko were c ross-examined regarding the direc tors’ reac tions to Foo’s proposal to leave Hexa Chemic als to pursue the opportunity in Indonesia, c ounsel for Loh did not suggest to them that the objec tions to Foo’s proposal were not based on a “no work, no pay” princ iple, but rather based on the reason that Foo was required to lead Hexa Chemic als, as Loh said his reason for objec ting was. Rather, c ounsel for Loh merely attac ked Foo’s and Ko’s testimony on the basis that the alleged “no work, no pay” understanding was not put down in writing – whic h Foo and Ko c andidly admitted to (see above at [50] and [51] respec tively). I also noted that c ounsel for Loh did not even c hallenge Goh on the meeting whic h allegedly led to the “no work, no pay” understanding. Ko had stated on c ross-examination earlier that Goh was present at that meeting as well (see [51] above). 

55     The sec ond point whic h I found notable was that it was undisputed (see [49] above where I noted that c ounsel for Loh herself asked Foo whether there was an agreement that Foo c ould take _no pay leave_ ) that in 1999, the direc tors did allow Foo to leave Hexa Chemic als for Indonesia on _no pay_

_leave_ , _ie_ that he would not rec eive pay or a share of the Hexa Chemic als’ profits during his leave period. In my view, this arrangement suggested that the c onc ern of the direc tors (besides Foo) was that Foo should not be paid if he were not working _ie_ when Foo wanted to resume working, he c ould then be paid. It seemed to me that if the primary c onc ern was that Foo, the so-c alled c aptain and leader of Hexa Chemic als, was abandoning ship and leaving it to sink – then the other direc tors would have, like Loh said, told Foo that he “might as well resign”. It seemed more likely that they would pull out all the stops in getting Foo to stay, as opposed to simply granting him no-pay leave and allowing him to return whenever he pleased. 

56     I should note that Loh was not a satisfac tory witness. He had a fixation that he was hard done by and kept repeating the same thing – they were very c lose. Regarding his demeanour as a witness, he failed to answer questions, there were long pauses before he answered some awkward questions and he often avoided answering direc tly any questions whic h showed up his position as untenable. He seldom made eye c ontac t with anyone and kept staring down at a point on the floor next to the Bar table even when he was answering questions. The defendant’s c losing and reply submissions c ontain many examples of these instanc es and it would take too long to set them out here. The defendants performed far better under c ross-examination. They were c andid and seldom hesitated. Many of their answers had the ring of truth to them. 

57     Considering the evidenc e from both sides, I ac c ept the evidenc e from the defendants, and find and hold that they all ac c epted the “no work, no pay” princ iple right from 1999. 

58     Given the nature of their business, c ommon sense dic tates that there c an be no other alternative. If not, it would in fac t be an inc entive for the shareholders to retire, let the others slog and make the profits, and c ome forward to share in the spoils. Wee said, not without signific anc e, that he was already 63 years old and would take retirement if he c ould c ontinue to rec eive money after he retired; but he knew that if he did not work, he would not share in the profits. That was the agreement. Sinc e he needed the money for a while more, he had to work. Goh gave the same reason, stating that she would be better off being at home with her family. In his c ross-examination, Loh was unable to answer this indisputable point: 

 If everybody retires, then who will earn the money? 

 But they have no health problem and they are not of retiring age. 

 Is there a retirement age in the c ompany's M & A, for example? 

 No. 

 In the employment c ontrac ts? 

 No. 

 There is no retirement age spec ified for Hexa Chemic als; c orrec t? 

 No. 

59     There was c ertainly no element at all of reward for investment risk as far as putting up the share c apital of Hexa Chemic als was c onc erned (see also Goh’s testimony at [43] above). 

_Equity ratio as a proxy for workload_ 


60     Before Loh’s retirement in 2005, the gross profits of Hexa Chemic als were primarily distributed to its shareholders ac c ording to their respec tive shareholdings. I ac c ept the defendants’ explanation for this the gross profits were distributed as remuneration for work done and the equity ratio was a proxy for what the shareholders thought was eac h shareholder’s ability to generate work and inc ome and what therefore their respec tive workload was going to be. Loh also agreed that the direc tors’ 

fees and inc entives were paid for work done and not bec ause the rec ipients were shareholders. [note: 10] Loh’s duties as a direc tor 

61     I also ac c ept the following evidenc e from the defendants and find them as fac ts. Loh was slipping at the time he tendered his resignation in Oc tober 2005. There was an email from an important princ ipal, Eastman Chemic als, severely c ritic ising Loh in unflattering terms and threatening Loh: 

 “If you [referring to Loh] still do not have any c lue about your business then. I think I need to something in [ sic ] soon. As I mentioned in the meeting many things has [ sic ] c hanged this way of reporting is not ac c eptable.” [note: 11] 

62     Loh was c learly embarrassed in c ross-examination by this email and pretended he did not 

understand what the writer, one Gunawan Suryawan, was saying in the email. [note: 12] Loh also made some fundamental mistakes in ordering some c hemic als and c aused Hexa Chemic als some loss. In one example, he ordered a quantity of a “single c ustomer produc t” ( _ie_ brought in for sale to only one c ustomer) in exc ess of what the c ustomer required without asking for an additional blanket purc hase order to c over the exc ess quantity, thereby leaving Hexa Chemic als with unnec essary inventory. In another example, Loh ordered additional 907.2 kg, in May 2005, of a c ertain c hemic al despite having 750 kg of the c hemic al already in stoc k for more than a year; moreover, he failed to realise that the c ustomer had substituted that item with a c heaper alternative and had stopped buying it from Hexa Chemic als. 

_Loh’s resignation_ 

63     It is not disputed that on or about January 2004, Loh tendered a first resignation letter, requested that his loan of $151,500 to Hexa Chemic als be repaid and said he hoped to sell his shares. This resignation was subsequently withdrawn. But it c aused the other direc tors to set aside a higher surplus of reserves for Financ ial Year 2005 in c ase they had to repay Loh’s portion of the loan. They must have sensed that he might not stay on for very long. On or about 12 Oc tober 2010, Foo asked Loh to write to Hexa Chemic als c onfirming that he would not ask for interest on his loan on the c ondition that Hexa Chemic als would fully redeem the loan by way of monthly instalments from 2006 to 2008. As a prudent measure, the remaining direc tors also started making provision for paying bac k the other shareholders’ loans over a three year period. To date, the shareholder defendants have only had one third of their loans to Hexa Chemic als repaid. 

64     On 31 Oc tober 2005, Loh tendered his resignation, giving two months’ notic e, c iting health reasons. It is important to note that his resignation as a direc tor was entirely voluntary. No one pushed him to resign. He was in fac t offered a c onsultanc y role by Foo but Loh refused it. Loh asked the other direc tors to inform the bankers of his resignation and asked that he be released from the joint and several guarantee to the banks as sec urity for the loans made to Hexa Chemic als. This was done. Loh was released from all the bank guarantees. Loh’s loan has also been fully repaid. As noted above, repayment of the loans to the others was halted after Dec ember 2006 as it was required to maintain Hexa Chemic al’s c ashflow. 


_Hexa Chemicals after Loh’s resignation_ 

65     I also find that Loh’s resignation also c ame at a time when Hexa Chemic als was fac ing a tough market and great c hallenges due to market c hanges. Hexa Chemic als had also just lost its biggest c ustomer, Akzo Nobel, whic h ac c ording to Ko ac c ounted for about 23% of their revenues. This was not c hallenged. Suppliers merged with others whic h already had distributors. Trading on the internet bec ame more prevalent and the role of the middleman was being eroded. Some shareholders felt Loh 

bailed out when the ship was fac ing ‘c hoppy’ waters. Suc h views are not without foundation. [note: 13] I find that when Loh retired, the others had to double up as their number had dropped from six to 

five; and the one who dropped out was one of the main workers. Ko, espec ially, had to take over the princ ipals and c ustomers that Loh usually dealt with. They had to attend more trade shows, travel more often, meet new suppliers and try to get new agenc y lines. They struggled hard but they got through the diffic ult period. Ko and Goh then approac hed Foo and asked for a restruc tured remuneration pac kage to plac e greater emphasis on performanc e. As noted above, Foo took time to t hink about it and subsequently agreed. Foo testified, and I ac c ept his evidenc e, that he had to do this to prevent others from following in the footsteps of Loh, _ie_ retiring and leaving him alone in Hexa 

Chemic als. [note: 14] This was his top priority. He c ould not afford to lose any more key people. Goh herself testified, and I also ac c ept her evidenc e, that if she c ould resign as a direc tor and still rec eive a share of the profits, as Loh was proposing, then she too might as well resign as a direc tor and stay home to look after the c hildren, (see [41] above). 

66     This revised remuneration struc ture was understandable. An amount, as usual, would be set aside for reserves. The direc tors would dec ide and set aside a total amount to be reserved for remuneration and inc entives at the end of the year. There was a flat inc entive payment c omponent and the balanc e would be distributed as to half, given to shareholders ac c ording to their perc entage shareholding, and the other half given to working shareholders based on their performanc e, _ie_ , the inc entive c omponent. The direc tors would rec eive direc tors’ fees out of the inc entive allowanc e c omponent. Foo’s evidenc e was that he needed more flexibility and he needed to properly reward those who were bringing in the revenue. After Loh’s first resignation letter in January 2005, whic h was withdrawn, Hexa Chemic als hired one Ms Jennifer Chen as a sales engineer on 30 September 2005. This was just as well as Loh tendered his resignation for the sec ond time one month later. Hexa Chemic als then hired a c lerk sometime on or about 10 April 2007, another sales engineer sometime in 2008 and yet one more sales engineer in 2009. 

67     I find that it was through the re-doubled efforts of the remaining members of the team that made this expansion possible. I also find that after a dip in revenue c aused by Loh’s departure, the remaining team built it bac k up. There was an inc rease in the revenue from some $8.9 million in 2006 and $8.2 million in 2007 to $10.68 million in 2008 and $9.45 million in 2009. Loh did not c ontribute to any of this. At the end of the day, Loh was not able to prove that the defendants dipped into the reserves and profited themselves at his expense after he left. That is simply not true as a fac t. There was no injustic e in the c irc umstanc es and fac ts of this c ase, neither was there c ommerc ial unfairness. 

_The defendants’ offer to purchase Loh’s shares_ 

68     I now c ome to another point of note although it is of no legal c onsequenc e in view of my judgment. The defendants offered to purc hase Loh’s shares in ac c ordanc e with the proc edure set out in the M&A. However, Loh ignored the presc ribed proc edure whic h bound his sale of his shares. 

69     Between 23 Marc h 2009 and February 2010 there was an exc hange of letters that c ulminated in 


Loh’s demand to be paid a staggering sum of $1.1 million for his shares and the shareholder defendants’ c ounter-offer of $315,000 whic h was about 14% below valuation. Loh had first suggested Hexa Chemic als engage a reputable ac c ounting firm to value the shares and he would seek a sec ond professional opinion if nec essary. The defendants invited Loh to issue an “Artic le 29” notic e to transfer his shares under the M&A; and stated that the fair value of Hexa Chemic al’s shares would be determined by its auditors in ac c ordanc e with Artic le 31 of the M&A. Loh replied that he was seeking advic e before providing a more substantive response. Loh then c hanged his position, saying that he had no wish to offer his shares in the c ompany at that point in time and alleged for the first time that Hexa Chemic als was formed by its founding members on terms similar to a partnership. Loh also said he was prepared to c onsider selling his shares at $11.27 per share or $1,183,350 for his 21% shareholding. On 21 July 2009, the c ompany’s auditors, presumably at the behest of the defendants, determined a fair value to be $3.50 per share. The defendants then offered to purc hase Loh’s shares at $315,000 (working out to $3.00 per share). The Defendants expec ted Loh to c ome bac k to negotiate but Loh initiated these proc eedings. 

_Loh had no legitimate expectation of dividends_ 

70     Having found that there is no relationship of mutual trust and c onfidenc e between the parties whic h gives rise to a quasi-partnership; and having found that there is no informal understanding between the parties whic h engenders Loh’s legitimate expec tation to have been paid dividends; I also find that no suc h legitimate expec tation arises from Hexa Chemic als’ c onstitutive doc uments or on any of the other fac ts of this c ase. Loh was not treated unfairly simply by virtue of the fac t that he did not rec eive dividends from Hexa Chemic als. Indeed, in her book, _Minority Shareholders' Rights and Remedies_ (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2007), Margaret Chew points out (at p 149) that: 

 Generally speaking, a shareholder c annot c ompel a c ompany to dec lare dividends. The dec laration of dividends and the quantum of dividends to be dec lared are business dec isions to be made by the board of direc tors. Typic ally, the board of direc tors rec ommend a dividend and the shareholders dec lare it. The failure to rec ommend or effec t the dec laration of dividends does not itself amount to unfair c onduc t impeac hable under sec tion 216 of the Companies Ac t. 

**(iii) Whether Loh was entitled to director’s fees** 

71     Finally, as for Loh’s c omplaint that Hexa did not pay him direc tor’s fees for the period from Oc tober to Dec ember 2005, I have found above that Loh had not performed his duties properly as a direc tor and had c aused Hexa Chemic als loss. I have also found that Loh had been c ritic ised by an important princ ipal as having “no c lue” about his business. Loh’s response to the defendants’ submissions was c ompletely unsatisfac tory – saying simply this in his submissions: 

 Although there is no polic y of making employees personally responsible for losses, the 1st to 5th Defendants now seek to make the Plaintiff personally responsible for a loss of less than $10,000. [note: 15] 

72     On the findings that I have made, inc luding (but not limited to) the basis for and manner of the payment of direc tor’s fees by Hexa Chemic als, as well as, Loh’s performanc e as a direc tor during this period, I find that the other direc tors and shareholders had reason to withhold his direc tors fees for this period. I therefore dismiss Loh’s c omplaint and c laim in this respec t as well. 

**Conclusion** 

73     Having found that Loh was not treated unfairly by the defendants, I dismiss Loh’s c laim as he 


has not made out any c ase for relief under s 216. It is c lear that this c ourt c annot exerc ise or assume jurisdic tion to grant relief under s 216 unless Loh has first of all established a c ase of oppression and/or disc riminatory and/or prejudic ial c onduc t amounting to c ommerc ial unfairness under s 216: see _Hoban Steven Maurice Dixon and another v Scanlon Graeme John and others_. <span class="citation">[2005] 2 SLR(R) 632</span> (“ _Hoban Steven_ ”) per Rajah J, as he then was, at [12]. Although this c ase went on appeal in Civil Appeal No 129 of 2004, this part of the ruling was not disturbed (see _Hoban Steven Maurice Dixon and another v Scanlon Graeme John and others_ [2007] 2 SLR(R) at [12]). 

74     The parties are therefore left with their c ontrac tual and other remedies. Muc h as I would like to resolve the dispute between the parties, _eg_ , by ordering a buy-out and spec ifying the terms or basis on whic h it should be done, I c annot do so as a matter of law. In _Hoban Steven_ , the parties agreed that they were dropping their disputes and not litigating the s 216 issues, leaving the issue of the exit mec hanism to be c ontested. This is not the c ase here. 

75     I express my hope that the defendants will offer to buy Loh’s shares at a fair pric e so that the parties c an part ways amic ably and move on from this unhappy state of affairs without the need for further litigation. I note that the defendants have previously offered to buy Loh’s shares for $315, (to be fair to them, they expec ted Loh to c ome bac k to negotiate), when the c ompany’s auditors valued them at $367,500. While I express no views on the fairness of those partic ular figures and how they were arrived at, it would seem to me that it would serve the parties well to mediate their differenc es over the share pric e. 

76     Although I have not heard c ounsel on c osts, the defendants have c ontended that this c laim should be dismissed with c osts. They have suc c eeded on all fronts and Loh has not suc c eeded on any issue. I therefore award c osts to the defendants, if not agreed, then to be taxed. Mr Alvin Cheng, c ounsel for Hexa Chemic als quite c orrec tly took the position that this was a shareholder dispute that did not involve the c ompany. He thus took no part in the trial. I therefore make no order as to c osts for Hexa Chemic als.
