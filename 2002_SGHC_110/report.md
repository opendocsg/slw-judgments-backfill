## Judgment 

### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

1\. This is an appeal by the defendants against the order of the learned Assistant Registrar of the Supreme Court made on 23 April 2002, requiring the defendants to provide the plaintiffs with a number of doc uments by 5 p.m. on 7 May 2002. Failure to c omply with the order would have resulted in the plaintiffs entering judgment against the defendants. The bac kground to the present appeal is provided below. 

2\. The plaintiffs, a group of about 4,895 disgruntled members of a proprietary soc ial c lub, have brought this ac tion against the c lub, the defendants herein, based on ac tionable misrepresentation and breac h of c ontrac t. The purpose of this ac tion, as stated in the plaintiffs’ statement of c laim is to s e e k dec laratory orders and c ompensation for the said alleged ac tionable misrepresentation and 


breac h of c ontrac t, reportedly c ontained in a set of doc uments whic h the plaintiffs term as a ‘c ommon law prospec tus’, promising lavish rec eption and fac ilities to all selec ted and ac c epted by the defendants as members of the c lub. 

3\. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued and c aused to be despatc hed to members of the public the said c ommon law prospec tus. Ac c ording to the plaintiffs, the said c ommon law prospec tus c omprised: 

 (a) a letter of invitation dated 9 November 1996; 

 (b) a doc ument giving general information in the form of questions and answers; and 

 (c ) a broc hure. 

4\. The plaintiffs further aver in their statement of c laim that the said prospec tus c ontained, inter alia, the following highlights either by express representation or by way of nec essary implic ations: 

 (a) It was planned that the Club would have nearly 600 c ar park lots for the use of the members. 

 (b) "Raffles Town Club members will enjoy unparalleled privileges and fac ilities". 

 (c ) "The Club’s exc lusive and limited memberships will be fully transferrable". 

 (d) The Club would be c onstruc ted to have a total built-up area in exc ess of 400,000 sq. ft. c atering for the "business entertainment, networking, soc ializing, personal and family leisure requirements" of eac h suc c essful subsc ription for the duration of the membership. The Club would have "separate formal, c asual, sporting, c hildren’s and family fac ilities" for the suc c essful subsc ribers. 

 (e) A supplementary c ard would be issued to the spouse or fianc of the member allowing full membership privileges and benefits at no additional c ost. This was intended to c onvey the meaning and message that eac h subsc riber would rec eive two lic enc es for the pric e of one. 

 (f ) The Club would be "without peer in terms of size, fac ilities and sheer opulenc e". 

 (g) There would be two c lasses of individual members: 

 (i) first, a limited number of exc lusive transferable founder members at S$28,000 (exc lusive of GST) available to the c redit-c ard holding c ustomers on a first-c ome-first-served basis. This c lass of founder members would be selec ted from those who submitted their applic ations not later than 30 November 1996. Based on "priority applic ations", this c lass of members were c alled "founder members"; and 

 (ii) the sec ond c lass of members would be selec ted from those not selec ted from the priority applic ations and from fresh applic ations submitted in response to a public launc h 


 to be made after 30 November 1996. The allotment pric e for this c lass of members was to be S$40,000. This c lass of members will hereafter be c alled "sec ond c lass members". 

5\. In paragraphs 10 to 14 of the statement of c laim, the plaintiffs outlined how they understood the said representations and their grievanc es. Insofar as is material, the said segment reads as follows: 

10\. The Plaintiffs and other members of the Class understood the representations to mean that the total number of members at any given time would be limited suc h that at any given time no member and the supplementary c ard-holder would be shut out from or be unable to use the fac ilities of the Club, inc luding the c ar parks in the manner or up to the standard as represented in the prospec tus. Suc h limitation was also to be inferred from the holding-out and the representations (a) that the Club would be "without peer in terms of size, fac ilities and sheer opulenc e", (b) that there would be "a limited number of exc lusive individual founder member memberships" and (c ) as to the number of c ar park lots and the total built-up area. Further, the representations were to be understood, implied or inferred in the light of the provisions of the Building Control Ac t, the regulations made thereunder as c onstrued and applied by the c onsultant arc hitec ts engaged by the Defendant for the c onstruc tion of the Club. 

11\. Additionally or alternatively, the representations and the holding-out set out above bec ame terms of the c ontrac tual lic enc es spawned by the ac c eptanc e of the Plaintiffs and other members of the Class. 

12\. The Plaintiffs and other members of the Class on the faith of the representations as set out above and the c ontents of the prospec tus as a whole subsc ribed to and bec ame the founder members. Eac h of them paid the subsc ription in the sum of S$28,000. All made their applic ations not later than 30 November 1996. In addition, they paid monthly subsc riptions and deposits for the Food and Beverage Ac c ount. 

13\. The representations as set out above turned out to be untrue, false and misleading. 

 a. The Club in fac t ac c epted 19,000 members eac h of whom had paid S$28,000. The ac c eptanc e was c ommunic ated by the Defendant to the suc c essful applic ants in Dec ember 

1996\. There was no public launc h of $40,000 for the sec ond c lass members. 

 b. The Club was opened in Marc h 2000 and not end of 1998 as promised and was woefully inadequate shoc kingly short of the representations to c ater for and ac c ommodate the huge number of members and the supplementary c ardholders. 

 c. Not all fac ilities stated in the prospec tus were available 


 to the members. 

 d. The Defendant dreadfully failed to realise the representations set out above with the result that the Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class were unable to realise the aspirations and representations c onveyed by the prospec tus. 

 e. The membership bec ame virtually useless. 

14\. Additionally or alternatively, by reason of the matters set out in paragraph 13, the Defendant was in breac h of the c ontrac t of the terms as asserted above. 

6\. In the result, the plaintiffs, alleging loss and damage, seek dec laratory orders and damages. 

7\. The defendants, in the defenc e filed by them without prejudic e to their rights to apply to the c ourt to strike out the plaintiffs’ c laim resist the c laim and aver that the plaintiffs are not entitled to the remedies sought by them. Insofar as is material, paragraphs 10 and 13 of the defenc e require reproduc tion and they are as follows: 

10\. Insofar as Paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim alleges that the Plaintiffs and other members of the Class understood that there were c ertain representations made, and that these representations were understood to mean suc h allegations as are c ontained in paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim, the Plaintiffs’ state of mind and the stage of mind of the members of the Class is not within the Defendant’s knowledge. Consequently, no admission is made thereto. 

13\. The Defendants further aver that the Club is a proprietary c lub, providing fac ilities and amenities for the use of its members, who, in turn, have no interest in the c lub property and/or inc ome. The Plaintiffs and the members of the Class applied to bec ome members of the Club, by submitting the applic ation forms. That is an offer by the Plaintiffs and the members of the Class. The Defendant ac c epted the offer. Plaintiffs and members of the Class thereby bec ame members of the Club. The c ontrac t between the parties is as set out in the said applic ation forms and ac c eptanc e. The terms of the c ontrac t are as set out in the said applic ation form, whic h, as stated earlier is an offer by the Plaintiffs and the members of the Class. 

8\. Further partic ulars were provided by the plaintiffs pursuant to an order of Court dated 4 Marc h 2002 and they are too long to be entered upon here. 

9\. As mentioned by me at the outset, the appeal before me is c onfined only to the order made by the Assistant Registrar on 23 April 2002, requiring the defendants to provide the plaintiffs a host of doc uments by 7 May 2002, failing whic h the plaintiffs are entitled to enter judgment against the defendants. In order to c omprehend the issues raised by the parties in regard to the present appeal, i t would be helpful at this stage to reproduc e a sc hedule submitted by c ounsel setting forth the desc ription of the doc uments ordered to be produc ed by the defendants and the position of the defendants in this appeal in relation to the said doc uments. The said sc hedule reads as follows:

 This is not being appealed.

10\. Copies of c orrespondenc e

 The Defendant is appealing against this order. 

12\. The Defendants are to produc e     f o r inspec tion the originals of     Item 106 – 129 of their List of     Doc uments identified as "F & B     Daily Sales and Cost of Sales     Analysis" with liberty for the     Plaintiffs to take c opies at their     c ost. 

 The Defendant is appealing against this order. 

10\. An addendum to the foregoing sc hedule is perhaps appropriate at this stage. It is an agreed position between both c ounsel that in regard to item 7 of the said sc hedule, the last four doc uments listed there, i.e., doc uments reflec ting the membership numbers for the periods: (iii) 31 January 1999; (iv ) 31 Marc h 2000; (v) 31 Marc h 2001; and (vi) 31 Marc h 2002 were never requested by the plaintiffs but yet were ordered to be produc ed by the Assistant Registrar. During the hearing before me, c ounsel for the plaintiffs made it known to the Court that the plaintiffs were not asking for them to be produc ed. 

11\. Before I touc h upon the arguments and c onc lusions reac hed by me, it would also be useful to make referenc e to the c hronology of events in relation to this disc overy proc ess. It reads as follows:

 Order made by Assistant Registrar 

12\. In the appeal before me, in the main, the submission by the c ounsel for the appellants was that in the absenc e of a plea of fraudulent misrepresentation, a party is not entitled to ask for doc uments to evinc e the other party’s frame of mind. He further submitted that the c ourt should not allow wide- 


ranging disc overy where the party’s purpose is to fish for possible c laims, as disc overy in suc h a c ase may be oppressive. He added that the over-riding test in respec t of disc overy is relevanc e and this does not appear to be c ase in relation to the plaintiffs’ requests. 

13\. Counsel for the plaintiffs argued that the doc uments ordered are relevant to the issues and matters in question in the ac tion; they are doc uments whic h the plaintiffs may or will rely on; they are doc uments whic h c ould adversely affec t the defendant’s c ase or support the plaintiffs’ c ase; they are doc uments whic h may lead the plaintiffs to a train of inquiry resulting in the plaintiffs obtaining information whic h may adversely affec t the defendant’s c ase or support the plaintiffs’ c ase; and above all they are nec essary for disposing fairly of the c ause or matter or as nec essary for saving c osts. Relianc e was plac ed on O 24 r (5) of the Rules of Court whic h provides: 

 5. 

 –(1) Subjec t to Rule 7, the Court may at any time, on the applic ation of any party to a c ause or matter, make an order requiring any other party to make an affidavit stating whether any doc ument spec ified or desc ribed in the applic ation or any c lass of doc ument so spec ified or desc ribed is, or has at any time been, in his possession, c ustody or power, and if not then in his possession, c ustody or power, when he parted with it and what has bec ome of it. 

 (2) An order may be made against a party under this Rule notwithstanding that the party may already have made or been required to make a list of doc uments or an affidavit under Rule 1. 

 (3) An applic ation for an order under this Rule must be supported by an affidavit stating the belief of the deponent that the party from whom disc overy is sought under this Rule has, or at some time had, in his possession, c ustody or power, t he doc ument, or c lass of doc ument, spec ified or desc ribed in the applic ation and that it falls within one of the following desc riptions: 

 (a) a doc ument on whic h the party relies or will rely; 

 (b) a doc ument whic h c ould – 

 (i) adversely affec t his own c ase; 

 (ii) adversely affec t another party’s c ase; or 

 (iii) support another party’s c ase; and 

 (c ) a doc ument whic h may lead the party seeking disc overy of it to a train of inquiry resulting in his obtaining information whic h may – 

 (i) adversely affec t his own c ase; 

 (ii) adversely affec t another party’s c ase; or 

 (iii) support another party’s c ase. 


 (4) An order under this Rule shall not be made in any c ause or matter in respec t of any party before an order under Rule 1 has first been obtained in respec t of that party, unless, in the opinion of the Court, the order is nec essary or desirable. 

**_Decision_** 

14\. In my view, whether a c lass of doc uments as a whole would be relevant and should be produc ed for the purposes of disc overy must depend upon the c ourt’s evaluation that the doc uments sought would c ontain suc h information that might enable the plaintiffs to advanc e their own c ase or damage that of the defendants. Colman J in _O Co. v M Co._ [1996] Vol. 2 Lloyd’s LR 347 at 351 observed: 

 [T]he doc ument or c lass of doc uments must be shown by the applic ant to offer a real probability of evidential materiality in the sense that it must be a doc ument or c lass of doc uments whic h in the ordinary way c an be expec ted to yield information of substantial evidential materiality to the pleaded c laim and the defenc e to it in the broad sense whic h I have explained. If the doc ument or c lass c annot be demonstrated to be c learly c onnec ted to issues whic h have already been raised on the pleadings or whic h would in the ordinary way be expec ted to be raised in the c ourse of the proc eedings, if suffic ient information were available, the applic ation should be dismissed. 

15\. Still on this subjec t, it was held by the Court of Appeal in England, in _Thorpe v Chief Constable of the Greater Manchester Police_ [1989] 2 All ER 827, that it would not order disc overy of material whic h would be used solely for c ross-examination of a witness as to c redit sinc e it would be oppressive if a party was obliged to disc lose any doc ument whic h might provide material for c ross- examination as to his c redibility as a witness. 

16\. The c ause of ac tion as put forth by the plaintiffs is based on ac tionable misrepresentation and breac h of c ontrac t. In this regard, the plaintiffs, in fac t 4,895 of them in all, by and large rely on a so-c alled c ommon law prospec tus. Let me now deal with the nature of the doc uments requested and ordered to be produc ed. 

17\. _Items 1 to 4 of the schedule_ : Doc uments requested are in relation to dec isions of the defendants’ board taken (a) before 6 November 1996, (b) after 30 November 1996 but before 31 Marc h 1997, and (c ) after 1 January 1996 but before 31 September 1997, on the c riteria for approving membership applic ations as well as the number of members to be taken in for the fee of $28,000 in the first offering and for $40,000 in the sec ond offering. 

18\. In my view, the dec ision of the board as to the c riteria to be adopted by them and the number of members they intended to rec ruit c annot be a basis for any ac tionable misrepresentation or breac h of c ontrac t and in this respec t no material is plac ed before me to warrant an inferenc e that the said doc uments might enable the plaintiffs to advanc e their c ase or damage that of the defendants. One c an imagine that in any c ommerc ial venture there is bound to be disc ussions and dec isions as to how the said venture should proc eed to obtain optimum returns. In a dynamic and fluid c orporate environment, dec isions are made and unmade to provide for c ontingenc ies. On the question how the c riteria c ontemplated and dec isions taken by the defendants’ board would enhanc e the plaintiffs’ c ase, or damage that of the defendants, there was very little forthc oming from the plaintiffs. 


19\. _Item 5_ : The doc ument here relates to applic ation forms to the c lub submitted after 30 November 1996 and before Marc h 2000 approved for membership at the fee of $28,000. Quite apart from the fac t, the applic ants might well objec t to their personal partic ulars disc losed to all and sundry, in my view, these applic ation forms have little relevanc e to the representations allegedly made to the plaintiffs and breac h spoken of. The request c overs not only the period the alleged representations were supposedly made in the said c ommon law prospec tus but also the ensuing four years. Again, I was not persuaded as to the relevanc e how this group of doc uments might advanc e the c ase of the plaintiffs or damage the c ase of the defendants. Cases referred to by the plaintiffs’ c ounsel ( _Manilal & Sons (Pte) Ltd v Bhupendra KJ Shan_ ( _t/a JB International)_ [1989] SLR 1182, _The Patraikos 2_ <span class="citation">[2001] 4 SLR 308</span>, _Standard Chartered Bank v SSangyong Cement (Singapore) Limited_ S1173/1991 unreported), all of them do not detrac t from the princ iple that in general where there is an order of c ourt for disc overy, a party is obliged to make disc over all doc uments relevant to the matters in the ac tion and what these matters are would depend on the pleadings. 

20\. _Item 6_ : Doc uments ordered to be produc ed under this item are not the subjec t of appeal before me. 

2       1. _Item 7_ : As mentioned by me earlier (see para 10 infra), doc uments in respec t of membership numbers as on 31 January 1999, 31 Marc h 2000, 31 Marc h 2001 and 31 Marc h 2002, although not asked for by the plaintiffs, were still ordered to be produc ed by the Assistant Registrar. During arguments before me, plaintiffs’ c ounsel informed me that he was not pressing for these doc uments. As for membership numbers as on 30 Dec ember 1996 and 31 Marc h 1997, I was not inc lined to disturb the order below as it would appear that the number of members in respec t of the periods mentioned are germane to the issues to be addressed in this c ase. 

22\. _Item 8_ : The doc ument ordered is a c opy of invitation to membership in the month of November 1996 by the defendants and their assoc iates. This is indeed a relevant doc ument and at any rate that there is no appeal by the defendants in respec t of this doc ument. 

23\. _Item 9_ : There are two c ategories of doc uments, c ategories (a) and (b), ordered to be produc ed under this head. The defendants are not appealing against c ategory (a) doc uments whic h relate to building plans and designs. The subjec t of appeal under this item is c onfined to doc uments grouped under c ategory (b) only. They pertain to dec isions made by the defendants or their assoc iat es shortly before June 2001 to use $100,000,000 for additional fac ilities and the implementation of the plan using the said sum. In relation to these doc uments, I am inc lined to agree with the defenc e c ontention that any dec ision that may have been made in the c ourse of the year 2001 c annot have any bearing or relevanc e to the alleged representations made in the year 1996. 

2       4. _Item 10_ : The doc uments ordered under this head relate to members’ c omplaints and management replies c onc erning the inadequac y and overc rowding in the c lub’s fac ilities for the period Marc h 2000 to July 2001. The first observation in regard to this request is that the plaintiffs, c omprising a united group of 4,995 members, would by themselves, have been able to produc e the letters of c omplaints they wrote to the management and the replies they might have rec eived without having to pass the burden to the defendants. In any event, the c omplaints and the response are not shown to me to be of relevanc e to the issues to be dec ided. 

25\. _Item 11_ : The doc uments ordered relate to the use of the presidential or exec utive suites of the c lub by a non-member or body c orporate and the fees c harged for suc h use for the period Marc h 2000 and Marc h 2001. What light, the doc uments requested would throw on the issues to be determined, I was not made aware of. In any event, in my evaluation, this request is c learly an endeavour to unsettle the defendants and has little relevanc e to the issues at hand. 


26\. _Item 12_ : Under this head, the defendants are required to produc e for inspec tion the originals of item 106 – 129 of their List of Doc uments identified as "F & B Daily Sales Analysis" with liberty for the plaintiffs to take c opies at their c ost. I was told that the defendants that they on their own disc losed and produc ed these doc uments with c ertain parts blanked out. The blanked parts relate to how muc h money is c harged and paid. The defendants’ c ontention is that those parts are not relevant at all to the issues to be dec ided. The plaintiffs’ c ounsel’s reply is that inasmuc h as the defendants have disc losed the doc uments to the plaintiffs, the latter must bare all. In _G.E. Capital Corporate Finance Group Ltd v. Bankers Trust Co. and Others_ [1995] 1 WLR 172, it was held by the Court of Appeal in England that a party giving disc overy of a doc ument is not obliged to disc lose any part whic h is irrelevant to the issues in the c ase. In that c ase, the plaintiff had blanked out from the doc uments in a list served on the defendants passages c onsidered irrelevant. The judge in the first instanc e ordered the c omplete doc uments to be disc losed sinc e it had not been alleged that they were irrelevant. The plaintiff appealed and the c ourt of appeal allowed the appeal holding that the judge had applied the wrong test. Hoffmann LJ (as he then was) observed at p.175 H that the irrelevant parts c an be c overed without destroying the sense of the rest or making it misleading. In the c ase before me, c ounsel for the plaintiffs did not address me on the relevanc e of the blanked parts exc ept to venture that he would like to know whether the c overed parts are relevant or not. 

27\. In _Marks and Spencer plc v Granada TV and Another_ (unreported), a transc ript of whic h is provided by the defendants’ c ounsel, Ebsworth J, c ommented at page 4 of the transc ript (last paragraph) " _[I]t is incumbent upon a party making an application for a discretionary order, such as spec ific_ **_discovery_** _, to ensure that which is sought is within the proper limits of relevance and sufficiently specific to be the subject of the affidavit which is required to be sworn. If it is too wide then it is both extremely onerous for the opposing party and will add to, rather than save costs by including matters which are not relevant. In those circumstances, as Aldous J pointed out in Fuji Photo Film Co Ltd v Carr’s Paper Ltd and others [1989] RPC 713, the court is entitled to refuse to make an order at all._ " 

28\. In my opinion, the very rationale for the disc overy proc ess, provided for in the Rule referred to, is relevanc e. If it is too wide, too onerous or oppressive then the c ourts are likely to rejec t the request. In my determination, the disc overies sought are too wide, extremely onerous and appear to lac k the essential ingredient of relevanc e. 

29\. Having c onsidered all the arguments and the learning referred to, I am of the view that disc overies requested and ordered, save for matters c onc eded and not appealed against appear to straddle the realm of fishing. In my determination, most of the doc uments requested appears to have little or no relevanc e to the issues to be dec ided exc ept for the purposes of expanding the armoury of the plaintiffs, whic h the plaintiffs are now trying to assemble at the expense of the defendants. When the appeal was in train before me, it was made apparent to me that the present grievanc e by the plaintiffs arises from a disc losure obtained by the c ourt in a previous c ase where the membership numbers of the defendants surfac ed. Having determined that the c ategories doc uments sought by the plaintiffs are extremely wide and bear little relevanc e to the issues, the following orders were made by me at the end. They are as follows: 

 (1) Appeal is allowed save for paragraph 1(7) of the Notic e of Appeal dated 25 April 2002; 

 (2) In relation to paragraph 1(7) of the Notic e of Appeal dated 25 April 2002, the Defendant shall give the Plaintiffs by 21 May 2002 either a doc ument or furnish best partic ulars of the: 


 (a) number of members as at 30 Dec ember 1996; and 

 (b) number of members as at 31 Marc h 1997; 

 (3) Order the Defendant, by 5.00 pm on 21 May 2002 to c omply with the orders made by the Assistant Registrar on 23 April 2002 whic h are not being appealed against and the orders made herein. 

 The Defendant to use its best endeavours to c omply with the above orders. 

 In default, the Plaintiff may apply to Court to enter judgment against the Defendant upon giving 48 hours’ notic e to the Defendant; 

 (4) There be liberty to apply; and 

 (5) By c onsent, c osts of the appeal and below be c osts in the c ause. 

_Order accordingly._
