AR Goh Yihan: 

**Introduction** 

1       The present applic ation c onc erns two broad prayers, whic h I will outline shortly but not before providing a brief summary of the parties involved. David Tan Hoc k Boon (“the sec ond defendant”) is the sec ond defendant in Suit No 2 of 2007 (“the present ac tion”) and the applic ant in the present applic ation. Suit No 2 of 2007 is a negligenc e suit brought against him and David Rasif (“the first defendant”) by two c o-administratric es of the estate of Koh Jit Meng (“the dec eased”), namely, Lim Quee Choo (“the first plaintiff”) and Wong Peng Luan (“the sec ond plaintiff”). The plaintiffs are the respondents in the present applic ation. 

2       In the present applic ation, the first prayer is for an order to set aside the order of c ourt dated 30 January 2007 wherein it was ordered that the servic e of the amended writ of summons (“the amended writ”) in this ac tion be effec ted on the sec ond efendant by, _inter alia_ , public ation of a Notic e in English in one issue of _The Straits Times_ (“the order for substituted servic e”), and that all proc eedings in this ac tion taken thereafter to be similarly set aside. The sec ond alternative prayer is for the interloc utory judgment (with damages to be assessed) entered in default of appearanc e on 26 February 2007 against the sec ond defendant to be set aside, and that the final judgment against the sec ond defendant with damages assessed at $3,695,622.32 on 14 September 2007 to be similarly set aside. If the interloc utory judgment and the final judgment are set aside, the sec ond prayer goes on further and seeks leave for the sec ond defendant to enter an appearanc e to the ac tion and to file and serve his defenc e to the ac tion herein. 

3       As the orders are prayed for in the alternative, suc h that the granting of one will render c onsideration of the other unnec essary, I will deal initially with the first prayer to set aside the order for substituted servic e. Notwithstanding my c onc lusion in relation to the first prayer, I will, for c ompleteness, also deal with the sec ond prayer to set aside the interloc utory judgment entered in default of appearanc e and the final judgment against the sec ond defendant. I turn now to the sec ond defendant’s first prayer in the present applic ation for an order to set aside the order for substituted servic e. 


**Prayer for order to set aside order for substituted service** 

**_The facts_** 

_Commencement of present action_ 

4       The genesis of this first prayer c an loosely be said to stem from a newspaper artic le. On 6 January 2007, there appeared in _The Straits Times_ an artic le authored by K C Vijayan entitled “Suits mount against runaway lawyer” (“The Straits Times artic le”). The “runaway lawyer” referred to in the artic le is, of c ourse, David Rasif, who is the first defendant in the present ac tion and the named defendant in other ac tions brought in the aftermath of his runaway. However, the well public ised saga surrounding his misappropriation and subsequent disappearanc e do not c onc ern this applic ation brought by the sec ond defendant and c onstitute a somewhat unnec essary, if unavoidable, distrac tion to the fac ts at hand. The Straits Times artic le is only relevant to the extent that it reported that on 3 January 2007, two c o-administrators of a dead man’s estate filed a High Court negligenc e suit for a flawed $3. million share-transfer agreement involving a c ompany direc tor and a shareholder against the first defendant and the sec ond defendant, the latter of whom was expressly identified as “David Tan” and desc ribed as “a lawyer who worked at [the first defendant’s] firm”. It should additionally be mentioned that while the Straits Times artic le provided some brief bac kground as to the c irc umstanc es leading to the negligenc e suit, inc luding the name of the dec eased, it did not mention anything about the identity of the law firm whic h was instruc ted to c ommenc e the said suit. The detailed fac ts surrounding the suit are not relevant for now. Nonetheless, it is c lear from the information provided in the Straits Times artic le that the “High Court negligenc e suit” ac tually referred to the present ac tion, _viz_ , Suit No 2 of 2007. 

5       The sec ond defendant deposed in his affidavit filed on 7 Dec ember 2007 for the purposes of the present applic ation (“the sec ond defendant’s first affidavit”) that he had read the Straits Times artic le. He thus c onc eded that he “was aware” of that a negligenc e ac tion was c ommenc ed against him by virtue of this artic le. However, in the same affidavit, he also stated that he had no idea as to whether the plaintiffs would be proc eeding with their ac tion against him. He was also unsure whether he c ould be held liable for any alleged defaults of the first defendant’s law firm, David Rasif & Partners (“DRP”), as DRP was a sole proprietorship and he was merely an employee. 

6       As it turned out, the initial writ of summons in the present ac tion was issued against the defendants on 3 January 2007. The Straits Times artic le was therefore ac c urate in so far as it reported that there was a High Court negligenc e suit filed against the defendants on 3 January 2007. However, the amended writ was subsequently issued on 23 January 2007. 

_Application for substituted service_ 

7       On the same day when the amended writ was issued, the plaintiffs applied by way of an _ex parte_ summons for an order for substituted servic e. In support of the summons, the solic itor for the plaintiffs filed an affidavit stating, _inter alia_ , that: (a) the sec ond defendant was a former partner of DRP and that he had left the prac tic e; (b) neither he nor the plaintiffs knew of the sec ond defendant’s residential address; (c ) the plaintiffs had only c ommunic ated with the sec ond defendant at the offic e of DRP whic h has sinc e c losed; and (d) servic e by way of advertisement in _The Straits Times_ would be effec tual in bringing the amended writ to the sec ond defendant’s knowledge. 

8       The summons first c ame before the assistant registrar on 23 January 2007. The assistant registrar refused to grant the order for substituted servic e and direc ted, with respec t to the sec ond defendant, that the plaintiffs’ solic itor filed a supplementary affidavit exhibiting People Profile 


Information (“PPI”) searc hes and desc ribing attempts to serve at alternative addresses, if any. 

9       Later in the afternoon of the same day, the plaintiffs’ solic itor attended before the assistant registrar and submitted, with respec t to the sec ond defendant, that the he had tried PPI searc hes but that there were too many “David Tans” suc h that he c ould not be sure whic h referred to the sec ond defendant. This was reflec ted c learly in the assistant registrar’s minutes of the proc eedings. 

He additionally submitted that he had tried to get the sec ond defendant’s residential address from the Law Soc iety of Singapore (“the Law Soc iety”) but that the latter dec lined to provide the required address on grounds of c onfidentiality. 

10     The assistant registrar then direc ted the plaintiffs to file a supplementary affidavit setting out the matters submitted by him. This supplementary affidavit was filed on 29 January 2007 and deposed to, _inter alia_ , the following: (a) the plaintiffs only knew the sec ond defendant’s name and identity c ard number but not his residential address; (b) the plaintiffs were unable to c onduc t a property searc h to asc ertain the sec ond defendant’s residential address based purely on his name and identity c ard number; (c ) the Law Soc iety had refused to release the sec ond defendant’s residential address; and (d) the Law Soc iety had forwarded to the sec ond defendant c orrespondenc e from the plaintiffs’ solic itor c onc erning the present ac tion but that the sec ond defendant had not responded. As a further follow-up to the state of the said c orrespondenc e, the plaintiffs have in their affidavit filed on 4 January 2008 for the purposes of the present applic ation (“the plaintiffs’ first affidavit”) deposed that they eventually disc overed in Dec ember 2007 that the Law Soc iety had sent the c orrespondenc e to the sec ond defendant’s former address, from whic h he had moved out prior to the c ommenc ement of the present ac tion. 

11     After the supplementary affidavit was filed, the order for substituted servic e was granted by the assistant registrar on 30 January 2007. 

_Judgments entered against the second defendant in default of appearance_ 

12     Pursuant to the order for substituted servic e, an advertisement was put on _The Straits Times_ on 7 February 2007. The sec ond defendant never saw this advertisement and thus did not enter an appearanc e. On 12 February 2007, the plaintiffs informed the brokers for the sec ond defendant’s professional indemnity insurers’ (“Loc kton”) that they had c ommenc ed the present ac tion. However, it appears that this information never reac hed the sec ond defendant as Loc kton later replied on 15 February 2007 that they were only the brokers and did not deal with c laimants or their solic itors direc tly. In the result, interloc utory judgment in default of appearanc e was entered against the sec ond defendant on 26 February 2007 and final judgment with damages assessed at $3,695,622. was obtained on 14 September 2007. 

_The second defendant’s discovery of the present action_ 

13     Less than a month after final judgment was obtained, the first plaintiff c alled the sec ond defendant on his mobile phone on 5 Oc tober 2007 and informed him that the plaintiffs had obtained default judgment against him. The plaintiffs had not c ontac ted the sec ond defendant by his mobile phone prior to this bec ause, as they have stated in their first affidavit, they did not realise that they had the mobile phone number of the sec ond defendant written on a note until late 2007. A meeting was arranged on 8 Oc tober 2007 between the parties, during whic h the sec ond defendant was informed that the amended writ was served on him by way of substituted servic e. The plaintiffs have also in their first affidavit deposed that the sec ond defendant had at this meeting informed them that in January 2007, Loc kton c ontac ted him about the Straits Times artic le and informed him that the 


plaintiffs had c ommenc ed the present ac tion against him and the first defendant. On 9 Oc tober 2007, the sec ond defendant met with the plaintiffs’ solic itor and requested for c opies of the relevant c ourt doc uments. These were forwarded to the sec ond defendant on 12 Oc tober 2007. 

14     After rec eiving c opies of the c ourt doc uments, the sec ond defendant informed his professional indemnity insurers, who in turn instruc ted the sec ond defendant’s present solic itors to ac t for him. The sec ond defendant subsequently determined that he needed to review some files left at DRP’s offic es when he left in Marc h 2006. From his enquiries, the sec ond defendant found out that after the Law Soc iety had intervened in the prac tic e of DRP following the disappearanc e of the first defendant, the files of DRP were retained by the Law Soc iety. On 26 Oc tober 2006, the sec ond defendant’s solic itors wrote to the Law Soc iety requesting to inspec t all the relevant files. However, when the sec ond defendant’s solic itors attended at the Law Soc iety, they were told that the plaintiffs, being the previous c lients of DRP, had c ollec ted three boxes of relevant files from the Law Soc iety on 14 June 2006. 

15     On 26 Oc tober 2007, the sec ond defendant’s solic itors wrote to the plaintiffs’ solic itor requesting to inspec t the relevant files. This was eventually fixed to take plac e on 7 November 2007. The sec ond defendant’s solic itors then realised during the c ourse of inspec tion that they needed c opies of the doc uments for further review and c ollation. Copies of the doc uments were eventually rec eived by the sec ond defendant’s solic itors on 19 November 2007. On 28 Dec ember 2007, the plaintiffs’ solic itor informed the sec ond defendant’s solic itors that more files relating to the period before Marc h 2004 had been loc ated. These files were inspec ted on 11 January 2008 and c opies of the relevant doc uments obtained on 14 January 2008. 

16     The above thus sets out the bac kground to the present applic ation whic h was c ommenc ed on 7 Dec ember 2007, spec ific ally in relation to the first prayer for an order to set aside the order for substituted servic e. 

**_Whether the order for substituted service should be set aside_** 

17     For an order for substituted servic e c an be made under O 62 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”), the applic ant must satisfy the c ourt that (a) the applic ant is in fac t unable to effec t personal servic e of the writ; and (b) the writ is likely to reac h the defendant or c ome to his knowledge if the method of substituted whic h is asked for is adopted: see _Porter v Freudenberg_ [1915] 1 KB 857 at 888. An order made under O 62 r 5(1) of the Rules may be set aside under O 32 r 6 on the basis that it is an _ex parte_ order and henc e is essentially a provisional order made on the basis of evidenc e and submissions emanating from one side only and therefore when the c ourt reviews the provisional order in the light of the evidenc e and arguments adduc ed by the other party, the c ourt is not inhibited from disc harging or varying the original order: see _WEA Records Ltd v Visions Channel 4 Ltd_ [1983] 1 WLR 721. This embodies the fundamental rule of prac tic e that a party affec ted by an _ex parte_ order may apply to the c ourt to disc harge it, inasmuc h as he has not had an opportunity of being heard: see _HMS Archer_ [1919] P 1. 

18     Applied to an order for substituted servic e made under O 62 r 5(1), the c ourt is thereby able to disc harge or vary the order made previously upon hearing the opposite side and is c onvinc ed that one or all of the requirements for an order to be granted was not met. It should be emphasised that the c ourt’s jurisdic tion to set aside the order for substituted servic e is not appellate in nature and instead flows from a very fundamental desire to c onsider all relevant fac ts and arguments whic h c an be made before it for its benefit in c oming to a just result. 

_Two preliminary points_ 


19     Before c onsidering whether the requirements under O 62 r 5(1) were met, spec ific ally whether suffic ient efforts were utilised to loc ate the sec ond defendant by the plaintiffs, I have to first c onsider two preliminary points raised by the plaintiffs whic h they say will prove fatal to the sec ond defendant’s present applic ation. 

(1) The issue of knowledge 

(A) THE ARGUMENT 

20     First, it was argued that the sec ond defendant was fully aware of the present ac tion either before or shortly after the order for substituted servic e had been made. Therefore, it was submitted that sinc e the intention whic h underlies all proc edure with regard to proc edural servic e is that the defendant will probably get to hear of the proc eedings, and this purpose had been fulfilled in the present ac tion, the question of whether the order for substituted servic e is in order is not relevant. The authority c ited for this proposition is the High Court dec ision of _BNP Paribas v Polynesia Timber Services Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2002] 4 SLR 933</span> (“ _BNP Paribas_ ”). 

(B) ANALYSIS 

21     With respec t, I am unable to ac c ept this c ontention. The first point really is that knowledge of the proc eedings _after_ the order for substituted servic e is not relevant. In every applic ation to set aside an order for substituted servic e, it is axiomatic that the applic ant would already have known of the proc eedings c ommenc ed against him. Otherwise, how would he be able to make suc h an applic ation in the first plac e? If, as the plaintiffs c ontended, the proposition of law that flows from _BNP Paribas_ is that so long as the plaintiff c omes to know that proc eedings have already been c ommenc ed against him, then any order for substituted servic e, however irregularly obtained, must not be set aside bec ause the purpose of servic e is already fulfilled, then I think that this is too wide a proposition whic h, in any event, was not intended by the High Court in _BNP Paribas_. Indeed, if the plaintiffs are c orrec t, then _all_ applic ations to set aside orders for substituted servic e must fail for the simple reason that in every suc h applic ation, the applic ant must have known after the event that there was an ac tion c ommenc ed against him. This c learly c annot be the law. 

22     Having asc ertained that the sec ond defendant’s knowledge after the order for substituted servic e to be irrelevant, I c ome now to his knowledge _before_ the order was made. While not artic ulated in suc h a manner, the plaintiffs’ argument with respec t to the sec ond defendant’s knowledge _before_ the order for substituted servic e was made must be premised on the following propositions: the purpose of personal servic e is to enable the defendant to obtain _actual_ knowledge that an ac tion had been c ommenc ed against him; the purpose of substituted servic e, on the other hand, is to impute only _constructive_ knowledge of this fac t when the c irc umstanc es did not make it possible to impute ac tual knowledge; thus, if the sec ond defendant _actually_ knew of the present ac tion being c ommenc ed against him before the order for substituted servic e, then the order, in so far as it sought to impart a _lesser_ degree of knowledge _vis-à-vis_ the degree of knowledge already possessed by the sec ond defendant, would not advanc e _any further_ the purpose of servic e, whic h had been ac hieved when the order was made. 

23     While I agree that the very purpose of servic e is to bring to the ac tual knowledge of the defendant that an ac tion has been c ommenc ed against him by the plaintiff, I do not think that the Straits Times artic le ac hieved this purpose. The very essenc e of personal or substituted servic e is that it is a _direct_ c ommunic ation from the plaintiff to the defendant that a writ had been issued against the latter. This ensures its ac c urac y and reliability. In the present c ase, although the Straits 


Times artic le c ontained some partic ulars with regard to the present ac tion, it was not a direc t form of c ommunic ation between the plaintiffs and the sec ond defendant. It would have been open to the sec ond defendant not to pay any heed to the artic le sinc e the c ontents of the artic le did not emanate from the plaintiffs and he c ould very rightly regard its c ontents to be potentially inac c urate (although I do not intend to say that _The Straits Times_ is not a reputable public ation; it c learly is). Thus, although the sec ond defendant has c onc eded that he “was aware” of the negligenc e ac tion being c ommenc ed against him by way of the Straits Times artic le, I do not think that this knowledge amounted to _reliable_ ac tual knowledge that the plaintiffs had in fac t c ommenc ed the present ac tion against the sec ond defendant. Indeed, the plaintiffs were unable to point to any authority for the proposition that newspaper artic les in general (as opposed to advertisements pursuant to an order for substituted servic e) c ould properly impart knowledge of the c ommenc ement of proc eedings on a defendant. 

24     This c an be c ontrasted with the fac ts of _BNP Paribas_ , whic h was relied upon by the plaintiffs. In that c ase, the plaintiff, BNPP, had c ommenc ed an ac tion against, _inter alia_ , the guarantor (“D2”) of a loan it had granted to a c ompany (“PTS”) when the c ompany defaulted on the loan. D2, who resided in Malaysia, had written to BNPP’s solic itors to c onfirm his residential address and also asked BNPP to fix an appointment to effec t servic e on him at his residenc e. BNPP then suc c essfully applied for servic e to be effec ted for servic e outside jurisdic tion to be effec ted on D2. However, BNPP was later informed that the Kuala Lumpur High Court’s proc ess server had failed to effec t servic e on D2 on three oc c asions. Following this, D2 orally informed BNPP over the telephone that the writ c ould be served on him at his residenc e or at his offic e in Malaysia. BNPP then advertised the notic e of the writ in two Malaysian newspapers, pursuant to an order granting substituted servic e. D2 informed BNPP that he would not enter appearanc e as the writ was not validly served on him. BNPP then obtained judgment in default of appearanc e. D2 applied to set aside the substituted servic e and default judgment obtained thereafter. 

25     In reversing the order that the substituted servic e be set aside, the High Court found that D2 was fully aware that BNPP had issued a writ against him even before substituted servic e was granted or exec uted. Consequently, the High Court found that there was no question of D2 having suffered prejudic e as a result of not knowing of the advertisements. The High Court then c ited with approval the passage from _Karen Ahmad v Standard Chartered Bank 2(3) Mallal’s Digest_ (4th Ed, 2001 Reissue) [5328] (“ _Karen Ahmad_ ”) whic h opined that the intention whic h underlies all proc edure with regard to substituted servic e is that the defendant will probably get to hear of the proc eedings. If this purpose is ac hieved, the question as to whether the applic ation for substituted servic e was in order or otherwise is no longer relevant. 

26     In my respec tful view, the reasoning behind the High Court’s dec ision and endorsement of _Karen Ahmad_ may perhaps be further explained by my explanation of the plaintiffs’ c ontention with respec t to the sec ond defendant’s knowledge before the order for substituted servic e was made (see [22] above). If this is c orrec t, then it would not esc ape keen eyes that in _BNP Paribas_ , the ac tual knowledge ac quired prior to the order for substituted servic e in that c ase c ame direc tly from BNPP, the plaintiffs. There was c ommunic ation between the parties suc h that D2 ac tually wanted to fix an appointment with BNPP to effec t personal servic e on him. This was, to my mind, a far more reliable form of ac tual knowledge than knowledge ac quired through a third party whic h, in this c ase, was the Straits Times artic le. Ac c ordingly, I do not think that the knowledge ac quired by the sec ond defendant prior to the order for substituted servic e was suc h as to render the very purpose of the order fulfilled suc h that its regularity ought not to be in question. 

27     Before I depart from this preliminary issue, I note also that the plaintiffs pointed to the sec ond defendant being informed by Loc kton in January 2007 about the ac tion. Again, for the reasons above, 


I do not think that suc h information c an be equated with a direc t c ommunic ation from the plaintiffs to the sec ond defendant about the c ommenc ement of the present ac tion. 

(2) The alleged waiver of irregularity 

(A) THE ARGUMENT 

28     The sec ond preliminary point raised by the plaintiffs was that the sec ond defendant had waived any irregularity of the order for substituted servic e by inc luding the sec ond prayer for leave to enter an appearanc e file his defenc e in the present applic ation. The authority c ited for this proposition is the Malaysia dec ision of _Development & Commercial Bank Bhd v Aspatra Corp Sdn Bhd_ [1995] 3 MLJ 472 (“ _Development & Commercial Bank Bhd_ ”). 

(B) ANALYSIS 

29     In my view, this argument has little merit. The c ase of _Development & Commercial Bank Bhd_ may be easily distinguished sinc e the prayers in that c ase for the setting aside of the substituted servic e and to file an appearanc e were not in the alternative; on the other hand, in the present c ase, the prayers are c learly in the alternative. It is only if the c ourt were unwilling to set aside the order for substituted servic e that the prayer to set aside the judgments in default of appearanc e (with the further prayer for leave to enter an appearanc e) is c onsidered. If the plaintiffs are c orrec t, then it would prec lude the c ourts from c onsidering both prayers in the same applic ation, even if prayed for in the alternative. This c learly is not the c ase as the c ourts have always c onsidered both prayers in the same applic ation, albeit in the alternative: see, for example, _Low Choon Kung v Tham Chan Kum_ <span class="citation">[2004] SGDC 139</span> (“ _Low Choon Kung_ ”). 

_Whether it was impracticable to serve the amended writ on the second defendant_ 

30     I c ome now to the primary question of whether the plaintiffs had disc harged the burden of satisfying the c ourt that it was imprac tic able to serve the amended writ on the sec ond defendant. It is worthwhile first to outline the parties’ arguments on this issue. 

(1) The parties’ arguments 

(A) THE SEC OND DEFENDANT'S ARGUMENTS 

31     The sec ond defendant’s arguments c entred on the sec ond defendant’s mobile phone number and the PPI searc hes. It was submitted that it would have been extremely easy to c ontac t the sec ond defendant on his mobile phone, as had ac tually been done in late 2007 when the first plaintiff c alled the sec ond defendant _after_ final judgment was obtained. 

32     As for the PPI searc hes, it was submitted that it would have been simple to c onduc t a PPI searc h (if done _properly_ ) to asc ertain the present address of the sec ond defendant, at whic h he has been living sinc e June 2005. In fac t, the sec ond defendant had instruc ted his solic itors to perform a PPI searc h using his name and identity c ard number to verify the plaintiffs’ solic itor’s c laim that there were “many David Tans”, as was submitted to the assistant registrar at the applic ation for the order for substituted servic e. The sec ond defendant’s solic itors performed four types of PPI searc hes. It is only nec essary to refer to two of these searc hes. The first of these searc hes was to searc h by a given identity c ard number. By keying in the sec ond defendant’s identity c ard number, the PPI searc h showed that the sec ond defendant was listed in the system. The sec ond of these searc hes involved typing in the sec ond defendant’s full name in a partic ular order, _ie_ , “Tan Hoc k Boon David” (as 


opposed to “David Tan Hoc k Boon”). This searc h showed that the sec ond defendant was listed in the system. By proc eeding with the searc hes based on the identity c ard number and full name, _ie_ , Tan Hoc k Boon David”, the final result would show the sec ond defendant’s present address, with the date this address was put into the system shown to be 7 June 2005, prior to the c ommenc ement of the present ac tion. Ac c ordingly, the sec ond defendant submitted that the plaintiffs’ solic itor, who had submitted before the assistant registrar that he had performed a PPI searc h but obtained so many “David Tans” that he c ould not tell who was the c orrec t person, must have done the PPI searc h _without_ using the sec ond defendant’s identity c ard number and full name, both of whic h were within his knowledge. 

33     For these reasons, it was therefore inc orrec t for the plaintiffs’ solic itor to have submitted to the assistant registrar that there was no way of asc ertaining the sec ond defendant’s address for the purpose of effec ting personal servic e. 

(B) THE PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENTS 

34     On the other hand, the plaintiffs submitted that there are no grounds for setting aside the order for substituted servic e. First, it was submitted that it was indeed not prac tic able to effec t personal servic e of the amended writ on the sec ond defendant. In this regard, it was said that the plaintiffs did not know the sec ond defendant’s residential address as all their dealings with him had been at the offic es of DRP. The plaintiffs had thereafter taken suffic ient steps to disc over the residential address of the applic ant by notifying (a) the Law Soc iety (see [9] above) and (b) Loc kton (see [12] above). In reply to the sec ond defendant’s assertion that the plaintiffs c ould have disc overed his residential address by c ontac ting him on his mobile phone or c onduc ting a PPI searc h properly, it was first said that the plaintiffs’ evidenc e is that the first plaintiff had only loc ated the note c ontaining the sec ond defendant’s mobile phone number in late 2007 (see [13] above). 

35     As for the PPI searc hes, it was stated that the plaintiffs did not know and had no basis to suspec t the sec ond defendant to be the direc tor or shareholder of any c ompany and ac c ordingly did not undertake any PPI searc h. Although the assistant registrar’s minutes on the afternoon of 23 January 2007 c learly rec orded the plaintiffs’ solic itor as saying that there were many “David Tans” when he had performed a PPI searc h (see [9] above), the plaintiffs explained that the reality was that the assistant registrar had meant to refer to a searc h through the phone book. The assistant registrar had also (supposedly) explained that a PPI searc h was a property tax searc h and bec ause the plaintiffs’ solic itor was not sure what a PPI searc h meant, he took this to be c ase and submitted before the assistant registrar that it was not possible to c onduc t a property tax searc h as he did not have the sec ond defendant’s residential address in the first plac e. 

(2) Analysis 

36     It is not without prec edent that an order for substituted servic e c an be set aside if insuffic ient effort had been used in attempting to loc ate the residential address for personal servic e. Thus in _Low Choon Kung_ , the substituted servic e of a divorc e petition by advertisement was deemed irregular as the petitioner’s efforts in loc ating the respondent for the purpose of personal servic e was deemed to be insuffic ient. 

37     However, a further question begs to be answered: what does “suffic ient effort” mean? The short answer must be that these are steps whic h satisfy the c ourt that it is imprac tic able for personal servic e to be effec ted. Further, _The Supreme Court Practice Directions_ offers some prac tic al guidanc e as to what c onstitutes these steps. In partic ular, paragraph 32 provides that two attempts at personal servic e should be made and that the attempts should be made at the residenc e of the 


party to be served, if known; otherwise or if the c laim relates to that party’s business or work, the attempts should be made at the party’s plac e of business or work. While these are merely guidelines, they do provide for the c riterion whic h underpins the suffic ienc y of efforts: reasonableness. In _Wiseman v Wiseman_ [1953] 2 WLR 499, it was said that methods of c ommunic ation whic h were reasonably obvious and c ould have been used but whic h were not would c onstitute fall short of the standard required. This is a useful yardstic k to be used in asc ertaining whether the plaintiffs used suffic ient efforts in the present applic ation. Here, two matters pointing to potential insuffic ienc y in the plaintiffs’ efforts in effec ting personal servic e on the sec ond defendant warrant c loser attention: (a) the allegation that the plaintiffs had the sec ond defendant’s mobile phone number; and (b) the PPI searc hes. 

(A) THE SEC OND DEFENDANT'S MOBILE PHONE NUMBER 

38     I deal first with the sec ond defendant’s mobile phone number. While I found it slightly inc redulous that the plaintiffs did not have the sec ond defendant’s mobile phone number until it suddenly appeared just a few weeks after final judgment was obtained (and indeed I should mention that the plaintiffs’ solic itor admitted before me that the timing would have seemed “unusual” to a third party), I c annot disc ount the plaintiffs’ evidenc e on affidavit that they only loc ated the sec ond defendant’s number towards the end of 2007. However, in my view, had it been the c ase that the plaintiffs were in possession of the sec ond defendant’s mobile phone number before the order for substituted servic e was made and they had neglec ted to take this very simple step to c ontac t the sec ond defendant to asc ertain his residential address, I would have had no hesitation in finding that insuffic ient effort had been utilised by the plaintiffs. 

(B) THE PPI SEARC HES 

39     In my judgment, the PPI searc hes provide the key to answering the question of whether suffic ient effort was made and henc e whether the plaintiffs had disc harged their burden of showing that it was imprac tic able to effec t personal servic e. I ac c ept the sec ond defendant’s submission that it would have been extremely easy for the plaintiffs, who were at the very least in possession of the sec ond defendant’s full name and identity c ard number, to c onduc t a PPI searc h properly to asc ertain the sec ond defendant’s residential address. 

40     I do not think that there is any merit to the plaintiffs’ submission that the assistant registrar had not properly explained what a PPI searc h is. The minutes of the hearing of the _ex parte_ applic ation, whic h I will have to ac c ept as true, shows that it was in fac t the plaintiffs’ solic itor who had submitted to the assistant registrar that he had c onduc ted the PPI searc hes but that there were too many “David Tans”. In the absenc e of extremely c ompelling evidenc e to the c ontrary, I am led to c onc lude that the plaintiffs’ solic itor knew what a PPI searc h was and had really not done a searc h properly. Had he done one properly with the sec ond defendant’s full name and identity c ard number, he would have been able to loc ate the sec ond defendant’s residential address. 

(C ) NOTIFYING THE LAW SOC IETY AND LOC KTON 

41     Finally, I do not think that notifying the Law Soc iety and/or Loc kton c onstituted suffic ient effort. First, c ontac t was made with Loc kton only _after_ the order for substituted servic e was obtained. Thus this c ould not have any bearing on c onvinc ing the c ourt of whether suffic ient effort was used to loc ate the sec ond defendant to effec t personal servic e. As for notifying the Law Soc iety, while I ac c ept that this c ould in some c irc umstanc es c onstitute suffic ient effort, the c irc umstanc es of the present c ase forc e me to c onc lude otherwise, espec ially sinc e the simple step of c onduc ting the PPI 


searc hes properly was not done. 

42     In the final analysis, I find that the plaintiffs had not disc harged their burden of showing that it was imprac tic able to effec t personal servic e on the sec ond defendant. The plaintiffs ought to have done the PPI searc h properly, in view of the fac t that their solic itor ac tually knew what a PPI searc h is (as is evident from the minutes stating that he had done a searc h) and with their knowledge of the sec ond defendant’s full name and identity c ard number. However, I do not think that the plaintiffs’ solic itor was in the least seeking to c onc eal anything to the c ourt; I am satisfied that he had made full and frank disc losure to the c ourt in so far as that means that he had not sought to intentionally withhold information in his knowledge. 

**_Conclusion in relation to prayer to set aside order for substituted service_** 

43     For the reasons given above, I set aside the order for substituted servic e. It nec essarily follows from this that all other proc eedings thereto are similarly set aside. While this is suffic ient to dispose of this applic ation, I now deal with the sec ond alternative prayer for an order to set aside the judgments entered in default of the sec ond defendant’s appearanc e in the event that I am wrong with respec t to the setting aside of the order for substituted servic e. 

**Prayer for order to set aside judgments entered in default of appearance** 

**_The facts_** 

44     As it is relevant to the sec ond prayer to set aside the judgments entered in default of appearanc e, the bac kground fac ts giving rise to the present ac tion against the defendants c an now be briefly stated. The entire saga started with the dec eased’s dec ision to deal with two individuals known as Tan Wah Leng (“Tan”) and her husband Thian Kim Hoe (“Thian”). Tan and Thian were the sole shareholders and direc tors of a c ompany inc orporated in Singapore known as Dauphin Offshore Engineering & Trading Pte Ltd (“the Company”). They were the registered owners of all ten million ordinary shares in the Company whic h c onstituted the entire shareholding of the Company. 

_The Share Transfer Agreement and the Supplemental Agreement_ 

45     In 2001, the dec eased paid $3.5m to Tan and Thian for 3 million shares in the Company. In addition, the dec eased also advanc ed a sum of about $316,000 to Tan and Thian. The understanding was supposedly that the sale proc eeds of the shares and the advanc es from the dec eased were to be used by Tan and Thian to pay the Company’s c reditors and enable the Company to tide over its financ ial diffic ulties. 

46     Between May and June 2001, the terms for the purc hase of the 3 million shares were set out in the Share Transfer Agreement dated 29 May 2001 (“the Share Transfer Agreement”) prepared by the defendants. In June 2001, the defendants prepared a Supplemental Agreement whic h was signed by all the parties. Under the Supplemental Agreement, Tan and Thian agreed to buy bac k 1.5 million shares of the Company from the dec eased no later than 30 June 2002 and repay the monies that had been advanc ed to them. 

_The defendants’ breach of obligations_ 

47     By April 2002, Tan and Thian had breac hed their obligations under both the Share Transfer Agreement and the Supplemental Agreement. However, the dec eased passed away on 6 April 2002 before any legal proc eedings were c ommenc ed. In August 2002, unknown to the plaintiffs, Tan 


transferred all her 25% interest and title in a property at 2 Clementi Cresc ent to her relatives. 

48     On 7 August 2003, letters of administration were granted to the estate of the dec eased and the plaintiffs were appointed as the joint administric es. Later, on 12 September 2003, the plaintiffs and Tan and Thian entered into a further agreement (“The Agreement of Settlement”) whereby Tan and Thian ac knowledged that they owed the dec eased’s estate the sum of $3.5m and a further sum of $316,656.05 and promised to repay these monies by a sc hedule of instalments. 

_Commencement of legal proceedings_ 

49     On 23 Marc h 2004, Suit 232 of 2004 (“Suit 232”) was c ommenc ed after Tan and Thian again defaulted in the instalment payments under the Agreement of Settlement. After filing an applic ation for summary judgment under O 14 of the Rules, the defendants proc eeded to enter into negotiations with the lawyers representing Tan and Thian. On 16 May 2004, unknown to the plaintiffs, Tan had transferred 1.5m of her shares in the Company to her relatives, Tan Jin Sin (“TJS”) and Lim Lee Chin (“LLC”), who are both direc tors in the Company. 

50     On 9 July 2004, the defendants, on behalf of the plaintiffs, entered into an agreement with the lawyers for Tan and Thian to allow the latter a further period to make payment by a revised sc hedule of instalment payments. This agreement was embodied in a Tomlin Order. 

51     On 20 Oc tober 2004, judgment was entered against Tan and Thian in Suit 232 when they defaulted in making the instalment payments due under the Tomlin Order. In Oc tober and November 2004, exec ution proc eedings were c ommenc ed to, _inter alia_ , seize the balanc e 8.5m shares in the Company registered in the names of Tan and Thian by way of Writ of Seizure Nos 58 and 61 of 2004 (“the exec ution proc eedings”). 

52     On 15 April 2004, the defendants c ommenc ed Suit 249 of 2005 (“Suit 249”) against Tan, Thian, Trios Corporation (S) Pte Ltd (“Trios”) together with the direc tors of Trios for c onspirac y. On 23 September 2005, bankruptc y orders were made against Tan and Thian. On 26 September 2005, on the defendants’ advic e, the plaintiffs entered into a Settlement Agreement with all the defendants in Suit 249 in respec t of the ac tion. 

_Negligence action against the defendants_ 

53     As it eventually turned out, the plaintiffs failed to rec over substantially the monies owing to them by Tan and Thian and they c ommenc ed the present ac tion against the defendants, alleging that they had been negligent in their c onduc t of the aforementioned matters. 

54     Before I turn to c onsider whether the judgments entered in default of the sec ond defendant’s appearanc e, I should first c onsider the applic able law. 

**_The law on setting aside judgments entered in default of appearance_** 

_Preliminary observations and the second defendant’s argument_ 

55     Assuming that the order for substituted servic e in the present ac tion is valid, it must follow, as c onc eded by the sec ond defendant, that the interloc utory judgment and final judgment entered in default of appearanc e must be a regular judgment. In this regard, O 13 r 8 of the Rules provides that the c ourt may, on suc h terms as it thinks just, set aside or vary any judgment entered in default of appearanc e to writ. As the learned authors of _Singapore Civil Procedure 2007_ (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 


2007) point out at 121, the leading loc al c ase for the law on O 13 r 8 is _Abdul Gaffer v Chua Kwang Yong_ <span class="citation">[1995] 1 SLR 484</span> (“ _Abdul Gaffer_ ”), a dec ision of the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal had in _Abdul Gaffer_ laid down the relevant princ iples for the exerc ise of the c ourt’s disc retion under O 13 r 8. As the material passages are not long, and are regarded to be of utmost important in loc al jurisprudenc e, I hereby set out them out: 

 We now turn to c onsider the princ iples upon which the court should exercise its discretion under O 13 r 8. They are: 

 (i) it is not suffic ient to show merely an arguable defenc e that would justify leave to defend under O 14; it must both have a real prospec t of suc c ess and c arry some degree of c onvic tion; and 

 (ii) if proc eedings are deliberately ignored, this c onduc t, although not amounting to an estoppel at law, must be c onsidered ‘in justic e’ before exerc ising the c ourt’s disc retion to set aside the default judgment. (see The Saudi Eagle; Alpine Bulk Transport Co Inc v Saudi Eagle Shippimg Co Inc ). 

 [emphasis added] 

I need only to mention that _Abdul Gaffer_ has been followed very rec ently by the High Court in _Canberra Development Pte Ltd v Mercurine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2007] SGHC 185</span> (“ _Canberra Development_ ”). In fac t, the High Court in _Canberra Development_ pointed out (at [24]) that the position is not in doubt in the c ase of a regular judgment and in further elaboration of the test in _Abdul Gaffer_ , stated that: 

 To persuade a judge to set aside a regular judgment it is insuffic ient for the defendant to put forward an arguable defenc e that would justify leave to defend under O 14. 

56     I respec tfully agree with the High Court in _Canberra Development_ , adopting _Abdul Gaffer_ as the authority whic h c annot be departed from, that the position is not in doubt. However, before me, the sec ond defendant advanc ed an interesting legal argument in relation to O 13 r 8 whic h indirec tly c hallenged _Abdul Gaffer_ , and whic h I c onsider nec essary of further analysis. 

57     Citing _Singapore Civil Procedure 2007_ , it was urged upon me that quite apart from the high authority of _Abdul Gaffer_ (whic h purports to lay down the princ iples whic h a c ourt _should_ apply when exerc ising its disc retion under O 13 r 8), there are ac tually two c lasses of c ases, the latter of whic h the test in _Abdul Gaffer_ does _not_ apply. It was said that where (a) eac h party’s c ase would c arry c onvic tion if it stood alone; (b) the issue of liability will turn entirely on the assessment of the fac ts at trial; and (c ) the c ourt is not able to say whic h will suc c eed, it is quite impossible to be dogmatic about the extent to whic h the c ourt must be satisfied of the validity of the suggested defenc e, c iting _Allen v Taylor_ [1992] PIQR 255 at 259. _Allen v Taylor_ , as far as I am aware, has never been applied by a Singapore c ourt before. In fac t, _Singapore Civil Procedure 2007_ does not c ite a single Singapore c ase whic h supports the proposition of a sec ond c lass of c ases to whic h _Abdul Gaffer_ does _not_ apply. 

58     Additionally, it was also suggested that if the defendant did not deliberately ignore proc eedings in the c ontext of an applic ation under O 13 r 8, the c ourt will not sc rutinise the defenc e as stric tly as the test put forth in _Abdul Gaffer_. This is said to mitigate the rather harsh effec t of a stric t c omplianc e with _Abdul Gaffer_. Indeed, as pointed out by Daniel Chia in “Setting aside a regular default judgment: What is a good defenc e on the merits – real prospec t of suc c ess or arguable, triable issue?” (1996) 17 Sing LR 221 (“Setting aside a regular default judgment”) (at 241), the present test adopted by the Singapore c ourts in dec iding whether to set aside a judgment entered in default of 


appearanc e “tilts the balanc e too far in favour of the plaintiff and exorbitantly distorts the objec t of c ivil proc edure”. Ac c ordingly, it was submitted by the sec ond defendant that the full rigour of the _Abdul Gaffer_ test did not apply in suc h c ases, notwithstanding the fac t that (and this was not argued) there is no loc al c ase supporting these propositions. 

59     Stric t adherents to the doc trine of _stare decisis_ will highlight at this junc ture that _Abdul Gaffer_ propounded a test whic h a c ourt _should_ exerc ise its disc retion under O 13 r 8 (see [55] above); as suc h, there c an be no distinc tion between two c lasses of c ases sinc e the Court of Appeal made no distinc tion between any c lass of c ases. While I am fully aware that I am bound by higher authority, I am equally of the view that where suc h higher authority is not entirely c lear, or has been qualified indirec tly by another authority of equal standing in rec ent times, the lower c ourt should not be prec luded solely by the matter of prec edenc e from re-examining the c ase law and determining whether there is sc ope for further c larific ation of the law in order to do justic e as a matter of fairness and princ iple. 

_The basis for discretion to set aside judgments entered in default of appearance_ 

60     An appropriate avenue from whic h to start this examination is the underlying basis for the disc retion under O 13 r 8 itself. The princ iple underlying the disc retionary power of the c ourt to set aside a judgment entered in default of appearanc e has been said to be that unless and until the c ourt has pronounc ed a judgment upon the merits or by c onsent, it is to have the power to revoke the expression of its c oerc ive power where that has been only been obtained by a failure to follow any of the rules of proc edure: _per_ Lord Atkin in _Evans v Bartlam_ [1937] AC 473 at 480. This has been endorsed by the High Court in _Hsing Mei Construction Pte Ltd v Lim Check Meng_ <span class="citation">[2000] SGHC 75</span> and also by the Court of Appeal in the rec ent c ase of _Su Sh-Hsyu v Wee Yue Chew_ <span class="citation">[2007] 3 SLR 673</span> (“ _Su Sh-Hsyu_ ”) (at [42]). Indeed, V K Rajah JA, who delivered the judgment of the c ourt, went on to dec lare (at [43]) that: 

 In an applic ation to set aside this type of default judgment, the question of whether there is a defenc e on the merits is the dominant feature to be weighed against the applic ant’s explanation both for the default and for any delay, as well as against prejudic e to the other party: Shocked ([41] supra ) at 379 c iting Evans v Bartlam , Vann v Awford (1986) 130 SJ 682 and The Saudi Eagle [1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 221. This position has been adopted loc ally: see Hong Leong Finance Ltd v Tay Keow Neo <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 205</span>. 

61     Somewhat c uriously, this very fundamental rationale underlying the disc retion in O 13 r 8 was not c ited by the Court of Appeal in the hitertho leading loc al c ase of _Abdul Gaffer_. While the Court of Appeal in the more rec ent c ase of _Su Sh-Hsyu_ c onstrained itself to passing only “brief c omments” on the law relating to the setting aside of default judgments under O 13 r 8, I think that its elevation of the rationale underlying O 13 r 8 as stated in _Evans v Bartlam_ lends welc ome assistanc e to the question of whether there exists a sec ond c lass of c ases involving regular judgments under O 13 r 8 wherein the c ourts will not adopt the stric t _Abdul Gaffer_ approac h in full. 

62     It is perhaps trite to state that every law exists for a purpose and where the rule bec omes divorc ed from its purpose of even bec omes antithetic al to its prior purpose, then it ought to be reviewed. That is why the Court of Appeal’s formal statement of the purpose for the disc retion under O 13 r 8 is important in the disc ussion to follow. In order to set the c ontext of the disc ussion in its proper light, I should first set out the prior position before _Abdul Gaffer_ , and the _Abdul Gaffer_ test itself. Before doing so, I should ac knowledge the c onsiderable assistanc e I derived from the exc ellently written artic le by Daniel Chia, _viz_ , “Setting aside a regular default judgment”. 


_The previous test: arguable or triable issue_ 

63     It has been said that the old test found expression in the House of Lords dec ision of _Evans v Bartlam_. In that c ase, Evans owed Bartlam a sum of money. Bartlam sued Evans, but Evans failed to enter an appearanc e. Bartlam therefore obtained judgment in default. Thereafter, Evans asked for time to pay, and Bartlam gave him a further seven days. However, before those seven days expired, Evans applied to c ourt to set aside the default judgment. The English Court of Appeal dismissed the applic ation, holding on the first ground that the judge below was prec luded from exerc ising his disc retion to set aside the judgment by the fac t that with knowledge of the judgment Evans had applied for the matter to stand over for him to see if he c ould arrange to pay and Bartlam had c onsented to let it stand over for seven days. Alternatively, it was held that Evans had approbated the default judgment and therefore was obliged to submit to it. The House of Lords disagreed with the English Court of Appeal. In holding first that the English Court of Appeal’s reasons for dec lining to exerc ise its disc retion to set aside the default judgment are erroneous, the House of Lords then went on to state the princ iples by whic h the c ourts have laid down for themselves to guide in the exerc ise of the disc retion. In this respec t, Lord Atkin said (at 480): 

 The disc retion is in terms unc onditional. The Courts, however, have laid down for themselves rules to guide them in the normal exerc ise of their disc retion. One is that where the judgment was obtained regularly there must be an affidavit of merits, meaning that the applicant must produce to the Court evidence that he has a prima fac ie defence. [emphasis added] 

Further down in his speec h, the learned law lord further opined thus: 

 But in any c ase in my opinion the Court does not, and I doubt whether it c an, lay down rigid rules whic h deprive it of jurisdic tion. Even the first rule as to affidavit of merits could, in no doubt rare but appropriate cases, be departed from. [emphasis added] 

It was in this c ontext that the famous words alluding to the underlying basis for the disc retion under O 13 r 8 of the Rules were uttered (see [60] above). 

64     Lord Wright seemed to have shared Lord Atkin’s view in the same c ase when he said that the primary c onsideration is whether the defendant “has merits to whic h the c ourt should pay heed” (at 489). Lord Russell of Killowen c onsidered the matter in some detail as follows (at 482): 

 The c ontention [advanc ed by c ounsel for Bartlam] no doubt c ontains this element of truth, that from the nature of the c ase no judge c ould, in exerc ising the disc retion c onferred on him by the rule, fail to c onsider both ( a ) whether any useful purpose c ould be served by setting aside the judgment, and obviously no useful purpose would be served if there were no possible defenc e to the ac tion, and ( b ) how it c ame about that the applic ant found himself bound by a judgment regularly obtained, to whic h he c ould have set up some serious defenc e. But to say that these two matters must necessarily enter into the judge’s consideration is quite a different thing from asserting that their proof is a condition precedent to the existence or exercise of the discretionary power to set aside a judgment signed in default of appearance. [emphasis added] 

Although Lord Russell seemed to allude to a stric ter test than one requiring merely an arguable or triable issue when he used the expression “serious defenc e”, I doubt very muc h that he had intended his words to have suc h an effec t. Indeed, the learned law lord had explained his earlier statement that there must be a useful purpose to be served by setting aside the judgment by stating that there would be suc h a purpose when there was a _possible_ defenc e to the ac tion. I do not think that the expression “serious defenc e” was intended to qualify the earlier referenc e to “possible defenc e” as 


Lord Russell then goes on to state that, in any event, the disc retion to set aside a judgment in default of appearanc e need not be prec onditioned on the proof of these matters whic h must nec essarily enter into the judge’s c onsideration. In other words, the exerc ise of the disc retion is not dependent on the satisfac tion of c ertain c onditions, although these c onditions may feature in the c onsideration whether to exerc ise the disc retion. 

65     The “arguable or triable issue” test was subsequently followed in later dec isions. Lord Denning in _Burns v Kondel_ [1971] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 554 held (at 555) that the defendant does not have to show a good defenc e on the merits. Instead, he needs only show a defenc e whic h disc loses an arguable or triable issue. Chao Hic k Tin J expressed the same view in _Singapore Gems v The Personal Representatives for Akber Ali, deceased_ <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR 254</span> (“ _Singapore Gems_ ”), in whic h he held that the defenc e need only disc lose “an arguable or triable” issue (at 259). 

_The present test: a real prospect of success_ 

66     The test in _Evans v Bartlam_ was explained and ultimately (at least loc ally) superseded by the dec ision of the English Court of Appeal in _Alpine Bulk Transport v Saudi Eagle Shipping_ [1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 221 (“ _The Saudi Eagle_ ”). In this c ase, the plaintiff c hartered the _Saudi Eagle_ from the defendant shipowners, but the liner booking note stated that the vessel was the _Saudi Ambassador_. The booking note was made subjec t to the Conlinebill terms and provided that the c ontrac t was between the “Merc hant and the Owner of the vessel” and, further, that the shipowner shall be liable for any damage or loss due to any breac h or non-performanc e of any obligation. The defendant refused to load the c argo and the plaintiff c laimed damages. No notic e of intention to defend was given by the defendant. The plaintiff signed interloc utory judgment in default and their damages were later assessed. The defendant, having at one stage deliberately dec ided not to defend the proc eedings bec ause it had no assets, rec alled that sec urity had been put up by them, and ac c ordingly applied for leave to set aside the judgment and for leave to defend on the ground that the plaintiff had sued the wrong defendant. The defendant appealed against the lower c ourt’s dec ision not to set aside the judgment. 

67     Sir Roger Ormrod, delivering the judgment of the English Court of Appeal, helpfully summarised the law (at 223): 

 The following “general indic ations to help the Court in exerc ising the disc retion” ... c an be extrac ted from the speec hes in Evans v Bartlam ... bearing in mind that “in matters of disc retion no one c ase c an be authority for another...” 

 (i) a judgment signed in default is a regular judgment from whic h, subjec t to (ii) below, the plaintiff derives rights of property; 

 (ii) the Rules of Court give to the Judge a disc retionary power to set aside the default judgment whic h is in terms “unc onditional” and the Court should not “lay down rigid rules whic h deprive it of jurisdic tion”; 

 (iii) the purpose of this disc retionary power is to avoid the injustic e whic h might be c aused if judgment followed automatic ally on default; 

 (iv) the primary c onsideration is whether the defendant “has merits to whic h the Court should pay heed,” not as a rule of law but as a matter of c ommon sense, sinc e there is no point in setting aside a judgment if the defendant has no defenc e and if he has shown the “merits” the ... Court will not, prima facie , desire to let a judgment pass on, whic h there has 


 been no proper adjudic ation; 

 (v) again as a matter of c ommon sense, though not making it a c ondition prec edent, the Court will take into ac c ount the explanation as to how it c ame about that the defendant ... found himself bound by a judgment regularly obtained to whic h he c ould have set up some serious defenc e. 

68     He then c onsidered the nature of the c ase required of the defendant to set aside a regular default judgment (at 223): 

 [What does the expression] “primary c onsideration” really mean ... [i]n the c ourse of his argument, [c ounsel] used the phrase “an arguable c ase” and it, or an equivalent, oc c urs in some of the reported c ases. ... This phrase is c ommonly used in relation to RSC O 14, to indic ate the standard to be met by a defendant who is seeking leave to defend [an applic ation by the plaintiff for summary judgment]. 

He c ontinued (at 223): 

 If [“arguable c ase”] is used in the same sense in relation to setting aside a default judgment, it does not ac c ord ... with the standard indic ated by eac h of their Lordships in Evans v Bartlam. All of them c learly c ontemplated that a defendant who is asking the Court to exerc ise its disc retion in his favour should show that he has a defence which has a real prospect of success ... [emphasis added] 

Further, it was said that (at 223): 

 ... [I]t would be surprising if the standard required for obtaining leave to defend (whic h has only to displac e the plaintiff’s assertion that there is no defenc e) were the same as that required to displac e a regular judgment of the Court and with it the rights ac quired by the plaintiff. ... [T]herefore, to arrive at a reasoned assessment of the justice of the case the Court must form a provisional view of the probable outcome if the judgment were to be set aside and the defence developed. The “arguable” defenc e must c arry some degree of c onvic tion. [emphasis added] 

69     The English Court of Appeal therefore found that it is not enough for the defendant to show a mere “arguable” defenc e. While suc h a defenc e suffic es to justify leave to defend summary judgment under Order 14, it is not enough to set aside a regular default judgment. A default judgment whic h has been regularly entered c an only be set aside if the defendant c an show, on his affidavit of merits, that his “arguable” defenc e has a real prospec t of suc c ess and c arries some degree of c onvic tion. In other words, the c ourt must be able to predic t the outc ome of the c ase on the basis of the evidenc e it has on the applic ation to set aside the default judgment; if it is unable to do so and yet it is unable to say with c ertainty whether the defendant will fail, it will have to refuse relief. On the fac ts, the it was found that “the evidenc e falls short of proof that _Saudi Eagle_ was on time c harter ... [so that the Court did] not think that the defendants [had] shown that they have a defenc e whic h has any reasonable prospec t of suc c ess”. 

_The Saudi Eagle accepted and applied in Singapore_ 

70     This new test was followed in Singapore by MPH Rubin JC in _Hong Leong Finance Ltd v Tay Keow Neo & Anor_ <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 205</span> (“ _Hong Leong Finance Ltd_ ”), a c ase referred to by the Court of Appeal in the rec ent c ase of _Su Sh-Hsyu_. In _Hong Leong Finance Ltd_ , the defendants were direc tors of a 


defunc t c ompany. They exec uted a guarantee in favour of the plaintiff financ e c ompany whic h had extended c redit fac ilities to them. The assistant registrar dismissed their applic ation to set aside judgment entered against them in default of appearanc e. The defendants appealed to the High Court, alleging _inter alia_ that they had ac ted under undue influenc e and were unaware of the nature of the doc ument they had assigned. Their appeal was dismissed bec ause Rubin JC found that their c laims were “sham and had very little substanc e” (at [60]), so that the defendants c learly failed the standard required of them, whic h was that of “a defenc e whic h had [a] reasonable prospec t of suc c ess” (at [61]). The learned judge stated that (at [61]): 

 It is my view that the defendants have not shown that they have a defenc e which had any reasonable prospect of success on the grounds stated and the evidence placed before me. Above all, the c onduc t of the defendants in ignoring the servic e of proc ess when they allowed the judgment to be entered in default, further fortifies my view that their c onduc t was deliberate and that they c ame in to dispute the issues only when they found they were going to be made bankrupts. The defenc es raised were by not any means meritorious and the defendants had deliberately allowed the plaintiff’s c laims to go by default. [emphasis added] 

71     Although Rubin JC referred to both _Evans v Bartlam_ and _The Saudi Eagle_ , he had apparently ac c epted that _The Saudi Eagle_ c orrec tly interpreted _Evans v Bartlam_ as requiring a higher standard than the “arguable or triable issue” test. However, as Daniel Chia in “Setting aside a regular default judgment” notes at 227, it was (with respec t) unfortunate that no further explanation was furnished as to the c ourt’s views on the _possible_ differenc es between the two standards espec ially sinc e the fac ts of _Hong Leong Finance Ltd_ were suc h that the defendants would have failed both the “reasonable prospec t of suc c ess” test and the lower “arguable or triable issue” standard. _The Saudi Eagle_ was simply applied without question. This is sinc e Rubin JC had found that the defendants’ c laims were “sham”, a standard whic h does not pass muster for unc onditional leave to defend under O 14. The apparent c onfusion in the loc al position was further heightened when, barely a year later, the High Court dec ided in _Singapore Gems_ that the for the purpose of setting aside a default judgment, the defenc e on the merits whic h the defendant was required to show need only disc lose an “arguable or triable issue”. 

72     Of c ourse, _Abdul Gaffer_ was then dec ided by the Court of Appeal a few years later and by its adoption of _The Saudi Eagle_ (again without any detailed explanation), the position in Singapore was and has been regarded as settled. Indeed, as I have mentioned earlier, the High Court in _Canberra Development_ very rec ently reaffirmed that the position in Singapore as not being in doubt. 

_The Saudi Eagle doubted and qualified elsewhere_ 

73     However, while the position in Singapore is generally regarded as being settled, the same c annot be said about that in England. Indeed, part of the reason for this may be that arguments relating to the c orrec tness of _The Saudi Eagle_ (as ac c epted in _Abdul Gaffer_ ) have not been as readily advanc ed for the c ourts’ c onsideration. This c ould also be why the purported existenc e of a sec ond c lass of c ases in _Singapore Civil Procedure 2007_ is based entirely on English authorities whic h may not stand up to sc rutiny when c onsidered against the bac kdrop of _Abdul Gaffer_ , whic h seemingly lays down a mandatory set of guidelines to be applied in c onjunc tion with the disc retion under O 13 r 8 (see also [55] above). Coming bac k to the issue at hand, it is without question that _The Saudi Eagle_ , despite its relatively c alm ac c eptanc e into Singapore law, has fac ed muc h tougher c urrents in other jurisdic tions. 

(1) England 


74     As Prof Jeffrey Pinsler SC notes in his seminal work, _Singapore Court Practice 2006_ (LexisNexis, 2006) at 195, it is interesting that Hobhouse J in _The Ruben Martinez Villena_ [1987] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 621 (a c ase whic h has not been c onsidered by the Singapore c ourts) doubted the purported effec t of _The Saudi Eagle_. Hobhouse J reiterated what he thought was the rationale and true meaning of the dec ision in _Evans v Bartlam_ thus (at 623): 

 So the ratio of Lord Wright is that it is a matter of disc retion whic h depends on the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, but the test that he held should be satisfied in that c ase was “he c learly shows an issue whic h the c ourt should try”, and similar language is used by Lord Atkin: “He must show on the evidenc e that he has a prima facie defenc e” and the spirit of the judgment of Lord Russell is to the same effec t. The logic of the decision is, as I have said, that there is no purpose in setting aside a judgment if there is not going to be something to be gained by having a trial, so that the defendant must show a real prospect that, if the matter goes to trial, there will be some different decision. One way that that c an be expressed is if the defendant c an show that he has a “good arguable defenc e” or, if one prefers it, “an arguable defenc e”, although I think “a good arguable defenc e” is nearer the right terminology. Similarly, it c an be said: “a defenc e whic h has a real prospec t of suc c ess”. Those phrases are the phrases whic h were relied upon before me by the plaintiffs in resisting this applic ation and I think they are legitimate phrases to use. In other c ases the simple phrase “arguable defenc e” has been used, and that may be more appropriate in c ertain situations bec ause, as is c lear, all these c ases depend upon their own c irc umstanc es; in another situation it has been said, to quote Lord Denning in Burns v. Kondel , he need only show a defenc e whic h disc loses an arguable or triable issue. Those are very similar criteria and the emphasis may just arise from the difference that is presented by the facts in each case. [emphasis added] 

75     A little further down in his judgment, Hobhouse J, c ommenting on the effec t of _The Saudi Eagle_ , c ontinues and c onc ludes that _The Saudi Eagle_ was never meant to c reate a new and more onerous standard than the one in _Evans v Bartlam_ (at 625): 

 But, in the c ourse of his judgment, Sir Roger Ormrod did refer to various other c riteria that might be applied. Most of what he says is c onsistent with what I have said. He refers to “a good prospec t” of suc c ess or in other plac es “an arguable defenc e”, but at one plac e he does say something that is inc onsistent. He says: 

 Indeed, it would be surprising if the standard required for obtaining leave to defend, whic h is only to displac e the plaintiff's assertion that there is no defenc e, were the same as that required to displac e a regular judgment of the Court and with it the rights ac quired by the plaintiff. In our opinion, therefore, to arrive at a reasoned assessment of the justic e of the c ase the Court must form a provisional view of the probable outc ome if the judgment were to be set aside and the defenc e developed. The arguable defenc e must c arry some degree of c onvic tion. 

 If in that passage he is intending to say that the Court must do its best to predict the outcome of the action if the judgment is set aside, and should only set aside a judgment if it is satisfied that the outcome of the action will, on a better than 50-50 chance, be a judgment in favour of the defendants, then I consider that statement goes beyond the law as it has been laid down in the authorities. As it is an obiter dictum it is not binding on me and I am under no obligation to follow it; but I doubt whether Sir Roger Ormrod was intending to say that. He was presented with a c ase in whic h the suggested defenc es involved just simple questions of law; they were questions of c onstruc tion; he c onsidered that they were unarguable and, therefore, there was no reason for setting aside the judgment. 


 [emphasis added] 

76     As Daniel Chia notes in “Setting aside a regular default judgment” at 240, Hobhouse J was probably suggesting that, on the fac ts of _The Saudi Eagle_ , the defendant would have failed to establish any defenc e on the merits whether the “arguable or triable issue” test or the “real prospec t of suc c ess” test was applied. Hobhouse J therefore c onc luded that Sir Roger Ormrod c ould not have intended to c reate a new and higher standard to be followed. Indeed, the varying expressions used, be it “real prospec t of suc c ess” or “arguable defenc e”, are just different ways of expressing the same standard, sinc e differenc e phrases were appropriate in different c irc umstanc es. Dealing with the rather explic it view of Sir Roger Omrod that the standard was not the same as that applied in O 14 applic ations, Hobhouse J simply said that this was not supported by existing authority. 

77     In _Allen v Taylor_ , Dillon LJ, delivering the judgment of the English Court of Appeal, stated similarly thus (at 259): 

 It is quite impossible to be dogmatic about the extent to whic h the c ourt must be satisfied of the validity of the suggested defenc e. There must be numerous cases where the issue will turn entirely on the assessment of the facts at trial : eac h party’s c ase would c arry c onvic tion if it stood alone and without c onduc ting a trial the c ourt is not able to say whic h will suc c eed. The present is, it seems to me, one of those c ases. [emphasis added] 

Indeed, Prof Pinsler in _Singapore Court Practice 2006_ pertinently observes (at 198) that this c onc lusion would seem to c onflic t with the unqualified direc tion found in _The Saudi Eagle_ that “... the c ourt must form a provisional view of the probable outc ome if the judgment were to be set aside and the defenc e developed”. 

78     Another c ase whic h I need to point out and that is _Day v RAC Motoring Services_ [1999] 1 WLR 2150, wherein the English Court of Appeal held that a c ourt, in dec iding whether to set aside a judgment in default of defenc e, need not be satisfied that there was a real likelihood that the defendant would suc c eed, but merely that the defendant had an arguable c ase whic h c arried some degree of c onvic tion. An important part of the dec ision appears at 2157, whic h I quote below: 

 This may be largely a matter of semantics and it would be better if the differences in language in these cases could be viewed as the emphasis in a particular case to the particular facts of that particular case. Perhaps the best guidanc e of all is in Sir Roger Ormrod’s judgment that this is not a rule of law but a matter of c ommonsense. Thus it is usually easy to identify the c ase whic h is hopeless and say “There is no real prospec t of suc c ess.” I add the emphasis to make the point that one is looking at the matter negatively. The approach is distorted if one uses “real prospects of success” as a positive test. That wrongly enc ourages a test of judging fac t on affidavit and then c oming to a provisional view of the probable outc ome. I agree, however, that the arguable c ase must c arry some degree of c onvic tion but judges should be very wary of trying issues of fac t on evidenc e where the fac ts are apparently c redible and are to be set aside against the fac ts being advanc ed by the other side. Choosing between them is the func tion of the trial judge, not the judge on the interloc utory applic ation, unless there is some inherent improbability in what is being asserted or some extraneous evidenc e whic h would c ontradic t it. I would therefore be a little hesitant to elevate the test into, as it is advanced in The Supreme Court Practice, “a real likelihood that a defendant will succeed.” [emphasis in bold italic s; original emphasis in italic s] 

79     From this survey of the English dec isions following _The Saudi Eagle_ , none of whic h have been c onsidered by a Singapore c ourt, it is c lear that the _The Saudi Eagle_ has either not been ac c epted as 


standing for a more rigorous test, or simply qualified to the extent of non-existenc e, even if later c ases suc h as _Swain v Hillman_ [2001] 1 All ER 91 have c ontinued to use the expression “real prospec t of suc c ess”. It seems to me that Sir Roger Ormrod’s supposed elevation of the test in _Evans v Bartlam_ to one whic h requires “a real likelihood of suc c ess” has been interpreted to be _merely another way_ of expressing the “arguable or triable issue” test. In this sense, there has not been a new test at all following _The Saudi Eagle_ but simply another way of stating the old test. The c an be c ontrasted with the views of the Singapore c ourts, whic h have hitherto ac c epted that _The Saudi Eagle_ , as ac c epted in _Abdul Gaffer_ , stands for a higher test than the “arguable or triable issue” test. 

(2) Malaysia 

80     It remains for me to state rather briefly, with the invaluable assistanc e of Prof Pinsler’s _Singapore Court Practice 2006_ (at 197), that the c ourts in Malaysia have been more guarded about ac c epting _The Saudi Eagle_ test. For example, in _PL Construction v Abdullah bin Said_ [1989] 1 MLJ 60, it was said that a defenc e on the merits means a defenc e whic h disc loses “an arguable and triable issue”. 

81     Similarly, in _Hasil Bumi Perumahan v United Malayan Banking_ [1994] 1 MLJ 312, the Supreme Court of Malaysia was of the view that the approac h in _The Saudi Eagle_ was not entirely c lear, and that the test to set aside a default judgment ought to remain the same to determine whether an applic ation for summary judgment should suc c eed (at 321): 

 ... the guidelines in Evans v Bartlam should be ac c epted. In our view, in order to suc c eed in his applic ation the applic ant must show that he has a defenc e whic h has some merits and whic h the c ourt should try. To use c ommon and plain language, the applic ant must show that his defenc e is not a sham defenc e but one that is prima facie , raising serious issues as a bona fide reasonable defenc e. 

82     With the approac hes of other jurisdic tions in mind, I turn now to examine the law in Singapore. 

_Is there scope for the existence of a second class of cases where Abdul Gaffer does not apply with its usual rigour?_ 

(1) Is the existenc e of a sec ond c lass of c ases supported by authority? 

83     The first question whic h I need to answer is whether there is a sec ond c lass of c ases to whic h _Abdul Gaffer_ does not apply with its usual rigour. I note first that the very premise of a sec ond c lass of c ases purportedly derives its authority from _Allen v Taylor_ , as the learned authors of _Singapore Civil Procedure 2007_ rely on at 121. However, it seems to me that Dillon LJ was of the same view as Hobhouse J in _The Ruben Martinez Villena_ in that _The Saudi Eagle_ never purported to lay down a rigid rule of universal applic ation whic h was, _at the same time_ , of a more onerous standard that the _Evans v Bartlam_ test. As I have mentioned, _Allen v Taylor_ is the subjec t of a material passage in _Singapore Civil Procedure 2007_ (at 121) whic h was the subjec t of the submission of law before me, and as suc h I think it is worthwhile to reproduc e this passage in its entirety and then disc uss it in some detail: 

 (7) In another c lass of c ases, where: (a) eac h party’s c ase would c arry c onvic tion if it stood alone; (b) the issue of liability will turn entirely on the assessment of the fac ts at trial; and (c ) and the c ourt is not able to say whic h will suc c eed, it is quite impossible to be dogmatic about the extent to whic h the c ourt must be satisfied of the validity of the suggested defenc e: Allen v. Taylor [1992] P.I.Q.R. 255 at 259. 

84     In my respec tful view, this passage, whic h purports that _Allen v Taylor_ stood for the proposition 


that there exists a sec ond c lass of c ases wherein _The Saudi Eagle_ applied with less rigour, is not entirely desc riptive of the dec ision in _Allen v Taylor_. In my view, all that Dillon LJ intended to say was something similar with the views of Hobhouse J in _The Ruben Martinez Villena_ , _ie_ , that that c annot be a universal standard to guide the exerc ise of disc retion for the setting aside of a default judgment _and_ that _The Saudi Eagle_ was never intended to lay down a test different from the test in _Evans v Bartlam_ (see [76] above). I do not think that both learned English judges ac c epted that _The Saudi Eagle_ stood for a higher test than that for O 14 applic ations. As suc h, I am unable to see how _Allen v Taylor_ c an stand for the proposition that there is a _second_ c lass of c ases apart from that in _The Saudi Eagle_. 

85     In any event, _even_ ac c epting that there is a sec ond c lass of c ases propounded by Dillon LJ, I do not think that the passage in _Singapore Civil Procedure 2007_ ac c urately reproduc es the c riteria by whic h to assess whic h c ases fell within this sec ond c lass. Transposing the passage onto the relevant paragraph in _Allen v Taylor_ (reproduc ed at [77] above), I think that the _sole_ c riterion applied by Dillon LJ was when “ _the issue will turn entirely on the assessment of the facts at trial_ ”. The further exposition that “eac h party’s c ase would c arry c onvic tion if it stood alone and without c onduc ting a trial the c ourt is not able to say whic h will suc c eed” are, to my mind, but further reasons explaining why in c ases involving issues of fac t, a supposedly less rigorous standard ought to apply (as c ontended for in _Singapore Civil Procedure 2007_ ). As suc h, I do not think that there are _three_ c riteria (denoted by (a), (b) and (c ) in the relevant passage) in asc ertaining whether a given c ase fell into the so-c alled “sec ond c lass” (if this proposition is c orrec t in the first plac e). Criteria (b) and (c ) are but elaborations of c riterion (a), whic h must stand on its own. Ac c ordingly, I think that if at all there is a sec ond c lass of c ases where _The Saudi Eagle_ applies with less rigour, this is where there is a triable issue of fac t whic h, as will be seen, is supportable by rec ourse to the underlying basis of O 13 r 8. 

86     However, this is not to say that there c annot be a sec ond c lass of c ases in Singapore, save that its authority c annot be supported by the passage in _Singapore Civil Procedure 2007_. It is important to note that in Singapore, unlike in England, there is one dec ision ( _Abdul Gaffer_ ) whic h has been unquestionably ac c epted as c orrec t by the lower c ourts thus far. This means that there is at least ac c eptanc e of one c lass of c ases from whic h deviations may be thought to be authority for a sec ond c lass of c ases. 

(2) The High Court’s dec isions lend support to sec ond c lass of c ases 

# (A) AWYONG SHI PENG V LIM SIU LAY <span class="citation">[2007] 2 SLR 225</span> (“ AWYONG SHI PENG ”) 

87     Preliminary support for the view that there exists a sec ond c lass of c ases c an be derived from a rec ent High Court dec ision. In _Awyong Shi Peng_ , the respondent-plaintiff had entered judgment against the appellant-defendant in default of defenc e and the appellant filed an applic ation to set aside the default judgment on the ground that he had applied to strike out the respondent’s ac tion and thought that by reason of that, the defenc e need not be filed in the meantime. The High Court, in dismissing the appeal from the lower c ourt’s dec ision to set aside the default judgment, held, with respec t to the exerc ise of disc retion to set aside a default judgment under O 19 r 9, as follows (at [8]): 

 The disc retionary power of the c ourt to set aside a default judgment that has been entered into regularly, as was the c ase here, is unc onditional. The overriding princ iple in the exerc ise of the c ourt’s disc retionary power is to avoid the injustic e whic h may result if judgment follows automatic ally on default. In exerc ising its disc retion to set aside the judgment, the c ourt would look at whether the defendant had established a defenc e with a real prospec t of suc c ess and 


 whic h c arried some degree of c onvic tion (applying Alpine Bulk Transport Co Inc v Saudi Eagle Shipping Co Inc [1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 221 (“ The Saudi Eagle ”); followed in Abdul Gaffer v Chua Kwang Yong <span class="citation">[1995] 1 SLR 484</span> (“ Abdul Gaffer ”)). However, where the defendant did not deliberately ignore the proc eedings, the merits of the defenc e may not be sc rutinised as stric tly as propounded in The Saudi Eagle (see Singapore Civil Procedure 2003 (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2003) at para 13/8/3). 

Applying this to the fac ts of that c ase, the High Court held that it was evident from the affidavit of the appellant that he did not deliberately ignore the proc eedings. Ac c ordingly, applying a lesser test than the one in _The Saudi Eagle_ , it was held that (at [9]): 

 At present, the merits of the c ase appear to be evenly balanc ed. It was not readily apparent from the affidavits filed which of the two parties was generally more truthful and reliable in respect of their claims. It was undeniable from the affidavits that there was substantial dispute of fact between the parties. While it was evident that there might be fraud involved, it is not c lear whic h party was the perpetrator of the fraud. It seemed to me that the appellant may have a defence but that is not a matter for me to dec ide c onc lusively on at this junc ture. It would be fair, therefore, that the appellant be given the opportunity to present his side of the story to the trial judge. [emphasis added] 

88     It will be observed that the High Court did not, as required by _Abdul Gaffer_ , c ome to a view as to whether there was a _real prospect of success_ ; it merely dec ided that there _may_ be a defenc e. The c ourt was c learly not able to tell whic h of the affidavits was more truthful; if so, it would not have been able to c ome to a provisional view as to whic h side was more likely to win, as required by _The Saudi Eagle_. This c learly is a departure from _Abdul Gaffer_ , albeit with respec t to O 19 r 9, not O 13 r 8. 

89     I ac knowledge that the High Court in _Awyong Shi Peng_ was not bound direc tly by _Abdul Gaffer_ as the latter c ase only purported to lay down the binding law with respec t to O 13 r 8. _Awyong Shi Peng_ was a dec ision on the exerc ise of the disc retion under O 19 r 9. Yet, I fail to see why there should be a differenc e in princ iple ac ross both Orders of the Rules. Indeed, both Orders c onc ern the setting aside of a default judgment differ only in how the judgment c ame about: O 13 r 8 being c onc erned with a judgment arising from default of appearanc e to writ, and O 19 r 9 being c onc erned with a judgment arising from default of appearanc e to defenc e. This does not alter the fac t that, in both c ases, the c ourt is c onc erned with setting aside a judgment _obtained not on the merits but because of some non-adherence to some procedural rule_. Indeed, in _TR Networks Ltd and Others v Elixir Health Holdings Pte Ltd and Others_ <span class="citation">[2005] SGHC 106</span> (“ _TR Networks Ltd_ ”), the High Court held (at [32]) that O 19 r 9 “were on the same terms” as O 13 r 8 and seemingly applied _The Saudi Eagle_ test to O 19 r 9 in that c ase. Quite apart from the divergent High Court authorities with respec t to O 19 r 9, _TR Networks Ltd_ at least shows that, in princ iple, the same approac h should apply for both O 13 r 8 and O 19 r 9. On that premise, therefore, _Awyong Shi Peng_ is minimally preliminary support for the view that, despite the leading authority of _Abdul Gaffer_ , there may exist a sec ond c lass of c ases in whic h the full rigour of _Abdul Gaffer_ does not apply. 

(B) OTHER C ASES 

90     From an examination of the other High Court c ases whic h have c ited and applied _Abdul Gaffer_ , I find that there may be some truth to the proposition that there is a sec ond c lass of c ases in whic h _Abdul Gaffer_ does not apply fully, and that this c lass c onc erns questions of fac t whic h the c ourt is unable to say for c ertain whether is true at the interloc utory stage. 


91     There are several reported dec isions c onc erning questions of fac t. For the c ases where the High Court set aside the default judgment, the allegations of fac t were found to be utterly and c ompletely insupportable on the evidenc e before the c ourt. Thus, in _Loh Poh Lai (trading as Edmund Dawn Marine Engineering) v Wei Sheng Marine Services Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1997] 2 SLR 154</span>, the High Court, while dec iding that the test was that as stated in _Abdul Gaffer_ , nonetheless was able to dec ide that there was no real prospec t of suc c ess as the defendant’s allegation of the non-existenc e of the c ontrac t whic h he was now sued on was found to be unsupportable by the evidenc e before the c ourt. Similarly, in _Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Yong Qiang Construction_ <span class="citation">[1999] 4 SLR 447</span>, the High Court found that the defenc e did not have a real prospec t of suc c ess and did not c arry some degree of c onvic tion as, onc e again, the defendant’s allegations of fac t were unsupportable by the evidenc e. In _Zulkifli Baharudin v Koh Lam Son_ <span class="citation">[2000] 2 SLR 233</span>, whic h was a defamation ac tion, the High Court dec lined to set aside the default judgment as the defenc e did not c hallenge the fac ts as alleged by the plaintiff but that, as a matter of law, the words were c learly defamatory. Finally, in _Australian Timber Products Pte Ltd v Koh Brothers Building & Civil Engineering Contractor (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2005] 1 SLR 168</span>, the High Court onc e again endorsed the _Abdul Gaffer_ test and dec ided not to set aside the default judgment as the defendant failed to show that there was any substanc e to its suggested defenc e that the plaintiff’s works were inc omplete and defec tive. This I take it to mean that the allegations of fac t by the defenc e were unsupported by the evidenc e. 

92     On the other hand, where there was a genuine dispute on the fac ts, the High Court has dec ided to set aside the default judgment even though on a stric t reading of _Abdul Gaffer_ , it would not be able to c ome to a provisional view as to the likely outc ome of the trial sinc e the allegations of fac t before it were open to differing interpretations. Thus in _M-Power Development Pte Ltd v Goodway Agencies (Shipping) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2003] SGHC 180</span> (“ _M-Power Development_ ”), where the issue was whether the plaintiff had sued the right party,namely the party who issued the bill of lading, the High Court upheld the lower c ourt’s dec ision to set aside the default judgment. It appears from the judgment that the defenc e had asserted that the defendants were merely the agents of the true party who issued the bill of lading whereas the plaintiff alleged that there is no evidenc e of suc h agenc y. As suc h, there was a question of fac t whic h c ould not be resolved by the c ourt at the interloc utory stage. Despite this, applying the _Abdul Gaffer_ test, the c ourt was able to state that the defenc e had a real prospec t of suc c eeding sinc e the identity of the party who issued the bill of lading was one best c onsidered at trial (at [15]). 

93     Finally, in c ases involving questions of law, the c ourts appear more ready to c ome to the c onc lusion that there is a real prospec t of suc c ess. In _Cosmic Insurance Corp Ltd v Ong Kah Hoe (trading as Ong Industrial Supplies)_ <span class="citation">[1996] 2 SLR 356</span>, the High Court dec ided that the appropriate test was a “real prospec t of suc c ess” and set aside the default judgment as the issue c onc erned a question of law. 

94     From the above examination of the c ase law, I c ome to the c onc lusion that, in so far as questions of fac t are c onc erned, the High Court has in reported dec isions dec lined to set aside the default judgment only where the fac ts alleged by the defenc e are c learly unsupportable. On the other hand, where there is some dispute as to the allegations of fac t but where it c annot be sure for c ertain whic h side is c orrec t, the High Court has set aside the default judgment for the full merits of the c ase to be c onsidered at trial: see, for example, _M-Power Development_. This, to my mind, means one of two things: first, there is a “real prospec t of suc c ess” when there is a triable issue as to fac t (as in _M-Power Development_ ) _or_ sec ond, there is a sec ond c lass of c ases where _Abdul Gaffer_ does not apply with its full rigour, and this is where the c ase c onc erns disputes of fac t. The former c annot be right as the Court of Appeal has in _Abdul Gaffer_ stated that the test in O 13 r 8 is not the same as that for O 14. As suc h, I am of the view that upon the examination of the c ase law, c oupled with the rec ent High Court dec ision of _Awyong Shi Peng_ , there does exist a sec ond c lass of c ases in whic h 


_Abdul Gaffer_ does not apply with its full rigour, and this will be when the issue of liability will turn almost entirely on the assessment of fac ts at trial, as stated by the English Court of Appeal in _Allen v Taylor_. I should stress that I have not c ome to this c onc lusion based solely on the relevant passage in _Singapore Civil Procedure 2007_ , whic h I respec tfully think does not represent Singapore law in so far as it purports to apply _Allen v Taylor_ in Singapore without any Singapore prec edent c ited in support. 

(3) Rec onc iling _Abdul Gaffer_ with _Su Sh-Hsyu_ 

95     I find that with the rec ent pronounc ement by the Court of Appeal of the rationale underlying O 13 r 8 in _Su Sh-Hsyu_ , my c onc lusion above is fortified even further. If _Abdul Gaffer_ is applied unquestionably to every c ase, inc luding those involving disputed allegations of fac t, then I c an hardly see how the wise words of Lord Atkin (see [60] above) whic h underlie and underpin the exerc ise of disc retion under O 13 r 8 c an be given effec t to. 

96     Indeed, Prof Pinsler in _Singapore Court Practice 2006_ notes at 197 that there are two diffic ulties with the approac h in _The Saudi Eagle_ (as applied in _Abdul Gaffer_ ): 

 In the first plac e, the higher standard requires the c ourt to enter into an evaluation of the evidenc e to determine the likely outc ome of the c ase. This task may be compromised by the inconclusiveness of the affidavits, and allegations in the pleadings which have yet to be substantiated by evidence tested on oath. 

 ... 

 Sec ondly, it may be unjust to deprive a defendant who can raise a genuinely triable issue (as opposed to a sham defence) of his opportunity to challenge a plaintiff’s case at trial. 

 [emphasis added] 

These same c onc erns also resonated with Lim Jian Yi in _Canberra Development Pte Ltd v Mercurine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2007] SGHC 107</span> (at [50]), although this was not a question he had to resolve in that c ase. 

97     Prof Pinsler’s words find espec ial relevanc e in so far as affidavits are c onc erned. If the affidavits are inc omplete, or the c ourt hearing the interloc utory applic ation is unable to tell whic h is the truth, would justic e be served by the adherenc e to _Abdul Gaffer_ whic h demands that the c ourt c ome to a provisional view as to the likely suc c ess of the defenc e? Would Lord Atkin’s anxious warning to the c ourts not to dispense with hearing the full merits of c ase unless in extremely c lear c ases (quite apart from mere failure to adhere to rules of proc edure) be given effec t to if, in c ases involving disputes of fac t, the c ourt simply dec lines to set aside the default judgment on the ground that it is unable to c onc lude whic h of two affidavits is more truthful? Ultimately, as Daniel Chia notes in “Setting aside a regular default judgment” at 234, perhaps we would do well to heed the words of the c ourt in the Americ an dec ision of _Jackson v Washington Monthly Co_ (1977) 569 F 2d 119: 

 Trial c ourt dismissal of a lawsuit never heard on its merits is a drastic step, normally to be taken only after unfruitful resort of lesser sanc tions ... sound disc retion hardly c omprehends a pointless exac tion of retribution. 

98     Ac c ordingly, bound by authority that _Abdul Gaffer_ is still the law, and yet taking into ac c ount the rec ent c ase of _Su Sh-Hsyu_ of the same standing, I c onc lude that a satisfac tory rec onc iliation of the two c ases, as well as dec isions of the High Court following _Abdul Gaffer_ , c an only be effec ted by 


dec iding that there exists a c lass of c ases wherein _Abdul Gaffer_ c annot apply with its full rigour. This c lass of c ases would be those in whic h the issue of liability turns almost entirely on the assessment of fac ts at trial. 

(4) Sound reasons to depart from _The Saudi Eagle_ 

99     In fac t, if I were not bound by _Abdul Gaffer_ , I would very respec tfully have thought that there are good reasons to depart entirely from _The Saudi Eagle_. First, the only reason given in _The Saudi Eagle_ for justifying a higher test to set aside default judgments (as c ontrasted from O 14 applic ations) is that there exists a regular c ourt judgment in the former c ase. To my mind, this is a formalistic distinc tion. True it may be that there is a judgment in question under O 13 r 8, but that is a judgment in name rather than in substanc e; it is a judgment obtained without c onsideration of the full merits of the c ase. The defendant has not been heard _fully_. Likewise in an O 14 applic ation, the plaintiff is seeking that the defendant not be heard _fully_. _The underlying basis in both applications is the same_. In both c ases, the c ourt is being asked to dec ide, as a matter of c onvenienc e and effic ac y, whether the defendant ought to be heard fully. In some c ases, the defendant making an applic ation to set aside a default judgment would not have deliberately sought to evade his proc edural responsibilities; he simply did not know of proc eedings against him. Would the underlying rationale for the disc retion under O 13 r 8 (as propounded in _Evans v Bartlam_ ) be advanc ed any further by the applic ation of a higher test? Why should the same test _not_ apply in both O 13 r 8 and O 14? Of c ourse if the defendant had deliberated ignored c ourt proc eedings, there c ould be better reason to penalise him by subjec ting him to a higher test. 

100    I thus find it ironic that if the whole basis to the disc retion to set aside a default judgment is to reserve judgment on the merits of the c ase for a full trial so that justic e c an be done substantively, this supposed rationale is given effec t by the applic ation of test whic h requires the c ourt, in some sense, to pronounc e on the substantive effec t of the defenc e in the absenc e of full arguments. In any event, as the foregoing disc ussion shows, _The Saudi Eagle_ (as applied in _Abdul Gaffer_ ) has been the subjec t of numerous qualific ation and disagreement in both England and Malaysia. Perhaps the time has also c ome for the Court of Appeal to re-examine the issue when the opportunity next arises, but it is not my position to say anything more in this aspec t. For my limited part, bound as I am by authority, I am c onstrained to only find that the _Abdul Gaffer_ does not apply fully in the c lass of c ases I have eluc idated above. 

_Conclusion with respect to the law_ 

101    Ultimately, in my view, one must not be unduly bound up by the c olourful expressions used in the c ase law relating to O 13 r 8. Whether the expression used is “arguable or triable issue”, “real prospec t of suc c ess” or “c arried some degree of c onvic tion”, one must not lose the proverbial woods for the trees and lose sight of the rationale that underlies and underpins the exerc ise of the disc retion under O 13 r 8, and that is that the c ourts will be extremely slow to allow judgment to be passed when the merits of the c ase have not been c onc lusively argued before it. This in part flows from the time-honoured tradition that every party to an ac tion has a right to be heard and indeed forms one of the very fundamental tenets of natural justic e. The importanc e of the House of Lords dec ision of _Evans v Bartlam_ is not so muc h its support for the “arguable or triable issue” test but for the law lords’ c lear exposition of the very premise of O 13 r 8. Now that the Court of Appeal in _Su Sh-Hsyu_ has finally reaffirmed the underlying basis for the disc retion under O 13 r 8 and elevated it to the same authoritative standard as the _Abdul Gaffer_ test, it nec essarily falls for the lower c ourts to rec onc ile the two. In my view, there is no c onflic t between the two views _if_ one were to take the view that _Abdul Gaffer_ does not apply fully in all c ases. 


102    In summary, my views on the law regulating the exerc ise of the disc retion under O 13 r 8 are suc h: in order to give effec t to _both_ the Court of Appeal dec isions in _Abdul Gaffer_ and _Su Sh-Hsyu_ , I ac c ept the sec ond defendant’s submission before me that in c ases involving liability whic h turns almost entirely on the assessment of fac ts at trial, _Abdul Gaffer_ does not apply with its full rigour, and the applic able test would be that if the defendant c an show an “arguable or triable issue”, the c ourt c ould (not should, sinc e O 13 r 8 ultimately enc ompasses a disc retion) set aside the judgment obtained in default of appearanc e to writ. 

**_Application of the law to the present facts_** 

103    I turn now to apply the law as disc ussed to the fac ts at hand. 

_Whether there had been undue delay_ 

104    However, lest it be thought that I have not applied my mind to this issue, let me state at the outset that I do not think that there had been undue delay by the sec ond defendant in applying for the default judgment to be set aside: see, for example, _European Asian Bank v Chia Ngee Thuang & anor_ <span class="citation">[1995] 3 SLR 171</span>. I am satisfied that the sec ond defendant, who only knew about the judgments entered against him in September 2007, needed some time to review files before he c ommenc ed the present applic ation more than a month later. This was not an undue delay. Indeed, I am also c onvinc ed that the sec ond defendant had not sought to evade the c urrent c ourt proc eedings against him, and as suc h there is no reason for me to dec line not to exerc ise my disc retion under O 13 r 8. 

_Whether liability depended on assessment of facts at trial_ 

105    The general allegation made by the plaintiffs is that the defendants never rendered any opinion, advised them of the risks, or dutifully kept them informed of the developments espec ially the negotiations that they had c onduc ted with the lawyers of Tan and Thian. It was further alleged that they did not forward to the plaintiffs any drafts of the various agreements that they had prepared pursuant to these negotiations or explained these doc uments to them. It was further alleged that the defendants only told the plaintiffs to sign the doc uments on the day itself without explaining any of the c ontents. In addition, it was alleged that the defendants did not take proper c are and were not diligent in prosec uting the litigation even though they were aware that there were other c reditors with c laims against Tan and Thian. It was thus due to the defendants’ c onduc t that led to Tan and Thian being able to delay the proc eedings and thwart rec overy of the monies due to them. These were all deposed to by the plaintiffs in their first affidavit. 

106    In my judgment, this is c learly a c ase where the liability of the sec ond defendant depended almost entirely on the assessment of fac ts whic h c an only be undertaken in a full trial. This is a c ase in whic h the plaintiffs have alleged that the sec ond defendant had not advised them properly, while the sec ond defendant has denied those allegations of fac t. In fac t, before me, it was c onc eded for the plaintiffs that there were many triable issues of fac t in the present ac tion. Ac c ordingly, in view of my c onc lusion as to the applic able law above, this alone would have been enough for me to set aside the interloc utory judgment entered in default of appearanc e against the sec ond defendant, and the final judgment as well. However, for c ompleteness, although I should not say too muc h about the merits of the defenc e, I will nonetheless briefly go through the various allegations made by the plaintiffs and show why I think there is at least an arguable issue of fac t and, further, a defenc e whic h has a real prospec t of suc c ess and c arry some degree of c onvic tion (to use the words in _Abdul Gaffer_ ). 


_Examination of allegations of negligence by the plaintiffs_ 

(1) DRP failed to advise the dec eased on his remedies and rights under the Share Transfer Agreement and the Supplemental Agreement 

107    The first allegation of negligenc e as pleaded in the Statement of Claim at [9] is that DRP failed to advise the dec eased on his remedies and rights under the Share Transfer Agreement and the Supplemental Agreement, and that no ac tion was taken against Tan and Thian notwithstanding their breac h. 

108    In my judgment, there is a good defenc e (even applying the elevated _Abdul Gaffer_ test) against this c laim. Apart from denying the plaintiffs’ allegations of fac t in his affidavit, the sec ond defendant has also shown that there _is_ evidenc e showing that the dec eased was well aware of the financ ial c onditions of _both_ the Company and Tan and Thian and that he wanted to extend the loan despite having knowledge of this. This is evident from the first plaintiff’s affidavit filed on 5 May 2004 in support of her applic ation for summary judgment in Suit 232. This affidavit c learly deposed that the dec eased and the sec ond plaintiff were introduc ed to Tan sometime in May 2001, when Tan wanted to sell off her property. It was then that the dec eased and the sec ond plaintiff were informed that Tan had to sell her property urgently as Tan was fac ing a suit in relation to her c ompany (whic h is the Company referred to above) and Tan needed to raise the sum of $500,000 to pay the Company’s c reditor. It was further stated by the first plaintiff in this affidavit that on or about 23 May 2001, the dec eased and her were informed during a meeting at Tan’s solic itor’s offic e that Tan and Thian were fac ing bankruptc y proc eedings and were expec ted to be made bankrupts shortly. The Share Transfer Agreement was signed on 29 May 2001. These were all knowledge ac quired by the dec eased pointing to the dire financ ial c onditions of the Company, as well as Tan and Thian. 

109    The fac t that the dec eased had entered into the loans with Tan and Thian in full knowledge of their dire financ ial c ondition was further c orroborated by draft affidavits prepared by the first plaintiff in c onsultation with DRP, probably in support of the applic ation for summary judgment in Suit 232. At [6] of this draft affidavit, whic h appears at the sec ond defendant’s sec ond affidavit filed for the present ac tion (“the sec ond defendant’s sec ond affidavit”) at 71, it was stated that the dec eased informed the first plaintiff that he was going to invest in the Company to help Tan and Thian out of their “legal and financ ial problem”. While I am fully aware that these were merely draft affidavits, I am nonetheless c onvinc ed that the fac ts stated therein further substantiated the truth of the fac ts already deposed to by the first plaintiff herself in her own affidavit filed for her applic ation for summary judgment in Suit 232. Moreover, the sec ond defendant has said that the dec eased in Dec ember 2001 said to him that while he was aware of Tan and Thian’s obligations under the Share Transfer Agreement and the Supplemental Agreement, the dec eased dec lined to enforc e them. It is c lear also from [3] of the affidavit filed by Tan and Thian to oppose the plaintiffs’ applic ation for summary judgment that they did exec ute the nec essary share transfer forms in favour of the dec eased. The problem was that, apparently, Tan and Thian did not pay the requisite stamp duties suc h that the share registration did not take plac e. The defendants surely c ould not be expec ted to effec t the registration in suc h c irc umstanc es. 

110    Ac c ordingly, with respec t to the plaintiffs’ first allegation of negligenc e, I find that the sec ond defendant has raised an arguable defenc e and even a defenc e with a real prospec t of suc c ess and whic h c arried some degree of c onvic tion. 

(2) DRP failed to advise the plaintiffs to enforc e their rights under the Share Transfer Agreement and/or Supplemental Agreement 


111    The sec ond allegation of negligenc e as pleaded in the Statement of Claim at [11] relates to the failure of DRP to advise the plaintiffs to enforc e their rights under the Share Transfer Agreement and/or Supplemental Agreement. It was said in the plaintiffs’ first affidavit that after the dec eased’s passing on 6 April 2002, the defendants did not advise the plaintiffs of their rights under the two agreements. It was further alleged that the defendants said that they c ould not take any ac tion until the grant of the letters of administration. In fac t, even after the grant was obtained in August 2003, it was alleged that the defendants still did not render any advic e or c ommenc e any proc eedings. 

112    In my judgment, the sec ond defendant has onc e again raised an arguable issue of fac t. I will go as far as to say he has raised a defenc e with a real prospec t of suc c ess. The sec ond defendant has said in his sec ond affidavit that DRP was in c onstant c ontac t with the plaintiffs during the time of the dec eased’s death to the time of the grant of the letters of administration. The doc umentary evidenc e c learly shows this be true. For example, on 20 February 2003, the sec ond defendant sent a draft letter to the plaintiffs with a draft letter of demand to Tan and Thian for the plaintiffs’ perusal. On 21 February 2003, an amended letter of demand was sent to the plaintiffs, onc e again for their approval. This letter of demand was eventually sent to Tan and Thian on 6 Marc h 2003. On 16 April 2003, the sec ond defendant wrote to the plaintiffs advising them to “sue [Tan and Thian] for the breac h of the sale and purc hase agreement and the supplemental agreement”. On 28 April 2003, the sec ond defendant again wrote to Tan and Thian regarding the letter of demand whic h was earlier sent to them. This was again done on 9 May 2003, 4 June 2003, 17 June 2003, 11 July 2003, and 14 July 2003, as is evident from the evidenc e before me. I need only to add that even after the grant of the letters of administration was obtained, the evidenc e c learly showed that the sec ond defendant kept up with the c ommunic ation with Tan and Thian. The c orrespondenc e before me showed these to have taken plac e on 26 August 2003, 28 August 2003, 29 August 2003 and 10 September 2003. As suc h, it seems rather surprising to me that the plaintiffs have made the allegation that the defendants did _nothing_ from the dec eased’s death to the grant of the letters of administration (and thereafter) when the evidenc e very c lear shows otherwise. 

113    Ac c ordingly, with respec t to the plaintiffs’ sec ond allegation of negligenc e, I find that the sec ond defendant has raised an arguable defenc e and even a defenc e with a real prospec t of suc c ess and whic h c arried some degree of c onvic tion. 

(3) DRP failed to advise or properly advise the plaintiffs that there was no need to enter into the Agreement of Settlement or their rights under this Agreement 

114    The third allegation of negligenc e (as pleaded at [13] of the Statement of Claim) is that DRP failed to advise or properly advise the plaintiffs that there was no need to enter into the Agreement of Settlement or alternatively it failed to advise the plaintiffs of their rights under this Agreement. Onc e again, I find that the sec ond defendant has raised an arguable defenc e and even a defenc e with a real prospec t of suc c ess and whic h c arried some degree of c onvic tion with respec t to this allegation. The sec ond defendant has stated that the Agreement of Settlement was to rec ord and update the payment obligations of Tan and Thian. Further, the sec ond defendant said that in order to prevent Tan and Thian from subsequently raising a defenc e to any c laim by the plaintiffs, the Agreement of Settlement was nec essary to make them admit to the debt owed to the plaintiffs. In fac t, if not for the Agreement of Settlement, the plaintiffs’ applic ation for summary judgment in Suit 232 would have been thwarted. I therefore see no reason to deny the sec ond defendant a c hanc e to fully refute the plaintiffs’ c urrent allegation in a full trial. 

(4) DRP failed to advise the plaintiffs to enforc e their rights under the Agreement of Settlement 

115    The fourth allegation of negligenc e, as pleaded at [14] of the Statement of Claim, is that DRP 


failed to advise the plaintiffs to enforc e their rights under the Agreement of Settlement. In my view, the sec ond defendant has made out an arguable defenc e and even a defenc e with a real prospec t of suc c ess and whic h c arried some degree of c onvic tion with respec t to this allegation. Based on the first plaintiff’s affidavit deposed on 5 May 2004 in Suit 232, Tan and Thian c omplied with c l 4(A) of the Agreement of Settlement by paying three instalments of $30,000 eac h and one instalment of $40,000. Indeed, the sec ond defendant also deposed in his first affidavit that the plaintiffs’ instruc tions were to threaten Tan and Thian with legal ac tion but not to c ommenc e legal ac tion immediately upon the breac h of the Agreement of Settlement. DRP also did not sit idly by while Tan and Thian defaulted in their payment obligations. On 1 Marc h 2004, when Tan and Thian defaulted in making full payment, DRP wrote to Tan and Thian’s solic itors reminding them of their c lients’ payment obligations. A total of five letters were sent between 1 Marc h 2004 and 19 Marc h 2004. Ac c ordingly, I think that the sec ond defendant should be given a c hanc e at a full trial to c ontend these allegations in detail. 

(5) DRP failed exerc ise due c are, skill or diligenc e with respec t to Suit 232 

116    The fifth allegation of negligenc e as pleaded at [17] of the Statement of Claim relates to DRP’s negligenc e c onduc t of Suit 232. One of the allegations was that DRP entered into negotiation with Tan and Thian’s solic itors and entered into the Tomlin Order without advising the plaintiffs. I do not think the evidenc e entitles me to c onc lusively determine this to be the truth. After all, the plaintiffs did initial on the Tomlin Order, a _prima facie_ indic ation that they were at least aware of what was happening. These are all matters of fac t whic h I am ill-plac ed to asc ertain determinatively, and I therefore think that the sec ond defendant has made out an arguable defenc e or even a defenc e with a real prospec t of suc c ess and whic h c arried some degree of c onvic tion with respec t to this allegation. 

(6) DRP failed to ensure that TJS and LLC fulfil their obligations under the Shares Agreement 

117    The sixth allegation of negligenc e (as pleaded at [31] of the Statement of Claim) relates to the Shares Agreement and alleges that DRP failed to ensure that TJS and LLC fulfil their obligations in the Shares Agreement. Here again the affidavits differ as to what DRP really advised the plaintiffs to do and I think this is an issue best determined by a trial c ourt sinc e an arguable issue of fac t has been raised. 

(7) DRP failed to ensure proper exec ution of the Settlement Agreement in Suit 249 

118    The seventh and final allegation of negligenc e (as pleaded at [23] and [26] of the Statement of Claim) relates to the exec ution of the Settlement Agreement in Suit 249. The plaintiffs allege that they were not aware of the settlement negotiations and were not shown drafts of the agreement. The plaintiffs also allege that DRP did not c onduc t bankruptc y searc hes on Tan and Thian before the exec ution proc eedings. Onc e again, the allegations of fac t are different and I am unable to determine c onc lusively whic h side is speaking the truth. Therefore, I find that an arguable issue of fac t has been raised with respec t to this allegation. 

**_Conclusion with respect to setting aside of judgments entered in default of appearance_** 

119    Ac c ordingly, on the applic ation of the law as disc ussed, I find that this being a c ase in whic h liability depended almost entirely on the assessment of fac ts at a full trial, an arguable defenc e is only nec essary. I find that there is an arguable defenc e with respec t to all of the plaintiffs’ allegations of negligenc e. In any event, even if I am wrong on the law and _Abdul Gaffer_ applies in full, I nonetheless am c onvinc ed by the evidenc e adduc ed before me that the sec ond defendant has advanc ed a 


defenc e whic h has a real prospec t of suc c ess and c arries with it some degree of c onvic tion. Thus, even if I am wrong on setting aside the order for substituted servic e, I would have set aside the interloc utory judgment entered in default of appearanc e against the sec ond defendant and final judgment entered against the sec ond defendant. 

**Conclusion** 

120    In final analysis, I do not think that the ends of justic e would be met if I were to dismiss the sec ond defendant’s present applic ation and deny him a c hanc e to present his c ase in c ourt. Whether the determinative issue is the order for substituted servic e or the setting aside of the default judgments, I c ome unhesitatingly to the view that, if one were to take a step bac k and ask oneself if justic e would be served denying the sec ond defendant a c hanc e to argue the c ase on its full merits before a trial c ourt, knowing what the c ourt now knows with the sec ond defendant’s submissions, the answer would be an unequivoc al “no”. This, in a single sentenc e, aptly summarises the underlying reason for my dec ision. 

121    For the reasons above, I set aside the order for substituted servic e and all proc eedings thereafter. I will hear the parties as to c osts.
