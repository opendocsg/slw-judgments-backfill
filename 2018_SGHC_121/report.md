**George Wei J:** 

**Introduction** 

1       This was an applic ation by the plaintiff, Lakshmi Prataprai Bhojwani (“the Plaintiff”), for the defendant, Moti Harkishindas Bhojwani (“the Defendant”), to provide an ac c ount of the assets of the estate (“the Estate”) of the late Harkishindas Ghumanmal Bhojwani (“the Testator”). 

2       Spec ific ally, the applic ation was for an ac c ount of the Estate as at 4 Marc h 2007, being the date on whic h the Testator had passed away and also as at the time the applic ation was made. The ac c ount was to inc lude details of any investment or divestment of the assets of the Estate, and the proc eeds of suc h investment or divestment. 

3       At the c onc lusion of the hearing on 18 January 2018, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s applic ation. The Plaintiff was dissatisfied with my dec ision and has appealed. I now furnish the grounds of my dec ision. 

**Facts** 

**_Parties_** 

4       An introduc tion to the bac kground of this applic ation must begin with a desc ription of the Bhojwani family tree. 


5       The Testator was the patriarc h of the Bhojwani family, and it is his last will and testament (“the Will”) that was at the heart of this applic ation. He is survived by his three sons, namely, Jethanand Harkishindas Bhojwani (“Jethanand”), Jaikirshin Harkishindas Bhojwani (“Jaikirshin”) and the 

Defendant. [note: 1] 

6       Jethanand, Jaikirshin and the Defendant are eac h married and have c hildren of their own. The 

Defendant was at all material times the sole exec utor of the Will, [note: 2] while eac h of the three 

sons is trustee over different parts of the Estate. [note: 3] 

7       The Plaintiff is the wife of Jethanand, and henc e the daughter-in-law of the Testator. [note: 4] However, the Plaintiff’s marriage with Jethanand deteriorated over the years, and this c ulminated in 

divorc e proc eedings filed by her on 5 Oc tober 2017. [note: 5] The Plaintiff is one of the benefic iaries 

named in the Will. [note: 6] 

**_The Will_** 

8       Pursuant to the Will, the Estate was divided into three groups of assets. Generally, eac h of the Testator’s three sons was appointed as trustee for eac h group of assets, with his respec tive family 

members being the benefic iaries of the assets of whic h he is trustee. [note: 7] 

9       I pause to note that the Will c reates five disc retionary trusts: one for the assets under c l 4 of the Will, one for the assets under c l 5 of the Will and three separate disc retionary trusts for the residue of the Estate under c l 7 of the Will. The Plaintiff’s interest as a benefic iary flows from her position as a member of the c lass of disc retionary benefic iaries under c l 5 of the Will, as well as one of the trusts under c l 7. 

10     Clause 4 of the Will spec ifies assets of whic h the Defendant (the exec utor of the Estate) is 

trustee. Clause 4 states: [note: 8] 

 4.1 In this c lause: 

 (i) “the trust period” means the period of 30 years c ommenc ing from the date of my death; 

 (ii) “the benefic iaries” means 

 (a) MRS BHAUNA MOTI BHOJWANI ... 

  

 (c ) remoter issue of MOTI who may be born before the end of the trust period together with any spouse, widow or widower of any suc h c hildren or remoter issue; and 

 (d) any person or c lass of persons nominated to my trustees by two benefic iaries and whose nomination is ac c epted in writing by my trustees. 

 (iii) “my trustee” means MOTI and inc ludes any trustees that may be appointed by MOTI ; and 

 (iv) “Trust Property” means 


 (a) suc h interest as I may have in No. 32A Branksome Road, Singapore ... 

 (b) 2,000 shares in Malaya Silk Store (Private) Limited[;] 

 (c ) 73,001 shares in Shankar’s Emporium (Private) Limited; 

 (d) 5,000 shares in Sharrods (Private) Limited; 

 (e) 2,000 shares in Shankar’s Pte Ltd; 

 (f) 5,000 shares in Sovrein Investments Private Limited; 

 (g) 3,000 shares in Lions Amalgamated Industries Private Limited; 

 (h) my 1 founder’s share in Malaya Silk Store (Private) Limited ... and 

 (i) my 1 founder’s share in Sherridon Exim Pte Ltd ... 

 4.2 I direc t my trustee to hold the Trust Property upon trust for all or suc h one or more of the benefic iaries at suc h ages or times in suc h shares and upon suc h trusts for the benefit of all or any one or more of the benefic iaries as my trustee in his absolute disc retion may by deed or deeds revoc able or irrevoc able at any time or times during the trust period appoint and in making any suc h appointment my trustee shall have powers spec ified in c lause 3 above during the Trust Period. 

 [emphasis in original] 

11     The named benefic iaries under c l 4 are the Defendant’s wife and son. 

12     Clause 5 of the Will provides for the group of assets of whic h Jethanand (husband of the 

Plaintiff) is trustee. Clause 5 states: [note: 9] 

 5.1 In this c lause: 

 (i) “the trust period” means the period of 30 years c ommenc ing from the date of my death; 

 (ii) “the benefic iaries” means 

 ( a ) LAKSHMI PRATAPRAI BHOJWANI MRS LAKSHMI JETHANAND BHOJWANI [the Plaintiff] ... 

 (b) DEVIN JETHANAND BHOJWANI ... 

 (c ) DILIP JETHANAND BHOJWANI ... 

 (d) SANDEEP JETHANAND BHOJWANI ... 

 (e) remoter issue of JETHANAND who may be born before the end of the trust period together with any spouse, widow or widower of any suc h c hildren or remoter issue; and 

 (f ) any person or c lass of persons nominated to my trustees by two benefic iaries and 


 whose nomination is ac c epted in writing by my trustees. 

 (iii) “my trustee” means JETHANAND and inc ludes any trustees that may be appointed by JETHANAND ; and 

 (iv) “Trust Property” means 

 (a) suc h interest as I may have in No. 32 Branksome Road, Singapore ... 

 (b) 9,000 shares in Malaya Silk Store (Private) Limited; 

 (c ) 150,000 shares in Shankar’s Emporium (Private) Limited;

 (f) 15,000 shares in Sovrein (Private) Limited; 

 (g) 12,001 shares in Lions Amalgamated Industries Private Limited; 

 (h) 1 share in Shankar’s Investments Pte Ltd (formerly known as Shankar’s Vietnam (Private) Limited); 

 (i) 1 share in Liberty Merc handising Pte Ltd; and 

 (j) my 1 founder’s share in Shankar’s Emporium (Private) Limited ... 

 5.2 I direc t my trustee to hold the Trust Property upon trust for all or suc h one or more of the benefic iaries at suc h ages or times in suc h shares and upon suc h trusts for the benefit of all or any one or more of the benefic iaries as my trustee in his absolute disc retion may by deed or deeds revoc able or irrevoc able at any time or times during the trust period appoint and in making any suc h appointment my trustee shall have powers spec ified in c lause 3 above during the Trust Period. 

 [emphasis in original] 

13     As c an be seen from c l 5, while it is true that the Plaintiff is a benefic iary named in the Will, she is only a benefic iary with respec t to the assets of whic h Jethanand is the trustee. The other named benefic iaries of these assets are the three sons of Jethanand and the Plaintiff. 

14     In addition, the residuary estate, being all the remaining assets in the Estate that had not been previously dealt with in the Will (“the Residuary Estate”), is further divided into three parts and given to Jethanand, Jaikirshin and the Defendant to hold on trust for their respec tive families. Clause 7 

states: [note: 10] 

7\. I give, devise and bequest all the residue of my movable and immovable property of whatsoever nature and wheresoever situate not hereinbefore spec ific ally devised or bequeathed to my trustees to distribute as follows: 

 (a) one-third (1/3) to my son JAIKIRSHIN HARKISHINDAS BHOJWANI (hereinafter 


 referred to as “ JAIKIRSHIN ”) to hold on trust for all or suc h one or more of the benefic iaries stipulated in c lause 8(ii) hereinbelow at suc h ages or times in suc h shares and upon suc h trusts for the benefit of all or any one or more of the benefic iaries stipulated in c lause 8(ii) hereinbelow as JAIKIRSHIN in his absolute disc retion may by deed or deeds revoc able or irrevoc able at any time or times during the trust period as stipulated in c lause 8(i) hereinbelow appoint and in making any suc h appointment JAIKIRSHIN shall have powers spec ified in c lause 3 above during the trust period as stipulated in c lause 8(i) hereinbelow; 

 (b) one-third (1/3) to my son JETHANAND to hold on trust for all or suc h one or more of the benefic iaries stipulated in c lause 5.1(iii) hereinabove at suc h ages or times in suc h shares and upon suc h trusts for the benefit of all or any one or more of the benefic iaries stipulated in c lause 5.1(iii) hereinabove as JETHANAND in his absolute disc retion may by deed or deeds revoc able or irrevoc able at any time or times during the trust period as stipulated in c lause 5.1(i) hereinabove appoint and in making any suc h appointment JETHANAND shall have powers spec ified in c lause 3 above during the trust period as stipulated in c lause 5.1(i) hereinabove; and 

 (c ) one-third (1/3) to my son MOTI to hold on trust for all or suc h one or more of the benefic iaries stipulated in c lause 4.1(iii) hereinabove at suc h ages or times in suc h shares and upon suc h trusts for the benefit of all or any one or more of the benefic iaries stipulated in c lause 4.1(iii) hereinabove as MOTI in his absolute disc retion may by deed or deeds revoc able or irrevoc able at any time or times during the trust period as stipulated in c lause 4.1(i) hereinabove appoint and in making any suc h appointment MOTI shall have powers spec ified in c lause 3 above during the trust period as stipulated in c lause 4.1(i) hereinabove. 

 [emphasis in original] 

15     Reading the Will in its entirety, it is apparent that the Plaintiff is a benefic iary of three main c ategories of assets (c ollec tively, “the Assets”), namely: 

 (a) the property at 32 Branksome Road, Singapore (“the Property”); 

 (b) the shares listed in items (b) to (j) of c l 5.1(iv) (“the Clause 5 Shares”); and 

 (c ) one-third of the Residuary Estate. 

**_The Defendant’s actions in relation to the Assets_** 

16     At this junc ture, it would be pertinent to state that at the beginning of the hearing, I had queried the parties on whether they were _ad idem_ as to there not being a need to examine the deponents of the affidavits, to whic h they had both responded in the positive. Therefore, I saw this as an indic ation that both parties did not c hallenge the verac ity of the evidenc e in the affidavits of both parties. In any event, given that this ac tion c ommenc ed by way of originating summons, I did not expec t any major disputes of fac t. 

17     The Testator passed away on 4 Marc h 2007. [note: 11] Subsequently, the Defendant was issued 

with a grant of probate in relation to the Estate on 12 February 2008. [note: 12] 

_The Clause 5 Shares_ 

18     The Defendant transferred the Clause 5 Shares to Jethanand on 1 August 2008. The stamp 


duty c ertific ates for the transfers of the Clause 5 Shares were exhibited in the Defendant’s affidavit. [note: 13] Additionally, the Defendant stated in his affidavit that no dividends had been dec lared in 

relation to eight c ompanies during the period between 4 Marc h 2007 and 1 August 2008. [note: 14] These eight c ompanies largely c orrespond to the c ompanies in whic h the Clause 5 Shares belong, with the exc eption of Shankar’s Emporium (Private) Limited. I note that the Defendant did not make an express statement that no dividends were dec lared for Shankar’s Emporium (Private) Limited. However, this inc onsistenc y was not raised before the c ourt during the hearing and I will say nothing more on the matter. 

_The Property_ 

19     Upon the death of the Testator, legal title to the Property had vested in the Defendant, who remained the registered proprietor until 12 Oc tober 2016. On 12 Oc tober 2016, the Defendant transferred the Property to the Plaintiff. This transfer was done on the instruc tions of Jethanand, who had previously c onferred with his three sons and the Plaintiff, all of whom were the named 

disc retionary benefic iaries of the Property. [note: 15] 

_The Residuary Estate_ 

20     As for the Residuary Estate, a c onsolidation of all the remaining assets less all the Estaterelated expenses resulted in a net defic it of $57,966.52. A breakdown of this figure was exhibited in 

the Defendant’s affidavit. [note: 16] The Defendant stated in his affidavit that he and Jethanand had 

paid equal amounts to provide for this defic it. [note: 17] 

**_Genesis of the dispute_** 

21     The Plaintiff and Jethanand resided at the Property together with their three sons. As noted above, Jethanand is the trustee and the Plaintiff together with their three sons are the benefic iaries of the Assets, whic h inc luded the Property. Jethanand did not have any benefic ial interest in the Property. The Defendant and his family resided next door at 32A Branksome Road. 

22     The Plaintiff asserted that she had not been informed of her benefic ial interest under c ll 5 and 7 

of the Will until around November 2016. [note: 18] 

23     On or about 16 September 2016, the Plaintiff c hanc ed upon a letter addressed to the 

Defendant, whic h referred to the Defendant as the oc c upant of the Property. [note: 19] This prompted the Plaintiff to c onduc t a title searc h on the Property, whic h revealed that the Defendant was indeed 

the registered proprietor of the Property. [note: 20] This c ame as a shoc k to the Plaintiff, bec ause she had believed all along that Jethanand was the registered proprietor of the Property. The Plaintiff was of the view that the Defendant, as the exec utor of the Estate, should rightfully have transferred the Property to Jethanand, at least, in ac c ordanc e with the Will. 

24     The Plaintiff therefore bec ame c onc erned that the Defendant was similarly mismanaging the rest of the Estate, of whic h she is a benefic iary. On 12 Oc tober 2017, she sent a formal request to the 

Defendant for a full ac c ount of the part of the Estate in whic h she has an interest. [note: 21] The Defendant responded on 17 Oc tober 2017 stating that he did not owe the Plaintiff a duty to ac c ount, 

and his duty was only to the trustee referred to in c l 5.1 of the Will, _ie_ , Jethanand. [note: 22] 

25     On 30 Oc tober 2017, the Plaintiff filed Originating Summons No 1229 of 2017 to bring the 


present applic ation. 

**Parties’ cases** 

26     The Plaintiff argued that the Defendant, being the exec utor of the Estate, owes her, a benefic iary of the Estate, fiduc iary duties both at c ommon law and under the Trustees Ac t (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed). This fiduc iary relationship therefore obliged the Defendant to provide the Plaintiff with an ac c ount of the Estate upon her request. 

27     In response, the Defendant c ontended that he did not owe the Plaintiff any fiduc iary duties, bec ause even though he is the sole exec utor of the Estate, he is not the trustee over the portion of the Estate of whic h the Plaintiff is a benefic iary. The Defendant c ontended that an exec utor’s duty is merely to c all in and distribute the assets in the estate in ac c ordanc e with the provisions of the will. Therefore, the Defendant argued that his duties to the Plaintiff had c eased upon his transfer of the Assets to Jethanand. The proper person for the Plaintiff to seek an ac c ount from should therefore be Jethanand and not the Defendant. 

**Issues for determination** 

28     In my view, there were two main issues that had to be determined in dec iding whether or not to grant the Plaintiff’s applic ation: 

 (a) whether the Plaintiff was entitled, as a matter of law, to an ac c ount of the Estate from the Defendant, and if so, for what assets and over whic h period of time; and 

 (b) if the answer to issue (a) was answered in the positive, whether there existed any good reasons for this c ourt to exerc ise its inherent disc retion not to make an order for the Defendant to provide an ac c ount to the Plaintiff. 

**My decision** 

**_The Plaintiff’s entitlement to an account from the Defendant_** 

29     I will first deal with the issue of whether the Plaintiff was entitled to an ac c ount of the Estate from the Defendant. It is settled law that the exec utor of a will owes the benefic iaries under the will fiduc iary duties. It is the fiduc iary relationship that provides the basis for this duty to ac c ount (see _Attorney-General v Cocke and Another_ [1988] 1 Ch 414 at 420). As was stated in my earlier dec ision in _Foo Jee Boo and another v Foo Jhee Tuang and others_ <span class="citation">[2016] SGHC 260</span> (“ _Foo Jee Boo_ ”) at [80]: 

 It is also the duty of the exec utor[s] to keep proper ac c ounts of the administration of the estate that they are dealing with. If c alled upon by the benefic iaries to render ac c ounts, they are obliged to furnish suc h ac c ounts and allow the benefic iaries to inspec t the ac c ounts. 

30     The Defendant had argued in his written submissions that the Plaintiff was not entitled to an ac c ount bec ause she did not have an interest _per se_ in the Estate. This was on the basis that the Plaintiff is merely a disc retionary benefic iary under the Will, and therefore whatever interest she has 

in the Estate would purely be at the disc retion of Jethanand as her trustee. [note: 23] I disagreed. There is a distinc tion to be made between the benefic iaries under two types of disc retionary trusts. The first type of trust involves _named_ benefic iaries whose benefits to be paid out of the estate are solely at the disc retion of the trustee, suc h as the Plaintiff in this c ase. The sec ond type of trust involves persons who are only _possible_ benefic iaries of a disc retionary trust, where there is a large 


number of suc h possible benefic iaries. To c larify, the latter sc enario envisions a trust struc ture in whic h there is a wide c lass of possible benefic iaries, and the trustee may be given the power to add to this c lass of benefic iaries other persons with the exc eption of c ertain stated individuals. This was the type of trust that was c onsidered in _Hartigan Nominees Pty Ltd and Another v Rydge_ (1992) 29 NSWLR 405 (“ _Hartigan_ ”), where the “Eligible Benefic iaries”, and thus possible benefic iaries, to the trust inc luded “any c hildren[,] grandc hildren or great-grandc hildren” of the _de facto_ settlor. In addition, Eligible Benefic iaries c ould inc lude persons who were nominated in writing to the trustees by the _de facto_ settlor, his legal representatives, or the trustees themselves. In suc h a trust struc ture, there would exist a large number of possible benefic iaries who would only have an interest in the trust if they have been dec lared as benefic iaries by those who have the power to do so. 

31     The benefic iaries under these two types of trusts may both be loosely termed as “disc retionary benefic iaries”. Indeed, the Defendant used that term to desc ribe the Plaintiff as a type of benefic iary falling into the former c ategory. However, while the same label is used on both types of benefic iaries, it does not mean that they have similar rights in respec t of the trust nor should it be interpreted that way. In my view, a benefic iary falling into the former c ategory suc h as the Plaintiff should be entitled to ac c ounts. On the other hand, a possible benefic iary belonging in the latter c ategory would have no suc h right (see _Hanbury and Martin: Modern Equity_ (Jamie Glister & James Lee gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2015) at para 20-018). A person in the former c ategory has an identifiable interest in the estate regardless of the manner in whic h the trustee’s disc retion is exerc ised, and therefore has a c orresponding right to an ac c ount. In c ontrast, a person in the latter c ategory does not have an identifiable interest in the estate until it is dec ided that he will be a benefic iary. Mahoney JA stated at pp 431–432 of _Hartigan_ that notwithstanding a trustee’s obligation to provide an ac c ounting in respec t of the administration of the trust upon suc h a request being made by the benefic iaries, it may be that suc h a right to an ac c ount does not exist where the request is made by a person who is only a possible benefic iary under a disc retionary trust. Mahoney JA further stated: “I doubt that a person whose interest lies not in property but in possibility and is in respec t of part but not all of the trust property may demand suc h information.” 

32     It has often been said that a disc retionary trust is one whic h gives a benefic iary no right to any defined part of the inc ome or c apital of the trust fund. The benefic iary has no more than a hope that the disc retion will be exerc ised in his favour (see _Snell’s Equity_ (John Mc Ghee gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015) (“ _Snell’s Equity_ ”) at para 22-005). In a similar vein, _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 9(3), _Equity and Trusts_ (LexisNexis, 2017 reissue) (“ _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 9(3): _Equity and Trusts_ ”) states at para 110.531: 

 Disc retionary trusts whic h are exhaustive c all for a distribution ultimately of the trust property and c onfer on benefic iaries a spes or hope of an exerc ise of disc retion in their favour. 

33     Nevertheless, this should not affec t the princ iple that the Plaintiff as a named disc retionary benefic iary of the Will has an identifiable interest in the Estate suc h that she would _prima facie_ be entitled to an ac c ount of the Estate. _Gartside and Another v Inland Revenue Commissioners_ [1968] AC 553 at p 617 also states that a benefic iary under a disc retionary trust has an interest in that he has the right to be c onsidered as a potential rec ipient of benefit by the trustees and a right to have that interest protec ted by a c ourt of equity. This explains the c omment in _Snell’s Equity_ at para 22005 that the disc retionary benefic iary’s interest is proprietary in c harac ter sinc e it gives him a stronger equitable title to the trust property than a third party with no entitlement at all. 

34     I move then to examine the sc ope and extent of this duty to ac c ount. The Plaintiff had sought to rely on _Lalwani Shalini Gobind and another v Lalwani Ashok Bherumal_ <span class="citation">[2017] SGHC 90</span> (“ _Lalwani_ ”) at [20] to argue that a trustee’s duty to ac c ount is a c ontinuous one, and that the transfer of trust 


assets to new trustees does not obviate the original trustee’s duty to ac c ount. However, I would note that an exec utor or a trustee should only owe a benefic iary a duty to ac c ount in relation to matters that oc c urred _during his term as a trustee_ (see _Lalwani_ at [11]). Properly understood, this c ontinuing duty is a duty on the trustee to provide ac c ounts to the benefic iary when requested, and this duty to ac c ount for his past c onduc t c ontinues even after the trustee has transferred the trust assets to another party. 

35     However, this c ontinuing duty does not mean that the trustee will remain ac c ountable for the trust assets in the period after they have been transferred to another party. Therefore, any ac c ount provided by the trustee will nec essarily be c onfined to the assets whic h he was in c ontrol of, and only for the period that he was ac tually the trustee over these assets. The same princ iple applies where a c laim is brought against an exec utor for an ac c ount of estate assets that are to be subsequently held by trustees under disc retionary trusts as set up by a will. 

36     Applying this to the present fac ts, the Defendant should therefore only be liable to ac c ount to the Plaintiff for the period that he was ac ting as exec utor and her trustee, and only in relation to the Assets of whic h she is a benefic iary. 

37     In summary, the Defendant was in a fiduc iary position as exec utor _viz_ the benefic iaries and was subjec t to the duty to ac c ount for his c onduc t for the period up to the transfer of the Assets to Jethanand as required by the Will, or to the Plaintiff in ac c ordanc e with Jethanand’s instruc tions. The Plaintiff rightly pointed out that an exec utor steps into the shoes of a trustee onc e he has disc harged his duties of c alling in and c ollec ting the assets of the estate and paying off all nec essary funeral, testamentary and estate expenses and liabilities (see _Lee Yoke San and another v Tsong Sai Sai Cecilia and another_ <span class="citation">[1992] 3 SLR(R) 516</span> at [35]). 

38     It follows that where the will c reates trusts over the estate assets, onc e the exec utor properly transfers the assets to the appointed trustees he will c ease to be ac c ountable for those assets. By this, what is meant is that whilst the exec utor remains ac c ountable for the period when the assets were under his c ontrol, he is not ac c ountable for those assets for the period after they are transferred to the trustees in ac c ordanc e with the terms of the will. 

39     On this basis, onc e the Defendant had transferred the Assets to Jethanand (and, in the c ase of the Property, to the Plaintiff ), the Defendant c eased to be the Plaintiff’s trustee, and would ac c ordingly not have to ac c ount for the Assets henc eforth. 

**_Assets and time period that the Defendant should be accountable for_** 

40     Title to a testator’s estate vests in the exec utor immediately upon the death of the testator (see _Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks on Executors, Administrators and Probate_ (John Ross Martyn & Nic holas Caddic k gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2013) at para 5-02). Therefore, the Defendant was vested with title to the Assets on 4 Marc h 2007, whic h is the day the Testator passed away. 

41     The Defendant thereafter transferred the Clause 5 Shares to Jethanand on 1 August 2008. Therefore, for the period between 4 Marc h 2007 and 1 August 2008, the Defendant would have been holding the Clause 5 Shares on trust for the Plaintiff and the other benefic iaries, and he would henc e be liable to ac c ount for the Clause 5 Shares during that period. 

42     As for the Property, the Defendant had been the registered proprietor and legal owner (by way of transmission on the Testator’s death) up until 12 Oc tober 2016, after whic h he transferred legal 

title to the Plaintiff in ac c ordanc e with the instruc tions of Jethanand. [note: 24] Therefore, the 


Defendant would have been holding the Property on trust for the Plaintiff and the other benefic iaries from 4 Marc h 2007 to 12 Oc tober 2016, and would be liable to ac c ount for the Property during that period. 

43     Finally, with regard to the Plaintiff’s interest in one-third of the Residuary Estate, the Defendant had given evidenc e that after c onsolidating all the remaining assets and ac c ounting for all the Estaterelated expenses, this resulted in an overall defic it. This defic it was subsequently borne by the Defendant and Jethanand in equal shares. Be that as it may, it appeared to me that the Defendant would have had legal title over the Residuary Estate, at least up to the point where the assets under of the Residuary Estate were presumably liquidated to pay for the Estate-related expenses. During suc h time, he would have been holding the Residuary Estate on trust for the Plaintiff and the other benefic iaries. Therefore, in my view, the Defendant would also owe the Plaintiff a duty to ac c ount for the Residuary Estate from 4 Marc h 2007 up until the point where it was c ompletely used to ac c ount for the Estate-related expenses. 

**_Reasons for this court not to order an account_** 

44     Notwithstanding the Plaintiff’s _prima facie_ entitlement to an ac c ount from the Defendant for the Assets during the time period as identified above, I was of the view that this was not a c ase whic h warranted the c alling of an ac c ount. As was noted in _Foo Jee Boo_ , notwithstanding a benefic iary’s entitlement to an ac c ount from his trustee, the c ourt may in its disc retion dec line to make an order for the taking of ac c ounts if it would be oppressive for the trustee to so ac c ount, or if there was some other good reason to so dec line (see _Foo Jee Boo_ at [81]). The High Court in _Chiang Shirley v Chiang Dong Pheng_ <span class="citation">[2015] 3 SLR 770</span> observed at [89] that “[w]hether the trustee/personal representative has c omplied with his duty to supply doc uments and information is a fac t-sensitive exerc ise in every c ase.” Further, the Court of Appeal in _Chng Weng Wah v Goh Bak Heng_ <span class="citation">[2016] 2 SLR 464</span> stated at [39] that “the c ourt may be able to draw an inferenc e, on a balanc e of probabilities, that settled ac c ounts have _already been provided_ ” [emphasis in original]. 

45     In my view, there was no need to order the Defendant to provide further ac c ounts to the Plaintiff given that the Defendant had already suffic iently disc harged this duty. In c oming to this dec ision, I noted that the question as to whether the Defendant had provided a suffic ient ac c ount was a fac t-sensitive inquiry. That said, I was reminded that a c ritic al aspec t of the c ustodial fiduc iary relationship is the duty of the trustee (and exec utor) to keep ac c ounts and to permit inspec tion by the benefic iaries for the purpose of (i) providing information as to the c urrent status of the estate or trust assets; and (ii) as a means for asc ertaining whether, _inter alia_ , maladministration has taken plac e (see _Lalwani_ at [16]). 

46     First, I c onsidered the Defendant’s duty to ac c ount in relation to the Clause 5 Shares. The Defendant had exhibited in his affidavit a doc ument stating that there were no dividends dec lared in relation to eight c ompanies during the period from 4 Marc h 2007 to 1 August 2008 (although I note the inc onsistenc y between this doc ument and the Clause 5 Shares as pointed out at [18] above). The Plaintiff responded in her own affidavit stating that “[t]his doc ument is c ompletely self-serving”. [note: 25] Yet, the Plaintiff did not apply to c ross-examine the Defendant on the evidenc e given in his 

affidavit whic h indic ated her ac c eptanc e of the verac ity of this evidenc e. The Defendant had also exhibited in his affidavit the stamp duty c ertific ates for the transfers of the Clause 5 Shares that were made to Jethanand on 1 August 2008. Despite this, the Plaintiff stated at the hearing that she was not satisfied with suc h evidenc e, and wanted sight of the ac tual share transfer forms. However, she did not explain why this was nec essary, nor did she seriously seek to c hallenge the authentic ity of the stamp duty c ertific ates. 


47     In the c irc umstanc es, I saw no reason to doubt the Defendant’s evidenc e as it stood. He had ac c ounted for the Clause 5 Shares during the period whic h he held them on trust for the Plaintiff, inc luding whether or not there were any dividends dec lared. Therefore, I found that he had suffic iently disc harged his duty to ac c ount for the Clause 5 Shares, and ac c ordingly there was no need for me to make an order for the same. 

48     Sec ond, I c onsidered the Defendant’s duty to ac c ount in relation to the Property. It is the Plaintiff’s own evidenc e that she, Jethanand and their three sons had been living in the Property for 

the past 31 years and c ontinue to reside there to date. [note: 26] The Plaintiff had c onfirmed during the hearing that there had never been a question of renting out the Property. Therefore, it c an safely be assumed that there would be no rental inc ome to ac c ount for in relation to the Property. Furthermore, a title searc h c onduc ted on 16 September 2016 showed that there were no enc umbranc es on the Property. All things c onsidered, it was c lear to me that the Plaintiff and her family had lived in the Property unhindered for the past 31 years. 

49     In light of this, I found the Plaintiff’s demand for an ac c ount of the Property to be unreasonable, given that there would simply be nothing to ac c ount for. It is evident that there was no rental inc ome earned from the Property. The title searc h on the Property c onduc ted on 16 September 2016 showed that it was then free of any enc umbranc es. If the Plaintiff was c onc erned that there may have been any prior enc umbranc es on the Property as a result of loans that the Defendant may have borrowed to his own advantage, it would have been open to her to find out by simply c onduc ting a historic al information searc h. For those reasons, it would have been unnec essary to order the Defendant to provide an ac c ount of the Property and therefore I dec lined to do so. 

50     Third, I c onsidered the Defendant’s duty to ac c ount for the Plaintiff’s share of the Residuary Estate. As was mentioned, the Residuary Estate was c ompletely used to pay for the Estate-related expenses. In this regard, the Defendant had exhibited a breakdown of the ac c ounts for the Residuary Estate in his affidavit. I saw no reason to disbelieve this evidenc e. If the Plaintiff was truly sc eptic al about the evidenc e provided by the Defendant, it would have been open to her to have the matter proc eed to trial instead where the evidenc e c ould then be tested by c ross-examination. Therefore, I was satisfied that the Defendant had provided an ac c ount of the Residuary Estate to the Plaintiff, and there was also no need for me to make an order for the same. 

51     As a final point, I would note that the Plaintiff had argued that the Defendant had breac hed his 

fiduc iary duties by failing to inform the Plaintiff of her interest under the Will. [note: 27] The Court of Appeal in _Foo Jee Seng and others v Foo Jhee Tuang and another_ <span class="citation">[2012] 4 SLR 339</span> has c larified at [87] that a trustee’s duty to ac c ount is not c ontingent on there being a breac h of the trustee’s fiduc iary duties. However, the Court did add that where suc h a breac h c ould be established, the benefic iaries would all the more be entitled to an ac c ount. Therefore, if it c ould be established in the present c ase that the Defendant had indeed breac hed his fiduc iary duties, this might have been a fac tor to sway me in favour of granting the Plaintiff’s applic ation. 

52     It is the exec utor’s foremost duty to ac t in the best interests of the benefic iaries when c arrying out his duties or exerc ising his powers, in the sense that he must do his best to promote the benefic iaries’ affairs (see _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 9(3): _Equity and Trusts_ at para 110.213). The question that arose was whether the failure on the part of the Defendant to inform the Plaintiff of her interest under the disc retionary trusts was (i) a breac h of his duty and (ii) if so, a breac h that justified the ordering of an ac c ount in any event. 

53     There was no c laim against Jethanand in these proc eedings for an ac c ount of the Assets. The 


fac t that Jethanand was and still is the Plaintiff’s husband and that their marriage appears to have broken down did not make any differenc e. The Plaintiff did however submit that whilst Jethanand’s c onduc t was not part of these proc eedings, the “wilful silenc e” of the Defendant in failing to inform the Plaintiff and her sons of the c ontents of the Will enabled any misc onduc t Jethanand may be guilty 

of in respec t of the Assets. [note: 28] 

54     I start by repeating that in the c ase of the Clause 5 Shares, the Defendant had transferred them to Jethanand on 1 August 2008 to hold on trust for the Plaintiff and her three sons, as required by the Will. 

55     With regard to the Property, even though the Defendant did not inform the Plaintiff that he was the registered proprietor, she and her family had been residing there for the past 31 years without any interruptions. It is important to note that under the terms of the Will, the exec utor and the trustees were given a very wide disc retion as to how to administer the Estate, so long as the benefic iaries were provided for in ac c ordanc e with the Will. 

56     For example, c l 3 of the Will provides the exec utor with the power, _inter alia_ , to permit any benefic iary to reside in any dwelling-house rent free or otherwise and on suc h terms the exec utor in his sole disc retion shall think fit. Clause 5 (whic h established the disc retionary trust for the Plaintiff and her three sons) c onfers on the trustee the same powers set out in c l 3 during the “trust period”. 

57     The Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff c ould have queried him or Jethanand muc h earlier as to whether there was a will and if so whether she had any interest. Her apparent failure to ask Jethanand, her trustee and her husband, about the Will and the Estate over so many years was said to be “odd”. This c ourt notes that this might not be signific ant if she had no reason to think there was a will in the first plac e. It was apparent however that she was aware that there was a will although she was not informed of the details and her interest until muc h later around November 2016. [note: 29] The Defendant on the other hand pointed out that the Plaintiff must have been aware of the 

terms of the Will or the relevant disc retionary trust at the latest by around September 2016. Nothing turned on this slight differenc e in timing. To be sure, the Plaintiff c ould have c onduc ted a searc h to asc ertain whether probate had been granted for any will and to inspec t the Testator’s file. If she had done this, she might have disc overed her disc retionary benefic ial interest very muc h earlier. This did not however detrac t from the princ iple that the Defendant as exec utor should have informed the Plaintiff of her interest under the Will and the disc retionary trusts. 

58     That said, based on the material put before this c ourt, it did not appear that the Plaintiff had suffered any loss. Indeed, the Plaintiff had rec eived all that she c ould have hoped for pursuant to the terms of the Will and the disc retionary trusts. She remained in c ontinuous residenc e (rent-free) of the Property. Eventually, full and unenc umbered title of the Property was transferred to her on 12 Oc tober 2016. 

59     Ac c ordingly, even if the Defendant had breac hed his fiduc iary duties by not informing the Plaintiff of her interest, I am of the view that the breac h was not suc h that led to the c onc lusion that an ac c ount must be ordered of the Property for the period between the Testator’s death and 12 Oc tober 2016. 

**Conclusion** 

60     Whilst I found for the Defendant, it is apposite to undersc ore the serious nature of the duties imposed on exec utors and trustees of disc retionary trusts. The fac t that a will c reates a disc retionary trust does not mean that a member of the c lass of benefic iaries does not have any rec ognised 


interest in the assets of the disc retionary trust. It follows that the Plaintiff was and is _prima facie_ entitled to an ac c ount from Jethanand being the trustee of the Assets in whic h the Plaintiff has a disc retionary interest. As was rightly stated in _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 9(4), _Equity and Trusts_ (LexisNexis, 2017 reissue) at para 110.790, note 1, the duty to render ac c ounts is one of the trustee’s most basic duties. For avoidanc e of doubt, this c omment is made bearing in mind that Jethanand’s c onduc t as trustee was not an issue that was before me. 

61     The Defendant in this c ase was the exec utor of the Will under whic h the disc retionary trusts were c reated. The Defendant was not the named trustee of the Assets to whic h the disc retionary trusts related. In my view, the Defendant as the exec utor ought to have informed the Plaintiff of her disc retionary interest under the trusts as part of his duty to c all in the assets and to distribute the same in ac c ordanc e with the Will. This duty also inc luded the transfer of the relevant Estate assets to the respec tive trustees for administration by them in ac c ordanc e with the terms of the disc retionary trusts. 

62     It follows that the Defendant as exec utor was under an obligation to provide an ac c ount to the Plaintiff of the Assets up to the point when the Assets were transferred to Jethanand or dealt with in ac c ordanc e with Jethanand’s instruc tions. That said, I was of the view that it would be unnec essary to make an order for the Defendant to do so given that he had already satisfac torily disc harged this duty in the c ourse of filing his reply affidavits for this applic ation, bearing in mind there was no applic ation to c ross-examine him. 

63     Ac c ordingly, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s applic ation. Nevertheless, I noted that the Plaintiff’s c onc ern might have been addressed by quic ker and fuller responses by the Defendant. Looking at the c irc umstanc es, I ordered fixed c osts of $2,000 to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant.
