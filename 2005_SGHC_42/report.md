Lai Siu Chiu J: 

**The facts** 

1       TSM Development Pte Ltd (“the plaintiff”) applied by the above originating summons (“the applic ation”) against Stephanie Celine Leonard _née_ Pereira (“the defendant”) for the following orders: 

1\. a dec laration that the portion of land as indic ated in the Topographic al Survey referred to in the affidavit of **TAN TIEN SENG** ... made in support of the [plaintiff’s] applic ation filed on 16 July 2004 (“the [Plaintiff’s] Affidavit”) between: 

 a. legal boundary of 43 and 45 Cotswold Close (edged and indic ated in red); and 

 b. the c hain fenc e (edged and indic ated in purple) and bric k wall (edged and indic ated in green), on 45 Cotswold Close. 

 (“the Land in Dispute”) is not subjec t to any adverse possession rights by the Defendant and all legal and benefic ial rights title and interests are retained by the [plaintiff]; 

2\. the Defendant returns possession of the Land in Dispute to the [plaintiff ] and an injunc tion to restrain the Defendant, her servants, agents, c ontrac tors or otherwise howsoever whosoever from remaining, entering or using the Land in Dispute; 

3\. the Defendant do at her own expense and c osts within a reasonable period and minimal disruption to 45 Cotswold Close: 

 a. remove the existing c hain fenc e and bric k wall on 45 Cotswold Close and to replac e a new c hain fenc e and bric k wall along the legal boundary of 43 and 45 Cotswold Close indic ated in the Topographic al Survey referred to in the [Plaintiff’s] Affidavit; 

 b. repair and reinstate the garden landsc aping works and the retaining and front bric k 


 wall around the Land in Dispute after installing the new c hain fenc e and bric k wall as reasonably possible to its original c ondition; 

 c. ensure that all drainages and rebuilding works pursuant to reinstating the Land in Dispute are in c omplianc e with Building & Construc tion Authority’s and/or Land Transport Authority’s regulations and direc tions (if any) and all nec essary c onsents for suc h works are obtained (paragraphs 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c ) c ollec tively referred to as “the Reinstatement Works”); and 

 d. if the Defendant fails to c omply with any of the sub-c lauses hereinabove, the [plaintiff is] entitled to engage a c ontrac tor to c onduc t the Reinstatement Works and the Defendant will indemnify the [plaintiff ] in full, the c osts and expense of the Reinstatement Works; 

4\. mesne profits and/or damages from the date of trespass until the delivery of possession; 

5\. interests; 

6\. c osts on an indemnity basis; and 

7\. suc h other reliefs as this Honourable Court shall deem fit. 

2       I dismissed the applic ation and granted, _inter alia_ , the defendant’s c ross-applic ation for a dec laration that she and her predec essors-in-title had been in c ontinuous adverse possession of the Land in Dispute as defined in the applic ation (see [1] above) and that all rights, title and interest of the plaintiff or any person c laiming under the plaintiff to that land had been extinguished by reason of the provisions of the Limitation Ac t (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed). The plaintiff has appealed against my dec ision (in Civil Appeal No 118 of 2004). 

**The affidavits** 

3       As stated earlier, the applic ation was supported by an affidavit filed by the plaintiff’s direc tor Tan Tien Seng (“Tan”) who desc ribed the plaintiff as a property ac quisition and development c ompany. The plaintiff had purc hased 45 Cotswold Close (“No 45”) on 23 Dec ember 2002. The defendant’s property, 43 Cotswold Close (“No 43”), adjoins No 45. 

4       Before proc eeding further, it is nec essary to set out the c hain of titles of the parties to the two properties in question. I reproduc e below from the defendant’s affidavit, the c hart whic h shows how the plaintiff and the defendant derived their titles to No 45 and No 43 respec tively. Both properties were originally part of a landed housing estate c alled Braddell Heights Estate developed by a c ompany c alled Braddell Heights Estate Limited (“the developers”) in the 1950s.

5       I will first elaborate on the plaintiff’s title to No 45. In 1951, the developers sold the property to one Bhermul Atmaram Lalwani (“Lalwani”). In 1963, Lalwani sold the property to one Chua Chee Ming who sold it in 1968 to Chua Fond Nam and two others. In 1971, Chua Fond Nam and his c oowners sold the property to Chee Hoe Hong (Private) Limited (“the c ompany”). On 23 Marc h 1985, while the c ompany was still the owner, the property was brought under the Land Titles Ac t by the Registrar of Titles (“the ROT”). Pursuant to the c onversion exerc ise, a qualified c ertific ate of title (Vol 277 Folio 182) was issued by the ROT. 

6       In 1989, the c ompany sold No 45 to Roy and Carol Eapen (“the Eapens”). The Eapens subsequently sold the property to the plaintiff and the Transfer to the latter was dated 23 Dec ember 

2002\. The c aution on the c ertific ate of title for No 45 was c anc elled (at the request of the plaintiff’s solic itiors) on 23 Dec ember 2003. 

7       As for the defendant’s property, No 43 was first sold to one Chang Hoi Phin in 1951. In 1971, Chang Hoi Phin sold No 43 to Edward George Leonard (“Leonard”), the defendant’s husband. The Indenture of Conveyanc e to Leonard was dated 3 April 1971. A qualified c ertific ate of title was issued for No 43 on 8 May 1976. Leonard passed away on 8 April 2003 and title to No 43 devolved to the defendant as the sole benefic iary under his will. The Transfer to the defendant was registered on 3 Dec ember 2003. On the same day, the c aution on the c ertific ate of title was c anc elled. 

8       Ac c ording to Tan’s affidavit, the plaintiff arranged for a boundary map to be made of No 45 in September 2003 by T H Lim Registered Surveyor (“the plaintiff’s surveyor”). The plaintiff’s surveyor 


c arried out a topographic al survey of No 45 whic h indic ated that the existing c hain fenc e and bric k wall separating the property from No 43 was not erec ted on the legal boundary but on the c ompound of No 45. The enc roac hed portion, _viz_ the portion of land between: (a) the legal boundary of the two properties and (b) the c hain fenc e and bric k wall, is the Land in Dispute referred to in the applic ation. The plaintiff’s surveyor filed a separate affidavit to c onfirm his survey findings. 

9       Unaware of his demise, the plaintiff wrote to Leonard on 12 September 2003 to inform him of the unlawful enc roac hment and requested that he rec tify the situation by setting the c hain fenc e bac k to the legal boundary line. The plaintiff’s solic itors only disc overed from a searc h c onduc ted in the Registry of Titles, that No 43 had been transferred to the defendant on 3 Dec ember 2003 by a grant of probate. 

10     Tan deposed that the plaintiff’s solic itors’ letter of 12 September 2003 rec eived a reply dated 10 Dec ember 2003 from the defendant’s solic itors in whic h they c laimed that the defendant and her predec essors-in-title had been in adverse possession of the Land in Dispute for the past 30 years. 

11     On 14 January 2004, the plaintiff’s solic itors wrote to the defendant’s solic itors to rejec t her c laim of adverse possession and requested for evidenc e in support thereof. No evidenc e was furnished by the defendant to support her c laim that the c hain fenc e had been in plac e “all these years”. Consequently, the plaintiff filed the applic ation. 

12     In her affidavit, the defendant deposed that when she and Leonard first viewed and inspec ted No 43 in 1971 (they were then already married), the present day c hain fenc e was already in existenc e and divided the two properties. Immediately next to the c hain fenc e on the side of No 45 were a few mature trees. No 45 slopes gently towards No 43. Next to the c hain fenc e on the side of No 43 was a 3ft high bric k wall that still stands today. 

13     Ac c ording to the defendant, over the years before his demise, her husband (and she) had used the plot of land next to the bric k wall on the side of No 43 as a garden to plant trees, palms, flowering plants and other foliage. She exhibited photographs taken as far bac k as June 1972 and as rec ent as 2004 to support her c laims. She asserted she (and her husband before his demise) had been in c ontinuous oc c upation of No 43 and the Land in Dispute sinc e 1971. 

14     The defendant deposed that before the plaintiff bec ame its owner, all previous oc c upants of No 45 had never c laimed the Land in Dispute as part of No 45. None of those oc c upants had attempted to breac h the c hain fenc e to c ross over to No 43. Had they done so, she and her husband would have treated them as trespassers. 

15     The defendant disputed the findings in the topographic al survey done by the plaintiff’s surveyor; the survey inc luded, within the legal boundary of No 45, land that was more than the Land in Dispute. She had shown the topographic al survey to a registered surveyor, Leong Kai Weng, who had c arried out a survey on her behalf and whic h survey c ured the shortc omings in the topographic al survey. The survey showed the Land in Dispute to be very c lose to the front gate of No 43. 

**The submissions** 

16     Mr Hee, c ounsel for the plaintiff, relied on ss 50, 172(7) and 172(8) of the Land Titles Ac t (Cap 157, 1994 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”) for his submissions. The Ac t has sinc e been replac ed by the Land Titles Ac t (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the revised edition”) but the provisions remain the same. The pertinent sec tions in the Ac t read: 


 No title by adverse possession 

 50 Exc ept as provided in sec tion 172(7) and (8), no title to land adverse to or in derogation of the title of a proprietor of registered land shall be ac quired by any length of possession by virtue of the Limitation Ac t or otherwise, nor shall the title of any proprietor of registered land be extinguished by the operation of that Ac t. 

 Savings 

 172.—(1) ... 

 (7) Where at any time before 1st Marc h 1994 a person — 

 (a) was in adverse possession of any registered land; and 

 (b) has lodged an applic ation for a possessory title to the land under the provisions of the repealed Ac t and the applic ation has not been withdrawn but is on that date pending in the Land Titles Registry, 

 the applic ation shall be dealt with in ac c ordanc e with the provisions of the repealed Ac t in forc e immediately before suc h date. 

 (8) Where at any time before 1st Marc h 1994 a person — 

 (a) was in adverse possession of any registered land: and 

 (b) was entitled to lodge an applic ation for a possessory title to the land under the provisions of the repealed Ac t whic h were in forc e immediately before that date, 

 he may, within 6 months of that date make an applic ation to c ourt for an order to vest the title in him or lodge an applic ation for a possessory title to the land and the applic ation shall be dealt with in ac c ordanc e with the provisions of the repealed Ac t in forc e immediately before suc h date. 

17     Sec tion 177 of the Land Titles Ac t 1993 (Ac t No 27 of 1993), whic h is also relevant, reads as follows: 

 Amendment of the Limitation Act 

 177.—(1) Sec tion 9 of the Limitation Ac t is amended by inserting immediately after subsec tion (2), the following subsec tion: 

 (2) Sec tion 16 of the Limitation Ac t is repealed. 

 (3) Nothing in this sec tion shall — 

 (a) enable any ac tion to be brought whic h was barred by the Limitation Ac t immediately before the c ommenc ement of the Land Titles Ac t 1993 (referred to in this subsec tion as the appointed day); 

 (b) affec t any ac tion c ommenc ed before the appointed day; or 

 (c ) revive any title to land whic h was extinguished by the operation of the Limitation 


 Ac t in forc e immediately before the appointed day. 

18     The repealed Ac t referred to in s 172 of the Ac t (and the c orresponding provision in the revised edition) was the Land Titles Ac t (Cap 157, 1985 Rev Ed) and will henc eforth be referred to as “the repealed Ac t”. The 1993 Ac t will henc eforth be referred to as “the 1993 Ac t”. 

19     Mr Hee argued that the above sec tions of the Ac t (whic h c ame into effec t on 1 Marc h 1994) meant that the defendant c ould no longer c laim adverse possession to defeat the plaintiff’s title to the Land in Dispute, as she had failed to c omply with the requirements of ss 172(7) and 172(8) thereof. He added that s 177(3) of the 1993 Ac t did not apply as the Land in Dispute was not unregistered land as at 1 Marc h 1994. He relied on _Balwant Singh v Double L & T Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1996] 2 SLR 726</span> (“ _Balwant Singh_ ”) and _Liwen Holdings Pte Ltd v Ng Ker San_ <span class="citation">[2001] 2 SLR 533</span> to support his submission. 

20     Mr Gan, c ounsel for the defendant, on the other hand interpreted the two c ases as supporting the defendant’s c laim to adverse possession of the Land in Dispute. He distinguished the defendant’s situation from the fac ts in _Ho Lam Phoh v Tan Swee Beng_ <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 629</span> and _Shell Eastern Petroleum (Pte) Ltd v Goh Chor Cheok_ <span class="citation">[2000] 1 SLR 45</span> (“ _Shell Eastern Petroleum_ ”). _Tan Siok Gek v Ng Kim Neo_ <span class="citation">[1997] 2 SLR 691</span> and _Lo Sook Ling Adela v Au Mei Yin Christina_ <span class="citation">[2002] 1 SLR 408</span> were also relied on by Mr Gan for his submission that the defendant’s c laim to adverse possession had already c rystallised before the applic ation and the plaintiff’s attempt to obtain a dec laration to the c ontrary c ame too late in the day. 

**The cases** 

21     As both parties relied on the same authorities to support opposite arguments, I now turn to c onsider them, starting with _Balwant Singh_. 

22     In that c ase, the Court of Appeal (whose judgment was delivered by Goh Joon Seng J) in allowing the appeal, held (ac c ording to the headnote of the revised edition of the report): 

 (1) As of 1 Marc h 1994, there were only three c ategories of c laims for adverse possession: (a) for land under the c ommon law system, the adverse possessor must have had at least 12 years of adverse possession as of 1 Marc h 1994 to make a c laim and rely on s 177(3) of [the 1993 Ac t] to preserve his title; (b) for registered land held under the provisions of the repealed Ac t, the adverse possessor c ould rely on s 172(7) and (8) of [the Ac t]; and (c ) for registered land held under the provisions of [the Ac t], no adverse possession c laims were allowed unless s 172(7) or (8) applied. 

 (2) Sec tion 50 of the new Ac t was not retrospec tive in operation and applied only in respec t of adverse possession whic h had not c rystallised into a possessory title when the land bec ame registered land and not to adverse possession whic h had c rystallised. In the latter situation, the title of the doc umentary owner would already have been extinguished at the time of the c onversion to registered land. 

 (3) In this c ase, as the land was only registered after 1 Marc h 1994, s 177(3)(a) and (c ) of [the 1993 Ac t] applied. Sinc e Balwant [the appellant] had c ompleted the requisite 12 years’ possession before the land was registered, his title was preserved by s 177(3) and s 50 did not apply to defeat his c laim. 

23     In _Balwant Singh_ , the material dates were as follows: 


 (a) In 1971, Balwant purc hased Lot 3886 Mukim 27 (“Balwant’s lot”) with a house to be known as 114 Jalan Langgar, Bedok, then under c onstruc tion. 

 (b) Balwant went into oc c upation of his house on 18 July1973. 

 (c ) Part of Lot 235-25, Mukim 27 (“Lot 235-25”) with a triangular area of 70.4m² (the disputed lot) was c ontiguous to Balwant’s lot. It was enc losed on two sides (inc luding the part bordering Balwant’s lot) by a c hainlink fenc e; 

 (d) Balwant removed the c hain link fenc e and annexed the disputed lot to his land. He c laimed to be in uninterrupted possession of the disputed lot sinc e September 1973, having maintained and turfed the previously unkempt area with c arpet grass. 

 (e) In 1941, one Thulasi Velayutham (“Thulasi”) entered into oc c upation of Lot 235-25. He built a single storey wooden house and lived there with the knowledge of its owner Dr V K Samy. 

 (f ) On 17 Dec ember 1993, Thulasi obtained a c onsent judgment against the estate of Dr V K Samy, dec laring himself to be in adverse possession of and the owner of Lot 235-25. The c onsent judgment was registered in the Registry of Deeds on 22 Dec ember 1993. 

 (g) On the same day, Thulasi c onveyed Lot 235-25 (inc luding the disputed lot) to Double L & T Pte Ltd (“Double L”). 

 (h) On 20 June 1994, Lot 235-25 (inc luding the disputed lot) was brought under the provisions of the Ac t, with Double L as the registered proprietor under a qualified c ertific ate of title. 

 (i) On 17 February 1995, Balwant lodged a c aveat against Lot 235-25 c laiming an interest in the disputed lot as an adverse possessor. 

24     Mr Hee argued that as the defendant had failed to lodge a c aveat (whic h the appellant did in _Balwant Singh_ ), she had lost her right to c laim adverse possession. Mr Gan, however, submitted that the holding of the Court of Appeal in sub-para (3) of [22] above, supported his c lient’s c laim. As the defendant had oc c upied the Land in Dispute without interruption sinc e 1971, she had c ompleted 12 years of adverse possession by 1983. Sinc e No 45 was only c onverted to registered land on 23 Marc h 1985 _after_ the defendant’s rights as adverse possessor had already c rystallised, she had extinguished the rights of the plaintiff and its predec essorin-title. The defendant was not obliged to take any ac tion to preserve her c laim, let alone file a c aveat. Neither s 50 of the Ac t nor s 177(3) of the 1993 Ac t applied to the defendant. Indeed, s 177(3) of the 1993 Ac t applied to the plaintiff, as limitation had set in after 1983 to extinguish the title of its vendor, the c ompany, when the defendant ac quired possessory title to the Land in Dispute. The plaintiff c ould no longer c laim that land by the applic ation. 

25     To reinforc e his argument, Mr Gan referred to _Lo Sook Ling Adela v Au Mei Yin Christina_ ([20] _supra_ ) where the Chao Hic k Tin JA, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said (at [5]): 

 In 1994, a signific ant c hange in the law took plac e in Singapore, By virtue of what is now s 50 of the Land Titles Ac t (Cap 157, 1994 Ed) no one may, after 1 Marc h 1994, ac quire any registered land by adverse possession. But the new law does not affect a person who has been in adverse possession of registered land for 12 years or more before 1 March 1994. In other words, the new law does not affect title already acquired by adverse possession : Balwant Singh ... 


 [emphasis added] 

26     The princ iples enunc iated in _Balwant Singh_ were followed in the subsequent c ases c ited in [20] above. Coinc identally, Goh Joon Seng J, who delivered the judgment in _Balwant Singh_ , also delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal in _Ho Lam Phoh v Tan Swee Beng_. The headnote in the revised edition of the report reads as follows: 

 The appellant and the respondent Tan were owners of adjoining properties. A retaining wall and fenc e, whic h demarc ated the boundary between their respec tive properties enc roac hed onto Tan’s property. The retaining wall and fenc e was erec ted latest by 1971, when both parties’ properties were developed as part of a housing estate. Both the appellants and Tan were not the original owners of their property. On 24 June 1974, the appellants’ property was c onverted to registered land and the same was done for Tan’s property on 20 June 1984. Tan was issued with a qualified c ertific ate of title. When Tan disc overed the enc roac hment by the retaining wall and fenc e, he requested that the appellants set bac k the wall, but they refused. Tan then c ommenc ed these proc eedings for an order, inter alia, to resite the retaining wall and fenc e to its proper boundary line. The [trial] judge agreed and the appellants appealed, c laiming adverse possession over that portion of Tan’s property. 

27     In dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the appellants had no c laim under the c ommon law system or under the registered land titles system. The disputed land was registered land as at 1 Marc h 1994. As suc h, ss 172(7) and 172(8) of the Ac t applied. Sinc e the appellants did not lodge any applic ation for possessory title or apply to c ourt for an order to vest the title in them, their c laim was abolished by s 50 of the Ac t. 

28     Mr Gan drew the c ourt’s attention to an extrac t at 636, [12] of the judgment where Goh J said: 

 [T]the disputed land bec ame registered land on 20 June 1984. As of 1 Marc h 1994, the defendants did not have 12 years of adverse possession under the c ommon law system. Their rights were therefore not preserved by s 177(3) of [the Ac t]. 

29     It would not be nec essary to review _Liwen Holdings Pte Ltd v Ng Ker San_ ([19] _supra_ ) sinc e Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) followed _Balwant Singh_ in arriving at his dec ision to allow the c laim of the adverse possessor. 

30     I turn my attention instead to _Shell Eastern Petroleum_ whic h c ase also followed _Balwant Singh_. However, the parties differed in their understanding of Warren L H Khoo J’s judgment. Mr Hee had relied on this c ase to buttress his argument that the defendant needed to lodge a c aveat to preserve her rights as an adverse possessor against a _bona fide_ purc haser for value ( _viz_ the plaintiff ). As she failed to do so, her c laim failed. Mr Gan, on the other hand, submitted that his opponent had misread Khoo J’s following remarks whic h were, in any c ase, _obiter_ : 

 12 Similarly, in the instant c ase, the plaintiffs’ title to the disputed land had been extinguished when the land was brought under the provisions of the Ac t. The failure of the defendants to lodge a c aveat would only have had an adverse effec t on them in relation to a purc haser from the plaintiffs. Vis-à-vis the plaintiffs as the original registered proprietor against whom the defendants had ac quired title by adverse possession, the absenc e of a c aveat had no effec t on the defendants’ title. 

 35 It is my c onc lusion, therefore, that the defendants’ adverse title, whic h had matured 


 long before the land was brought under the provisions of the Land Titles Ac t, remains valid notwithstanding the fac t that they never lodged any c aveat while the land was subjec t to qualified title and notwithstanding that the plaintiffs’ title has sinc e bec ome unqualified as a result of the c anc ellation of the c aution. The defendants’ title, however, stands on an extremely prec arious footing. It is exposed to the risk of being over-reac hed by a purc haser from the plaintiffs, as it has not been notified on the register. That is a c onsequenc e to whic h all persons who have an interest in registered land whic h is not within the exc eptions in s 46 or whic h has not been notified on the register, are exposed. Whether the defendants c an still protec t their interest by lodging a c aveat in ac c ordanc e with the general provisions of s 115 is not a matter before me. 

31     Khoo J dismissed the plaintiffs’ c laim. He noted at [35] that the defendants’ adverse title had matured long before the land was brought under the provisions of the Land Titles Ac t. It remained valid notwithstanding that the defendants did not lodge any c aveat while the land was the subjec t of a qualified title and notwithstanding that the plaintiffs’ title had sinc e bec ome unqualified as a result of the c anc ellation of the c aution. 

32     The c hronology of events in _Shell Eastern Petroleum_ was as follows: 

 (a) In 1961, there was enc roac hment by the defendants of the plaintiffs’ land. 

 (b) In 1973, 12 years of adverse possession was c ompleted by the defendants. 

 (c ) In 1992, the plaintiffs’ land was c onverted to registered land and a qualified c ertific ate of title was issued. 

 (d) In 1993, the Ac t abolished adverse possession. 

 (e) In 1996, the c aution on the c ertific ate of title was c anc elled. 

 (g) In 1997, the plaintiffs c ommenc ed Originating Summons No 827 of 1997 against the defendants. 

33     In the c ourse of his judgment (before making his remarks as set out in [30] above), Khoo J had also referred to the Court of Appeal’s judgment (delivered by Chan Sek Keong J) in _Wong Kok Chin v Mah Ten Kui Joseph_ <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR 161</span>. I shall return to this c ase later. 

34     Mr Gan pointed out that neither c ounsel nor Khoo J referred to _Tan Siok Gek v Ng Kim Neo_ ([20] _supra_ ). In that c ase, Choo Han Tec k JC (as he then was), in allowing the plaintiff’s c laim for adverse possession, said (at [12]): 

 The plaintiffs in this c ase ac quired [her] interest by way of adverse possession even before the land was brought under the LTA. Upon her ac quisition, the defendants’ rights were c orrespondingly extinguished. Henc e, by the time the defendants’ property was brought under the LTA in 1992, the property so c onverted was the original plot less the strip of land adversely possessed. 

**The decision** 

35     I disagreed with Khoo J’s views and rejec ted the plaintiff’s argument that the defendant was required to, but had failed, to file a c aveat or c omply with ss 172(7) and 172(8) of the Ac t in order to 


assert her rights as an adverse possessor. With respec t, that is not the requirement either under the Ac t or established c ase law, in partic ular, _Balwant Singh_. 

36     The c hronology set out in [4] above showed that Leonard, together with the defendant, had c ompleted 12 years of adverse possession by 1983 sinc e their oc c upation of the Land in Dispute began at the latest on 3 April 1971, that being the date of the Indenture of Conveyanc e. By 1983, Leonard had obtained an indefeasible title to, and had extinguished, the title of the then owner, _viz_ , the c ompany (see [5] above) to the Land in Dispute. When No 45 was brought under the Ac t two years later on 23 Marc h 1985, the Land in Dispute was not part of the registered land as it was no longer owned by the c ompany. Henc e, when No 45 was transferred to the plaintiff on 23 Dec ember 2002, the plaintiff did not have any title to the Land in Dispute. It is trite law that a vendor c annot c onvey to a purc haser a better title than what he has. I should point out at this junc ture that the plaintiff did not dispute the fac ts the defendant had deposed to in her affidavit. Consequently, the fac t of her adverse possession of the Land in Dispute sinc e 1971 was not denied. 

37     Mr Hee’s arguments, relying on ss 172(7) and 172(8) of the Ac t, were misc onc eived. The two subsec tions spec ific ally referred to adverse possession of “registered land”. The Land in Dispute was not registered land before 1 Marc h 1994; it was c ommon law land up to 23 Marc h 1985. The defendant therefore c ame within the first c ategory of c laims for adverse possession – she had more than 12 years of uninterrupted oc c upation as of 1 Marc h 1994. _Balwant Singh_ (see [22] above) also made it c lear that s 50 of the Ac t was not retrospec tive in operation. Subsequent events (c onversion of No 45 to registered land) c annot overreac h the defendant’s prior existing rights as an adverse possessor. 

38     Earlier at [33], I had adverted to _Wong Kok Chin v Mah Ten Kui Joseph._ That c ase c entred on s 42(3) of the repealed Ac t whic h stated: 

 Nothing in this Ac t affec ts the operation of the Limitation Ac t with respec t to the right of a person in adverse possession of land c omprised in a qualified c ertific ate of title where the possession c ommenc ed before the land was brought under the provisions of this Ac t and that right has been protec ted by c aveat. 

Khoo J was probably influenc ed by the c ase when he made his c omments on the need for an adverse possessor to lodge a c aveat to protec t his interest. 

39     In _Wong Kok Chin v Mah Ten Kui Joseph_ , the enc roac hment by the respondent of the appellant’s land began in 1969 when the parties bec ame registered proprietors of adjoining lots of land. The appellant’s land was brought under the provisions of the Land Titles Ac t (Cap 276, 1970 Rev Ed) on 23 August 1974 and a qualified c ertific ate of title was issued in respec t thereof. The respondent’s solic itors notified the appellant on 10 June 1988 that his title to the enc roac hed land had been extinguished. On 16 June 1988, the respondent erec ted a new fenc e in the same position as the previous fenc e whic h the appellant had taken down. On 23 June 1988, the appellant lodged a notic e of reassertion of ownership under s 44 of the repealed Ac t (referred to in the judgment as “the LTA”). On 27 June 1988, the respondent lodged a c aveat against the appellant’s property c laiming an interest as adverse possessor in the enc roac hed land. In his judgment, Chan Sek Keong J held, _inter alia_ (ac c ording to the headnote of the report): 

 (3) The respondent’s inc hoate interest had c rystallized into an indefeasible right against the appellant by Dec ember 1981. The appellant’s title was extinguished long before he lodged his reassertion of ownership. The lodgement of the reassertion of ownership c ould not have the effec t of reviving a title whic h had been extinguished by limitation. ... 


 (4) The appellant’s c ontention that the respondent’s right of adverse possession had been lost when he failed to lodge his c aveat in time was not ac c eptable. It is c lear from s 20 of the LTA that until the registered proprietor of land held under a qualified title obtains the c anc ellation of the c aution on his c ertific ate of title, his title will always be subjec t to subsisting interests affec ting his title. The c aveat referred to in s 42(3) is intended to protec t the rights of an adverse possessor against a purc haser and not against the registered proprietor. The right of an adverse possessor in a situation envisaged by s 42(3) c an only be defeated by a purc haser where suc h right is not protec ted by c aveat, or by the registered proprietor lodging a reassertion of ownership before his title has been extinguished by limitation. 

40     The following passage from his judgment (at 166, [15]) is illuminating on the rights of an adverse possessor: 

 The sec ond problem arises from the nature of an adverse possessor’s rights in land. He does not ac quire the proprietary interest or title of the dispossessed owner of the land. Limitation merely has the effec t of extinguishing the title of the true owner. Onc e extinguished, no c orresponding title c an vest in the adverse possessor. But, bec ause the true owner is barred by law from rec overing possession of the land from the adverse possessor, the latter has thereby ac quired a possessory right whic h is indefeasible by anyone. For that reason, his possessory title is as good as any other title the law c an provide. 

41     Apart from alerting the registered proprietor (whic h would not be the desired effec t), what purpose would have been served by the lodgment of a c aveat by the defendant? Assuming she did lodge a c aveat soon after 23 Marc h 1985. The c ompany c ould not have taken any legal steps to defeat the defendant’s possessory title whic h had c rystallised two years earlier. At best, the c aveat would have enabled the plaintiff to obtain a reduc tion of its purc hase pric e ($4.15m) in 2002. When the c aution on the plaintiff’s c ertific ate of title was c anc elled in Dec ember 2003, it was far too late and had no effec t on the defendant’s possessory title either. 

42     If indeed a c aveat was required to be filed by the defendant, the holding of Chan J in subpara (4) of [39] above made it c lear it was intended to protec t her possessory rights against a purc haser, not against the registered proprietor. The plaintiff was _not_ a purc haser but a registered proprietor. Even if I am wrong on this c ount and the plaintiff c an be said to be a _bona fide_ purc haser for value, I find it diffic ult to believe that Tan, or any other representative of the plaintiff, c ould not have notic ed that the Land in Dispute was outside the fenc e of No 45. Indeed, the vendors, _viz_ , the Eapens, would have been very surprised had they been told that what they sold to the plaintiff inc luded land over their neighbour’s fenc e. I note too that the Eapens’ option to purc hase dated 29 August 2002 addressed to “Chia Quee Hoc k” or nominee (but subsequently exerc ised by the plaintiff), only referred to No 45 without identifying the lot and/or mukim and/or area of land. 

43     I applied the princ iples laid down in _Balwant Singh_ and in subsequent c ases. Consequently, I dismissed the applic ation, granted the defendant’s c rossapplic ation and, _inter alia_ , ordered the issue of a separate c ertific ate of title to the defendant for the Land in Dispute, after registering my order vesting the legal, equitable and possessory title of the Land in Dispute in the defendant.
