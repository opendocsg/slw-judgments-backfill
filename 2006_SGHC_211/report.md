**Sundaresh Menon JC:** 

1       Madam Loh Gek Huay (“Madam Loh”) had two properties to her name. One was No. 59 Kovan Road, Singapore 548148 (“No. 59”), on whic h an apartment building was developed and now stands. The other was No. 61 Kovan Road, Singapore 548189 (“No. 61”), where Madam Loh stayed with her family until her death. A well-intentioned mother, Madam Loh bequeathed these properties variously to her ten c hildren, her grandson and her daughter-in-law. Unfortunately, good intentions are not always rec iproc ated and following her demise, these properties have bec ome the c entre of a bitter dispute among the benefic iaries, in partic ular, the plaintiff (“Nellie”), the sec ond defendant (“Lian Chyu”) and the fifth defendant (“Rosaline”). 

2       Both properties were the subjec t of Madam Loh’s last will and testament (“the will”) and they were bequeathed in the following terms: 

 Subjec t to payment of my just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses inc luding estate duty, I GIVE DEVISE and BEQUEATH my properties to the persons and in the manner following: 

 (a) My residential premises known as No. 61 Kovan Road, Singapore, to the following persons in equal shares: 

 (1) my daughter GOH ANNIE 

 (2) my daughter GOH MOLLY 

 (3) my son GOH LIAN CHYU 

 (4) my son GOH LIAN HING 


 (5) my daughter GOH SHIRLEY 

 (6) my daughter GOH NELLIE 

 (7) my daughter GOH JUDY 

 (8) my son GOH LIAN POH 

 (9) my daughter GOH ROSALIND [ sic ] 

 (10) my son GOH LIAN TECK 

 (11) my grandson GOH BOON HUI RONEY 

 My above stated residential premises shall be used as a residence by my c hildren abovenamed and shall not be sold without the consent in writing of the abovenamed 11 beneficiaries and that until c ompletion of the sale thereof my trustee shall permit my c hildren abovenamed or any one of them to oc c upy the same rent free so long as he or she shall desire. 

 (b) The irremovable property known as No 59 Kovan Road, Singapore 548148, to all the benefic iaries named below as alloc ated: 

 (1) my son GOH LIAN HING: #01-02 (Type B) 

 (2) my daughter GOH ROSALIND: [sic ] #01-03 (Type C) 

 (3) my son GOH LIAN POH: #02-02 (Type D) 

 (4) my daughter NELLIE GOH: #02-03 (Type C) 

 (5) my son GOH LIAN CHYU: #03-02 (Type D) 

 (6) my son GOH LIAN TECK: #03-03 (Type C) 

 (7) my daughter-in-law, LOW DJAU AI: #01-01, #02-01 and #03-01 (Type A) (This is in apprec iation of LOW DJAU AI advanc ing financ e for the development of this projec t). 

 (emphasis added; NRIC Nos. redac ted) 

3       Soon after Madam Loh’s death, the quarrels started in relation to the properties she had left behind. The extent of the ac rimony is demonstrated in the fac t that this is the third ac tion involving Madam Loh’s benefic iaries to c ome before the c ourts. The first, MC Suit 411 of 2003, c onc erned a c omplaint by Rosaline that Lian Chyu and Nellie had unlawfully removed and disposed of some kennels that Rosaline had set up in No. 61 for her pet dogs. The c ase was eventually settled. The sec ond, OS 618 of 2005 (“OS 618”), is related to the present c ause of ac tion. That was an applic ation by Rosaline, _inter alia_ , for a determination of her right to reside in No 61. It c ame before Andrew Phang Boon Leong JC (as he then was), who made the following order on 8 August 2005: 

 On a true c onstruc tion of paragraph 2(a) of the Last Will & Testament of Low Gek Huay and in the events that have happened, that the Plaintiff has the benefic ial right to oc c upy the Property [ie No. 61] as a residenc e rent free as long as the Plaintiff desires (until sale) and that it shall not 


 be sold without the consent (in writing) of the Plaintiff provided that if the Plaintiff so c hooses to exerc ise her right of oc c upation, she must in fac t personally reside in the said Property. 

 (emphasis added; NRIC No. redac ted) 

4       In the wake of these disputes, the first defendant (“Lian Tec k”), who was originally the administrator of the estate, relinquished his appointment and Nellie took over on 8 August 2005. 

**The present action** 

5       The hostility among the main ac tors in these disputes did not abate. The c urrent ac tion stemmed from a meeting of the benefic iaries that was held on 15 Oc tober 2005. The sale of No. 61 was proposed at that meeting. The ostensible reason given was that the sale was nec essary in order to raise funds to meet the expenses inc urred by the estate. 

6       Rosaline objec ted to the sale. So too did three other benefic iaries: the seventh defendant (“Lian Hing”), the eighth defendant (“Shirley”) and the ninth defendant (“Judy”). In these proc eedings, eac h of them filed an affidavit supporting Rosaline’s position and opposing Nellie’s applic ation. 

7       As a result of Rosaline’s opposition to the sale of No. 61, Nellie, in her c apac ity as administratrix, applied to this c ourt for an order pursuant to s 56 of the Trustees Ac t (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”) sanc tioning the sale of No. 61. She maintained that this issue was not resolved by the order of Phang JC made in OS 618 and that the terms of the will do not prohibit the sale of No. 61. In her affidavit, Nellie c ited two reasons that should move this c ourt to exerc ise its disc retion under s 56(1) of the Ac t: 

 (a) that No. 61 is and has been a c onstant sourc e of c onflic t between Rosaline and Lian Chyu, who is c urrently residing in No. 61 with his wife; and 

 (b) that the sale of No. 61 is nec essary in order to raise the funds referred to at [5] above. 

8       Further, Nellie also deposed to her belief that her mother had wanted to ensure that all her benefic iaries had a roof over their head. She submitted this was no longer a c onc ern as eac h of the benefic iaries had their own property and the will should be c onstrued with this in mind. 

9       Rosaline, on the other hand, submitted that: 

 (a) the question, whether the benefic iaries to No. 61 eac h had a veto over its sale, had already been answered in the affirmative in OS 618 and is therefore res judicata ; 

 (b) even if the issue remained open for c onsideration by this c ourt, there is an express prohibition in the will against the sale of No. 61 unless all the benefic iaries c onsent in writing. Therefore, this c ourt has no power to sanc tion the sale under s 56(1) of the Ac t; 

 (c ) even if the c ourt has the power to sanc tion a sale under s 56(1) of the Ac t, the reasons c ited by Nellie do not stand up to sc rutiny. 

**The legal issues in this matter** 

10     The starting point of the analysis in this c ase is 56(1) of the Ac t, whic h reads as follows: 


**56.** —(1) Where in the management or administration of any property vested in trustees, any sale, lease, mortgage, surrender, release, or other disposition, or any purc hase, investment, ac quisition, expenditure, or other transac tion, is in the opinion of the c ourt expedient, _but the same cannot be effected by reason of the absence of any power for that purpose vested in the trustees by the trust instrument_ , if any, or by law, the c ourt may — 

 (a) by order c onfer upon the trustees, either generally or in any partic ular instanc e, the nec essary power for the purpose, on suc h terms, and subjec t to suc h provisions and c onditions, if any, as the c ourt may think fit; and 

 (b) direc t in what manner any money authorised to be expended, and the c osts of any transac tion, are to be paid or borne as between c apital and inc ome. 

 (emphasis added) 

11     In _Rajabali Jumabhoy and Others v Ameerali R Jumabhoy and Others_ <span class="citation">[1998] 2 SLR 439</span> (“ _Jumabhoy_ ”) the Court of Appeal held that a c ourt’s powers under s 56(1) of the Ac t (then s 59(1)) in relation to the management and administration of trust property are limited by the express terms of the trust instrument. This is no more than a reflec tion of the time-honoured princ iple that it is not for the c ourts to rewrite a trust instrument save in very limited c irc umstanc es where rec ourse may be had to the c ourt’s inherent jurisdic tion: see, for example, _In re New_ [1901] 2 Ch 534; _Jumabhoy_ at [68] – [75]; and _Re Tan Tye, Deceased_ [1957] MLJ 114. No argument was raised before me seeking rec ourse to the c ourt’s inherent jurisdic tion in the present c irc umstanc es and I have therefore c onfined myself to a c onsideration of the position under s 56(1) of the Ac t. As to this, it is c lear that while s 56(1) allows a c ourt the disc retion to empower a trustee to perform an ac t that is _not expressly authorised by the instrument_ , it c annot empower him to perform an ac t that is _expressly forbidden by it_. Commenting on s 57 of the UK Trustees Ac t 1925 ( _in pari materia_ with our s 56(1)), Evershed MR and Romer LJ stated as follows in _Re Downshire Settled Estates, Re Chapman’s Settlement Trusts, Re Blackwell’s Settlement Trusts_ [1953] Ch 218 at 248: 

 In our judgment, the objec t of s 57 was to sec ure that trust property should be managed as advantageously as possible in the interests of the benefic iaries and, with that objec t in view, to authorise spec ific dealings with the property whic h the c ourt might have felt itself unable to sanc tion under the inherent jurisdic tion, either bec ause no ac tual ‘emergenc y’ had arisen or bec ause of inability to show that the position whic h c alled for intervention was one whic h the c reator of the trust c ould not reasonably have foreseen; but it was no part of the legislative aim to disturb the rule that the court will not rewrite a trust , or to add to suc h exc eptions to that rule as had already found their way into the inherent jurisdic tion. 

 (emphasis added) 

12     Ac c epting this proposition, the Court of Appeal in _Jumabhoy_ , at [84], stated that the c ourt’s powers were not without limit, notwithstanding the wide disc retion c onferred by s 56(1) of the Ac t: 

 We think it is implicit in s 59(1) that that section cannot be invoked to sanction or authorise an act or transaction, where there is an express prohibition against such act or transaction contained in the trust instrument. In this respec t, the c ruc ial words in that subsec tion are ‘the same [ie the ac t or transac tion] c annot be effec ted by reason of the absenc e of any power for that purpose vested in the trustees by the trust instrument’. In a c ase, suc h as the present one, there is no ‘absenc e of any power’ in the trust instrument. On the c ontrary, there is, in this c ase in the trust instrument, c l 5 whic h expressly forbids the ac t or transac tion to be c arried out, ie to 


 invest in any sec urities in Singapore. In the face of this prohibition, the court cannot sanction or authorise an act or transaction proposed to be carried out, or ratify and approve such act or transaction which has been carried out, which is contrary to the terms of the trust. The intention of the settlor as expressed in the settlement ought to be respected. 

 (emphasis added) 

13     These observations on the ambit of s 56(1) of the Ac t were not really c ontroversial before me. Indeed, the princ iple that the c ourt has a disc retion to sanc tion the performanc e of an ac t by a trustee under s 56(1) subjec t to any express intention evidenc ed by the trust instrument under c onsideration was rec ently affirmed by the Court of Appeal in _Leo Teng Choy v Leo Teng Kit_ <span class="citation">[2001] 1 SLR 256</span> (“ _Leo Teng Choy_ ”) at [24] whic h was a c ase relied on heavily by Mr Andre Maniam who appeared for Lian Chyu. 

14     Ac c ordingly, the first task for a c ourt fac ed with an applic ation for it to exerc ise its powers under s 56(1) of the Ac t is to c onstrue the terms of the trust instrument (in this c ase, paragraph 2(a) of the will), in order to asc ertain whether there is an express prohibition of the very ac t that the trustee wishes, with the c ourt’s leave, to perform. It is only in the absenc e of any suc h prohibition that the c ourt needs to assess the applic ation on its merits. 

15     This, however, runs into a yet prior objec tion arising out of the litigation that has prec eded this ac tion. In partic ular, Rosaline c laims that the issue of whether the will prohibits the sale of No. 61 has already been answered in the affirmative by Phang JC in OS 618 in so far as he ordered that no sale of No. 61 c ould take plac e unless Rosaline c onsented to it in writing (see [3] _supra_ ). This therefore raises the anterior question as to whether the issue to be dec ided in this c ase is forec losed by the doc trine of _res judicata_. 

16     Ac c ordingly, the two preliminary issues that Nellie’s c ase must c ross before an assessment c an be made of whether the c ourt should exerc ise its disc retion under s 56(1) of the Ac t are: 

 (a) whether, the existenc e or otherwise of a right on the part of the benefic iaries, whether singly or in c onc ert, to veto the sale of No. 61 has already been determined in OS 618 and is therefore res judicata ; and 

 (b) if the issue stated in (a) is answered in the negative, whether, properly c onstrued, the will expressly forbids the sale of No. 61 in the event that any one or more of the benefic iaries objec t to its sale. If so, the c ourt has no power under s 56(1) of the Ac t to order its sale. 

It was dec ided with the c onsent of the parties that I should first give my dec ision on these two issues and this I now do. 

**Whether the application made in this action is estopped** 

**_The doctrine of res judicata_** 

17     The umbrella doc trine of _res judicata_ enc ompasses three c onc eptually distinc t though interrelated princ iples. The first of these is known as “c ause of ac tion estoppel” and it was famously explic ated in the judgment of Diploc k LJ (as he then was) in _Thoday v Thoday_ [1964] P 181 (“ _Thoday_ ”) as follow at 197-198: 

 [C]ause of ac tion estoppel...prevents a party from asserting or denying as against the other 


 party, the existenc e of a partic ular c ause of ac tion, the non-existenc e or existenc e of whic h has been determined by a c ourt of c ompetent jurisdic tion in previous litigation between the same parties. If the c ause of ac tion was determined to exist, i.e. judgment was given upon it, it is said to be merged in the judgment... If it was determined not to exist, the unsuc c essful plaintiff c an no longer assert that it does; he is estopped per rem judic atam. 

18     If the previous dec ision does not determine the c ause of ac tion sued on in the later proc eedings, that dec ision may still be invoked as having determined, as an essential step in its reasoning, an issue that proves relevant in the later c ase and further c onsideration of that issue may be forec losed: Spenc er Bower, Turner and Handley eds., _The Doctrine of Res Judicata_ (London: Butterworths, 1996) (“ _The Doctrine of Res Judicata_ ”) at para 182. This is c ommonly known as “issue estoppel” and was also explained by Diploc k LJ in _Thoday_ at 198 as follows: 

 [I]ssue estoppel is an extension of the same rule of public polic y. There are many c ases of ac tion whic h c an only be established by proving that two or more different c onditions are fulfilled. Suc h c auses of ac tion involve as many separate issues between the parties as there are many c onditions to be fulfilled by the plaintiff in order to establish his c ause of ac tion; and there may be c ases where the fulfilment of an identic al c ondition is a requirement c ommon to two or more different c auses of ac tion. If in litigation upon one suc h c ause of ac tion any of suc h separate issues as to whether a partic ular c ondition has been fulfilled is determined by a c ourt of c ompetent jurisdic tion, either upon evidenc e or upon admission by a party to the litigation, neither party c an, in subsequent litigation between one another upon any c ause of ac tion whic h depends upon the fulfilment of the identic al c ondition, assert that the c ondition was fulfilled if the c ourt has in the first litigation determined that it was not, or deny that it was fulfilled if the c ourt in the first litigation determined that it was. 

19     In some c ases, where neither c ause of ac tion estoppel nor issue estoppel is available, a defendant may rely on what the authors of _The Doctrine of Res Judicata_ term as “the extended doc trine of res judic ata” or, as it is more popularly known, the defenc e of abuse of proc ess. It has been questioned whether abuse of proc ess in this c ontext is a princ iple that is truly distinc t from c ause of ac tion and issue estoppels (see per Lord Denning MR in _McIlkenny v Chief Constable of the West Midlands_ [1980] 1 QB 283 at 322) (“ _McIlkenny_ ”). Lord Denning was undoubtedly c orrec t that some of the c ases that were said to have been applying the doc trine of abuse of proc ess in fac t c ould have been dec ided on traditional _res judicata_ princ iples. On the other hand, there are other c ases whic h c learly fall outside the traditional reac h of c ause of ac tion and issue estoppels but whic h have nonetheless been barred from proc eeding and these rest on the doc trine of abuse of proc ess. The doc trine has c learly been rec ognised as a part of the law in England (see _Johnson v Gore Wood & Co (a firm)_ [2002] 2 AC 1) (“ _Johnson_ ”). It has also been ac c epted in Singapore (see the dec ision of the Court of Appeal in _Lee Hiok Tng (in his personal capacity) v Lee Hiok Tng & Anor (executors and trustees of the estate of Lee Wee Nam, deceased)_ <span class="citation">[2001] 2 SLR 41</span> (“ _Lee Hiok Tng_ ”) as well as the dec ision of the same c ourt in _Lai Swee Lin Linda v AG_ <span class="citation">[2006] 2 SLR 565</span> whic h at [62] followed _Johnson_. 

20     The distinc t features of the doc trine of abuse of proc ess are well illustrated in the dec ision of the House of Lords in _Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police_ [1982] AC 529 (“ _Hunter_ ”) on appeal from the dec ision of the Court of Appeal _sub nom McIlkenny_ at [19] above. The appellant in that c ase was one of the ac c used in the notorious “Birmingham Six” c riminal trial. The appellant and his other c o-ac c used alleged that their c onfessions had been induc ed by polic e violenc e. The trial judge ruled that their c onfessions were voluntary and they were ac c ordingly c onvic ted. The appellant then brought a c ivil c laim against the polic e for damages for assault based on the alleged violenc e inflic ted in the c ourse of extrac ting his c onfession. The House of Lords unanimously held that the 


c laim should be struc k out as an abuse of proc ess bec ause it was in fac t an attempt to relitigate an issue that had already been dec ided. It was in essenc e a c ollateral attac k mounted by means of a c ivil ac tion, against the dec ision of the c riminal c ourt on the same point. Lord Diploc k (who delivered the leading judgment in whic h the other Law Lords c onc urred) noted as follows at 541: 

 The abuse of proc ess whic h the instant c ase exemplifies is the initiation of proc eedings in a c ourt of justic e for the purpose of mounting a c ollateral attac k upon a final dec ision against the intending plaintiff whic h has been made by another c ourt of c ompetent jurisdic tion in previous proc eedings in whic h the intending plaintiff had a full opportunity of c ontesting the dec ision in the c ourt by whic h it was made. 

21     Lord Diploc k at 542 also c ited favourably the following dic tum of Lord Halsbury LC in _Reichel v Magrath_ (1889) 14 App. Cas. 665 at 668: 

 I think it would be a sc andal to the administration of justic e if the same question having been disposed of by one c ase, the litigant were to be permitted by c hanging the form of the proc eedings to set up the same c ase again. 

22     The House of Lords relied on the abuse of proc ess defenc e rather than c ause of ac tion estoppel or issue estoppel bec ause the parties involved in the c ivil proc eedings were different from those in the c riminal proc eedings. While Lord Denning MR and Sir George Baker in the c ourt below were prepared to hold that the fac t that the parties were formally different did not and should not prevent the applic ation of the doc trine of issue estoppel (see _McIlkenny_ [19] above at 319 and 346 respec tively), Lord Diploc k thought it best, in order to avoid c onfusion and to maintain the distinc tion between issue estoppel and abuse of proc ess, that issue estoppel should be restric ted to that spec ies of estoppel _per rem judicatam_ that may arise in c ivil ac tions between the same parties or their privies: _Hunter_ at 540 541. 

23     The distinc tion between _res judicata_ (c ause of ac tion estoppel and issue estoppel) on the one hand and abuse of proc ess on the other was further explained in _Bradford & Bingley Building Society v Seddon_ [1999] 1 WLR 1482, where Auld LJ said at 1490: 

 In my judgment, it is important to distinguish c learly between res judicata and abuse of proc ess not qualifying as res judicata ... The former, in its c ause of ac tion estoppel form, is an absolute bar to relitigation, and in its issue estoppel form also, save in “spec ial c ases” or “spec ial c irc umstanc es” ... The latter, whic h may arise where there is no c ause of ac tion or issue estoppel, is not subjec t to the same test, the task of the c ourt being to draw the balanc e between the c ompeting c laims of one party to put his c ase before the c ourt and of the other not to be unjustly hounded given the earlier history of the matter. 

24     This _dicta_ was c ited and the distinc tion ac c epted by Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in _Kwa Ban Cheong v Kuah Boon Sek and Others_ <span class="citation">[2003] 3 SLR 644</span> (“ _Kwa Ban Cheong_ ”) at [24], and I agree that it ac c urately identifies the distinc tion between _res judicata_ and abuse of proc ess. 

25     In the present c ase, Rosaline relies only on the defenc es of issue estoppel and abuse of proc ess. 

**_Issue estoppel_** 

26     In _Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation of Grange Heights Strata Title No 301 (No 2)_ <span class="citation">[2005] 3 SLR 157</span> (“ _Lee Tat_ ”) the Court of Appeal at [14] to [15] held that the 


following requirements had to be met to establish an issue estoppel: 

 (a) there must be a final and c onc lusive judgment on the merits; 

 (b) that judgment must be of a c ourt of c ompetent jurisdic tion; 

 (c ) there must be identity between the parties to the two ac tions that are being c ompared; and 

 (d) there must be an identity of subjec t matter in the two proc eedings. 

27     I turn to examine whether these c riteria are satisfied in this c ase. 

28     The first issue is whether the prior dec ision is a final and c onc lusive judgment on its merits. It is important not to equate finality for the purposes of _res judicata_ with the vexed issue of finality for the purposes of an appeal. The distinc tion between “final” and “interloc utory” dec isions is not relevant to the doc trine of finality in respec t of _res judicata_ : _McIlkenny_ at 321 (per Lord Denning MR). Finality for the purposes of _res judicata_ simply refers to a dec laration or determination of a party’s liability and/or his rights or obligations leaving nothing else to be judic ially determined: _The Doctrine of Res Judicata_ at para 154. Whether the dec ision in question is a final and c onc lusive judgment on the merits may be asc ertained from the intention of the judge as gathered from the relevant doc uments filed, the order made and the notes of any evidenc e taken or arguments made. Andrew Ang J rec ently noted as follows in _Alliance Entertainment Singapore Pte Ltd v Sim Kay Teck_ <span class="citation">[2006] 3 SLR 712</span> at [23]: 

 That, in this respec t, the intention of the judge is c ritic al c an also be seen in Hendrawan Setiadi v OCBC Securities Pte Ltd <span class="citation">[2001] 4 SLR 503</span>. In that c ase, Woo Bih Li JC (as he then was) had to dec ide whether the plaintiff was estopped from bringing a sec ond ac tion against the defendants by reason of an earlier ac tion between the same parties having been struc k out after c ounsel for the plaintiff unsuc c essfully sought leave to disc ontinue. The plaintiff argued that as his c laim in the first ac tion had not been dismissed he was not prec luded from re-litigating it. Woo JC went through the trial judge’s notes of the proc eedings in c hambers on the plaintiff’s applic ation for leave to disc ontinue and c onc luded that, in refusing the plaintiff’s applic ation and ordering a striking out of the ac tion, the trial judge had intended to prec lude any fresh ac tion. 

29     In the present c ase, there c an be no doubt that the order made in OS 618 was a final determination of the right of Rosaline to reside at No 61. There was nothing that remained to be dec ided in relation to this. Counsel for Nellie submitted, however, that OS 618 was a c onsent order and he c ontended that c onsent orders are inc apable of forming the basis upon whic h an issue estoppel c ould arise. In my judgment, this is misc onc eived. Leaving aside the question whether OS 618 was a c onsent order to begin with, this would not prevent it forming the basis of an issue estoppel so long as the order was final: see, _The Doctrine of Res Judicata_ at para 38, c iting _Kinch v Walcott_ [1929] AC 482. 

30     Counsel for Lian Chyu advanc ed a slightly different argument. He ac c epted that a c onsent judgment c ould found an estoppel, but he argued that this emanated from the agreement of the parties. He referred to the dec ision of Andrew Phang Boon Leong J (as he then was) in _Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man_ <span class="citation">[2006] 2 SLR 117</span> (“ _Wellmix Organics_ ”) in support of the notion that a c onsent order rested on the fac t of agreement so that onc e the c onsent order was vitiated as an agreement it c ould not be relied upon. With respec t, this too is misc onc eived. As c ounsel ac c epted, _Wellmix Organics_ was not c onc erned with issue estoppel. Rather, it was 


c onc erned with the breac h of an “unless order”. There was an issue as to whether it was an order made by c onsent. Phang J found on the fac ts it was not. That did not displac e the fac t that it was still an “unless order”. Phang J then c onsidered whether the breac h of the “unless order” was c ontumelious or c ontumac ious and found it was not and he allowed the appeal on that ground (see _Wellmix Organics_ at [106], [107] and [110]). 

31     The sec ond requirement, that the prior dec ision must have been made by a c ourt of c ompetent jurisdic tion, is obviously satisfied. Neither party sought to argue otherwise. 

32     The third requirement is identity between the parties involved in the previous litigation and in the present proc eedings. The c ourts have not taken a narrow view of what this means. In _Lee Tat_ , for example, even though the appellant had brought the earlier ac tion as owner of two _dominant_ tenements and the later proc eedings as owner of a _servient_ tenement, this c hange in status did not prevent the Court of Appeal from holding that the “effec tive parties” were the same for the purpose of satisfying this requirement: at [14] and [16]. In _Hunter_ , Lord Diploc k also stated that issue estoppel may arise in c ivil ac tions between “the same parties _or their privies_ ”: at 541 (emphasis added). 

33     In OS 618, Rosaline brought her ac tion against Lian Tec k (in his c apac ity as administrator of the estate), Lian Chyu and Nellie. In this respec t, it was eventually c onc eded – and rightfully so – by c ounsel for Lian Chyu that the order in OS 618, made against Lian Tec k _in his capacity as administrator of the estate_ must nec essarily bind all the benefic iaries jointly and severally and, for that matter, anyone stepping into the shoes of the administrator. In the c urrent applic ation, Nellie was ac ting _in her capacity as administratrix of the estate_ and Rosaline as the princ ipal benefic iary opposing the applic ation. In my judgment, it is c lear that the princ ipal players in both ac tions – Rosaline and the administrator of the estate (representing the benefic iaries) – are effec tively identic al. As suc h, this requirement also is met. 

34     The main diffic ulty in dec iding whether issue estoppel arises on the fac ts of this c ase lies in determining whether the issues litigated in OS 618 and the issues presented in this applic ation are identic al. The requirement that the subjec t matter of both proc eedings be identic al enc apsulates a number of disc rete c onc eptual strands. Firstly, the issues must be identic al in the sense that the prior dec ision must traverse the same ground as the subsequent proc eeding and the fac ts and c irc umstanc es giving rise to the earlier dec ision must not have c hanged or should be inc apable of c hange. Where this is not the c ase, issue estoppel may not arise. Thus, in _Richards v Richards_ [1953] P 36, the c ourt allowed a wife to bring a sec ond ac tion against her husband alleging c ruelty and traversing some of the ground already c overed in an earlier ac tion whic h also alleged c ruelty but had failed. This was bec ause “the c onduc t whic h is alleged ... to amount to persistent c ruelty c an only be judged in the light of the whole c ourse of c onduc t, and the mere fac t that at an earlier stage, when the c onduc t was only partly c ompleted, a c ourt has adjudged that at that point it does not amount to persistent c ruelty, does not shut that evidenc e out forever”: see at 40 c iting _Molesworth v Molesworth_ [1947] 2 All ER 842. Similarly, in _Mills v Cooper_ [1967] 2 QB 459, it was held that bec ause the question of whether someone was a gipsy c ould c hange depending on his c irc umstanc es, an earlier dec ision that the defendant was not a gipsy did not bar subsequent proc eedings c ontending that he was. 

35     The sec ond idea whic h is c ontained within the requirement of an identity of subjec t-matter is that the previous determination in question must have been fundamental and not merely c ollateral to the previous dec ision so that the dec ision c ould not stand without that determination: see _The Doctrine of Res Judicata_ at para 201. The authors of _The Doctrine of Res Judicata_ trac e the authorities for this princ iple bac k to the dec ision of Lord Holt in _Blackham’s Case_ (1709) 1 Salk 290, 


but a more rec ent statement may be found in _Blair v Curran_ (1939) 62 CLR 464, in whic h Starke J held at 510: 

 [A] judgment c onc ludes not merely the point dec ided but matters whic h were nec essary to dec ide and whic h were ac tually dec ided as the groundwork of the dec ision itself though not then direc tly the point at issue and that a judgment is c onc lusive evidenc e not merely of the fac ts direc tly dec ided but of those fac ts whic h are nec essary steps to the dec ision – so cardinal to it that without them it cannot stand. 

 (emphasis added) 

36     In the same c ase, Dixon J said as follows at 532: 

 In the phraseology of Lord Shaw [in Hoystead v Commissioner of Taxation [1926] AC 155], “a fac t fundamental to the dec ision arrived at” in the former proc eedings...must be taken as finally and c onc lusively established...[M]atters of law or fac t whic h are subsidiary or c ollateral are not c overed by the estoppel... Decisions upon matters of law which amount to no more than steps in a process of reasoning tending to establish or support the proposition upon which the rights depend do not estop the parties if the same matters of law arise in subsequent litigation. 

 (emphasis added) 

37     The distinc tion between those issues that are “no more than steps in a proc ess of reasoning” and those whic h are “so c ardinal” that the dec ision “c annot stand without them” is not an easy one. The authors of _The Doctrine of Res Judicata_ , at para 202, propose that one test is whether the issue in question may be appealed. If there c an be no effec tive appeal against that determination, then the issue is not fundamental to the judgment. However, as even they c onc ede, this test may not always be useful bec ause many determinations whic h may be nec essary to the dec ision for purposes of _res judicata_ may not be susc eptible to c hallenge by appeal. In my judgment, the assessment of whic h side of the line an issue falls should be approac hed from a c ommonsensic al perspec tive, balanc ing between the important public interest in sec uring finality and in ensuring that the same issues are not repeatedly litigated on one hand, and on the other, the private interest in not forec losing a litigant from arguing an issue whic h, in substanc e, was not the c entral issue dec ided by a previous c ourt. In this regard, I find Lord Upjohn’s dic tum in _Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner & Keeler Ltd (No 2)_ [1967] 1 AC 853 (“ _Carl Zeiss_ ”) at 947 apposite: 

 All estoppels are not odious but must be applied so as to work justic e, and not injustic e and I think the princ iple of issue estoppel must be applied to the c irc umstanc es of the subsequent c ase with this overriding c onsideration in mind. 

38     It might be thought that a third idea that is enc ompassed within the requirement of an identity of issues is that the issue in question should be shown in fac t to have been raised and argued. At one level, this is no more than a logic al c orollary of the first two ideas I have referred to and indeed of the primary basis on whic h _res judicata_ operates. This was desc ribed in the following terms by Lord Maugham LC in the House of Lords dec ision in _New Brunswick Rly Co v British and French Trust Corpn Ltd_ [1939] AC 1 (“ _New Brunswick Rly Co_ ”), at 19-20: 

 [T]he doc trine of estoppel (per rem judic atam) is one founded on c onsiderations of justic e and good sense. If an issue has been distinctly raised and decided in an action, in which the parties are represented , it is unjust and unreasonable to permit the same issue to be litigated afresh between the same parties or persons c laiming under them. 


 (emphasis added) 

39     Plainly if an issue has in fac t been raised and dec ided in one set of proc eedings, then on the fac e of it, it would not be permissible to relitigate the same issue as between the same parties in a subsequent ac tion. But, where the issue in question has not in fac t been argued or submitted upon, it is less obvious that the polic y goals underlying the doc trine of _res judicata_ – the interest in the finality and c onc lusiveness of judic ial dec isions as well as the right of individuals to be protec ted from vexatious multiplic ation of suits and prosec utions (see _The Doctrine of Res Judicata_ at para 10) – are nec essarily attrac ted. This indeed is the c ontext in whic h the dic tum of Lord Maugham above should be c onstrued bec ause that was a c ase where a judgment in default of appearanc e had been entered against the appellants in an earlier ac tion and the question raised related to the effec t of suc h a judgment in the later ac tion. In that c ontext, Lord Maugham thought that in the c ase of a judgment in default of appearanc e the estoppel should be c onfined to defenc es whic h were “nec essarily, and with c omplete prec ision, dec ided by the previous judgment; in other words, by _res judicata_ in the ac c urate sense” (see _New Brunswick Rly Co_ at 21). In my judgment, this is authority for the proposition that in c ases where there has been no ac tual investigation of a point, issue estoppel in the stric t sense would only apply to those aspec ts of the earlier dec ision that were direc tly and prec isely to be dec ided by it. However, this c annot be taken too far. Thus, where a litigant raises a point but either c onc edes or fails to argue it, issue estoppel may still arise in respec t of the point c onc eded or not argued: _Khan v Golechha International Ltd_ [1980] 1 WLR 1482; _SCF Finance Co Ltd v Masri (No 3)_ [1987] QB 1028; _Linprint v Hexham Textiles_ (1991) 23 NSWLR 508 (“ _Linprint_ ”); _Hendrawan Setiadi v OCBC Securities Pte Ltd and Others_ <span class="citation">[2001] 4 SLR 503</span> (“ _Hendrawan Setiadi_ ”). 

40     Furthermore, in my judgment the question whether subsequent litigation is in fac t forec losed in the c irc umstanc es, would depend also on the applic ability of the defenc e of abuse of proc ess. In _Hendrawan Setiadi_ , Woo Bih Li JC (as he then was) c ited at [61] the following _dictum_ of Kirby P in the dec ision of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in _Linprint_ at 521 and went on to hold at [66] that an issue estoppel c ould arise even where there had been no dec ision on the merits: 

 Issue estoppel: a wider princ iple: 

 If, c ontrary to the foregoing c onc lusions, a proper interpretation of the proc eedings in the County Court of Vic toria is that there was no judic ial adjudic ation of the matters involved in the c ounterc laim by virtue of the withdrawal of the respondent, and therefore that res judicata does not apply, the same result nonetheless follows from the applic ation of the law of issue estoppel. The issues whic h the respondent now wishes to litigate in the Supreme Court of this State were either (a) nec essarily inherent in the issues raised by the c ounter-c laim and defenc e in the County Court of Vic toria or (b) so intimately c onnec ted with those issues that the Court would require that the party to the litigation should have pleaded them in suc h a way as to have them resolved in the Vic torian proc eedings. It would have been unreasonable not to have pleaded them in those proc eedings and, to the extent that they were not pleaded, they should not now be allowed to be pleaded again. 

41     In my judgment, the relevant princ iple is that where the issue has in fac t been direc tly c overed by the earlier dec ision, it will be c aught either by c ause of ac tion estoppel or issue estoppel. As one moves further away from what was direc tly c overed by the earlier dec ision, then the relevant doc trine bec omes the defenc e of abuse of proc ess rather than issue estoppel. Thus where the issue ought to have been raised and was not, it might nonetheless amount to an abuse of proc ess subsequently to litigate that same issue: see _Henderson v Henderson_ [1843-60] All ER Rep 378 (“ _Henderson_ ”) whic h was followed in _Hendrawan Setiadi_. Whether it does or does not in any given c ase will depend on a wider analysis whic h I deal with at [51] to [56] below. In my judgment, the 


following dic tum of Lord Shaw in the dec ision of the Privy Counc il in _Hoystead v Commissioner of Taxation_ [1926] AC 155 at 170 is to be seen in that light: 

 It is seen from this c itation of authority that if in any Court of c ompetent jurisdic tion a dec ision is reac hed, a party is estopped from questioning it in a new legal proc eeding. But the princ iple also extends to any point, whether of assumption or admission, whic h was in substanc e the ratio of and fundamental to the dec ision. The rule on this subjec t was set forth in the leading c ase of Henderson v Henderson by Wigram Vc. 

42     In fac t, it may be noted that _Henderson_ is widely regarded as the root of the defenc e of abuse of proc ess. Similarly, I c onsider that the following statement of Lord Wilberforc e in _Carl Zeiss_ ([37] _supra_ ) at 965 c an be rec onc iled with the statement of the relevant princ iple as I have set it out at [41] above: 

 Mr Spenc er Bower, in his work on Res Judicata states the princ iple as being “that the judic ial de c ision was, or involved, a determination of the same question as that sought to be c ontroverted in the litigation in whic h the estoppel is raised” ( Res Judicata , p. 9) – a formulation whic h invites the inquiry how what is “involved” in a dec ision is to be asc ertained. One way of answering this is to say that any determination is involved in a dec ision if it is a “nec essary step” to the dec ision or a “matter whic h it was nec essary to dec ide, and whic h was ac tually dec ided, as the groundwork of the dec ision” ( Reg. V Inhabitants of Hartington Middle Quarter Township [FN312]) and from this it follows that it is permissible to look not merely at the rec ord of the judgment relied on, but at the reasons for it, the pleadings, the evidenc e ( Brunsden v Humphrey [FN313] and if nec essary other material to show what was the issue dec ided ( Flitters v Allfrey [FN314]). The fac t that the pleadings and the evidenc e may be referred to, suggests that the task of the c ourt in the subsequent proc eeding must inc lude that of satisfying itself that the party against whom the estoppel is set up did ac tually raise the c ritic al issue, or possibly, though I do not think that this point has yet been dec ided, that he had a fair opportunity, or that he ought, to have raised it. 

43     Finally, the fac t that the issues dec ided in both the earlier and the later ac tions may be identic al may not always bar the sec ond round of litigation. The c ases rec ognise that in spec ial c irc umstanc es, it may be unjust to enforc e the stric t letter of the doc trine. The leading authority for this is the dec ision of the House of Lords in _Arnold v National Westminster Bank plc_ [1991] 2 AC 93 (“ _Arnold_ ”), where Lord Keith (with whom the other Law Lords c onc urred) held that issue estoppel at least was not absolute at 108 109: 

 But there is room for the view that the underlying princ iples upon whic h estoppel is based, public polic y and justic e, have greater forc e in c ause of ac tion estoppel, the subjec t matter of the two proc eedings being identic al, than they do in issue estoppel, where the subjec t matter is different. Onc e it is ac c epted that different c onsiderations apply to issue estoppel, it is hard to perc eive any logic al distinc tion between a point whic h was previously raised and dec ided and one whic h might have been but was not. Given that the further material whic h would have put an entirely different c omplexion on the point was at the earlier stage unknown to the party and c ould not by reasonable diligenc e have been disc overed by him, it is hard to see why there should be a different result ac c ording to whether he dec ided not to take the point, thinking it hopeless, or argue it faintly without any real hope of suc c ess. In my opinion your Lordships should affirm it to be the law that there may be an exc eption to issue estoppel in the spec ial c irc umstanc e that there has bec ome available to a party further material relevant to the c orrec t determination of a point involved in the earlier proc eedings, whether or not that point was spec ific ally raised and dec ided, being material whic h c ould not by reasonable diligenc e have been adduc ed in those 


 proc eedings. One of the purposes of estoppel being to work justic e between the parties, it is open to c ourts to rec ognise that in spec ial c irc umstanc es inflexible applic ation of it may have the opposite result. 

44     While Lord Keith’s dic ta is c apable of a broad and expansive reading, it should be noted that the dec isive fac tor in _Arnold_ was the fac t that there was an absenc e of an effec tive right of appeal from what the House of Lords thought was an erroneous dec ision by the c ourt of first instanc e in the earlier litigation: see _Arnold_ at 110-111. 

45     I turn to the c ase at hand in the light of the foregoing princ iples. The arguments relating to whether the issue dec ided in OS 618 and that raised in the present applic ation are identic al may be summarised as follows. Nellie c laims that the c entral question raised in OS 618 was not the right of eac h benefic iary to veto the sale of No. 61 (“the sale issue”) but the right of eac h benefic iary (partic ularly, Rosaline) to reside at No. 61 _until sale_ (“the residenc e issue”). Therefore, it is suggested that any aspec t of the dec ision of Phang JC, whic h purports to dec ide what the will says in respec t of the sale issue must be merely anc illary and not fundamental to the ultimate issue that was raised and dec ided ( _viz_ ., the residenc e issue). In addition, Nellie’s submission is that Phang JC did not dec ide – and c ould not have dec ided – the sale issue bec ause the question was not even raised to begin with. Any mention of the sale issue in the terms of the order that was made (see the italic ised words at [3] above) simply rec ites, without dec iding, the prayer for relief. Therefore, Nellie argues that the issue raised in this applic ation is not forec losed by the order made in OS 618. 

46     On the other hand, Rosaline’s position is that the issues in OS 618 and in the present applic ation are identic al. It is submitted on her behalf that in dec iding whether Rosaline had a right to reside at No. 61, Phang JC would have had to c onsider the testamentary intentions of Madam Loh, and given that the issue presented in this applic ation must also be dec ided in the light of Madam Loh’s testamentary intentions, the issues in the two sets of proc eedings are similar, if not identic al. Moreover, it is argued, a plain reading of the order made in OS 618 shows that Phang JC did dec ide on the proper c onstruc tion of paragraph 2(a) of the will, whic h is the prec ise provision that is also now in issue. 

47     In my judgment, the mere fac t that the order made by Phang JC appears to suggest that it extended to the sale issue is not dec isive: see the dec ision of the House of Lords in _Juan José de la Trinidad Concha v Manuel Antonio Concha_ (1886) 11 HL 541 where it was held that a dec ree expressing a finding as to domic ile did not forec lose a subsequent determination of this issue bec ause that finding was unnec essary to the dec ree. 

48     In the final analysis, the question whether OS 618 in fac t dec ided the sale issue, and therefore renders it _res judicata_ , depends on a variety of c onsiderations. It is c ertainly true, as Rosaline c ontends, that in order for Phang JC to have dec ided OS 618, it would have been nec essary to asc ertain Madam Loh’s intentions. Thus, in so far as the residenc e issue was dec ided on the basis that Rosaline (as well as any of the relevant benefic iaries for that matter) has the right to reside rent free at No. 61 for as long as she likes, it might be argued that this c arries with it, implic itly, a dec ision that Rosaline has the right to veto a sale sinc e otherwise the right of residenc e might be stripped of effec t. 

49     In my judgment, while that may yet be true on a proper c onstruc tion of the will, there is nothing to suggest it was so presented to or c ontemplated by Phang JC. The matter must be seen from the perspec tive of the hearing before Phang JC. In that c ontext, it is c lear that Rosaline’s position before me c onflates what c ould, in substanc e, be two quite different and separate issues. There is nothing inherent in a right of residenc e that requires that it must nec essarily extend to a 


right to veto the sale of the residenc e. One c ould have a right of residenc e _until sale_ whic h c ould, c onc eivably, c o-exist with a right to sell that residenc e at whic h point the right of residenc e would end. This bec omes c ritic al in the c ontext of c onsidering just what it was that Phang JC dec ided. If the only issue before him was as to Rosaline’s right to reside at No. 61 there being no c ontemplation at all at that time that the property might be sold, then the possibility of a dic hotomy between the right of residenc e and the right to veto the sale bec omes relevant. In short, the fac t that the benefic iaries have a right to reside at No. 61 tells one nothing nec essarily about the right, if any, of the benefic iaries to veto the sale of No. 61. In the language of Starke J in _Blair v Curran_ at [35] above, any determination on the sale issue c annot be said to have been so c ardinal to the residenc e issue that without the former, the latter c annot stand. 

50     In this light, it bec omes a point of fundamental importanc e that that there was no argument before Phang JC as to the c onstruc tion of the will in relation to the sale issue. In that sense, I do not c onsider that the issue is c overed by the dec ision of Phang JC and it c annot then be said that the issue before me traversed the same ground as was c anvassed before Phang JC. The public interest in deterring or avoiding re-litigation of similar or identic al issues between the same parties is therefore not underc ut. Ac c ordingly in my judgment, there is no identity of subjec t matter and therefore no issue estoppel in relation to the sale issue arises out of Phang JC’s order in OS 618. 

**_Abuse of process_** 

51     I turn to c onsider briefly the applic ability of the abuse of proc ess doc trine. In _Henderson_ ([41] _supra_ ), it was noted by Wigram VC as follows at [381 – 382]: 

 Where a given matter bec omes the subjec t of litigation in, and of adjudic ation by, a c ourt of c ompetent jurisdic tion, the c ourt requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole c ase, and will not (exc ept under spec ial c irc umstanc es) permit the same parties to open the same subjec t of litigation in respec t of matter whic h might have been brought forward as part of the subjec t in c ontest, but whic h was not brought forward, only bec ause they have, from negligenc e, inadvertenc e, or even ac c ident, omitted part of their c ase. The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at that time. 

 (emphasis added) 

52     This is often regarded as the root of the doc trine of abuse of proc ess but it has sinc e been restated. In _Hunter_ ([20] _supra_ ), the failure to bring forward matters whic h “belonged to the subjec t of litigation” in the previous c ourt was not seen as the only basis on whic h an argument of abuse of proc ess c ould be grounded. Abuse of proc ess was found in the fac t that the later proc eedings were c onsidered in substanc e merely to be a c ollateral attac k on the previous dec ision. The modern restatement of the doc trine is to be found in the dec ision of the House of Lords in _Johnson_ ([19] _supra_ ), where the respondent argued that the appellant ought not be allowed to bring a c laim (for negligenc e and breac h of duty) in his own name and for his own benefit; and that any suc h c laim ought to have been brought in an earlier ac tion by one of the appellant’s businesses against the respondent. To allow the appellant’s c ase to proc eed, the respondent submitted, would amount to an abuse of proc ess bec ause the appellant was mounting a c ollateral attac k on the outc ome of the earlier proc eedings, whic h had been settled by the respondent without admission of liability. The House held in favour of the appellant, and in so doing, rec ast the law on abuse of proc ess. The following dic tum of Lord Bingham of Cornhill at 31 is instruc tive: 


 But Henderson v Henderson abuse of proc ess, as now understood, although separate and distinc t from c ause of ac tion estoppel and issue estoppel, has muc h in c ommon with them. The underlying public interest is the same: that there should be finality in litigation and that a party should not be twic e vexed in the same matter. This public interest is reinforc ed by the c urrent emphasis on effic ienc y and ec onomy in the c onduc t of litigation, in the interests of the parties and the public as a whole. The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defence in later proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse) that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all. I would not accept that it is necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional element such as a collateral attack on a previous decision or some dishonesty, but where those elements are present the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive, and there will rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as unjust harassment of a party. It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion be a broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before. As one cannot comprehensively list all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether, on given facts, abuse is to be found or not. Thus while I would ac c ept that lac k of funds would not ordinarily exc use a failure to raise in earlier proc eedings an issue whic h c ould and should have been raised then, I would not regard it as nec essarily irrelevant, partic ularly if it appears that the lac k of funds has been c aused by the party against whom it is sought to c laim. While the result may often be the same, it is in my view preferable to ask whether in all the circumstances a party's conduct is an abuse than to ask whether the conduct is an abuse and then, if it is, to ask whether the abuse is excused or justified by special circumstances. Properly applied, and whatever the legitimac y of its desc ent, the rule has in my view a valuable part to play in protec ting the interests of justic e. 

 (emphasis added) 

53     This has been followed in our jurisprudenc e by Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in _Kwa Ban Cheong_ ([24] _supra_ ) at [25] to [33] as well as by the Court of Appeal in _Lai Swee Lin Linda v AG_ ([19] _supra_ ). To put it shortly, a c ourt should determine whether there is an abuse of proc ess by looking at all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, inc luding whether the later proc eedings in substanc e is nothing more than a c ollateral attac k upon the previous dec ision; whether there is fresh evidenc e that might warrant re-litigation; whether there are _bona fide_ reasons why an issue that ought to have been raised in the earlier ac tion was not; and whether there are some other spec ial c irc umstanc es that might justify allowing the c ase to proc eed. The absenc e or existenc e of these enumerated fac tors (whic h are not intended to be exhaustive) is not dec isive. In determining whether the ambient c irc umstanc es of the c ase give rise to an abuse of proc ess, the c ourt should not adopt an inflexible or unyielding attitude but should remain guided by the balanc e to be found in the tension between the demands of ensuring that a litigant who has a genuine c laim is allowed to press his c ase in c ourt and rec ognising that there is a point beyond whic h repeated litigation would be unduly oppressive to the defendant. In the c ontext of c ases suc h as the present, the inquiry is direc ted not at the theoretic al possibility that the issue raised in the later proc eedings c ould c onc eivably have been taken in the earlier, but rather at whether having regard to the substanc e and reality of the earlier ac tion, it reasonably ought to have been. In my judgment, the answer to that in the present c ase is plainly no. 

54     Rosaline’s argument in the present applic ation is that even if it is found that the sale issue 


was not dec ided by Phang JC in OS 618, and therefore issue estoppel does not stric tly arise, the doc trine of abuse of proc ess applies. But it is not c lear on what basis that c an be c orrec t on the fac ts of this c ase. To begin with, any argument that the present applic ation is in reality a c ollateral attac k on Phang JC’s order in OS 618 would be without merit. As I have stated at [47 50] above, the sale issue and the residenc e issue are c onc eptually two separate and distinc t points and were not seen in any other way by Phang JC. 

55     In my judgment, it would be equally implausible (and for the same reasons) to maintain that the sale issue was properly within the “subjec t of litigation” of OS 618 and ought to have been brought forward earlier. It is useful here to refer to the c ase of _Lee Hiok Tng_ ([19] _supra_ ). In that c ase, an earlier ac tion had been brought to dec ide, _inter alia_ , to whom c ertain lots of shares belonged. In a subsequent ac tion brought by the appellant in relation to one lot of the shares in order to determine whether it had been given to him as a gift, one of the questions that the Court of Appeal had to dec ide was whether the appellant was prec luded from bringing the ac tion bec ause his c laim ought to have been raised earlier as it fell within the “subjec t of litigation” of the earlier ac tion. The c ourt held that there was no abuse of proc ess in the appellant instituting the sec ond c ause of ac tion bec ause the question as to whether that one lot of shares were transferred to him as a gift c ould only be dec ided after it had been determined to whom the shares belonged in the first plac e. Indeed, the c ourt stated that to have raised the gift question earlier would not have fac ilitated the orderly disposal of the earlier ac tion and would in fac t, have been premature. In my judgment, although the fac ts are different, the princ iple is the same. Where there are two distinc t issues, it does not nec essarily follow that both should be required to have been raised in the same proc eedings. This is all the more so in the present c ase given that the only live issue before Phang JC was the residenc e issue. It was therefore not at all unreasonable for Nellie or the other defendants in OS 618 not to have addressed the sale issue before Phang JC. 

56     Ac c ordingly, in my judgment, the bringing of the present applic ation does not amount to an abuse of proc ess notwithstanding the order made in OS 618. Nellie is therefore not prec luded from pursuing this matter. 

**The Construction of the Will** 

57     It remains for me to c onsider whether there is an express prohibition against the sale of No. 61 so as to exc lude the exerc ise of any disc retion on my part under to s 56(1) of the Ac t. 

**_General principles of construction_** 

58     The princ iples governing the proper c onstruc tion of a will are many: see generally, _C H Sherrin_ et al eds, _Williams on Wills_ (London: Butterworths, 8 ed, 2002) (“ _Williams_ ”) at c hapter 50; 

Clive V Margrave-Jones ed., _Mellows: The Law of Succession_ (London: Butterworths, 5th ed, 1993) (“ _Mellows_ ”) at c hapter 10. For the purposes of the present applic ation, the following princ iples may be noted. 

59     First, the overriding aim of any c ourt c onstruing a will is to seek and give effec t to the testamentary intention as expressed in the words employed by the testator: see _Williams_ at para 50.1. The c ourt’s func tion is not to rewrite the will or to seek to “improve upon or perfec t testamentary dispositions”: _Re Bailey_ [1951] Ch 407 at 421. 

60     Sec ond, the general rule for asc ertaining the meaning of the words used is to read the will as a whole without regard to partic ular c anons of c onstruc tion. The following passage from _Williams_ at paragraph 50.2 (omitting c itations) provides a c onc ise summary: 


 General rule for ascertaining the meaning of words. For the purpose of asc ertaining the intention, the will is read in the first plac e without referenc e or regard to the c onsequenc es of any rule of law or c anon of c onstruc tion. Words are given the meaning whic h is rendered nec essary by the c ontext of the whole will, the partic ular passage being taken together with whatever is relevant in the rest of the will to explain it. Where the c ourt finds on the fac e of the will a c lear, general or paramount intention to whic h effec t c an be given, and a partic ular or subordinate intention to whic h, by reason of some rule of law, the c ourt c annot wholly or partially give effec t, or whic h is inc onsistent with or does not c arry out all the intentions whic h the testator has or is presumed to have, then the partic ular intention must be rejec ted or modified, and the general intention of the testator c arried into effec t ... 

 The will itself is taken as the dic tionary from whic h the meaning of the words is asc ertained, however inac c urate suc h meaning would be in ordinary or legal use. The only qualific ation on the applic ation of this general princ iple is that a c lear c ontext is required in order to exc lude the usual meaning of a word. 

61     Third, bec ause a c ourt is to c onstrue the will as a whole and is not to adopt a c lause-bound view of eac h part of the will (see _Mellows_ at para 10.13; _Leo Teng Choy_ at [25 26]), a c ourt should pay partic ular attention to two things. One is the overall arc hitec ture of the will, meaning the struc tural plac ement of c ertain words and phrases. If c ertain c lauses are found in one area of the will but not another, this c annot readily be dismissed as being without signific anc e, unless the c ontext indic ates otherwise. The sec ond point is that the intratextual use of words, phrases and language is often important. A c ourt should c ompare and c ontrast identic al words used in different parts of the will so as to eluc idate the most c omplete meaning or intention that should be asc ribed to the words used. 

62     Finally, there is a presumption that effec t should be given to every word: _Re Sanford, Sanford v Sanford_ [1901] 1 Ch 939. A c ourt should not disregard parts of the will as long as some meaning c an be asc ribed to it and that meaning is not c ontrary to some intention plainly expressed in other parts of the will: _Williams_ at para 50.15. A testator, in other words, does not will in vain. 

**Application of principles to the facts** 

63     In submitting that paragraph 2(a) of the will (see [2] above) does not expressly prohibit the sale of No. 61 without the c onsent in writing of all the benefic iaries, Nellie makes the following arguments: 

 (a) If the will was c onstrued to allow eac h benefic iary a veto, it would mean that No. 59 may or would have to be sold even if that did not make c ommerc ial sense; 

 (b) Even if No. 59 was sold, there would have to be some nec essary adjustment in relation to the payment of debts and expenses so that they are not taken solely from the shares of the benefic iaries to No. 59. This arises from the referenc e in the opening words of paragraph 2 of the will to suc h debts and expenses being paid. It is argued on this basis, that it might entail the possibility of the benefic iaries to No. 59 paying for suc h expenses and debts without being able to realise their shares in No. 61; 

 (c ) The sale of No. 59 might not be suffic ient to meet the expenses of the estate; and 

 (d) the benefic iaries to No. 59 and No. 61 are not all the same. In partic ular, Madam Loh’s daughter-in-law (“Djau Ai”) is entitled to three units in No. 59 but has no share in No. 61. If 


 No. 61 was subjec t to a veto, Djau Ai would be put in a better position than some of Madam Loh’s sons and daughters who may not be able to realise their asset in No. 61, whereas Djau Ai would be able to sell No. 59 with c onsiderably less diffic ulty. 

64     These arguments are not unreasonable and perhaps if they had been put before Madam Loh, she might have struc tured her will differently. But this c ourt is not empowered to re-write the will of the testatrix even if it c onsidered the intended dispositions unwise or ill-advised. Subjec t to law, it is the right of the testator alone to determine the destiny of his property on his death: _Mellows_ at para 10.11. To that extent, Nellie’s c ontentions are ultimately unpersuasive: the c onc lusion that is urged on her behalf rests upon a premise that has been assumed, namely that Madam Loh did not intend to draw a distinc tion between the two properties. For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that Madam Loh did intend – and c learly did express – that No. 61 was to be dealt with differently from No. 59. 

65     The first indic ation that Madam Loh did not intend the same rules to apply in respec t of No. 59 and No. 61 is the paragraph found after the benefic iaries named in paragraph 2(a) of the will and whic h was appended only in relation to No. 61. It states: 

 My above stated residential premises shall be used as a residence by my c hildren abovenamed and shall not be sold without the consent in writing of the abovenamed 11 beneficiaries and that until c ompletion of the sale thereof my trustee shall permit my c hildren abovenamed or any one of them to oc c upy the same rent free so long as he or she shall desire. (emphasis added) 

66     If Madam Loh had desired that both properties be devised in the same manner, one would have expec ted the same c lause to be appended in relation to both properties or to neither. Therefore, the very struc ture of the will suggests that a distinc tion is to be drawn between No. 59 and No. 61. As I said to Mr Maniam in argument, the testatrix appeared to have had some definite reasons for inc luding this paragraph in relation to one of the properties but not to the other, and it seemed to me wrong to c onstrue the will so as to give no effec t at all to this paragraph. Yet this would be the effec t of ac c epting the c onstruc tion of the will that was urged upon me on Nellie’s behalf. 

67     The sec ond indic ation lies in the attention given to the language used in desc ribing the two properties whic h suggests a differenc e in Madam Loh’s attitudes towards them. In respec t of No. 61, Madam Loh employed the phrase “my residential premises”. In referring to No. 59, she c alled it “the irremovable property”. One inferenc e from this is that Madam Loh regarded the two properties as possessing distinc t purposes and, as a c orollary, willed them differently. In line with this, one would not be surprised if No. 61 was willed to the benefic iaries in question at least in part to assure eac h of them shelter and residenc e. 

68     It is also signific ant that the words used indic ate that “any one” of the benefic iaries may stay rent-free suggesting that Madam Loh intended to give an overriding right to eac h benefic iary to reside in the premises. It c ould not have eluded her that this might c reate c onflic t among the benefic iaries. The right to reside was therefore fundamental to how she intended to dispose of No. 

61\. This ties in with what I have stated at [67] above. 

69     This is further amplified by the explic it provision in paragraph 2(a) that the “written c onsent of the abovenamed 11 benefic iaries” is nec essary in order to effec t a sale of No. 61. The natural meaning of this is that eac h benefic iary is to have a veto over the sale. To hold otherwise would be to violate the presumption that eac h word in a will must be given meaning and effec t. This interpretation would also be c onsistent with – and would in fac t promote – the overriding intention of 


Madam Loh to provide the sec urity of _residence_ at No. 61 to eac h of the named benefic iaries as I have noted at [65] to [68] above. If it was true that no right to veto the sale existed in respec t of No. 61, that would effec tively put the position of the benefic iaries to No. 59 and No. 61 on the same footing in respec t of the right to sell eac h of these properties. That is wholly inc onsistent with the linguistic differenc es apparent in the way Madam Loh willed these properties. It would also c onsiderably weaken the forc e and effec t of the right of residenc e. 

70     In my judgment, all of these fac tors take this will outside the ambit of the dec ision in _Leo Teng Choy_ , on whic h Nellie relies. In that c ase, the Court of Appeal held that even though there was a c lause in the testator’s will to the effec t that the property in question “shall not be sold, rented out or in any way c onverted into c ash unless and until unanimously agreed upon by my said sons”, the intention of the testator, as c onstrued from the entire will, was not to prohibit the sale of the property but to ensure an equitable distribution of the proc eeds if it was sold. Ac c ordingly, the c ourt had the power to sanc tion the sale of the property under s 56(1) of the Ac t. In the present c ase, the overriding intention of the testatrix, in my judgment, was not to grant the equal right of eac h benefic iary to the proc eeds of sale _per se_ ; but rather, to ensure that eac h benefic iary to No. 61 would have the right to reside there if they needed or wanted to. 

71     In any event, a partic ular c onstruc tion given to a partic ular will has no binding effec t even if the will in question appears to be worded similarly. A c ourt must approac h the c onstruc tion and interpretation of eac h will afresh. In the present c ase, it is not so muc h the similarities but the dissimilarities with _Leo Teng Choy_ that are signific ant in my view. 

72     The prac tic al c onsequenc es of my c onstruc tion of the will are not entirely free from fuss, but they are by no means impossible. Nellie c laims, there is a need to raise funds to meet c ertain expenses and debts. It was suggested that having rec ourse to selling units at No. 59 for this purpose might visit the burden of these expenses unfairly on one set of benefic iaries. Whether that is so or not depends on a separate issue of c onstruc tion of the will whic h was not argued before me and whic h I do not rule on. But even if it were, there is nothing to say it was not open to Madam Loh to so provide if she wished. 

73     As to the other arguments at [63a and 63d] above, assuming these c ontentions were c orrec t, they too rest on the same premise that is fatally flawed: namely that it was not open to Madam Loh to so provide if she wished. That is c learly wrong. Further, it assumes that the entitlement to the proc eeds of sale of the properties was the ultimate prize that Madam Loh intended to bestow on her c hildren. This also is not so in my judgment. It is evident at least in relation to No. 61, that Madam Loh viewed the sec urity of having a house to reside in as being the c ritic al provision she wished to make for the benefic iaries in question, rather than giving some of them the right to ac c ess the proc eeds of its sale over the objec tions of others. 

74     In the final analysis, I am left with the impression that Madam Loh, was a well-intentioned mother who, above all, wanted to guarantee her c hildren a plac e to reside in. She took muc h c are to express her intentions in her will. In my judgment, her intentions in relation to No. 59 and No. 61 were not identic al. She did intend that No. 61 should not be sold as long as any of the benefic iaries wished to use it as a residenc e. In the present c irc umstanc es, it was not argued and also was not nec essary for me to dec ide whether the position would be different if none of the benefic iaries in fac t wished to use the premises as a residenc e. I therefore do not dec ide this point. However, as long as any of the benefic iaries are using and do wish to use the premises as a residenc e, I do not c onsider the c ourt has power under s 56(1) of the Ac t to authorise the sale of the property. 

**Conclusion** 


75     In the premises, it is not nec essary to proc eed further to dec ide whether the reasons c ited by Nellie for selling No. 61 are valid or not. The applic ation for this c ourt to sanc tion the sale of No. 61 is denied. I will hear the parties on c osts.
