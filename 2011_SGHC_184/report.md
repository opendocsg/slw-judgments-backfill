**Introduction** 

1       In the present applic ation to strike out the Plaintiff’s statement of c laim, or part thereof, two separate issues of law were presented for the c ourt’s determination. First, what is the nature and effec t of c onsent orders and did a prior c onsent order entered into between the parties prec lude the Plaintiff’s ac tion in the present suit? Sec ondly, did the effec t of sec tion 51(10) of the Housing and Development Ac t (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed) (“HDA”) extend so far as to prec lude the bringing of a proprietary estoppel c laim involving a Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat? Although these issues appear novel at first sight, the answers were, in truth, not far to find onc e the princ iples already espoused in the relevant areas of law were properly c onsidered. To this task I now turn my attention. 

**The background to the application** 

**_(i) the factual background_** 

2       The Plaintiff and the Defendant are c ousins. Their dispute arose following the demise of their c ommon grandmother, Tan Ah Kng (“the Dec eased”), and revolved around a flat situated at Bloc k 306, Hougang Avenue 5, #02-355 Singapore 530306 (the “Flat”) that she left behind. This was a flat sold by the HDB and whic h was subjec t to the provisions of the HDA. While the Defendant did not nec essarily agree with everything stated in the Plaintiff’s statement of c laim and his subsequent affidavit, it was only nec essary, for the purposes of the present applic ation, to c onsider the Plaintiff’s version of the fac ts. 

3       A note, before we c ontinue, about the pleadings. I am not given to be partic ularly partic ular about partic ulars. However, it would not be inac c urate to desc ribe the statement of c laim filed by the Plaintiff as inadequately bare. In it, he set out the relationship between the main protagonists, the 


gist of the main fac ts as well as the breakdown for his c laim of S$18,350.50. Unfortunately, muc h of the relevant, and indeed c ruc ial, fac ts were not properly pleaded. While brevity in pleadings is a virtue that should be enc ouraged, the austerity of the Plaintiff’s statement of c laim in this c ase meant that it was impossible to disc ern what the legal basis for his c laim was. Indeed, it almost appeared that the Plaintiff himself was unc lear as to his legal c laim, merely that he had disparate grievanc es that required airing. It was not until the Plaintiff filed a subsequent affidavit, for the purposes of this applic ation, that muc h of his c ase c ould be understood. It is mostly on the basis of the subsequent affidavit that most of the following fac ts are rec ounted. 

4       Insofar as I was able to disc ern, the Flat was purc hased around 1983. At the time of the purc hase, the Dec eased was the sole owner of the Flat but at some unknown subsequent point in time, one of her daughters, Low Eng Cheng (“the Aunt”), was added as an owner suc h that the Flat was owed in joint tenanc y between the two of them. Be that as it may, it was the Plaintiff and his immediate family who had use of the Flat as their family home for many years. This c ertainly was the c ase from the time the Plaintiff was born (in 1984) until 2003. In that latter year, for reasons undisc losed, most of the Plaintiff’s family moved out of the Flat, save for one of the Plaintiff’s brother and the Plaintiff himself. About two years later, in 2005, the Dec eased and the Aunt also made the Flat their residenc e. The year after, the Plaintiff’s brother moved out. This, of c ourse, left the Dec eased, the Aunt and the Plaintiff as the remaining oc c upants of the Flat. 

5       The Plaintiff averred that almost immediately after his brother had left the Flat, the Plaintiff had to look after both the Dec eased and the Aunt as they were in poor physic al health. The Aunt was diagnosed with ovarian c anc er while the Dec eased, towards the end of her life, c ontrac ted tuberc ulosis. The responsibility for c aring for the infirm fell to the Plaintiff who, I am told, fulfilled his familial obligations selflessly. Despite the Plaintiff’s efforts, both the Aunt and the Dec eased eventually suc c umbed to their illnesses and passed away in 2007 and 2008, respec tively. Both of them died intestate. 

6       On 28 April 2009, the Defendant was granted letters of administration in respec t of the Dec eased’s estate. The only asset whic h had to be distributed was the Flat (whic h the Dec eased owned wholly following the earlier death of the Aunt). Pursuant to the Intestate Suc c ession Ac t (Cap 146, 1985 Rev Ed), the benefic iaries of the estate were the five surviving c hildren of the Dec eased; the Plaintiff was therefore not a benefic iary of the estate. The Defendant then took the view that the Plaintiff was, whilst the Dec eased was alive, a free lodger and, now, an illegal oc c upier of the Flat. Ac c ordingly, in what he regarded was his lawful duty as the administrator of the Dec eased’s estate, the Defendant endeavoured to remove the Plaintiff from the Flat. In suc c ession, the Defendant orally informed the Plaintiff to vac ate the Flat, c alled a loc ksmith to pic k the loc k of the Flat and instruc ted solic itors to issue a letter of demand to the Plaintiff. 

**_(ii) the legal background_** 

7       Finally, given the Plaintiff’s lac k of response to his entreaties, the Defendant c ommenc ed Originating Summons No. 213 of 2009 (the “Order 81 Applic ation”). In that applic ation, the Defendant sued, pursuant to Order 81 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), for immediate possession of the Flat as well as c osts for the legal proc eedings. Thereafter, but prior to the hearing of the Order 81 Applic ation, attempts at an amic able settlement were made, the details of whic h would turn out to be signific ant for the present applic ation. 

8       The olive branc h was first extended by the Defendant even though he was also the one who c ommenc ed the Order 81 Applic ation. On 13 July 2009, his c ounsel wrote to the Plaintiff’s c ounsel in the following terms: 


## 2.

 b. 

 c. 

## 2. 

## 1.

## 3.

## 3. 

 The [Defendant] offers to settle this OS [the Order 81 Applic ation] as follows: 

 That the [Plaintiff ] does agree to vac ate the HDB flat in question within a date no later than 31 July 2009; 

 In return, the [Defendant] will not ask for the c osts of the OS and the Plaintiff will agree to abandon the c laims arising from trespass and unlawful oc c upation; 

 This agreement to be rec orded in a c onsent order within on or before 24 July 2009. 

9       To that offer c ounsel for the Plaintiff responded on 17 July 2009 in a somewhat equivoc al fashion: 

 We write to c onfirm that our c lient will ac c ept the offer as set out in your Fax, without prejudic e to any c laims that he may have against the estate, partic ularly in respec t of any moneys expended and/or ownership. 

10     In the following fax, on 21 July 2009, c ounsel for the Defendant set out the Defendant’s view that the Plaintiff had made a c ounteroffer: 

 We refer to your fax dated 17 July 2009 ac c epting our c lient’s offer to settle this OS. Tec hnic ally, the fax c ontains a c ounter offer in paragraph 2 after the first c omma. That portion is not part of any settlement whic h the [Defendant] agrees to and will have to be left to be resolved under the general law, if applic able. 

 We enc lose the draft Order for your referenc e. This doc ument will also be served on you by EFS. 

 We will attend before the Distric t Judge on Friday to rec ord the settlement before extrac ting the Order. Please let us know if you wish for us to mention on your behalf. 

Signific antly, the terms of the draft order enc losed with the foregoing fax were similar to those of the c onsent order eventually entered into: see [12], below. The terms, in short, were that the Plaintiff vac ates the Flat and the Defendant abandons any c laim for trespass and unlawful oc c upation as well as c osts. 

11     This c hain of c orrespondenc e finally c onc luded with c ounsel for the Plaintiff writing to the Defendant’s c ounsel on 22 July 2009 in the following manner: 

 We refer to your fax of 21 July 2009, rec eived by us at 9.00pm (the “Fax”). 

 We ac knowledge the c ontents of the Fax. Rather than making a c ounter-offer, we were merely reiterating that the ac c eptanc e of your c lient’s offer was not be deemed an abandonment of any c laims that he may have against the Estate. 

 We enc lose herewith the amended draft c onsent order, duly approved by us for your nec essary ac tion. As the amendments are extensive, we have redrafted and approved the same. We trust you will have no objec tions to this. 

The draft was essentially amended for organisation and to c omply with the standard form for Orders of Court. The substantive terms of the order remained unaltered.

12     Indeed, the form and substanc e of the amended draft prepared by the Plaintiff’s c ounsel reflec ted the ac tual one eventually entered into before Deputy Registrar Julian Chin on 24 July 2009. The learned Deputy Registrar rec orded the terms as follows: 

 the [Defendant] be given immediate possession of the [Flat]; 

 the [Plaintiff] shall deliver vac ant possession of the Flat to the [Defendant] by 31 July 2009; 

 provided the [Plaintiff ] vac ates the Flat by 31 July 2009, the estate of Tan Ah Kng (“the Estate”) shall agree to abandon any c laims by the Estate against the [Plaintiff ] arising from the [Plaintiff’s] oc c upation of the Flat in respec t of trespass and unlawful oc c upation; and 

 that there be no order as to c osts. 

Thereafter, the Flat was duly delivered to the Defendant, sold and the proc eeds thereof distributed. 

13     Subsequently, the Plaintiff c ommenc ed the present suit to rec over, as I have mentioned, a total of S$18,350.50 or, alternatively, damages to be assessed. Ac c ording to the statement of c laim, the c laim was for “the monies expended in taking c are of [the Dec eased] during her lifetime” and that “[t]he Plaintiff’s c laim against the Defendant arose when the Dec eased passed away and the Defendant gave notic e to the Plaintiff to evic t out of the flat...” The c laim of S$18,350.50 was obtained by totalling various household expenses, inc luding expenses for power servic es, telec ommunic ation servic es, transport and town c ounc il c harges whic h the Plaintiff had paid for. Dissatisfied with the ac tion, the Defendant took out the present applic ation to strike out the statement of c laim, in whole or in part, pursuant to Order 18, rule 19(1)(a), (b) and (d) of the ROC. 

**The parties’ submissions** 

**_(i) the Plaintiff’s case_** 

14     As alluded to earlier, the affidavit that the Plaintiff filed for the purposes of the present applic ation c leared up muc h of the fac tual ambiguity c reated by the statement of c laim. However, the legal basis of the Plaintiff’s c laim was still unc lear. To further c omplic ate matters, at different points in his affidavit, the Plaintiff made oblique referenc es to lic enses, proprietary estoppel and c onstruc tive trust without stating explic itly whic h ground he was seriously pursuing or if he was relying on all of them. Even in the written submissions tendered before me, it was maintained that the “c auses of ac tion against the Defendant lie in estoppel and c onstruc tive trust.” However, before me, c ounsel for t he Plaintiff c onfirmed that the Plaintiff’s c ase was one of proprietary estoppel on the basis of the following fac ts: 

 The Dec eased had, on various oc c asions prior to her demise, promised that the Flat should not be sold, that the Plaintiff c ould live in the Flat for as long as he wanted and that he c ould use the Flat as his family home. Suc h promises were made not just in the presenc e of the Plaintiff but also in the presenc e of other family members. 


 ii. 

 iii. 

 In relianc e of those promises, the Plaintiff ac ted to his detriment. For instanc e, he took c are of the Dec eased by paying for the household and medic al expenses. He also gave up a relatively rewarding c areer as a financ ial planner to work from home as a tutor so as to take better c are of the Dec eased. Furthermore, the Plaintiff exposed himself to danger by living in c lose proximity with the Dec eased who had tuberc ulosis and had to undergo the ordeal of medic al examinations to asc ertain that he, himself, had not c ontrac ted the disease. 

 As a result, of the foregoing, an equity had been raised. However, the Plaintiff did not seek a trust over any interest in the Flat to satisfy that equity. Instead, the Plaintiff sought to be c ompensated by damages for the outlay he had already inc urred in relianc e of the Dec eased’s promises. In short, the Plaintiff had paid for various household and medic al expenses in relianc e of the representation that he would be allowed to stay in the Flat for as long as he desired. The promise not having been kept, he sought to be put bac k into the same position he would have been in had he not relied on those promises. 

**_(ii) the Defendant’s submissions_** 

15     Counsel for the Defendant essentially presented two arguments, one revolving around the Order 81 Applic ation and the other around the HDA. 

16     First, c ounsel for the Defendant argued that the Plaintiff was estopped from raising his c laim. This was bec ause the issue as to whether the Plaintiff was entitled to any interest in the Flat was first brought before the c ourts in the Order 81 Applic ation. In an affidavit to support that applic ation, the Defendant had alleged that the Plaintiff was an illegal oc c upier of the Flat. The natural import of suc h an allegation was that the Plaintiff had no c laim to or interest in the Flat. If the Plaintiff thought otherwise, he should have c hallenged the Defendant’s Order 81 Applic ation. Instead, the Plaintiff c hose to enter into a c onsent judgment and give up possession of the Flat. By so doing, the Plaintiff had, in fac t, _agreed_ with the Defendant’s allegations as set out in the supporting affidavit and should not now be allowed to re-open the issue. 

17     The other distinc t argument made by the Defendant’s c ounsel was that the Plaintiff was prec luded from bringing his c laim by virtue of sec tion 51(10) of the HDA, whic h reads as follows: 

 No person shall bec ome entitled to any protec ted property (or any interest in suc h property) under any resulting trust or c onstruc tive trust whensoever c reated or arising. 

It was not disputed between the parties that the Plaintiff was ineligible to own the Flat as he, being unmarried and without a family nuc leus, did not satisfy the HDB’s Eligibility Rules. However, given how the Plaintiff’s pleadings were initially unc lear and how the Plaintiff’s c ounsel had subsequently c larified that the c laim was based on proprietary estoppel and not c onstruc tive trust, I asked c ounsel for the Defendant if he was still pursuing this argument. He answered in the affirmative. His view was that the Plaintiff’s c laim, if suc c essful raised, nec essarily raised an equitable interest in the Flat. While it may be that the Plaintiff was presently seeking only liquidated damages and not an interest in the Flat, this prayer was in lieu of, and therefore based on, an equitable interest. By his rec koning, all equitable interests in a HDB flat raised in favour of an ineligible person are prohibited. As suc h, the Plaintiff’s c laim was doomed to failure and should be struc k out for that reason. 

**_(iii) the Plaintiff’s reply_** 

18     The Plaintiff’s response to the Defendant’s arguments was relatively straightforward. 


19     Addressing the Defendant’s argument on issue estoppel, c ounsel for the Plaintiff pointed out that in the c orrespondenc e leading up to the making of the c onsent judgment, the Plaintiff had emphasised that that he was preserving his rights to any c laim he may have against the Defendant, inc luding the present one he was making. In effec t, all that he was c onsenting to in the Order 81 Applic ation was to vac ate and give up possession of the Flat. This was reflec ted by the c irc umstanc es in whic h the c onsent order was entered into as well as the very terms in the eventual order made: see [12], above. The Plaintiff was therefore not estopped from pursuing the present c laim. 

20     Where the issue involving the HDA was c onc erned, the Plaintiff’s c ounsel made c lear that the Plaint iff’s c ase, in no way, involved a c onstruc tive trust. It was, as stated earlier, grounded in proprietary estoppel. If the c laim was suc c essful, no interest in the Flat need arise as the Plaintiff was seeking for equitable c ompensation. This was different from a c laim seeking an equitable proprietary interest in the Flat. The c ourt, it was submitted, may satisfy an equity raised by a c laim of proprietary estoppel in a number of ways, inc luding by dec laring a trust over the Plaintiff’s interest or by awarding equitable c ompensation. The latter remedy was independent of the former. As suc h, the Plaintiff’s c laim was not prec luded by sec tion 51(10) of the HDA whic h only prohibited an ineligible person from being entitled to a HDB flat by way of a c onstruc tive or resulting trust. 

**The decision of the court** 

21     The Defendant’s present applic ation was made pursuant to Order 18, rule 19(1)(a), (b) and (d) of the ROC, reproduc ed below: 

 19-(1 ) The Court may at any stage of the proc eedings order to be struc k out or amended any pleading or endorsement of any writ in the ac tion, or anything in the pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that – 

 (a) it disc loses no reasonable c ause of ac tion or defenc e, as the c ase may be; 

 (b) it is sc andalous, frivolous or vexation; 

 (d) it is otherwise an abuse of the proc ess of the Court, 

 and may order the ac tion to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered ac c ordingly, as the c ase may be. 

22     The standard whic h must be satisfied before pleadings c an be struc k out was c learly set out in the Court of Appeal c ase of _Gabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and oths_ , [1997] SLR(R) 649, whic h reads, _inter alia_ : 

 18 In general, it is only in plain and obvious c ases that the power of striking out should be invoked. This was the view taken by Lindley MR in Hubbuck & Sons v Wilkinson, Heywood and Clark [1899] 1 QB 86 at p 91. It should not be exerc ised by a minute and protrac ted examination of the doc uments and fac ts of the c ase in order to see if the Plaintiff really has a c ase of ac tion. The prac tic e of the c ourts has been that, where an applic ation for striking out involves a lengthy and serious argument, the c ourt should dec line to proc eed with the argument unless, not only does it have doubts as to the soundness of the pleading, but in addition, it is satisfied that striking out will obviate the nec essity for a trial or reduc e the burden of preparing for a trial. 

In _Tan Eng Khiam v Ultra Realty Pte Ltd_ [1991] 1 SLR(R) 844, G P Selvam JC explained the c ourt’s 


 i. 

 ii. 

reluc tanc e to summarily strike out a c laim (at [31]) as follows: 

 ...This is anc hored on the judic ial polic y to afford a litigant the right to institute a bona fide c laim before the c ourts and to prosec ute it in the usual way. Whenever possible the courts will let the Plaintiff proceed with the action unless his case is wholly and clearly unarguable... [Emphasis added.] 

23     Although the Defendant had c ited three limbs of Order 18, rule 19(1) as the basis for his applic ation, c ounsel for the Defendant only seriously pursued the “frivolous and vexatious” limb before me. In respec t of those words, Lai Siu Chiu J, delivering judgment on behalf of the Court of Appeal, stated in _Ridhuan bin Yusof v Khng Thian Huat and another_ [2005] 2 SLR(R) 188 that: 

 29 In Afro-Asia Shipping Co (Pte) Ltd v Haridass Ho & Partners [2003] 2 SLR(R) 491 I had defined (at [22]) the words “frivolous or vexatious” under O 18 r 19(1)(b) of the Rules to mean “c ases whic h are obviously unsustainable or wrong, [and where] the words c onnote purposelessness in relation to the proc ess or a lac k of seriousness or truth and a lac k of bona fides ”. The definition as held by Yong Pung How CJ i n Goh Koon Suan v Heng Gek Kiau [1990] 2 SLR(R) 705 at [15], also inc luded proc eedings where a party “is not ac ting bona fide and merely wishes to annoy or embarrass his opponent, or when it is not c alc ulated to lead to any prac tic al result”. 

There being no serious suggestion that the Plaintiff was not ac ting _bona fide_ , I had, therefore, only to asc ertain if the Plaintiff’s c ause of ac tion was obviously unsustainable or wrong. 

24     In c onnec tion thereto, and arising from the submissions made by c ounsel for the Defendant, two main issues arose for c onsideration: 

 whether the Plaintiff’s c laim was prec luded by the c onsent order entered into between the parties in the Order 81 Applic ation; and 

 whether the Plaintiff’s c laim was prec luded by sec tion 51(10) of the HDA. 

**_Whether the Plaintiff’s claim was precluded by the consent judgment_** 

25     The key to this issue really laid in understanding the nature of a c onsent order and the effec ts thereof. To this end, a short survey of c ase law is nec essary. 

_The law on consent orders_ 

26     In _Siebe Gorman & Co Ltd v Pneupac Ltd_ [1982] 1 W.L.R. 185 (“ _Siebe Gorman_ ”), a dec ision of the English Court of Appeal, the Plaintiffs issued a writ against the Defendants in respec t of a transac tion of goods. After the c lose of pleadings, the Defendants took out a summons for spec ific disc overy to be provided within 10 days of the date of the order sought. The summons also prayed for a peremptory order in default of c omplianc e with the order, even though this was the first summons for disc overy. Just prior to attending before the Master for the hearing of the summons, solic itors for both parties had a brief disc ussion and agreed that, in return for the Plaintiffs c onsenting to the order sought, the Defendants would allow the Plaintiffs ten days to c omply with the order. No mention was made of the peremptory prayer then. However, when the Defendants drew up the order, the peremptory prayer was inc luded. Naturally, the Plaintiffs failed to c omply with the order for 


disc overy. After the Defendants took the position that the Plaintiffs’ c laim had been struc k out, the Plaint iffs applied for an extension of time to c omply. This was allowed at first instanc e but was reversed upon appeal. The Plaintiffs then further appealed to the Court of Appeal. 

27     The leading judgment was written by Lord Denning M.R. who, in his usual breezy manner, allowed an extension of time for the Plaintiffs to c omply with the disc overy order. In so doing, he noted that not all c onsent orders were alike (at 189) as follows: 

 We have had a disc ussion about “c onsent orders”. It should be c learly understood by the profession that, when an order is expressed to be made “by c onsent”, it is ambiguous. There are two meanings to the words “by c onsent.” That was observed by Lord Greene M.R. in ChandlessChandless v Nic holson [1942] 2 K.B. 321, 324. One meaning is this: the words “by c onsent” may evidenc e a real c ontrac t between the parties. In suc h a c ase the c ourt will only interfere with suc h an order on the same grounds as it would with any other c ontrac t. The other meaning is this: the words “by c onsent” may mean “the parties hereto not objec ting.” In suc h a c ase there is no real c ontrac t between the parties. The order c an be altered or varied by the c ourt in the same c irc umstanc es as any other order that is made by the c ourt without the c onsent of the parties. In every c ase it is nec essary to disc over the meaning is used. Does the order evidenc e a real c ontrac t between the parties? Or does it only evidenc e an order made without objec tions? 

Thus, Lord Denning distinguished between c ontrac tual c onsent orders and ‘no objec tions’ c onsent orders. The former is, in essenc e, a c ontrac t entered into in the presenc e of the c ourt; the latter, as observed by Templeman LJ in _Tigner-Roche & Co Ltd v Spiro_ (1982) 126 SJ 525 (“ _Tigner-Roche_ ”), is merely a c ase where “...the Plaintiffs [or the Defendants as the c ase may be] merely bowed their heads and submitted to suc h an order”. This distinc tion has sinc e been followed in many English c ases thereafter: see _Greater London Council v Rush Tomkins_ (1984) 128 SJ 722 (full transc ript available on Lexis), _RG Carter (West Norfolk) Ltd v Ham Gray Associates Ltd_ (1994) 42 ConLR 68, _Boyle v Hagerty_ (unreported, 29 Oc tober 1987, full transc ript available on Lexis), _Wembley Laboratories Ltd v Joyce Ground Engineering Ltd_ (1989) 19 ConLR 143 and _Community Care North East (a partnership) v Durham County Council_ [2010] 4 All ER 733. 

28     In the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, Lord Denning c onsidered the c onsent order made in the applic ation before him to be a “no objec tions” c onsent order (at 190): 

 I c annot put any suc h interpretation [an interpretation that the c onsent order was a c ontrac tual c onsent order] on the order whic h was drawn up in this c ase. It often happens in the Bear Garden that one solic itor or legal exec utive says to the other, “Give me 10 days.” The other agrees. They go in before the master. They say, “We have agreed the order.” The master initials it. It is said to be “by c onsent.” But there is no real c ontrac t. All that happens is that the master makes an order without any objec tion being made to it. It seems to me that that is what exac tly happened here. The solic itors for the Plaintiffs were saying, “We do not objec t to the order. Give us the extra 10 days from the time of inspec tion, and that is good enough.” It seems to me quite impossible in this c ase to infer any c ontrac t from the fac t that the order was drawn up as “by c onsent.” 

29     The first loc al c ase that pic ked up on the distinc tion drawn by Lord Denning was, I believe, the High Court c ase of _Wiltopps (Asia) Ltd v Drew & Napier and another_ [1999] 1 SLR(R) 252 (“ _Wiltopps_ ”). In that c ase, after the writ was filed, the Plaintiff failed to c omply with a c ourt order to file affidavits o f evidenc e-in-c hief. Initially, the Defendants were happy to provide the Plaintiff with more time. Eventually, however, the delay was so exorbitant that the Defendants filed an applic ation praying that unless the exc hange of affidavits of evidenc e-in-c hief took plac e within three days, the Plaintiff’s 


ac tion would be dismissed with c osts without further order. At the hearing of that summons, it was rec orded in the Notes of Evidenc e that the Plaintiff was “prepared to ac c ept an unless order, provided that the summons in c hambers is for seven days”. To that effec t the c ourt so ordered. Unfortunately, the Plaintiff again failed to c omply by the deadline. Pursuant to the unless order, the Defendants extrac ted an order for the ac tion to be dismissed. The Plaintiff sought to set aside this default judgment. 

30     Lee Seiu Kin JC c ited the c ase of _Siebe Gorman_ , applied the analysis to the c ase before him and held that the c onsent order entered into was of the c ontrac tual kind. He reasoned (at [19]): 

 In the present c ase the unless order was made pursuant to an applic ation taken out by the Defendants who had prayed for an unless order that gave the Plaintiffs three days to c omply. At the hearing of that applic ation, the Plaintiffs’ solic itors offered to c onsent to the order if they were given seven days, to whic h the Defendants’ solic itors agreed. It was on this basis that the c ourt made the order. It is c lear that there was c onsideration flowing from the Defendants to the Plaintiffs in that they would otherwise have maintained their applic ation for a three-day deadline, in respec t of whic h there was a possibility that they would obtain it. This was therefore an order giving effec t to the c ontrac t between the parties. 

Having so dec ided, Lee JC then went on to examine the effec t of a c ontrac tual c onsent order. To this end, he observed (at [23]): 

 A judgment or order by c onsent is binding until it is set aside and fresh proc eedings must be c ommenc ed if it is sought to set aside a c onsent order. In Wilding v Sanderson [1897] 2 CH 534, Byrne J said, at 543: 

 A c onsent judgment or order is meant to be the formal result and expression of an agreement already arrived at between the parties to proc eedings embodied in an order of the Court. The fac t of its being so expressed puts the parties in a different position from the position of those who have simply entered into an ordinary agreement. It is, of c ourse, enforc eable while it stands, and a party affec ted by it c annot, if he c onc eives he is entitled to relief from its operation, simply wait until it is sought to be enforc ed against him, and then raise by way of defenc e the matters in respec t of whic h he desires to be relieved. He must, when onc e it has been c ompleted, obey it, unless and until he c an get it set aside in proc eedings duly c onstituted for the purpose. 

31     The next signific ant c ase is that of _Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man_ [2006] 2 SLR(R) 117 (“ _Wellmix_ ”). _Wellmix_ revolved around an alleged c onsent unless order, this time for the Defendant, rather than the Plaintiff, to serve affidavits of evidenc e-in-c hief failing whic h the defenc e would be struc k out. This unless order was entered into after c ounsel for both parties had a disc ussion outside c hambers. After the Defendant failed to c omply with the unless order, the Plaintiff attempted to enforc e the same; the Defendant denied that the unless order was by c onsent and appealed against the dec ision of the assistant registrar who had agreed with the Plaintiff. 

32     Against this bac kdrop, Andrew Phang Boon Leong J set out the methodology to be employed in asc ertaining whether there was a c ontrac tual c onsent order (at [14]) as follows: 

 T h e general (albeit c ruc ial) starting-point is this: One has to adopt an objective approac h towards asc ertaining the parties’ intentions at the initial hearing before the assistant registrar and, indeed, before he made the order c onc erned. In this regard, c lose attention had to be paid not only to the parties’ own ac tions in the context of the relevant surrounding circumstances 


 but also to the language and terms of the actual order made by the assistant registrar himself. Looked at in this light, it is c lear that the assistant registrar’s own subjective interpretation of the order he had made earlier on, whilst not totally irrelevant, was c learly not dec isive by any means. [Emphasis in original.] 

In the c irc umstanc es before him, Phang J found that the unless order made between the parties was not a c ontrac tual c onsent order. This was bec ause the disc ussion between c ounsel was a short one and there was no prior negotiations nor c lear written c orrespondenc e. Neither were the words “By c onsent” used by the assistant registrar in making his order. On that basis, _inter alia_ , Phang J set aside the interloc utory judgment entered in favour of the Plaintiff. 

33     A brief pause, if I may, to address an issue not stric tly relevant to the present proc eedings. In _Wiltopps_ , Lee JC also c onsidered the following question: onc e a c ontrac tual c onsent order has been entered into, c an the c ourt subsequent to that interfere with the terms of the agreement? He noted the two differing opinions proffered by the c oram in _Purcell v F C Trigell Ltd_ [1971] 1 QB 358 (“ _Purcell_ ”) on this issue. Spec ific ally, Lord Denning proposed a further distinc tion between a c ontrac tual c onsent order in an interloc utory matter and a c ontrac tual c onsent order made as a final judgment. As to the former, Lord Denning was of the opinion (at 363) that: 

 The c ourt has always a c ontrol over interloc utory orders. It may, in its disc retion, vary or alter them even though made originally by c onsent. 

Where a final judgment is made by c onsent, however, the c ourt Lord Denning rec koned has no disc retion to interfere, save pursuant to ordinary c ontrac tual princ iples. However, the majority, inc luding Winn LJ and Buc kley LJ, saw no reason to make the same distinc tion. Regardless of whether t he c ontrac tual c onsent order was an interloc utory judgment or a final judgment, they were of the opinion that it c an only be set aside on ordinary c ontrac tual princ iples. 

34     Lee JC did not, in _Wiltopps_ , make a dec ision as to whic h view was c orrec t as it was unnec essary for him to do so. However, he made c lear that the majority view was the one he preferred, _i.e_ ., a c ontrac tual c onsent order c an only be set aside on grounds that would justify the setting aside of a c ontrac t. Phang J, in _Wellmix_ , did however take a dec isive stand on this issue. After c arefully examining all the relevant authorities and materials on this issue (inc luding _Purcell_ and _Wiltopps_ ), Phang J held: 

 89 However, I would be prepared to ac c ept that, the objec tions in the prec eding paragraphs notwithstanding, it would still be desirable to allocate to the court a residuary discretion of the type suggested by Lord Denning MR in Purcell. In this regard, I also respectfully differ from the view preferred by Lee JC in the Wiltopps case , and I do so for the following main reason. 

 90 It must be borne in mind that a c onsent unless order, whilst tec hnic ally a c ontrac t between the parties, is one that allows one party to wholly deprive the other of its legal rights in the c ontext of litigation. Even though suc h an order has been agreed upon between the parties, there may, in my view, arise c ertain c irc umstanc es where it would nevertheless be unjust for the party in whose favour the c onsent order operates to insist on its enforc ement in the absenc e of a high degree of intentionally c ontumac ious or c ontumelious c onduc t. 

 91 Suc h a disc retion is, in the final analysis, merely an aspec t of the c ourt’s power to have ultimate c ontrol over its own proc edure. This is not at all unreasonable, in my view, and does, on balanc e, c onduc e to justic e and fairness. The foc us is still on proc edure, rather than substanc e. 


 It might be argued that the substantive rights of the Plaintiff would be adversely affec ted. This is arguably the c ase but it must never be forgotten that an unless order is part of the proc edural armoury and is not based on the substantive merits of the c ase as suc h. Thus, an unless order (whether by c onsent or otherwise) deals, in the final analysis, with the litigation process and, on this score, the courts ought to have the final say. 

 [Emphasis in italic s in original. Emphasis in bold added.] 

This was the other basis on whic h Phang J arrived at his dec ision. 

35     The last loc al c ase whic h has added to our understanding of c onsent orders is that of _Woo Koon Chee v Scandinavian Boiler Service (Asia) Pte Ltd and others_ [2010] 4 SLR 1213 (“ _Woo Koon Chee_ ”). In that c ase, it was not disputed that there was a c ontrac tual c onsent order made whic h was aimed at resolving the substantive c onflic t between the parties. Unfortunately, the appellant failed to abide by the terms of that c ontrac tual c onsent order. The respondents then took out a summons for spec ific enforc ement. The issue at hand was the appropriate manner in whic h a c ontrac tual c onsent order should be enforc ed. 

36     The Court of Appeal endorsed the following passage found in the _Singapore Court Practice 2009_ (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed, LexisNexis 2009) in holding that the respondents need not start a separate ac tion to enforc e the c ontrac tual c onsent order: 

 42/1/6. Consent judgments and orders. The terms of a settlement agreement may be enforc ed by a separate ac tion, assuming the agreement has the status of a legally binding c ontrac t... 

 However, the advantage of embodying the terms of the settlement in a c onsent judgment or order is that it may be automatically enforc ed in the event of non-c omplianc e... 

 [Emphasis in original.] 

More pertinent to the present applic ation before me, the Court of Appeal also touc hed upon the nature of a c ontrac tual c onsent order as well as the ac tion pursuant to whic h the order was made (at [18]): 

 By Summons No 76, the Relevant Respondents were c learly seeking to enforc e their rights under the Consent Order and not under Suit 53 of 2008, which cause (c onsistent with the princ iple enunc iated in IOB v Motorcycle Industries at [12] above) ha d been merged with and superseded by the Consent Order. [Emphasis added.] 

I n _Indian Overseas Bank v Motorcycle Industries (1973) Pte Ltd_ [1992] 3 SLR(R) 841 (“ _IOB v Motorcycle Industries_ ”), the Court of Appeal had relied on the following passage in _Halsbury’s Laws of_ 

_England_ vol 37 (Butterworths, 4 th Ed) at para 391: 

 ...[w]here the parties settle or c ompromise pending proc eedings, whether before, at or during the trial, the settlement or c ompromise c onstitutes at a new and independent agreement between them made for good c onsideration. Its effects are (1) to put an end to the proceedings, for they are thereby spent and exhausted; (2) to preclude the parties from taking any further steps in the action, except where they have provided for liberty to apply to enforce the agreed terms; and (3) to supersede the original cause of action altogether... An agreement for a c ompromise may be enforc ed or set aside on the same grounds and in the same way as any

 other c ontrac t... [Emphasis added.] 

37     The following is, then, the law relating to c onsent orders as I understand it: 

 There are two kinds of c onsent orders. One is a c ontrac tual c onsent order. This is a real c ontrac t between the parties, rec orded in the presenc e of the c ourt. The other is a ‘no objec tions’ c onsent order. This is, in essenc e, a passive c onsent order in that one party simply does not objec t to the prayers sought by the other party: see Siebe Gorman, Wiltopps and Wellmix. 

 To distinguish between the two, one must adopt an objec tive approac h and look at all relevant c irc umstanc es of the c ase, inc luding the parties’ c onduc t and the order made: see Wellmix. 

 In the c ase of a c ontrac tual c onsent order whic h aims to settle the substantive dispute, the c onsent order supersedes the original c ause of ac tion altogether. The original proc eedings are then spent and exhausted: see Woo Koon Chee and IOB v Motorcycle Industries. Presumably, a c ontrac tual c onsent order dealing with an interloc utory matter supersedes the interloc utory applic ation and the applic ation is then spent and exhausted. 

 Where enforc ement is c onc erned, a c onsent order, whether a c ontrac tual or a ‘no objec tions’ one, may be, but need not be, enforc ed without a fresh ac tion. It may be enforc ed like any other c ourt order: see Woo Koon Chee. 

 However, different princ iples apply to the setting aside or variation of a c ontrac tual c onsent order and a ‘no objec tions’ c onsent order. In the former c ase, the c onsent order c an only be set aside or varied pursuant to ordinary princ iples applied in the law of c ontrac t. In a ‘no objec tions’ c onsent order, the princ iples applic able to the setting aside or variation of an ordinary c ourt order applies: see Siebe Gorman and Wellmix. 

 There is one rider to the princ iple stated in (v). Insofar as a c ontrac tual c onsent order regarding interloc utory matters is c onc erned, the c ourt has an overriding disc retion to vary o r alter the terms of the order: see Wellmix and Lord Denning per Purcell. This is an exc eption to the general rule that c ontrac tual c onsent orders may be set aside or varied pursuant only to ordinary c ontrac t law princ iples. 

_Application of the law to the facts_ 

38     In order to address the arguments presented by the Defendant’s c ounsel, it must first, of c ourse, be asc ertained what kind of c onsent order was agreed to between the parties in the Order 81 Applic ation. This was to be done by using an objec tive approac h, taking into ac c ount all relevant c irc umstanc es of the c ase. Upon a c lose examination of the c orrespondenc e between the parties leading up to the making of the c onsent order, there was no doubt in my mind that the c onsent order arrived at was a c onsent order of the c ontrac tual kind. 

39     The genesis of the c onsent order was the olive branc h extended by the Defendant on 13 July 


2009: see [8], above. In this fax, the Defendant agreed not to seek c osts for the Order 81 Applic ation and to abandon any c laims for trespass if the Plaintiff will vac ate the Flat by 31 July 2009. This, obviously, was an offer as understood in c ontrac t law to settle the Order 81 Applic ation on the terms set out. However, the nature of the response by the Plaintiff’s c ounsel on 17 July 2009 (see [9], above) was not so easy to disc ern. This was bec ause c ounsel for the Plaintiff did not ac c ept the olive branc h unequivoc ally but said that “our c lient will ac c ept the offer...without prejudic e to any c laims that he may have against the estate, partic ularly in respec t of any moneys expended and/or ownership.” To my mind, this response may be understood in two ways. First, it may be understood as a c ounteroffer in that the Plaintiff ac c epted all the terms set out in the Defendant’s initial offer but wished to inc lude a separate term that the Plaintiff was to be allowed to pursue any c laims against the estate that he may have. This was indeed the way the Defendant’s c ounsel understood the response. Sec ondly, the response may also be understood as a request for c larific ation. The Plaintiff wanted to asc ertain that the terms of the Defendant’s initial offer did not implic itly prec lude the Plaint iff from c laiming against the estate. If so, the Plaintiff was willing to ac c ept the Defendant’s offer. I myself preferred this sec ond interpretation of the Plaintiff’s response. However, regardless of whic hever interpretation was c orrec t, the signific ant point was that there was no c ontrac t formed at this stage as there was no unequivoc al ac c eptanc e. 

40     What then is to be made of the next fax of 21 July 2009 by the Defendant’s c ounsel (see 10, above)? To reiterate, the Defendant’s c ounsel wrote, _inter alia_ , that: 

 [t]ec hnic ally, the fax [from the Plaintiff’s c ounsel] c ontains a c ounter offer in paragraph 2 after the first c omma. That portion is not part of any settlement whic h the [Defendant] agrees to and will have to be left to be resolved under the general law, if applic able. 

Thereafter, a draft order of c ourt was attac hed whic h reflec ted the same terms set out in the Defendant’s initial offer. In my opinion, the Defendant was, again, making the same offer it did before (on 13 July 2009). This time, however, the Defendant made c lear that the Plaintiff’s possible c laims were _not_ part of the settlement and that any suc h c laim was to be resolved separately, _i.e_ ., “under general law”. This was also c lear bec ause the Plaintiff’s potential c laims were, at this point, a live issue. Sinc e the Defendant did not explic itly state that the Plaintiff was to abandon any c laims that he may have in the draft order, it must mean that any suc h term was not part of the agreement. 

41     Thereafter, c ounsel for the Plaintiff redrafted the c onsent order for form but not substanc e: see [11], above. At this point, if not before, there was a meeting of minds between the Plaintiff and the Defendant as to the terms of the formal c ontrac t to be entered between them. While it had not yet been formally rec orded, there was nevertheless _consensus ad idem_ between the parties. The formal rec ording of the c ontrac t finally took plac e on 24 July 2009 before Deputy Registrar Julian Chin in the form of the c onsent order. 

42     The above, I believe, is the proper way to analyse the c orrespondenc e between the parties. The c onsent order entered into between the parties was therefore a c ontrac tual c onsent order rather than a ‘no objec tions’ c onsent order. At all times, c ounsel for both parties were fully aware of, and in agreement with, the terms of the c ontrac t. Equally, they were also aware of a live outstanding issue 

- that of the Plaintiff’s c laims – whic h was not part of the agreement. Even so, there was suffic ient c onsideration from the Plaintiff, given that he had vac ated the Flat, for c ontrac t formation. 

43     Sinc e the c onsent order entered into between the parties in the Order 81 Applic ation was, in essenc e, a c ontrac t, the effec t of that c ontrac t must be determined solely by referenc e to the terms of the c ontrac t. The terms of the c ontrac t were enc apsulated by the c onsent order (see [12], above) and did not inc lude one to the effec t that the Plaintiff was to give up his right to take out the 


present ac tion. I do not agree with the argument that the Plaintiff had, by entering into the c onsent order, agreed with the Defendant’s allegations (that the Plaintiff was an unlawful oc c upant of the Flat) as set out in the Defendant’s supporting affidavit for the Order 81 Applic ation. The supporting affidavit did not form part of the c ontrac t between the parties. The fac ts set out therein did not, therefore, bind the Plaintiff. Indeed, in the c orrespondenc e leading up to the c onsent order, the Defendant had expressly agreed that suc h any issue regarding the Plaintiff’s right to sue the estate was to be “resolved under the general law”. 

44     The Defendant’s c ounsel also pointed to two c ases in support of the Defendant’s present applic ation whic h I will now address. First, c ounsel argued that issue estoppel applied on the basis of Sundaresh Menon JC’s dec ision in _Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others_ [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 (“ _Goh Nellie_ ”). In that c ase, the plaintiff, as trustee, sought the right to sell a partic ular piec e of property without the fifth defendant’s permission. Prior to this applic ation, the fifth defendant had applied via Originating Summons No 618 of 2005 (“OS 618/2005”) for a determination of her right to stay in a partic ular piec e of property. That applic ation was disposed off by Phang JC, as he was then, who made a substantive order to the effec t that the fifth defendant had the right to stay on the property as long as she personally resides there. On that basis, the fifth defendant argued, _inter alia_ , that issue estoppel applied to the plaintiff’s applic ation before Menon JC. On this point, Menon JC wrote (at [29]): 

 In the present case, there can be no doubt that the order made in OS 618/2005 was a final determination of the right of Rosaline [the fifth Defendant] to reside at No 61. There was nothing that remained to be dec ided in relation to this. Counsel for Nellie [the Plaintiff ] submitted, however, that OS 618/2005 was a c onsent order and he c ontended that c onsent orders are inc apable of forming the basis upon whic h an issue estoppel c ould arise. In my judgment, this is misc onc eived. Leaving aside the question whether OS 618/2005 was a consent order to begin with, this would not prevent it forming the basis of an issue estoppel so long as the order was final : see The Doctrine of Res Judicata at para 38, c it ing Kinch v Walcott [1929] AC 482. [Emphasis added.] 

Although the sec ond italic ised sentenc e in this passage seemed to support the Defendant’s position at first glanc e, a proper understanding of Menon JC’s dec ision revealed that this was not so. 

45     The c ritic al part of the passage was the fac t that Menon JC found that there was a “final determination” in OS 618/2005: see the first italic ised sentenc e of the prec eding passage. There was, in other words, a final and c onc lusive judgment _on the merits_. To my mind, the c onsent order in OS 618/2005 must therefore have been a ‘no objec tions’ c onsent order rather than a c ontrac tual c onsent order, although this was not explic itly stated. This was bec ause in a c ontrac tual c onsent order, there would have been no final and c onc lusive judgment _on the merits_. As explained earlier, in a c ontrac tual c onsent order, the judge merely rec ords a c ontrac t agreed between the parties. The judge does not apply his mind to the c ase to asc ertain, ac c ording to law, whether the applic ation or the prayers sought should be granted. In fac t, as the Court of Appeal in _Woo Koon Chee_ explained (see [35] to [37], above), the c ontrac tual c onsent order supersedes the original c ause of ac tion altogether. The original proc eedings are then spent and exhausted. This is different from a ‘no objec tions’ c onsent order where the judge makes a judic ial determination as to the rights between parties, albeit without objec tions from one party. This view is supported by the fac t that Phang JC had c ame to his final determination in OS 618/2005 “[o]n a true c onstruc tion of paragraph 2(a) of the Last Will & Testament of Low Gek Huay and in the events that have happened...” This suggests that Phang JC had applied his mind to the merits of the applic ation. Thus, when Menon JC suggested that it did not matter whether the order made in OS 618/2005 was a c onsent order or not (and that issue estoppel applied anyways), he ac tually meant that it did not matter _whether the order was a ‘no objections’_ 


_consent order or whether the order was made after full arguments_. This was bec ause in either c ase there would have been a judgment _on the merits_. However, it would be a very different if the c onsent order made in OS 618/2005 was a _contractual_ c onsent order. Had that been the c ase, it would be very surprising if Menon JC had arrived at the same c onc lusion he did. For this reason, I was not of the view that the c ase of _Goh Nellie_ supported the Defendant’s c ase. 

46     The sec ond c ase whic h c ounsel for the Defendant raised was muc h simplier to deal with. In _Sim Lian (Newton) Pte Ltd v Gan Beng Cheng Raynes and Another_ [2007] SGHC 84, Assistant Registrar Paul Tan had oc c asion to deal with an applic ation pursuant to Order 81 of the ROC. In that c ase, AR Tan analysed the nature of an Order 81 applic ation and reasoned that: 

 31 [s]everal c onsequenc es flow from the summary nature of proc eedings under O 81. First, where there is a dispute on the fac ts or on legal issues, O 81 would not be the appropriate proc edure and the applic ant should have his c laim adjudic ated by the usual proc ess, inc luding trial if nec essary... 

 ... 

 33 ...in summary proc eedings, it is not the func tion of the c ourt to resolve the c ase on its merits but only to judge whether there is a dispute that ought to be adjudic ated by trial. In this regard, onc e the applic ant has present a prima facie c ase, it falls on the responding party to “lead trump or risk losing” (see, 1061590 Ontario Ltd v Ontario Jockey Club (1995) 21 O.R. (3d) 547 at 36). 

On the basis of these passages, c ounsel for the Defendant argued that the Plaintiff should have c laimed trial instead of c onsenting to the order made in the Order 81 Applic ation. Having c onsented, he c ould not now reopen the issue. 

47     With respec t, c ounsel’s argument was misc onc eived. The responsibility of the Plaintiff to “lead trump or risk losing” in the Order 81 Applic ation only applied if the Defendant had pursued his c ase against the Plaintiff. However, as it turned out, the Defendant did not. Rather, the Defendant c hose to enter into a c ontrac tual c onsent order with the Plaintiff. At the risk of repetition, this meant that the c onsent order superseded the Defendant’s c ause of ac tion in the Order 81 Applic ation altogether. The Order 81 Applic ation was then spent and exhausted: see _Woo Koon Chee_. Sinc e the Defendant did not pursue his c ase, the Plaintiff had no c ase to respond to. Ac c ordingly, the fac t that the Plaintiff did not c hallenge the Order 81 Applic ation then did not mean that he c ould not now pursue the present ac tion. 

48     For all of the above reasons, I was of the view that the Plaintiff was not prec luded from pursuing the present ac tion by reason of the c onsent order entered into between the parties in the Order 81 Applic ation. 

**_Whether the Plaintiff’s claim is precluded by section 51(10) of the HDA_** 

49     I now turn to the sec ond issue. To reiterate, the argument made on behalf of the Defendant was that the Plaintiff was prec luded from bringing his c laim by virtue of sec tion 51(10) of the HDA. To assess the validity of this argument, it was nec essary to understand fully the nature of a proprietary estoppel c laim. 

_Proprietary estoppel and constructive trust_ 


 i. 

 ii. 

 iii. 

50     When reading c aselaw, it is not often easy to distinguish proprietary estoppel from another equitable ac tion known as c onstruc tive trust. This c onfusion may, to my mind, be the result of at least four fac tors. First, the term ‘c onstruc tive trust’ has been used to mean different things; Indeed, Sir Peter Millet c ommented that “the use of the language of c onstruc tive trust has bec ome suc h a fertile sourc e of c onfusion that it would be better if it were abandoned”: see Mc Kendric k, _Commercial Aspects of Trusts and Fiduciary Obligations_ , (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 3. Sec ondly, the use of the term ‘proprietary estoppel’ is relatively modern although the pith of that c ause of ac tion is deeply antiquated, dating from before the nineteenth c entury. Even when the term ‘proprietary estoppel’ was used in the twentieth c entury, it was not used c onsistently. This means that one c annot always be c ertain that a partic ular dec ision was based on proprietary estoppel or some other c ause of ac tion. Thirdly, the exac t ambit of proprietary estoppel is not partic ularly settled. On the c ontrary, the c ommon law, I believe, is still in the midst of feeling out its edges. Fourthly, fac ts that may suffic e to make out a proprietary estoppel are often also suffic ient to make out a c onstruc tive trust, partic ularly a c ommon intention c onstruc tive trust, c laim. 

51     Be that as it may, it is relatively c lear that while there are areas of overlap between a proprietary estoppel c laim and c onstruc tive trust c laim, the two are distinc t c auses of ac tion. The exac t boundaries of these c auses of ac tion may be diffic ult to define but the two c auses of ac tion are c onc eptually different and independent of eac h other. I shall attempt to explain the differenc e between the two. 

52     I begin with c onstruc tive trust for the law regarding c onstruc tive trust is more settled. The term ‘c onstruc tive trust’ may be used to desc ribe a c ause of ac tion or an equitable remedy. As a c ause of ac tion, English law has, generally only rec ognised the existenc e of an ‘institutional’ c onstruc tive trust (as opposed to a ‘remedial’ c onstruc tive trust). (I note, however, the dec ision of Judith Prakash J in _Koh Cheong Heng v Ho Yee Fong_ [2011] 3 SLR 125 (“ _Koh Cheong Heng_ ” ) whic h seemed to ac c ept a very limited form of remedial c onstruc tive trust in Singapore.) The primary feature of an institutional c onstruc tive trust is that it is brought into being on the oc c urrenc e of spec ified, well-established events, without the need for the intervention of the c ourt. As a c ause of ac tion, the term ‘c onstruc tive trust’ is simply a way to c ategorise these disparate spec ified events under one umbrella. These spec ified events are disparate bec ause the fac ts required to make out these events are quite distinc t. That said, there is a c ommonality underlying these events – in eac h of these events, it would be inequitable – or some would say unc onsc ionable – for the holder of the legal title to assert absolute entitlement to the property. 

53     Although unc onsc ionability is a vague idea, the c onditions under whic h a c onstruc tive trust c ause of ac tion may be made out are relatively well c irc umsc ribed under English law. Without attempting to be exhaustive, the following are fac ts that would generally found a c onstruc tive trust c laim: 

 fraud; 

 the retention of property ac quired as a result of a c rime c ausing death; 

 a profit in beac h of a fiduc iary duty; 


 iv. 

 v. 

 vi. 

 vii. 

 the retention of property by a vendor after the vendor had entered into a spec ific ally enforc eable c ontrac t to sell the property; 

 the c hanging of a will by the survivor of two persons who had entered into a c ontrac t to exec ute wills in a c ommon form; 

 the ac quisition of land expressly subjec t to the interests of a third party; 

 the assertion of full entitlement to property after a c ommon intention to share property had been formed (also known as a ‘c ommon intention c onstruc tive trust’). 

So far, English law has taken the view that a c onstruc tive trust c laim may not be established outside of these well-defined and ac c epted events. 

54     Onc e these events are established, the c ourt _declares_ the existenc e of a c onstruc tive trust. A c onstruc tive is not imposed bec ause the trust exists from the time the relevant events oc c urred. The c ourt merely rec ognises that the benefic iary enjoys a pre-existing interest in the property. The c orollary to this princ iple is that the c ourt does not have a disc retion as to the appropriate remedy to b e rendered. Onc e the fac ts are found to have arisen, a c onstruc tive trust _must_ be dec lared. Ac c ordingly, a c onstruc tive trust may be c apable of gaining priority over other subsequent interests in t he property. The c ourt’s func tion is, therefore, to dec lare proprietary interests as they are, not to alter them. 

55     A proprietary estoppel c laim is a little different. As expressed in Pearc e, Stevens & Barr, _The_ 

_Law of Trusts and Equitable Obligations_ , (Oxford University Press, 2010, 5th Ed), (at p 339): 

 Proprietary estoppel is an entirely different equitable devic e from either the c onstruc tive or resulting trust, bec ause it does not operate by rec ognizing the existenc e of a benefic ial interest already c reated by the parties themselves, as it the c ase with express, resulting, and c onstruc tive trusts. Instead, it provides an equitable remedy, even though the remedy may allow a party to ac quire an interest in the property. 

The moral forc e of a proprietary estoppel c laim lies in the unc onsc ionability of a ‘frustrated expec tation’: see Gray and Gray, _Elements of Land Law_ , (Oxford University Press, 5th edn, 2009) (“Elements of Land Law”) (at [9.2.119]). In essenc e, the legal owner of a property must have c onduc ted himself (whether by way of enc ouragement or representation) in suc h a manner that the c laimant believes that he has, or will obtain, some rights in respec t of that property. The c laimant must thereafter have relied on the legal owner’s behaviour to his detriment. When suc h a situation arises, it would be unc onsc ionable for the legal owner to then assert his stric t legal entitlement to the property and equity will intervene to prevent this. The c ourt, in essenc e, has to identify c irc umstanc es in whic h a legal owner’s c onduc t c an be said to be unc onsc ionable. 

56     If the above sounds similar to a c onstruc tive trust – partic ularly a c ommon intention c onstruc tive trust c laim, it is. The moral forc e of a c onstruc tive trust and a proprietary estoppel c laim is, I believe, rooted in the same sourc e – unc onsc ionability. What is different is the foc us of the judic ial enquiry, the degree of unc onsionability and the legal c onsequenc es resulting thereto. As stated in _Elements of Land Law_ (at [9.2.119]): 


 In so far as any distinc tion exists between the doc trines of proprietary estoppel and c onstruc tive trust, it is sometimes said that the balanc e of emphasis in the c onstruc tive trust falls on the notion of frustrated bargain, whereas the ‘equity’ of estoppel is more obviously founded upon the notion of frustrated expec tation. 

As c ompared to a c onstruc tive trust c laim, proprietary estoppel is a far more flexible and versatile doc trine, more suited to dealing with lesser degrees of unc onsc ionability arising from lay persons’ varied and informal arrangements with regards to property. When c irc umstanc es giving rise to a proprietary estoppel c laim oc c urs, only an inc hoate estoppel equity is raised. Unlike a c onstruc tive trust c laim, no trust automatic ally arises as a result of suc h fac ts oc c urring. The c laimant is thus entitled to remedial relief in order to satisfy the equity. At this point, the c ourt must then dec ide what remedy is appropriate in the c irc umstanc es to satisfy the expec tation raised by the estoppel. In some c ases, a trust will be _imposed_ over the property. But this is not the inevitable result. The c ourt may selec t from the full range of equitable remedies available at law inc luding ordering injunc tions or awarding equitable damages. The c ourt is limited only by the princ iple that it should award the _minimum_ right or interest nec essary to do justic e between the parties. The c ourt’s primary func tion is, therefore, not to asc ertain proprietary rights as they are but to rec tify the unc onsc ionability in a proportionate manner. 

57     Despite the doc trinal differenc es highlighted in the prec eding paragraphs, it c annot be gainsaid that there is, in prac tic e, a substantial area of overlap between c onstruc tive trusts and proprietary estoppel. Often, the same fac tual matrix may give rise to both a c onstruc tive trust and a proprietary estoppel c laim. However, that there is an area of overlap does not, in any way, diminish – muc h less eliminate their areas of differenc es and, c onsequently, the fac t that the two c auses of ac tion are distinc t and separate. Indeed, Lord Walker expressed doubt in _Stack v Dowden_ [2007] 2 AC 432 (at [37]) that the two areas of law “c an or should be c ompletely assimilated” and held that: 

 [p]roprietary estoppel typic ally c onsists of asserting an equitable c laim against the c onsc ienc e of the ‘true’ owner. The c laim is a ‘mere equity’. It is to be satisfied by the minimum award nec essary to do justic e...whic h may sometimes lead to no more than a monetary award. A ‘c ommon intention’ c onstruc tive trust, by c ontrast, is identifying the true benefic ial owner or owners, and the size of their benefic ial interests. 

_Application of the law to the facts_ 

58     Having so understood the law, the answer to the Defendant’s objec tions to the Plaintiff’s c laim presented itself. In my view, sec tion 51(10) of the HDA did not make the Plaintiff’s c laim obviously unsustainable. 

59     Sec tion 51(10) of the HDA reads: 

 No person shall bec ome entitled to any protec ted property (or any interest in suc h property) under any resulting trust or c onstruc tive trust whensoever c reated or arising. 

This provision was amended to its c urrent wording in 2010. Prior to that, the equivalent provision, whic h is sec tion 51(6) of the then-HDA, read: 

 No person shall bec ome entitled to any suc h flat, house or other building under any resulting trust or c onstruc tive trust, whensoever c reated. 


 (i) 

 (ii) 

 (iii) 

The main c hange was, therefore, the addition of the words “or arising”. 

60     Prakash J explained in _Koh Cheong Heng_ that the amendment did not c hange the effec t of the provision but merely reflec ted that a resulting trust or a c onstruc tive may sometimes be more ac c urately said to have “arisen” rather than “c reated”. She explained (at [56]): 

 Although the amended legislation inc ludes the words “or arising” at the end of the relevant provision, in my opinion the addition of the words “or arising” only c larify that a “resulting trust” or a “c onstruc tive trust” may be more properly said to arise by operation of law, rather than by the c reation of parties. 

As a result, materials pertinent to understanding the previous sec tion 51(6) were also relevant apropos the present sec tion 51(10). 

61     To understand objec tives lying behind the older provision, the Ministerial Statement that was read at the sec ond reading of the Bill was instruc tive. The Minister stated as follows (see _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (15 August 2005) vol 80 at c ol 1252 (Mah Bow Tan, Minister for National Development)): 

 Clause 6 of the Bill amends sec tion 51 to make it c lear that, in addition to prohibiting the voluntary c reation of trusts over an HDB flat, the Ac t also prohibits any person from bec oming entitled to a HDB flat under a resulting trust or a c onstruc tive trust. This will help to prevent a situation where a person who is ineligible to own an HDB flat may become entitled to own one, for example, by paying the purchase price of the flat on behalf of the owner. [Emphasis added.] 

The intent of sec tion 51(6) of the thenHDA was therefore to prevent ineligible persons from owning HDB flats. This was also the understanding of the High Court in the c ase of _Tan Chui Lian v Neo Liew Eng_ [2007] 1 SLR(R) 265. The restric tion, in other words, operated within stric t boundaries. The c onditions were that: 

 the purported benefic iary must be one who is ordinarily ineligible to own a HDB flat; 

 the benefic iary must be c laiming an interest in the HDB flat; and 

 the benefic iary must be entitled to the interest in the flat by way of a resulting or c onstruc tive trust. 

Sinc e the effec t of sec tion 51(6) of the thenHDA was not c hanged by the subsequent amendment, the present sec tion 51(10) must be understood to operate within the same boundaries. 

62     In the present c ase, although c riterion (i) (as listed in the prec eding paragraph) was satisfied, c riteria (ii) and (iii) were not. The Plaintiff was making a proprietary estoppel c laim on the basis of c ertain representations made to him by the Dec eased. He was not making any of the c onstruc tive trust c laims enumerated in [53], above. As a result, no trust need nec essarily be dec lared by virtue of the nature of his c laim, if suc c essfully made. All that arose out of the unc onsc ionability of the fac ts would be a mere estoppel equity, not a trust. To this end, c ounsel for the Defendant had c onfused the doc trine of proprietary estoppel for that of c onstruc tive trust. Furthermore, the Plaintiff did not 


seek for the equity to be satisfied by way of a trust. In fac t, the Plaintiff was not even seeking an interest in the Flat. Rather, the Plaintiff was merely asking for equitable damages in order to satisfy the equity raised. This prayer was one that was within the c ourt’s equitable disc retion to grant. Given the partic ular way in whic h the Plaintiff’s c ase had been framed, it c ould not be said his c laim was nec essarily prec luded by sec tion 51(10) of the HDA. 

63     Allow me to c onc lude with a personal observation. In my view, the present c ase is exac tly the kind of c ase that the proprietary estoppel doc trine is uniquely suited to deal with. Indeed, given the rec ent liberalisation of the c ommon intention c onstruc tive trust doc trine (see _Oxley v Hiscock_ [2005] Fam 211 and _Stack v Dowden_ ), the time may soon c ome when proprietary estoppel is used only to do the minimum required to remedy any unac c eptable unc onsc ionability rather than alloc ate proprietary interests. If that happens, one will expec t it to be the exc eption rather than the norm for an estoppel equity to be satisfied by the imposition of a c onstruc tive trust. 

**Conclusion** 

64     I had dealt with the Plaintiff’s c ase on the basis of the representations made by his c ounsel that the Plaintiff c laim was based only on proprietary estoppel and that the Plaintiff was not seeking a trust to satisfy any equity raised. For all of the above reasons, I c ame to the c onc lusion that the Plaintiff’s c ase was not obviously unsustainable or wrong. I was, therefore, not of the view that the appropriate c ourse of ac tion was to strike out the Plaintiff’s c ase entirely. However, that the Plaintiff’s statement of c laim was inadequately defec tive remained so. Ac c ordingly, I ordered that the Plaintiff amend his statement of c laim to properly reflec t his proprietary estoppel c laim. 

65     Both sets of c ounsel before me agreed that the Defendant should be awarded c osts of this applic ation. In the c irc umstanc es, I awarded fixed c osts of S$5000, exc luding disbursements, to be paid by the plaintiff.
