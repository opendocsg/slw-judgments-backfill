## Judgment 

### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

On 23 Dec ember 2001 at 12.50am the polic e c onduc ted a raid on Tiananmen KTV & Lounge Pte Ltd, situated at No. 407 Haveloc k Road. Chia Sze Chang, the appellant, was a c o-owner of the entertainment establishment at this time. Due to three breac hes of the Public Entertainment and Meetings Ac t (Cap 257) s 19(1)(c ), the appellant was c harged on three c ounts. 

2       The first c harge, was that the appellant had failed to ensure that the singers did not sit with the c ustomers. 

3       The sec ond and third c harges, was that the appellant had failed to ensure that the c ustomers would only be served drinks by persons who were listed on the establishment’s register. 

4       The appellant was c onvic ted on all three c harges. Distric t Judge Kow Keng Siong imposed a fine of $9,000, in default two months imprisonment, on eac h c harge. The total fine was therefore $27,000 whic h the appellant has sinc e paid. 

5       The appellant appealed against c onvic tion. 

**Facts as to the first charge** 

6       The following were the fac ts as found by the trial judge. 

7       Staff Sgt Wong Vee Kong, the prosec ution’s first witness, entered the Tiananmen KTV & Lounge at 12.50am on 23 Dec ember 2001. He was in plain c lothes and was ac c ompanied by a group of offic ers, also in plain c lothes. Due to his seniority, Staff Sgt Wong led the group. Staff Sgt Wong surveyed the premises and spotted some goings-on in KTV room 18, where he observed a woman danc ing with a c ustomer. He also observed that two more women were c hatting and sitting with some 


other c ustomers in the same room. These observations prompted Staff Sgt Wong’s to enter the room whereupon he identified himself as a polic e offic er. In the c ourse of his questioning and the subsequent arrests, Staff Sgt Wong identified the two women who were sitting with the c ustomers as Liu Hong Lian (Liu) and Zhang Chong Ling (Zhang). It was undisputed that these two women were employed as singers by the appellant. The Lic ensing Conditions for Nightc lubs/Coc ktail Lounges/Disc otheques/Restaurants states that : 

 The lic ensee shall ensure that the singers do not sit or danc e with the c ustomers. 

As against the danc er, Gao Hong Mei, no subsequent ac tion was taken as Staff Sgt Wong was satisfied that she was brought in as a guest. 

**The appellant’s challenge on conviction under the first charge** 

8       The appellant disputed the trial judge’s finding that Zhang and Liu were sitting with the c ustomers, but did not provide any evidenc e to persuade this c ourt to disregard trial judge’s findings on this matter. The distric t judge stated at pages 11 and 12 of his grounds of dec ision: 

 In the present c ase, if Staff Sgt Wong’s evidenc e is believed, the ingredients of [the first c harge] would have been satisfied. Having c arefully c onsidered the matter, I found Staff Sgt Wong to be a reliable witness and that it is inc onc eivable that he c ould have been mistaken about seeing Liu and Zhang. 

There was nothing in the appellant’s submission nor in anything the trial judge said on this matter that c ould persuade this c ourt to alter the trial judge’s findings. In _Ang Jwee Herng v PP_ <span class="citation">[2001] 2 SLR 474</span> I re-stated the following princ iple: 

 It is settled law that an appellate c ourt will be slow to overturn findings of fac t by the trial judge espec ially when an assessment of the c redibility and verac ity of the witness has been made. 

This princ iple has been used in a whole host of c ase law _Shamsul bin Abdullah v PP_ MA145/2002; _Lim Ah Poh v PP_ <span class="citation">[1992] 1 SLR 713</span> at 719; _Teo Keng Pong v PP_ <span class="citation">[1996] 3 SLR 329</span> at 342; _Ng Soo Hin v PP_ <span class="citation">[1994] 1 SLR 105</span>; _Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP_ <span class="citation">[1997] 3 SLR 464</span>. 

9       The three reasons given by the trial judge as to why he c ame to the c onc lusion that the two singers, Zhang and Liu, were sitting with the c ustomers were sound. The trial judge stated that Staff Sgt Wong had enough observation time before entering room 18 to c onfirm that the women were sitting with the c ustomers. Sec ondly, the trial judge stated there was not any evidenc e produc ed by the appellant to show that Staff Sgt Wong was less than diligent in his observation skills. The appellant’s c ontention that Staff Sgt Wong was totally fixated on the danc er and not on the women sitting with the c ustomers was totally spec ulative, and the trial judge was quite right to dispose of suc h a far-fetc hed theory. Thirdly, Staff Sgt Wong wasted no time in c hec king on the three women in room 18. During the c hec king, the two women who were sitting with the c ustomers produc ed their professional visit passes. 

10     The appellant did not dispute that Zhang and Liu were singers employed at his KTV Lounge. 


For these reasons, there c ould be no dispute as to the trial judge’s findings that these singers sat with the c ustomers. 

11     The appellant had a sec ond argument whic h c hallenged his c onvic tion under the first c harge. He c ontended that the trial judge erred in law and in fac t in finding that the unavailability of Liu and Zhang was not fatal to the prosec ution’s c ase. 

12     Zhang and Liu returned to China before the start of the trial in the distric t c ourt. The two of them had insisted on returning home. As the trial judge observed, the authorities in Singapore had no power to detain them as they were not immigration offenders. 

13     The unavailability of Zhang and Liu as witnesses during the trial c ould not work to extinguish t he appellant’s c ulpability. The reason why the prosec ution did not c all Zhang and Liu was bec ause had left the c ountry and not bec ause their presenc e as trial witnesses would jeopardise the prosec ution’s c ase. This was addressed by the trial judge and there was no reason to sec ond-guess his applic ation of the law on the matter. 

14     No adverse inferenc e c ould also be drawn against the prosec ution under s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidenc e Ac t. I held in _R Yoganathan v PP_ <span class="citation">[1999] 4 SLR 264</span> at 278 that, although the prosec ution did not c all c ertain witnesses to give evidenc e and likewise dec lined to produc e PW1 for further c ross-examination at the c lose of its c ase, the presumption under s116 illustration (g) of the Evidenc e Ac t did not operate. This was bec ause the witnesses who were not produc ed were not essential to the prosec ution’s c ase, and neither did the prosec ution withhold evidenc e from the c ourt or the appellant. Important for our purposes in this c ase was the fac t that the adverse inferenc e under s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidenc e Ac t is disc retionary. Illustration (g) under s116 reads: 

 ..... that evidenc e whic h c ould be and is not produc ed would if produc ed be unfavourable to the person who withholds it 

With the guidanc e of _R Yoganathan_ , no adverse inferenc e should be drawn from the fac t that Zhang and Liu returned to China. No ill-motivation on the part of the prosec ution c an be latc hed onto the women’s innoc ent desire to return home. I ruled in _Ang Jwee Herng_ <span class="citation">[2001] 2 SLR 474</span> that the prosec ution has no obligation to c all any partic ular witness, unless the failure to do so c ould be shown to be motivated by an intention to hinder or hamper the defenc e. This princ iple c onsolidated itself in the judgments in _Chua Keem Long v PP_ <span class="citation">[1996] 1 SLR 510</span> and _Roy S Selvarajah v PP_ <span class="citation">[1998] 3 SLR 517</span>. 

15     Of importanc e was the fac t that the trial judge found Staff Sgt Wong a c redible witness and that his testimony was suffic ient to c onfirm that Zhang and Liu were sitting with the c ustomers. For these reasons, the appellant’s c laim that there were insuffic ient witnesses must fail. 

16     The appellant’s third c hallenge to his c onvic tion under the first c harge was that the trial judge imposed on him too great a burden to ensure that his singers did not sit with c ustomers. He listed out all the ways in whic h he tried to prevent his singers from sitting with c ustomers. Amongst the ‘preventive measures’ he listed in his submission were : 

 a All employees must have a valid work permit 

 b No one below 18 years old is allowed into the lounge 

 c The staff is c losely supervised by the ‘Mummys’ in the 


 lounge 

 d The singers employed are briefed and c onstantly reminded that they are not to sit with c ustomers 

 e The singers are further briefed and reminded not even to mingle with c ustomers, even in passageways or by any form of c hit-c hatting 

The appellant further stated that he personally walked around the lounge to ensure that no c onditions of the lic enc e were breac hed. Thus, the appellant’s argument was that, in light of all these preventive measures, he should be exc used from liability sinc e he fulfilled the c ondition ‘the lic ensee _shall ensure_ that the singers do not sit with the c ustomers.’ I found that the appellant did not reac h the threshold needed to fulfil the ‘ _shall ensure_ ’ c ondition. It was my belief that the appellant knew of the goings-on in the KTV rooms but turned a blind eye to them. If the appellant said, as he did, that he regularly did his rounds to ensure that no breac h took plac e, why did it only take a short while for Staff Sgt Wong to realise that there was a c lear breac h in room 18? Could it be that the breac hes only oc c urred when the big boss was away? (in this c ase, the appellant was away from the lounge when the raid happened) – I did not think so. This was bec ause the appellant had stated that he was not the only person who did the patrolling. The ‘Mummys’ or ‘Mamasans’ patrolled also. If the KTV rooms were brightly lit, the insides of whic h were able to be seen from the c orridors, as has been deduc ed from the evidenc e, why would it be so diffic ult to ensure that no singer sat with a c ustomer? The appellant and his ‘Mummys’ most c ertainly do do their rounds of patrol but turn a blind eye to the goings-on in the KTV rooms. I would say that he is guilty of Nelsonian knowledge – he knows the true fac ts of things but turns a blind eye to them as Lord Nelson did in putting his telesc ope to his blind eye and dec laring, ‘I see no ships, I see no ships.’ The appellant was guilty of suc h knowledge – he knew of the trend of singers sitting with c ustomers. At the time of the raid only 25 rooms were oc c upied. It was not diffic ult to ensure that singers did not sit with c ustomers in 25 rooms, if the patrols are done diligently. Furthermore, the appellant stated in c ross-examination that he had only 8 singers, and that he took just five to ten minutes to c omplete his patrol. There were only eight singers to keep an eye on. And the patrol only took five to ten minutes. How diffic ult c ould it be to keep the plac e in c hec k? 

- Not diffic ult; if the intention is to keep the plac e in c hec k. From what the appellant stated on his own ac c ord, it is my view that he ‘turned a blind eye’ to what was really going on in the rooms. For this reason, the ‘shall ensure’ c ondition had not been met. 

17     This was far from making liability, stemming from the breac h of the lic ensing c onditions, stric t. Here, the appellant, although taking the preventive measures, did not possess the intention of stamping out the breac hes of the c onditions under the lic enc e. The appellant had Nelsonian knowledge – he turned a blind eye. The preventive ac tions were not c oupled with a genuine desire to prevent the breac hes. This was where the appellant c ounsel’s argument fell short. 

18     Thus, the appellant’s c ontention that he took all reasonable and nec essary steps to prevent the breac h from happening was off-tangent. What threw it off was his knowledge. 

19     For these reasons, the appeal against c onvic tion under the first c harge was dismissed. 

**Facts as to the second and third charges** 

20     On the night of the raid, Narc otic s Offic er Gopinathan (NO Gopinathan) was instruc ted to enter KTV room 19. This he did. There were four male c ustomers and two women in the room. NO Gopinathan identified himself and stated that he was in plain c lothes. In his evidenc e, he stated that 


the two women were sitting beside the male c ustomers. After NO Gopinathan had done the initial investigation, he returned to Central Division. The two women in room 19 followed him. The c ase was then handed over to offic er Adrian Oong Chun Chang. The two women, Li and Dong, requested to return to China. As they were not found to be immigration offenders, they were released. 

21     It was the prosec ution’s c ase, whic h was agreed to by the trial judge, that these two women were the ones who were sitting and serving the four c ustomers that night. 

22     The issue here stemmed from the following c ondition whic h a lic ensee must fulfil. Ac c ording to the ‘Lic ensing Conditions for Nightc lubs/Coc ktail Lounges/Disc otheques/Restaurants/Bars’: 

 The lic ensee shall ensure that only registered waitresses, bar-girls, and lounge-hostesses are permitted to serve c ustomers. 

Dong and Li were not registered and, on the strength of the prosec ution witnesses, the trial judge found the appellant in breac h of the above c ondition. The appellant c ontested this finding on several grounds. 

**The appellant’s challenge on convictions under the second and third charge respectively** 

23     The appellant c ontended that the trial judge erred in law and in fac t in finding that both Li and Dong had been suffic iently identified. The arrest report showed that, the two women were Dong and Li. As NO Gopinathan stated in his examination-in-c hief: 

 After I had finished, I handed over the partic ulars to one of the InCharge and esc orted the females to the holding area. We then went bac k to Central Division. The two females from room 19 followed me. Offic er Adrian Oong Chun Chang lodged an arrest report. I gave the partic ulars to Oong who lodged the report. I verified the arrest report. (my emphasis) 

There was hardly any slip in the c orrec t identific ation of these two women, Dong and Li. 

24     The appellant also c ontended that the trial judge erred in law and fac t by ac c epting and giving too muc h weight to the evidenc e of Cheok Ah Lek (Cheok) and Liew Fatt Nien (Liew), who were two of the four c ustomers in room 19 that night. Liew and Cheok were prosec ution witnesses. 

25     To this end, it is apt to re-emphasise the trial judge’s own apprehensions toward Liew’s testimony that Dong and Li were definitely the women in room 19. The trial judge’s apprehension stemmed from the fac t that Liew had c onfirmed the two women as the two women in room 19 a good six months after the raid. The important point here was that the trial judge did take this into c onsideration. It is apt to c ite a key part of his ruling on this matter: 

 I am of the view that even without Liew’s identification evidence , the identific ation of Li and Dong as the two women sitting with Cheok, Liew and their friends at the material time had been properly established....Staff Sgt Oong Chun Chang c orroborated Narc otic s Offic er Gopinathan’s evidenc e relating to the making of the arrest 


 report (exhibit P10). Ac c ording to the arrest report, (a) the two women arrested were Li Jin Hong and Dong Jing Yi, and (b) the two women were sitting together with Kwek Leng Kee (Kwek) and Ong Teng Koon (Ong) (the other two c ustomers). During the trial, the defenc e did not c hallenge at all these aspec ts of the prosec ution’s c ase. (my emphasis) 

This, the trial judge stated, was enough to overc ome the few inc onsistenc ies between the evidenc e of Liew, Cheok, and NO Gopinathan. There was nothing submitted whic h should prompt this Court to sec ond-guess the learned judge’s findings on the matter. 

26     The appellant’s third c hallenge as regards the sec ond and third c harges was that the trial judge erred in law and in fac t in finding that the prosec ution’s failure to c all Li and Dong, and Kwek and Ong (the other two c ustomers) was not fatal to the prosec ution’s c ase. 

27     The trial judge spec ific ally tac kled the issue of the absenc e of these four persons at trial. He stated, at para 44 of his grounds of dec ision: 

 I am of the opinion that the fac t that neither Li, Dong, Kwek, nor Ong gave evidenc e did not c reate a lac una in the Prosec ution’s c ase as there was direc t and c redible evidenc e from other material witnesses. 

With this statement in mind, the c redibility of the material witnesses whic h inc luded Narc otic s Offic er Gopinathan and c ustomer Cheok ought not to be sec ond-guessed by this Court. 

28     The appellant’s fourth c hallenge as regards the sec ond and third c harges was that the trial judge erred in law and in fac t in finding that Li and Dong were serving c ustomers and working in room 

19\. The issue here was that Li and Dong were not registered – there was no dispute as to this. Couple this fac t with the following finding of the trial judge’s and it was very diffic ult to allow suc h a c laim by the appellant. At para 46 of his grounds of dec ision, the trial judge stated: 

 There is c lear evidenc e that Li and Dong were serving c ustomers in KTV room 19. Both Cheok and Liew gave evidenc e that during their karaoke session, the women were (a) sitting with the c ustomers, (b) pouring drinks for them, and (c ) joining in the singing. Their evidenc e is c orroborated by Narc otic s Offic er Gopinathan who testified that at the time of entering KTV room 19, he heard some loud music from the room. After entering, Narc otic s Offic er Gopinathan observed two women, later established to be Li and Dong, to be sitting with the c ustomers and that there were some glasses and liquor bottles in the room. 

The trial judge’s reservation toward Liew’s evidenc e was only limited to his identific ation evidenc e as regards Li and Dong. Quite simply, therefore, the women were not on the register but were pouring and serving the four men drinks. 

29     But c ould Li and Dong have been guests of the men? – Or c ould the two women have entered the KTV lounge without the appellant’s management knowing about it? However, it was c lear that the 


t rial judge was satisfied with the fac t that Li and Dong were not the guests of the four men, and there was no reason why this c ourt should differ from this c onc lusion. What about the theory that Li and Dong c ould have slipped into the KTV Lounge? – The very testimony of the appellant c losed the door on suc h an argument. The following verbatim, at page 47 of the notes of evidenc e (c rossexamination of appellant), was telling: 

 Q You have advised or alerted your rec eption staff to stop people from sneaking in to enjoy KTV fac ilities, at c ompany’s expense? 

 A Yes. Instruc tions given to rec eption to asc ertain whether person entering is a c ustomer or otherwise. 

 Q Often diffic ult to ensure no outsider enters KTV bec ause you have only three rec eption staff? 

 A Disagree. 

 Q At anytime, how many rec eptionists on duty at the c ounter? 

 A At least one. 

 Q Staff at c ounter would be able to see who enters? 

 A Normally, we would have a c aptain to entertain them. If t h e rec eptionist leads the c ustomer to the rooms, the c aptain would be at the rec eption. 

If the KTV Lounge was as tight in its proc edure as to who was allowed in and who was not, as the appellant suggested in his testimony, how then c ould Li and Dong have slipped by the c hec ks? The fac t of the matter was that they did not even need to sneak in, as their presenc e was known to the management. To this end, I agreed with the trial judge’s assessment, at para 52 of his grounds of dec ision, that: 

 On the totality of the evidenc e, I find that Li and Dong had been permitted to serve at the Lounge by the appellant and his management. 

To argue that Dong and Li were free-lanc e hostesses and should therefore not have to be registered in order to serve was to make a nonsense of the registering c ondition. The register exists to keep trac k of the employment arrangements in the lounge industry. If it were otherwise, there would only be a handful of registered servers and a whole host of free-lanc ers. For these reasons, this last c ontention of the appellant’s must fail. 

30     The appellant’s rec ord offered him no favours. He had been fined no less than six times for breac h of the Public Entertainment and Meetings Ac t over a period of 12 years. The last sentenc e was passed on 5 November 2001 for providing public entertainment in c ontravention of a c ondition in a lic enc e under s18(1)(c ) of the Public Entertainment and Meetings Ac t. The fine of $8500 was paid in full, as were all his other fines. Separate from his breac hes of the Public Entertainment Ac t was his selling of intoxic ating liquor to under aged persons in a lic ensed premises – for whic h he was fined 


$800 on 4 January 1990. Again, he paid this fine in full. We must stop these lic ensees from treating fines as part of their business losses. Suc h an attitude belittles the law. A heavy fine will wake up lic ensees in the same position as the appellant to the fac t that fines too c an be c ostly and, as a deterrent sentenc e, the $27,000 fine imposed by the distric t judge is a good start. 

31     The appeal was dismissed.
