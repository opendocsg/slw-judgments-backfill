**Andrew Ang JC:** 

1       There were ten Notic es of Motion before me (sitting as a single judge Court of Appeal) under s 36(1) of the Supreme Court of Judic ature Ac t (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Ac t”), in c onnec tion with four appeals to the Court of Appeal – Civil Appeals Nos 50, 51, 53 and 54 of 2004. Six of these Notic es of Motion were filed on behalf of the appellants (the defendants in Originating Summonses Nos 1368 and 1566 of 2003). The remaining four Notic es of Motion were filed on behalf of the respondents (the plaintiffs in the two originating summonses mentioned above). 

2       Eac h of the six Notic es of Motion filed on behalf of the appellants sought orders: 

 (a) that the appellant be at liberty, upon the hearing of the appeal, to adduc e additional evidenc e by way of c ertain identified affidavit(s); and 

 (b) that the appellant be at liberty to file a single c ase and a single c ore bundle for the appeals. 

Eac h of the four Notic es of Motion filed on behalf of the respondents sought an order that the respondent be at liberty, upon the hearing of the appeal, to adduc e additional evidenc e by way of c ertain identified affidavit(s). 

3       Sec tion 36(1) of the Ac t provides as follows: 

 In any proc eeding pending before the Court of Appeal, any direc tion inc idental thereto not involving the dec ision of the appeal, any interim order to prevent prejudic e to the c laims of parties pending the appeal, and any order for sec urity for c osts and for the dismissal of an appeal for default in furnishing sec urity so ordered, may at any time be made by a Judge. 


The provision c ontemplates three types of direc tions or orders whic h a single judge sitting as the Court of Appeal may properly make: 

 (a) any inc idental direc tion not involving the dec ision of the appeal; 

 (b) any interim order to prevent prejudic e; and 

 (c ) any order for sec urity for c osts of the appeal and the c onsequential order for dismissal of an appeal for default. 

I had no diffic ulty in granting the appellants’ applic ations for an order that they be at liberty to file a single c ase and a single c ore bundle for the appeals as that c learly c ame within the first limb. 

4       Greater diffic ulty was enc ountered in regard to the adduc tion of additional evidenc e. While it was c lear that the sec ond and third limbs were inapplic able, the question was whether an order granting liberty to adduc e further evidenc e fell within the first as being a “direc tion inc idental thereto not involving the dec ision of the appeal”. There appears to be no direc t authority on the point. The editors of _Singapore Civil Procedure 2003_ (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2003 Ed) at para 57/1/3, are of the view that applic ations to adduc e further evidenc e fall within s 36(1) of the Ac t. They state: 

6\. Applic ations — There may be inc idental applic ations in c onnec tion with an appeal, most of whic h are heard by a single Judge of Appeal (see _Bank of India v Rai Bahadur Singh & Anor_ <span class="citation">[1993] 2 SLR 592</span>). Some of these situations inc lude an applic ation for leave to appeal (under O 57, r 16(2)), an applic ation to obtain further sec urity for c osts (see     O 23), an applic ation for a stay of exec ution (under O 57, r 15), _to adduce further evidence (under O 57, r 13(2)),_ and for an extension of time (under O 57 r 17). See generally O 57, r 16 and paras 57/16/2 and 57/16/4 below. [emphasis added] 

However, they c ite no authority in support. Indeed, c ounsel for the appellants and the respondents have not been able to find any. Nor have they been able to find any reported dec ision where a single judge sitting as the Court of Appeal dec ided on an applic ation to adduc e fresh evidenc e. In c ontrast, the c ases disc overed all c onc ern applic ations to adduc e further evidenc e heard by the full Court of Appeal. 

5       In _Roberto Building Material Pte Ltd v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2003] 2 SLR 353</span>, the full Court of Appeal stated at [23] that they were inc lined to take a wider view of the first limb as they regarded it as a fac ilitative provision to assist the Court of Appeal. A similar view was taken in the c ase of _Bank of India v Rai Bahadur Singh_ <span class="citation">[1993] 2 SLR 592</span> where the Court of Appeal (Judith Prakash JC (as she then was) sitting as a single judge) held at [20] that: 

 The intent of legislature [in relation to s 36(1) of the Supreme Court of Judic ature Ac t] was to avoid burdening a three-judge c ourt with interloc utory applic ations relating to an appeal whic h c ould be more expeditiously and less expensively disposed of before a single judge. 

It follows that the c ourt should be slow to hold that it lac ks jurisdic tion to entertain applic ations lest legislative intention be defeated. 

6       I now turn to examine more c losely the wording of the first limb. So far as the word “direc tion” is c onc erned, I do not think there was any intention on the part of the legislature to use it 


in a sense different from “order”. As Lord Merriman P opined in _Benson v Benson_ [1941] 2 All ER 335 at 341: 

 Counsel for the petitioner has direc ted my attention to the OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY, from whic h it is quite c lear, as I should myself have supposed, that in c ertain c ontexts “order” and “direc tion” are interc hangeable terms. A “direc tion” is said to be “an order to be c arried out,” and “order,” for example, so far as the Supreme Court is c onc erned, is said to be “a direc tion other than final judgment,” and I should find it very diffic ult indeed, for the purposes of this Ac t, to draw any sensible distinc tion between a direc tion of the Board of Control that the statutory maximum period should be enlarged and an order to the same effec t. 

7       The word “inc idental” is defined in _The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary_ , vol 1, (Oxford University Press, 1993 Ed) as “something c asual or of sec ondary importanc e; not direc tly relevant to ...”. A direc tion whic h disposed of an appeal would therefore not be “inc idental”. 

8       The Court of Appeal in the _Roberto_ c ase (see [5] _supra_ ) stated at [10] that: 

 By qualifying the expression “direc tion inc idental thereto” with the phrase “not involving the dec ision of the appeal” the legislature must have intended that any direc tion, so long as it does not involve the disposal of the appeal may be made by the single judge. 

I respec tfully agree. It is for the full c ourt to dec ide the appeal. However, I wonder why the legislature found it nec essary to add this qualifying phrase when the word “inc idental” would already have suffic ed. As pointed out earlier, a direc tion whic h disposed of an appeal would c ertainly not be “inc idental”. In my view, the answer is to be found in the meaning of the word “involving”. 

9       The word “involve”, as defined in _The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary_ (see [7] _supra_ ), c ould mean “inc lude as essential; imply, c all for, entail”. However, the word “involve” is also defined in the same dic tionary as synonymous with “affec t”. Using the word in this latter sense, “not involving the dec ision of the appeal” bec omes “not _affecting_ the dec ision of the appeal”. Construed thus, the phrase would not be superfluous and would sit c omfortably with the word “inc idental”. Thus, in order to fall within the first limb, not only must the direc tion be c asual or of sec ondary importanc e, but it must also not _affect_ the dec ision of the appeal. 

10     As laid down in _Ladd v Marshall_ [1954] 3 All ER 745, the sec ond of three c onditions to be satisfied for the adduc tion of fresh evidenc e is that the evidenc e must be suc h that, if given, it would probably have an important influenc e on the result of the c ase, although it need not be dec isive. If the evidenc e satisfies this c ondition, it follows that it would probably affec t the dec ision of the appeal. Ac c ordingly, a direc tion or order giving liberty to adduc e further evidenc e at the appeal would fail to qualify as an “inc idental direc tion not involving the dec ision of the appeal”. 

11     This probably explains why, in prac tic e, the Registry of the Supreme Court normally fixes suc h applic ations before the full Court of Appeal. Two other prac tic al c onsiderations oc c urred to me. First, under s 36(3) of the Ac t, any order made by a single judge pursuant to s 36(1) may be disc harged or varied by the full Court of Appeal. On a matter as c ritic al to the parties as the adduc tion of fresh evidenc e, the likelihood of an applic ation being made to the full Court of Appeal for review of the single judge’s dec ision had to be high. In that event, the full Court of Appeal would be re-c onsidering the same question. That would defeat the purpose of having a single judge hear it in the first plac e. 


12     Sec ond, in view of the unc ertainty, the parties would still have to prepare their c ases in the alternative, one on the basis that the additional evidenc e was adduc ed and the other, without the same. A direc tion by the single judge would not have settled the question (espec ially in the instant appeals where both sides sought to adduc e further evidenc e). Therefore, no advantage would be obtained by making suc h an applic ation before a single judge. 

13     For the above reasons, I ruled that I had no jurisdic tion to hear the applic ations for the adduc tion of fresh evidenc e and direc ted that they be adjourned to be heard before the full Court of Appeal. At the request of the parties, I also direc ted that affidavits in reply in respec t of eac h Notic e of Motion be filed by the respec tive respondents by 17 September 2004. Costs were reserved to the Court of Appeal.
