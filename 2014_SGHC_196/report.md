**Introduction** 

1       Prior to the trial of an ac tion, it is quite usual for parties to engage in different forms of interloc utory applic ations of varying c omplexities. They are often either a sourc e of distrac tion or useful ammunition for trial preparation. However when the dust is settled after the resolution of the interloc utories, it is essential for the c laimant not to lose sight of or ignore the primary requirement to prove its c laim. This is espec ially so if the c laim is for a liquidated sum based on an allegedly unpaid c ontrac tual debt. This was, unfortunately for the c laimant, prec isely what happened in this c ase. 

2       The trial of the ac tion only c onc erned the defendants’ c ounterc laims against 13 Groupon entities from 13 different c ountries for numerous unpaid vouc hers that had allegedly been redeemed, the plaintiffs’ c laims having been dismissed for failure to c omply with an “unless order”. Separate and distinc t c laim amounts were pleaded against eac h of the 13 Groupon entities. However, only bare partic ulars were provided in respec t of eac h c ounterc laim. Not unexpec tedly, this prompted the plaintiffs to apply for further and better partic ulars of the respec tive c laim amounts. The applic ation was suc c essfully resisted by the defendants. They were able to c onvinc e the Assistant Registrar that the partic ulars sought relate to matters of evidenc e and henc e need not be pleaded. 

3       Having taken the position that the breakdown of eac h of the c laim amounts relates to evidenc e, the defendants would be expec ted to provide the evidenc e at the trial to prove the respec tive c laim amounts against eac h of the plaintiffs. Inexplic ably, this was not done. In their Opening Statement, the defendants sought to advanc e their c laim on an aggregate basis, _ie_ , by purporting to add up all the redeemed vouc hers less the total amounts paid by the plaintiffs to prove 


the balanc e amount outstanding from all 13 plaintiffs c ollec tively. In response to my observation at the start of the trial on the lac k of evidential basis to support the total number of redeemed vouc hers and that the c laim amounts need to be proved against eac h of the 13 plaintiffs separately and not on an aggregate basis, two exhibits, D1 and D2 were belatedly tendered by the defendants. They c omprised spreadsheets, the origins of whic h were not satisfac torily explained. More will be said of the exhibits below. For now, it suffic es to say that it is not c lear how the spreadsheets were prepared. Further, tabulating the figures in a spreadsheet does not dispense with the basic requirement to prove the c laim amounts. The defendants c laim that they were not able to provide all the supporting doc uments bec ause the doc uments had earlier been seized by the Commerc ial Affairs Department (“CAD”) in c onnec tion with the plaintiffs’ c omplaint. However no evidenc e was led to show that they took any steps to sec ure the release of the doc uments from the CAD to fulfil their disc overy obligations. Nonetheless they were still able to produc e a “ _sampling_ ” of the primary doc uments but this was of little c omfort to the defendants bec ause, based on those doc uments, the sums simply did not add up to support the pleaded c laim amounts. No explanation was offered as to why the defendants were able to provide a sampling of the primary doc uments when all had allegedly been seized by the CAD. 

4       Rec ognising that there are severe gaps in exhibits D1 and D2, the defendants sought to address the flaws of their c ase in seeking to rely on alleged “admissions” by the plaintiffs’ representative in an earlier affidavit filed in c onnec tion with the defendants’ applic ation to disc harge a Mareva Injunc tion then in forc e against them. These “admissions” are not the usual admissions whic h a party relies on to obtain judgment under O 27 r 3 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”). None of them admits to the c laim amounts. Instead they are statements in an affidavit (extrac ted from a different c ontext) whic h the defendants seek to rely on to prove _one_ c omponent of the c laim amounts against the plaintiffs. There are many diffic ulties with suc h an approac h, the most serious of whic h is the c onspic uous fac t that relianc e on the alleged “admissions” would result in c laim amounts quite different, some higher and some lower, from the pleaded c laim amounts. No explanation was forthc oming from the defendants to rec onc ile the c onflic ting amounts. In fac t, they readily c onc ede that they simply c annot be rec onc iled. To date, no applic ation has been made to amend the pleaded c laim amounts to those arrived at on the basis of this new “admissions” c ase theory. Naturally this approac h took the plaintiffs by surprise sinc e the c ase whic h they were asked to meet at the c losing submissions was quite different from the c ase as pleaded. Is suc h an approac h permissible to prove the c laim amounts? Clearly not. As suc h, the various attempts by the defendants to plug the evidential gaps of their c laims not only failed to address them, they in fac t highlighted the gaps and henc e c ompounded the defendants’ shortc omings as regards proof or the lac k thereof of their c laims. 

5       As it turned out, this was not the only problem that the defendants fac ed in their quest to prove their c laims. The c ontrac tual arrangement between the parties required the defendants to submit evidenc e of valid redemption of the vouc hers to the plaintiffs within 28 days of the vouc hers having been validly redeemed by the end-c onsumer failing whic h the defendants “shall lose its right to rec eive” payment. Both parties relied on the same c lause for different purposes and eac h adopted diametric ally opposing views on the question of the burden of proof. Was it for the defendants to prove that the evidenc e of valid redemption was submitted within 28 days or for the plaintiffs to establish that suc h evidenc e was submitted outside the 28-day window? The defendants c laimed that this requirement was never previously insisted upon and was only pleaded by the plaintiffs at a late stage of the proc eedings. Yet, no waiver or estoppel was pleaded by the defendants in response. 

6       Having broadly set out my general observations on the relevant issues, I turn now to provide the bac kground to the present dispute. 


**The facts** 

**_The parties_** 

7       The 13 plaintiffs are related entities worldwide whic h are eac h partly owned by Groupon Inc , a 

c ompany inc orporated in the United States of Americ a. [note: 1] Where relevant, eac h of these Groupon entities will be individually referred to with a suffix indic ating its geographic al loc ation. Therefore the first plaintiff will be referred to as “Groupon UK”, the sec ond plaintiff as “Groupon Franc e” and so on. 

8       The plaintiffs’ primary business is in the running of “deal-of-the-day” [note: 2] websites where disc ount vouc hers for a range of advertised goods and servic es may be purc hased by internet users. To be c lear, the ac tual provision of suc h goods and servic es to the end-c onsumer is not by the plaintiffs themselves; instead, this is typic ally undertaken by various merc hants who have c ontrac ted with the plaintiffs to have their goods and servic es promoted at a disc ounted rate on the plaintiffs’ 

online platform. [note: 3] However there may also be instanc es where the c ontrac ting merc hant is not 

the ac tual goods/servic e provider (as in the present c ase). [note: 4] To illustrate, this may oc c ur where a merc hant whic h c ontrac ts to advertise hotel stay pac kages on the plaintiffs’ websites is not ac tually the hotel itself but, for example, a travel agenc y. In all instanc es, however, the proc ess whic h the end-c onsumer has to go through is the same: first, he purc hases a vouc her direc tly from the plaintiffs online; then, he looks to the c ontrac ting merc hant to redeem the vouc her and obtain the purc hased good or servic e as the c ase may be, and this usually involves him having to present a 

c omputer print-out of the vouc her to the merc hant. [note: 5] 

9       Subsequently, the merc hant would seek to obtain payment from the plaintiffs in respec t of the 

redeemed vouc hers ac c ording to the mec hanism provided under the c ontrac t with the plaintiffs. [note: 6] The sum payable to the merc hant is usually stipulated as the pric e of the vouc her less an agreed 

suc c ess fee to whic h the plaintiffs are entitled and any tax whic h is payable. [note: 7] 

10     The first defendant was inc orporated on 9 Marc h 2011 as a private limited c ompany of whic h the third and fourth defendants are listed as direc tors and equal shareholders. Its business is c onc erned with hotel management, c onsultanc y servic es, luxury property management and booking 

servic es. [note: 8] The sec ond defendant is a sole proprietorship registered on 24 August 2010 with the fourth defendant as its sole proprietor and it provides a similar but more limited range of servic es 

than the first defendant. [note: 9] However, ac c ording to its c orporate profile maintained with the Ac c ounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, the sec ond defendant had c eased c arrying on 

business prior to the c ommenc ement of the trial. [note: 10] Both the first and sec ond defendants are relatively young set-ups and they share the same registered address in Textile Centre along Jalan 

Sultan. [note: 11] 

**_The dispute_** 

11     The first and sec ond defendants c ontrac ted as merc hants with the plaintiffs under agreements 

whic h shall hereinafter be referred to c ollec tively as “the Co-operation Agreements”. [note: 12] It was agreed that the first and sec ond defendants would provide pac kaged holiday villa stays at promotional 

rates in Bali, Indonesia [note: 13] and that the plaintiffs would advertise and sell vouc hers for the enjoyment of these disc ounted servic es on their websites. 


12     The present dispute arose from the plaintiffs’ alleged failure to make payment on numerous vouc hers whic h were allegedly redeemed by end-c onsumers with the first and sec ond defendants. The plaintiffs’ response, however, was that the first and sec ond defendants have failed to prove their c laims and in any event were not entitled to payment on these vouc hers based on the terms of the Co-operation Agreements. 

**_The procedural history_** 

13     The plaintiffs c ommenc ed this suit on 5 April 2012 as a result of the first and sec ond defendants’ failure to provide end-c onsumers with the hospitality servic es they had c ontrac ted to 

provide under the Co-operation Agreements. [note: 14] Various c auses of ac tion were formulated by 

the plaintiffs [note: 15] but I shall not elaborate upon them here bec ause, as will be explained shortly, the plaintiffs’ c laim was ultimately not proc eeded with. 

14     The plaintiffs also c onc urrently filed an _ex parte_ applic ation for a Mareva Injunc tion against the 

defendants on the same day. [note: 16] This applic ation was heard by Lai Siu Chiu J on 10 April 2012 

and the injunc tion was granted. [note: 17] However more than a year later, on 20 May 2013, Lai J 

made an order to disc harge the injunc tion on the defendants’ applic ation. [note: 18] It is expedient to flag out here that, in the present proc eedings, the defendants have sought to rely on alleged “admissions” made by Ms Adeline Seah (“Ms Seah”) in an affidavit filed for the purposes of resisting the disc harge of the Mareva Injunc tion. I shall elaborate upon these “admissions” in due c ourse. 

15     On 24 Oc tober 2012, the defendants amended their defenc e to inc lude the present 

c ounterc laim for a c ontrac tual debt of $290,552.86. [note: 19] The defendants alleged that this debt arose as a result of numerous validly redeemed vouc hers remaining unpaid by the plaintiffs in breac h 

of the Co-operation Agreements. [note: 20] To explain how the debt of $290,552.86 had been arrived at, the defendants produc ed a basic summary table in their pleadings whic h c ontained a breakdown of figures in respec t of eac h of the 13 plaintiffs (“the Pleadings Table”), although I should qualify this statement with the observation that the c laims against Groupon Australia and Groupon New Zealand 

were grouped together on an aggregate basis without any explanation. [note: 21] Essentially, the Pleadings Table displayed how eac h c laim amount was arrived at by juxtaposing the sums purportedly due on redeemed vouc hers from eac h plaintiff against the sums purportedly paid by them; the differenc e was then totalled up to arrive at the aggregate c laim of $290,552.86. 

16     The defendants’ pleaded c ase did not provide partic ulars of either the _number_ or _identity_ of redeemed vouc hers whic h they c laimed remained unpaid by eac h plaintiff. This prompted an 

applic ation for further and better partic ulars by the plaintiffs on 14 February 2013. [note: 22] This applic ation, however, was suc c essfully resisted by the defendants before Assistant Registrar Teo 

Guan Kee (“AR Teo”) on 11 Marc h 2013. [note: 23] Importantly, the defendants’ basis for objec ting to the applic ation was that the Pleadings Table provided the plaintiffs with suffic ient notic e of the c ase whic h they had to meet and that partic ulars of the unpaid vouc hers c onstituted evidenc e whic h did 

not have to be pleaded. [note: 24] 

17     At about the same time as the plaintiffs’ applic ation for further and better partic ulars, the 

defendants also filed an applic ation for sec urity for c osts on 18 February 2013. [note: 25] AR Teo heard this applic ation on 14 Marc h 2013 and ordered the plaintiffs to furnish sec urity in the sum of 

$50,000 within 14 days of the order. [note: 26] The deadline lapsed, however, without the plaintiffs 


c omplying. [note: 27] 

18     Consequently, at a subsequent pre-trial c onferenc e on 22 May 2013, Assistant Registrar Cornie Ng (“AR Ng”) ordered that unless sec urity was provided by 5 June 2013, (a) the plaintiffs’ c laim would be dismissed with c osts and (b) judgment would be entered for the defendants on the c ounterc laim. [note: 28] Onc e again, the plaintiffs failed to c omply. 

19     Subsequently, the plaintiffs took steps to appeal against that part of AR Ng’s dec ision whic h c onc erned the entering of judgment on the c ounterc laim and eventually suc c eeded in setting it aside 

before Woo Bih Li J on 23 August 2013. [note: 29] However, as the plaintiffs did not appeal against the 

dismissal of their original c laim, [note: 30] it stands dismissed and is not before this c ourt. Ac c ordingly, only the c ounterc laim remains to be c onsidered. 

**The defendants’ evolving claims** 

**_The task of proving the counterclaim_** 

20     I begin by noting that in every c laim for a liquidated sum arising from an allegedly unpaid c ontrac tual debt, it is c ruc ial for the c laimant to satisfac torily prove how the c laim amount is arrived at. In some instanc es, this will be a straightforward task. Take for example a c reditor seeking to rec over a lump sum extended as a simple loan to the debtor. Suc h a c reditor should not enc ounter any diffic ulty in proving the amount whic h he alleges is owed to him upon maturity of the loan period; he needs only to produc e the loan agreement stating the amount to be repaid to him. In other instanc es, however, the task of proving the c laim amount may involve more c omplex c onsiderations. The present c ase is perhaps one suc h example. Having said that, however simple or c omplex the c ase may be, onc e the c laimant dec ides to bring the c laim, he bears the burden to prove his c ase. No “disc ount” on the burden of proof is to be extended on ac c ount of the c omplexity of the c ase. 

21     For starters, the defendants’ c ounterc laim does not involve the rec overy of a single lump sum. It might appear to be that way if one looks only at the total c ounterc laim amount of $290,552.86 but that is apt to mislead. It must be apprec iated that this total figure is in ac tual fac t a func tion of 13 different c laims against 13 different plaintiffs, with eac h c laim no doubt having to be proved separately. The present c ase also differs from my previous illustration in a further respec t, whic h is that eac h c laim amount here arises from a series of transac tions (instead of a single one) bec ause eac h c laim is essentially founded on the c ollec tive value of numerous distinc t vouc hers whic h were allegedly redeemed by end-c onsumers with the first and sec ond defendants at different times. Evidenc e of these redeemed vouc hers is therefore c ruc ial. However, that is not the end of the matter bec ause it is not the defendants’ c ase that _all_ the redeemed vouc hers remain unpaid. The defendants say that the plaintiffs did make payments but that these payments were short of the amounts due and owing on the validly redeemed vouc hers. Ac c ordingly, evidenc e of how muc h eac h plaintiff did pay will also have to be furnished by the defendants as a further fac et of their c laims in order to arrive at the balanc e outstanding amount owing by eac h of the 13 plaintiffs. 

22     The foregoing observations show that effort must be properly undertaken by the defendants to prove their c laims. However, this is not by any stretc h a task whic h is plagued by insoluble problems of proof. It is plainly c apable of proof provided it is approac hed with due diligenc e. In this regard, it is perhaps useful to undersc ore the fac t that the defendants’ c laim against eac h plaintiff in essenc e involves no more than the simple arithmetic c ombination of two c omponents presented in the formula below: 


 Claim amount = Total value of validly redeemed vouc hers (“Component A”) − Total amount paid by the plaintiff (“Component B”) 

23     As I have stated, however, the defendants had overlooked the basic nec essity of proving eac h of their c laims. They found proof of Component A, in partic ular, to be seriously problematic. The result of this failing was that the c laim amounts were c onstantly in flux during the c ourse of the trial and even beyond that as the defendants sought desperately to address the evidential gaps in their c ase. 

**_Charting the evolution of the defendants’ claims_** 

24     The defendants’ c ounterc laim as viewed from the plaintiffs’ perspec tive no doubt resembled a “moving target” as it evolved ac c ording to the varying and troublingly irrec onc ilable evidential sourc es that the defendants sought to rely on. It is by all ac c ounts unsatisfac tory that a c laim for liquidated damages should take on suc h a fluid c harac ter but even more so where, as was the c ase here, the defendants appeared to hold out at the interloc utory stage that their c laims were grounded in evidenc e that would be adduc ed at the trial. The plaintiffs were no doubt c aught by surprise when this did not materialise and, indeed, muc h c ourt time was unproduc tively spent on trying to understand the defendants’ ultimately ephemeral c laims. 

25     The paragraphs whic h follow thus provide a sketc h of how the defendants’ c laims meandered through the c ourse of the proc eedings. This ac c ount is further c omplemented by a series of tables annexed to this judgment (“the Annexed Tables”) whic h will be referred to at the appropriate junc tures. The Annexed Tables would show at a glanc e how the c laims against eac h of the 13 plaintiffs had evolved from the pleadings to the oral c losing submissions. 

_The defendants’ pleaded position_ 

26     As mentioned earlier at [15], the defendants’ pleaded position was reflec ted in the Pleadings Table whic h showed how the total c ounterc laim amount of $290,552.86 was arrived at by totting up the individual c laim amounts (exc ept for Groupon Australia and Groupon New Zealand) whic h were in turn obtained after netting off the figures displayed for Component B against those for Component A 

in respec t of eac h c laim. [note: 31] No further partic ulars were provided but, if anything, the breakdown of information in the Pleadings Table at least gave the impression that the defendants were c ognisant of the need to prove eac h individual c laim as pleaded and of how this task was to be approac hed. That, however, turned out to be an illusory indic ation. 

_The defendants’ position at trial_ 

27     At the c ommenc ement of the trial, the defendants inexplic ably set out in their Opening 

Statement that they would be proving their c laims on an aggregate basis. [note: 32] In other words, they were beginning from the premise that it was permissible to effec tively lump up their 13 c laims into one indisc rete c laim for $290,552.86. They then intended to go about proving this global sum by simply subtrac ting the total amount paid from the total value of redeemed vouc hers for all the 13 plaintiffs c ollec tively without any c onc eivable attempt to relate whic h of these payments or redeemed vouc hers were c onnec ted to whic h partic ular c laim. As I stressed earlier, however, the c ounterc laim here is made up of 13 c laims, eac h one distinc t from the rest; henc e the defendants’ proposed approac h whic h blurred the lines between c laims was wholly inappropriate. 

28     Further, on the fac e of the c ounterc laims, there are two c ounterc laimants – the first and sec ond defendants. The pleadings did not identify the amounts whic h were due and owing from whic h of the plaintiffs to the first and/or sec ond defendants. I then sought c larific ation from the defendants’ 


c ounsel, Mr Rasanathan, who upon taking instruc tions c onfirmed that all the c ounterc laims were being pursued entirely by the first defendant. Mr Rasanathan at the same time informed the c ourt that the total c laim amount would be reduc ed from the pleaded amount of $290,552.86 to $289,118.43 to take into ac c ount a payment of $1,434.43 rec eived from Groupon Sweden after the c ommenc ement of the proc eedings. I indic ated to Mr Rasanathan that if this was the extent of the amendment, he c ould apply to amend the c ounterc laim at the appropriate time. There was c ertainly no suggestion from Mr Rasanathan that, arising from his c onfirmation, all vouc hers redeemed and payments rec eived by the sec ond defendant would have to be deleted from the c laim amounts. The signific anc e of this point will be elaborated below when I c onsider the first defendant’s revised c laims whic h, _inter alia_ , seek to delete all vouc hers redeemed and payments rec eived by the sec ond defendant. It is not c lear why this was done by the defendants. For now, suffic e it to say that when the fourth defendant was c ross-examined, she was referred to various Co-operation Agreements suc h as those c onc erning Groupon UK and Groupon Australia whic h were, on their fac e, entered into only with the sec ond defendant. This raised the question whether the first defendant was the proper c ounterc laimant in respec t of those Co-operation Agreements entered into with the sec ond defendant. As this point was not spec ific ally pleaded by the plaintiffs, I enquired from c ounsel for the plaintiffs, Mr Navinder Singh, whether the plaintiffs were planning to take this point. Mr Singh subsequently c onfirmed that the plaintiffs ac c ept that the first defendant was indeed the proper c ontrac ting party for all the Cooperation Agreements with all the 13 plaintiffs. With this c onfirmation from both parties, I will henc eforth c onsider all the c laims in the name of the first defendant. 

29     I indic ated to the first defendant that they still had to prove their 13 pleaded c laims on an individualised basis. However the manner in whic h they sought to do so was most perplexing. This was bec ause they relied for this purpose c hiefly on another summary table exhibited in the fourth defendant’s affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief (“the AEIC Table”) whic h c ontained _virtually the same_ set 

of data as that in the Pleadings Table. [note: 33] I failed to see how this new table, whic h essentially mirrored the first, did anything to advanc e the first defendant’s c ase evidentially in the absenc e of the relevant underlying primary doc uments. I shall return to elaborate on this shortc oming of the AEIC Table in greater detail below. 

30     I should mention here, however, that the first defendant did point me to a “sampling” of 

redeemed vouc hers whic h purportedly supported the figures for Component A in the AEIC Table. [note: 34] However, given the simplic ity of the AEIC Table, it was bereft of any explanation as to how the 

figures c ontained therein were c orrelated to the limited sampling of vouc hers whic h were adduc ed. Indeed, the fac t that these vouc hers represented mere _samples_ in support of the first defendant’s c laims was a c lear c onc ession that they did not possess the entire body of evidenc e required to prove their c laims as pleaded. The first defendant explained that they were handic apped in this regard as their doc uments had been seized by the CAD as part of an investigation into the defendants’ 

business ac tivities pursuant to a c omplaint lodged by Groupon Singapore. [note: 35] However, as I noted earlier, no evidenc e was led as to whether the defendants had taken any steps to proc ure the release of suc h doc uments to fulfil their disc overy obligations. The c ourt is c ertainly not in the habit of taking it upon itself to fill the evidential gaps in a party’s c ase. 

31     Rec ognising the defic ienc ies in the AEIC Table, the defendants then sought to supplement it by tendering two exhibits on the sec ond day of the trial: D1 and D2. These exhibits were in the nature of spreadsheets and they c ompiled information regarding Component A and Component B respec tively. To elaborate, D1 purportedly tabulated eac h vouc her whic h the defendants c laimed was validly redeemed, serialised ac c ording to the individual vouc her c odes and ac c ompanied by figures showing the total amounts due in respec t of these vouc hers to the first and sec ond defendants. As for D2, this spreadsheet displayed the payments rec eived by the first and sec ond defendants from eac h of 


the plaintiffs ac c ording to bank statements whic h were adduc ed. 

32     In my view, however, the produc tion of these two exhibits also did not assist the first defendant. First, the origins of D1 and D2 were never satisfac torily explained to me. At the time of their produc tion during the trial, I inquired with Mr Rasanathan as to how and when these spreadsheets were prepared. He replied that he would need to c hec k with his c lients. In any event, these are matters for the fourth defendant to explain sinc e D1 and D2 were introduc ed while she was still on the stand. Other than c laiming that the exhibits were prepared “some time ago” and not overnight, the fourth defendant was not able to explain how they were prepared and the sourc es of information used in their preparation. I spec ific ally asked her to c hec k when the spreadsheets were ac t ually _created_. She said that she would ac c ess her c omputer to obtain the information but she failed to respond with the information even after a reminder from me. Eventually Mr Rasanathan informed the c ourt that D1 and D2 were prepared some time between August and Oc tober 2012. Quite apart from the fac t that this was for the fourth defendant to explain, Mr Rasanathan was not able to offer how they were in fac t prepared. This lac k of a proper explanation was espec ially problematic in so far as D1 was c onc erned bec ause D1 was set out muc h in the same way as the two summary tables before it ( _ie_ , the Pleadings Table and the AEIC Table): it did not c ontain c rossreferenc es to any of the primary doc uments from whic h its figures were purportedly derived. Therefore, if D1 had been prepared with the benefit of the primary doc uments, _ie_ , the validly redeemed vouc hers (whic h must be so if it was to have any probative value), then it begs the question why the first defendant was no longer able to provide them to support their c laims. The total amount owing from the validly redeemed vouc hers would to some extent depend on the total number of redeemed vouc hers. In this c onnec tion, it bears mention that while the c ounterc laim did not plead the total number of redeemed vouc hers, that figure was however provided in D1 with no explanation as to the sourc e of that information. To c ompound the problem even more, with the exc eption of Groupon Australia, Groupon New Zealand and Groupon Mexic o (in respec t of whom the c laim amounts are either insignific ant or not seriously pursued) none of the total number of redeemed vouc hers in D tallied with that in Annex B (see [35] and [47] below) whic h the first defendant relied on to support their primary c ase. This appears c learly from the Annexed Tables whic h ac c ompany this judgment. As for D2, it fared better sinc e the doc umentary origin of the figures c ontained therein, _viz_ , the bank statements, were c ross-referenc ed. However, it must be emphasised that the information in D2 was meaningless on its own as it had to be read alongside D1 to arrive at the balanc e outstanding amounts c laimed to be owing from eac h of the 13 plaintiffs. 

33     Sec ond, even if one took pains to matc h the vouc her c odes in D1 to those vouc hers within what was provided in the “sample” pool, it was not c lear how the figures in D1 stating what was payable in respec t of eac h vouc her had been derived from the individual vouc her pric es. This was bec ause, in many instanc es, the differenc e between the two figures was so stark that I doubted it c ould be attributable to mere deduc tions of the plaintiffs’ suc c ess fee and any taxes paid from the displayed vouc her pric e. For example, for the Groupon vouc her with vouc her c ode 5/7461, the value 

of this vouc her whic h is c ontained in the Agreed Bundle is stated to be £1,100 [note: 36] whereas the amount stated to be payable to the first defendant for this same vouc her is stated in D1 as £259.35. [note: 37] D1 provides no explanation for this disc repanc y. Even if the differenc e was indeed due to 

the deduc tion of the suc c ess fee and tax paid, D1 did not make that c lear and, in any event, Mr Rasanathan also c ould not give a satisfac tory explanation for these rec urring disc repanc ies when I raised the matter with him. It was for the first defendant to explain but none was forthc oming. Simply put, then, D1 was of no evidential value on its own and c oupling it with whatever underlying primary evidenc e led only to more questions than answers. 

34     Third, I observe that even if the aforementioned defec ts in D1 were ignored and its figures 


ac c epted as ac c urately proven, a c ombined reading of D1 and D2 still did not produc e c laim amounts that equalled the pleaded c laims in the AEIC Table when, logic ally, this should have been the c ase. In this regard, another glanc e at the Annexed Tables will quic kly reveal that the c laim amounts arrived at by subtrac ting the figures in D2 from that in D1 had morphed from the pleaded c laims for a signific ant portion of the Groupon entities (namely, those in Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Belgium, Australia, and New Zealand). In fac t, the Annexed Table spec ific to Groupon New Zealand further illustrates what may perhaps even be an internal inc ongruenc y between D1 and D2 sinc e, if the figures therein are c orrec t, it would appear that Groupon New Zealand had ac tually made payments _in excess_ of what it owed to the first defendant. 

_The first defendant’s position in written closing submissions_ 

35     D1 and D2 were thus riddled with irremediable inc onsistenc ies and, realising this, the first defendant embarked on a novel route to prove their c laims in their written c losing submissions whic h 

annexed three further tables: Annex A, Annex B, and Annex C. [note: 38] I foc us for the moment on Annex A. 

36     Annex A largely c omprised figures whic h the first defendant said were derived from “admissions” made by Ms Seah in her affidavit dated 13 Marc h 2013 (“13 Marc h affidavit”) whic h was filed to resist the disc harge of the Mareva Injunc tion (see [14] above). It is important to point out that the statements made by Ms Seah in this affidavit c overed, _inter alia_ , the following ground: (a) the number of validly redeemed vouc hers in respec t of eac h plaintiff, (b) the amounts due to the first and sec ond defendants based on those vouc hers, (c ) the amounts paid by the respec tive plaintiffs, and (d) the amounts whic h the plaintiffs had to refund to end-c onsumers for the first and sec ond defendants’ 

failure to provide the hotel ac c ommodation in spite of the booking c onfirmation. [note: 39] Annex A inc luded only the first three c ategories of information whic h the first defendant attributed to Ms Seah. However, when I perused Ms Seah’s 13 Marc h affidavit on my own, I was surprised to find that the figures whic h she had provided therein differed frequently enough from what was tabulated in Annex A suc h that these inc ongruities c ould not be exc used on the basis of being mere tec hnic al errors in c ompilation. For example, while Ms Seah’s 13 Marc h affidavit states that Groupon UK had 

remitted €74,679.09 to the defendants, [note: 40] Annex A rec ords her as stating that this sum was in fac t €101,987.20. To provide another example, Ms Seah’s 13 Marc h affidavit states that Groupon 

Franc e remitted €27,974 to the defendants [note: 41] but Annex A rec ords her as stating that this sum was €58,410 instead. Annex A provides no explanation for these disc repanc ies. It therefore appeared that muc h of the information reproduc ed in Annex A was basic ally masquerading as Ms Seah’s affidavit evidenc e when, in fac t, the two did not tally. For that reason, I was inc lined to treat Annex A with nec essary c aution. 

37     However, leaving aside for the moment that there were serious questions over the integrity of the Annex A figures, I further noted that the first defendant was partic ularly selec tive in how they sought to use Ms Seah’s statements to prove their c laims. The reason for this was ostensibly bec ause, if Ms Seah’s affidavit evidenc e (as produc ed in Annex A) was adopted in its entirety, it would result in the first defendant’s c laims against a majority of the plaintiffs being wholly extinguished. This may c learly be gathered from the Annexed Tables whic h show that, based on Ms Seah’s evidenc e as tabulated in Annex A, many of the Groupon entities (namely, those in the UK, Franc e, Germany, Poland, Sweden, Belgium, Mexic o, and UAE) had _fully_ paid up on the amounts whic h were owing to the defendants in respec t of the redeemed vouc hers. In light of this, the first defendant urged me to ignore that partic ular part of Ms Seah’s “admissions” in the 13 Marc h affidavit whic h related to the amounts paid by eac h plaintiff and to prefer, instead, the figures c ontained in their unc hallenged exhibit D2. Ac c ording to the first defendant, I c ould properly subtrac t the figures in 


D2 (representing Component B) from the amounts owing based on Ms Seah’s 13 Marc h affidavit (representing Component A) to derive the amounts c laimed in Annex A. This approac h was highly doubtful. I shall disc uss its merits in greater detail below but it suffic es to observe for now that the mishmash of evidenc e c obbled together by the first defendant ultimately produc ed c laim amounts whic h departed erratic ally from what was pleaded. Some of these new c laims were higher and yet others lower than the pleaded c laims. _None_ of the 13 c laim amounts remained the same. Onc e again, this is borne out by the Annexed Tables. 

38     As mentioned earlier, the first defendant also relied on two other tables in their written c losing submissions: Annex B and Annex C. These were unrelated to the novel “admissions” c ase theory as desc ribed above. They were provided, instead, to plug the evidential gap whic h D1 was earlier intended to address, _viz_ , the lac k of proof regarding the validly redeemed vouc hers in respec t of eac h plaintiff ( _ie_ , Component A). However, both tables fell far short of their intended aim. 

39     It was not at all c lear how Annex C was intended to assist the first defendant. Annex C merely tabulated _some_ of the redeemed vouc hers from within the “sample” pool ac c ording to their vouc her c odes. It also displayed the vouc her pric e payable for eac h of these tabulated vouc hers. To begin with, it has already been observed at [30] and [32] above that the total value of the sampling of vouc hers produc ed simply did not add up to support the pleaded c laims and, moreover, if one sought to matc h the vouc her c odes in Annex C with the primary doc uments, one would find that the vouc her pric e whic h was reflec ted on the fac e of the vouc her itself did not c orrespond with that rec orded in Annex C. For example, the first vouc her serialised in Annex C (with vouc her c ode 4/0995) is stated to have the vouc her pric e of £499. However, when the same vouc her is loc ated in the Agreed Bundle, it 

appears on the fac e of that vouc her that the vouc her pric e is in fac t £1,835. [note: 42] The exac t same disc repanc y may again be observed when one moves down to the sec ond vouc her serialised in Annex C (with vouc her c ode 135/1162) and c ompares its stated vouc her pric e with that reflec ted on 

the ac tual vouc her itself in the Agreed Bundle. [note: 43] Annex C provides no explanation for these disc repanc ies. 

40     As for Annex B, it was simply a reinc arnation of the AEIC Table as it c ontained the same c olumns of information for Component A and Component B broken down ac c ording to the individual plaintiffs. Naturally, it was afflic ted with the same problem of being unsupported by the primary evidenc e to prove the stated number of vouc hers whic h were purportedly redeemed. 

41     There was, however, a notic eable differenc e in that some of the c laim amounts in Annex B were different from that whic h had been put forward at trial ac c ording to the AEIC Table. Mr Rasanathan explained that these c laim amounts had been deliberately modified so as to reflec t an alleged c onfirmation at trial that the sec ond defendant was abandoning its c laims. The new figures in Annex B were thus explic able on the basis that they no longer took into ac c ount the sums allegedly owing on redeemed vouc hers or paid by the plaintiffs in so far as the sec ond defendant was c onc erned. The result of this was that the c laim amounts in Annex B remained the same as what was pleaded only against c ertain plaintiffs (namely, Groupon UK, Poland, Mexic o, and UAE) while it was revised to reflec t the c hanged c irc umstanc es for the remaining plaintiffs. This may again be gathered from the Annexed Tables. 

42     However I found Mr Rasanathan’s explanation for the revision to be without foundation and that his c onfusion most likely stemmed from his failure to follow the trial. As observed earlier in [28] above, I had sought c larific ation from Mr Rasanathan on the sec ond day of the trial about the amounts owing to the first and sec ond defendants respec tively and, in reply, he merely c onfirmed that all the defendants’ c laims were being pursued entirely by the first defendant and that the total c ounterc laim amount was to be reduc ed to ac c ount for a small payment whic h had sinc e been made by Groupon 


Sweden. There was c ertainly no statement that, as a c onsequenc e of his c onfirmation, all the vouc hers redeemed with the sec ond defendant and alleged to be outstanding would have to be withdrawn or abandoned. Therefore I did not understand how it bec ame nec essary for the defendants to remove from their c laims against the 13 plaintiffs those vouc hers whic h they alleged were redeemed with the sec ond defendant. It was c lear to me that Mr Singh had effec tively ac c epted that whoever might have submitted the vouc hers for payment, it was done on behalf of the first defendant. This was after all in line with Mr Singh’s c onfirmation that, notwithstanding the fac t that some of the Co-operation Agreements might have been entered into with the sec ond defendant, he ac c epted that the first defendant was in fac t the proper c ontrac ting party. It did not make any sense for the defendants to delete all the vouc hers redeemed with the sec ond defendant. It also c annot be rec onc iled with Mr Rasanathan’s c larific ation that, arising from his c onfirmation that all the c ounterc laims are being pursued in the name of the first defendant, the total c laim would be reduc ed only to reflec t the small payment of $1,434,43 rec eived from Groupon Sweden. If his understanding had been that the total c laim amount was to be reduc ed to ac c ount for a deletion of the vouc hers redeemed by the sec ond defendant, the reduc tion would have been signific antly more. Finally there was no logic to delete the c laims purportedly made by the sec ond defendant. Clearly these c laims c ould be identified (despite the fourth defendant testifying to the c ontrary) sinc e they were, after all, the subjec t matter of the revision. Further, the sec ond defendant is already an existing party to the c ounterc laim and c ould rightly pursue the c laim if indeed it was the proper party to do so. Ac c ordingly, the new c laims in Annex B were the result of a c ompletely unwarranted revision. Nevertheless, I should add that I did not regard this to be in any way fatal to the first defendant’s c laims. I raised this just to illustrate the appalling manner in whic h the c ounterc laims were pursued. 

_The first defendant’s position during oral closing submissions_ 

43     There was yet a further evolution of the first defendant’s c laims during oral c losing submissions. Mr Rasanathan was hard-pressed to explain in a rational and c oherent manner how eac h of the c laims against the 13 plaintiffs were sought to be proven and, in his rather vain attempt at doing so, the waters were unfortunately muddied even further. For instanc e, the first defendant’s c laim against Groupon New Zealand was withdrawn c ompletely while no definitive stand was taken in respec t of Groupon Australia. This was not altogether surprising given that the first defendant’s c laims against both these plaintiffs had always been advanc ed on an aggregate basis (see [15] above). Therefore, when urged to indic ate what evidenc e he was relying on for eac h distinc t c laim, Mr Rasanathan ultimately c onc eded that he c ould not do so. Further, the first defendant also c hose to abandon their “admissions” c ase theory as an alternative basis of proof for some c laims (namely, against Groupon Switzerland, Poland, Sweden, Belgium and Mexic o) while they had no c hoic e but to hastily qualify other c laim amounts in Annex B when it was pointed out that the value of these c laims somehow outstripped the pleaded amounts (see, for example, the c laim against Groupon Switzerland). These developments are noted down in the Annexed Tables and, ultimately, they illustrated an alarming lac k of c onsistenc y in how the first defendant sought to prove their individual c laims. 

_The first defendant’s application to amend the counterclaim_ 

44     At the c lose of oral submissions, I direc ted the parties to address me on several issues of law with further written submissions. Mr Rasanathan, however, appeared to take this opportunity to launc h a last-ditc h attempt at proving how the first defendant’s 13 c laims were arrived at. His further 

submissions [note: 44] therefore inc luded an Amended Annex B whic h, as its name suggests, is modelled entirely after Annex B in terms of its presentation. The differenc es were that Amended Annex B had again c hanged the c laim amounts for a majority of the 13 plaintiffs and that it was ac c ompanied by c ertain explanatory notes whic h attempted to rationalise how these c hanges addressed earlier disc repanc ies. Mr Rasanathan also c onc urrently filed a fresh applic ation on 3 


September 2014 to amend his c ounterc laim so as to reflec t the new c laim amounts in Amended Annex 

B. [note: 45] For c ompleteness, it should be mentioned that the applic ation to amend did not also seek to inc lude the alternative c laim amounts advanc ed under the “admissions” c ase theory in Annex A. 

45     I heard the first defendant’s applic ation on 17 September 2014 and dismissed it. It is c lear that the applic ation to amend was made very late in the day – after oral c losing submissions. The only explanation provided by the first defendant for the late applic ation was that their business c ame to a halt as a result of the Mareva Injunc tion. They were therefore unable to afford the servic es of an ac c ountant to assist them in the proper c alc ulation of the c laim amounts. The first defendant c laimed that they realised the errors and mistakes over the c ourse of the trial. I do not ac c ept the explanation. The proper c alc ulation of the c laim amounts is a basic task to be undertaken prior to the filing of the c ounterc laim. It was not suc h a c omplex exerc ise whic h nec essarily required the servic es of an ac c ountant. More fundamentally, the applic ation sought to amend the balanc e outstanding amounts due and owing from the sec ond, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, ninth, and tenth plaintiffs. The amendments were ostensibly to delete the c laims in respec t of vouc hers redeemed by the sec ond defendant and to c orrec t c alc ulation errors. However, Mr Rasanathan readily c onc eded during the hearing before me that the first defendant does not have the c omplete set of primary doc uments to support the revised total amount owing on the redeemed vouc hers. The first defendant reiterated that they seek to rely on D1 to prove their c laims. As I will explain at [55]–[59] below, without the primary doc uments, the c laims c annot be proved with referenc e to D1. Ac c ordingly, I saw no purpose in allowing suc h an amendment whic h is a non-starter and in this regard, I c an do no better than to c ite the dec ision of Judith Prakash JC (as she then was) in _Hong Leong Finance Ltd v Famco (S) Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR(R) 224</span> at [13]–[15]: 

 I ... c onsidered the substanc e of the proposed amendment itself c arefully. In my view, even if the amendment were allowed, it would not, on the basis of the evidenc e plac ed before the c ourt to date, afford SPP a real and viable defenc e. 

 At the c lose of the plaintiffs' c ase there was no evidence that they had ac tual knowledge of any breac h of fiduc iary duty on the part of M/s Chew and Cheng. Ac c ordingly, SPP would have to rely on the proposition that in all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, the plaintiffs "ought to have known" that Mr Chew and Mr Cheng were ac ting in breac h of duty in proc uring the issue of the c orporate guarantee. Again, the evidence does not substantiate any suc h c onstruc tive knowledge. What the plaintiffs knew as shown by the testimony of James Sim, their senior manager, was that sometime in August 1984, Famc o had bec ome a subsidiary of SPP and SPP was ac c ordingly prepared to replac e the pledge of shares given by FYH for its subsidiary's obligations by its own c orporate guarantee. It was perfec tly reasonable for the plaintiffs to ac c ept this at fac e value. In business transac tions, it is c ommon plac e for a holding c ompany to guarantee the obligations of its subsidiaries either from the outset or from suc h time as the holding c ompany ac quires the subsidiary. There were thus, in this c ase, no suspic ious c irc umstanc es that should have put the plaintiffs on guard or alerted the plaintiffs to the fac t that something not quite proper might be going on. The plaintiffs' ac c eptanc e of the c orporate guarantee without further investigation c annot therefore be impugned. 

 I therefore regarded the proposed amended defenc e vis-à-vis the plaintiffs as a non-starter. 

 [emphasis added in bold] 

46     For c ompleteness, I should say that if there was in fac t evidenc e before me to support the revised c laims, I would have awarded the reduc ed amounts even without the nec essity of an amendment sinc e the revision was merely to delete the vouc hers redeemed by the sec ond defendant 


and to c orrec t c alc ulation errors. 

**_Summarising the first defendant’s claims and the evidence relied on_** 

47     Despite the highly unsatisfac tory way in whic h the first defendant’s c laims shifted throughout the proc eedings, I note that they did finally c ome to rest on Annex A and/or Annex B of the first defendant’s written c losing submissions, with both yielding different amounts. As between the two, Annex B was relied on as the first defendant’s main plank. The figures c ontained therein were intended to prove the first defendant’s original pleaded c laim amounts in respec t of some plaintiffs and its revised c laim amounts in respec t of others. Annex A was the first defendant’s alternative plank. It was intended to prove entirely new c laim amounts against all the plaintiffs based on the “admissions” c ase theory. 

48     To determine whether the first defendant had proved the c laim amounts in either Annex A or Annex B, the evidentiary basis on whic h eac h of these doc uments were in turn founded had to be c losely sc rutinised. In this regard, I intend to examine the two following piec es of evidenc e proffered by the first defendant: 

 (a) the AEIC Table as proof of the c laim amounts in Annex B; and 

 (b) the alleged “admissions” by Ms Seah as proof of the c laim amounts in Annex A. 

49     Before embarking on suc h an inquiry, however, I should first c onsider a _threshold_ objec tion made by Mr Singh in response to the evolving nature of the first defendant’s c laims. I have desc ribed Mr Singh’s objec tion in this manner bec ause he argued that the mere fac t that the c laim amounts in Annex A and Annex B were different from those c ontained in the pleadings meant that the c ounterc laim must fail _in limine_. In other words, ac c ording to Mr Singh, there was stric tly no need to determine whether the c laim amounts in Annex A and Annex B had been proven sinc e their very departure from the pleadings was self-defeating in nature. 

**The plaintiffs’ threshold objection** 

50     Mr Singh’s threshold objec tion c an be stated as follows. [note: 46] First, he labelled the first defendant’s pleaded c laim for the spec ific liquidated sum of $290,552.86 as an ac tion for damages, in partic ular spec ial damages. Next, he said it was c ruc ial to notic e that this was the only relief sought by the first defendant in their pleadings on the basis of allegedly unpaid vouc hers. Importantly, there 

was no explic it prayer for general damages to be assessed. [note: 47] In these c irc umstanc es, Mr Singh submitted that the c ourt had no power to award a sum lower than that whic h was spec ific ally pleaded under the guise of general damages. That was so even if the loss of suc h a lesser amount was in fac t supported by the evidenc e. 

51     I do not agree with Mr Singh’s submissions. In my judgment, his starting premise was mistaken as it involved a misc harac terisation of the prec ise nature of the c ounterc laim. The first defendant’s c ounterc laim here is _not_ an ac tion for damages, it is an ac tion for a c ontrac tual debt (or an ac tion for a fixed sum as it is sometimes referred to). That the two kinds of ac tions generally arise in very different c irc umstanc es and generate very different c onsiderations is made c lear by the learned authors of _The Law of Contract in Singapore_ (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Ac ademy Publishing, 2012) (“ _The Law of Contract in Singapore_ ”) at para 23.042: 

 Where an ac tion for a fixed sum is brought, there is no need to c onsider c onc epts suc h as remoteness and/or mitigation of damages. Nor, in most c ases, is there a need for quantific ation or 


 assessment. Those c onc epts are irrelevant. Remoteness and mitigation issues are only relevant in c laims for unliquidated damages for breac h of a c ontrac tual term. This should be obvious onc e we apprec iate that the action for a fixed sum or debt has nothing to do with compensation. Such a claim simply allows the innocent party to recover what was promised to him, and is not a “money-substitute” for it. To use Lord Diploc k’s language of primary and sec ondary obligations [in Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd [1980] AC 827], the action for a fixed sum enforces performance of the primary obligation of payment, as specified by the contracting parties in their contract; whereas an action for damages enforces performance of the secondary obligation to pay damages which is imposed by law when a contractual promise is breached by one of the contracting parties. [original emphasis in italic s; emphasis added in bold] 

52     In the present c ase, the first defendant’s c ounterc laim for $290,552.86 represents the total value of validly redeemed vouc hers whic h they allege remain unpaid by the plaintiffs. This sum, to borrow from the language used in the passage above, “has nothing to do with _compensation_ ”. It is c ertainly not a sum whic h the first defendant has formulated as a “money-substitute” for their total losses flowing c onsequentially upon the plaintiffs’ alleged breac h. Instead, it is a sum whic h the first defendant c laims has ac c rued to them direc tly under the c ontrac t as a result of the plaintiffs’ failure to perform their primary c ontrac tual obligation to make payments on validly redeemed vouc hers. The amounts to be paid in respec t of eac h vouc her is, it should be added, also readily quantifiable bec ause, ac c ording to the terms of the Co-operation Agreements, this is fixed by referenc e to the pric e of eac h vouc her less the agreed suc c ess fee and any tax payable. Viewed in this way, then, it bec omes c lear that the c ounterc laim here is not in the nature of an ac tion for damages, whether general or spec ial. It is simply an ac tion to rec over a fixed debt whic h, if suc c essful, produc es the result that “the defendant is bound to do exac tly what the c ontrac t required” (see Neil Andrews _et al_ , _Contractual Duties: Performance, Breach, Termination and Remedies_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 2011) at para 19-003). 

53     Given that Mr Singh’s submissions proc eeded from an entirely erroneous footing, the rest of it nec essarily falls away. Consequently, I find that the c ase whic h he c ited in support of his arguments 

- _The “Shravan”_ <span class="citation">[1999] 2 SLR(R) 713</span> – had no applic ation here. Mr Singh had relied, in partic ular, on a paragraph of that judgment (at [77]) where Chao Hic k Tin J (as he then was) made plain the distinc tion between general and spec ial damages and observed that spec ial damages had always to 

be explic itly c laimed on the pleading. [note: 48] However the present ac tion is not one for damages but for a debt; and this is not a differenc e without a distinc tion bec ause, as I have stated, the applic able princ iples differ depending on the partic ular form of the ac tion. _The “Shravan”_ was simply not c onc erned with an ac tion for a debt, thus the observations made there are of no assistanc e here. 

54     In my view, I have no doubt that it is open to me to award to the first defendant an amount lower than what was pleaded in respec t of eac h c laim _if_ that lower c laim amount is supported by the evidenc e. The first defendant’s pleaded c laim amounts, after all, are simply based on the differenc e between Component A and Component B. Component A, in turn, is derived from totalling up the number of vouc hers whic h the first defendant says were validly redeemed in respec t of eac h plaintiff. If, however, the first defendant is unable to make good at the trial what they have pleaded in that they manage only to prove that a smaller number of vouc hers were validly redeemed, I do not see why this prec ludes them from being awarded a sum whic h is c orrespondingly reduc ed from the pleaded c laim as I had earlier alluded to at [46] above. Ac c ordingly, the mere fac t that the c laim amounts now advanc ed by the first defendant in Annex A and Annex B have evolved from what was pleaded is not in itself fatal to the c ounterc laim. I thus go on to determine whether these new c laims had been properly proved. It c ertainly invites c loser sc rutiny to understand how and why the c laims have evolved. 


**The first defendant’s reliance on the AEIC Table to prove the Annex B claims** 

55     The main objec tion to the first defendant’s relianc e on the AEIC Table to prove their c laims in Annex B should be obvious by now: the entries therein regarding the total amounts owing in respec t of redeemed vouc hers is not supported by the relevant primary evidenc e, _viz_ , the allegedly redeemed vouc hers themselves (see [30] above). Sec tion 66 of the Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) is material in this regard. Its mandatory language c learly presc ribes that doc uments _must_ be proved by primary evidenc e exc ept where the c irc umstanc es in s 67, whic h permit proof by way of sec ondary evidenc e, are applic able. 

56     That the evidential rule in s 66 of the Evidenc e Ac t is of great prac tic al importanc e in the proper c onduc t of disputes is not in doubt. As the Court of Appeal noted in _Jet Holding Ltd and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and other appeals_ <span class="citation">[2006] 3 SLR(R) 769</span> (“ _Jet Holding_ ”) at [36], this rule is “ _intended to ensure that only the best evidence is admitted into evidence_ ” [original emphasis]. While the Court of Appeal in _Jet Holding_ did also go on to observe that an “overly punc tilious insistenc e” on c omplianc e with provisions in the Evidenc e Ac t for its own sake was “undesirable” (see [50]) and that the “modern approac h” in other jurisdic tions was generally to admit all evidenc e and foc us on issues of weight instead (see [57]–[62]), it must be stressed that these remarks were being proffered by way of “preliminary observations” only (see [47]). Certainly they were not intended to diminish the evidential rule in s 66. Indeed, the following passage from _Jet Holding_ at [48] dispels suc h notions entirely and bears mention in the present c ase: 

 Firstly, we must begin with the general princ iple that the party who wishes to introduc e the doc uments c onc erned into evidenc e must c omply with the salient provisions of the Evidenc e Ac t ... To begin with, any other premise would ignore the c lear provisions of the Ac t. Worse still, it would be a signal to parties to be indisc iplined in so far as the introduc tion of doc uments is c onc erned. It would then be the thin end of the proc edural wedge and might even lead to the fraudulent introduc tion of doc uments. The fac t that there is another legal barrier in the form of testing the truth of the c ontents of doc uments is no exc use for lowering the barrier in relation to the authentic ity of doc uments under the salient provisions of the Evidenc e Ac t, and whic h would itself c onstitute an important threshold safeguard. 

57     The general stanc e towards s 66 of the Evidenc e Ac t is therefore c lear. However it is also useful for present purposes to provide a more spec ific illustration of how this evidential rule operates against parties seeking to prove the c ontents of doc uments whic h are purportedly c ollated from other sourc es. In this regard, I find instruc tive the Indian c ase of _State of Meghalaya and others v Joinmanick Nosmel Giri_ (1995) 2 GLR 174 (“ _Joinmanick_ ”). I pause to add parenthetic ally that as our Evidenc e Ac t originated from the Indian equivalent, authorities from this jurisdic tion are c ertainly not short of persuasive value here (see also _Jet Holding_ at [52]). 

58     In _Joinmanick_ , the c laimant c ontrac tor sought to rec over a shortfall in payment by the defendants for work done in c onnec tion with an irrigation projec t. To prove an aspec t of its c laim, the c laimant produc ed among various other exhibits one whic h took the form of an exerc ise book. This exerc ise book was prepared by the c laimant and c ontained several entries regarding work whic h it had purportedly done over a c ertain period. However the c ourt refused to admit it into evidenc e as the entries therein had not been proven by primary or sec ondary evidenc e (at [20]): 

 ... [Exhibit] 15(1) is a exerc ise book c ontaining some entries. Also it c ontain some slips of papers. ... It is not understood as to why this book was admitted in the evidence without proving entries made therein. ... No doubt, this book was exhibited without objec tion from the defendant. But 


 that did not take away the right of the c ourt to question and/or sec rutinize [ sic ] the evidentiary value of the same, Sec tion 61 of the Evidenc e Ac t [equivalent to s 63 of our Evidenc e Ac t] provided that c ontents of doc uments may be proved either by primary or by sec ondary evidenc e. Here the contents of the exhibits were not proved either by primary or by secondary evidence. So these exhibits must be brushed aside. ... The way these exhibits are sought to be utilised to thrust the liability on the defendant, may give rise [to] dangerous precedent in the field of civil litigation. [emphasis added in italic s] 

59     In the present c ase, the total sums payable in respec t of redeemed vouc hers as rec orded in the AEIC Table were also not proven by produc tion of the underlying primary evidenc e. Although _some_ primary evidenc e was adduc ed in the form of “sample” redeemed vouc hers, it is c lear that these vouc hers simply do not add up to the sums tabulated in the AEIC Table. Compiling the c laim figures in a spreadsheet, D1, without adequately explaining the sourc e of the underlying information, does not improve the first defendant’s position. 

60     The first defendant c ould also well have attempted to prove their c laims through sec ondary evidenc e suc h as reminders sent to the plaintiffs for payment of the unpaid “validly redeemed” vouc hers. In this regard, I find it c urious that apart from the first defendant’s abjec t failure to identify and/or produc e the primary evidenc e, _ie_ , the unpaid “validly redeemed” vouc hers, they have also failed to produc e any c orrespondenc e demanding payment from the plaintiffs in respec t of the unpaid “validly redeemed” vouc hers. I say that this is surprising bec ause the first defendant – and, for that matter, the sec ond defendant as well – c ertainly c annot be desc ribed as large or established c orporate outfits having the financ ial wherewithal to tolerate a sustained period of late payments by the plaintiffs. Indeed, this bec omes even more apparent when one takes into ac c ount the business model whic h the first and sec ond defendants operated. In this regard, the fourth defendant explained in her affidavit that the first and sec ond defendants abided by a marketing princ iple known as the “Princ iple of Loss Leader” whic h involved them selling the vac ation pac kages to end-c onsumers at pric es lower than what they were themselves paying to the ac tual servic e providers, _ie_ , the Bali villa 

owners. [note: 49] The objec tive was to grow the first and sec ond defendants’ businesses and, onc e they had established a name for themselves, it was envisaged that the pric es of the holiday pac kages sold to the end-c onsumers would be inc reased to return a profit. From this desc ription of the first and sec ond defendants’ business strategy, it is c lear that they effec tively inc urred a loss eac h time a transac tion was made. Timely payment from the plaintiffs on validly redeemed vouc hers was therefore paramount for the survival, muc h less suc c ess, of the first and sec ond defendants’ businesses sinc e this would provide them with the nec essary c ash flow for making up the shortfall owing to the Bali villa owners on eac h transac tion. One would therefore expec t the defendants to have monitored payments by the plaintiffs c losely and, in respec t of the partic ular unpaid vouc hers c omprising the present c laims, to have promptly sent reminders seeking payment of these vouc hers. However, there is a c onspic uous absenc e of any evidenc e of this sort. While I noted that the first defendant did disc lose c ertain emails showing that they had issued reminders for payment, these emails were of little assistanc e to the first defendant bec ause there is nothing to indic ate that the reminders therein were spec ific ally in respec t of those “validly redeemed” vouc hers whic h they alleged _remained unpaid_. 

For example, in an email dated 22 February 2012, [note: 50] a staff member of the first and sec ond defendants issued a reminder to Groupon Franc e to make payment on vouc hers whic h had been redeemed earlier on 28 January and 18 February. However, there is nothing to suggest that these redeemed vouc hers remained unpaid. Groupon Franc e may well have paid up on these vouc hers pursuant to the reminder, and it is for the first defendant to prove that they did not. In another email thread whic h the first defendant sought to rely on, it is shown that reminders for payment were sent to Groupon Hong Kong on 21 September 2011 and 19 Oc tober 2011 in respec t of redeemed vouc hers 

listed out in an earlier email dated 6 September 2011. [note: 51] However Groupon Hong Kong is not a 


party to this ac tion. The first defendant has not made any c laim against Groupon Hong Kong for unpaid vouc hers and, indeed, it was c larified during the trial that there were no outstanding payments due from Groupon Hong Kong. This is another illustration of how the email reminders whic h the first defendant sought to rely on simply did not advanc e their c laims whic h, it must be stressed, are made in respec t of a definite number of identifiable validly redeemed vouc hers whic h remained unpaid. What was the reason for the first defendant’s remarkable failure to produc e any reminder of whatsoever nature sent from the defendants to the plaintiffs demanding for payment in respec t of the _unpaid_ “validly redeemed” vouc hers? None other than a general averment that their doc uments had been seized by the CAD. It is possible that no suc h reminders were in fac t ever sent. 

61     The result, then, is that the AEIC Table had not been properly admitted into evidenc e in ac c ordanc e with the statutorily presc ribed modes of proof. The c laim amounts in Annex B were thus without any evidential basis. 

**The first defendant’s reliance on Ms Seah’s alleged “admissions” to prove the Annex A claims** 

62     The next issue relates to whether the first defendant c ould prove their c laim amounts in Annex A based on Ms Seah’s alleged “admissions” in her 13 Marc h affidavit. To be more spec ific , the question here is whether the first defendant c ould rely spec ific ally on that _part_ of Ms Seah’s alleged “admissions” whic h pertained to the sums owing on validly redeemed vouc hers ( _ie_ , Component A) while at the same time c hoosing to disregard her evidenc e on the amounts paid by eac h plaintiff ( _ie_ , Component B). 

**_The first defendant’s invocation of Order 27 rule 3_** 

63     Mr Rasanathan asserted during oral c losing submissions that this was a permissible approac h but, when probed on the legal basis for him saying so, he was unable to provide a ready answer. It was only later in the first defendant’s further written submissions that his legal argument on this issue bec ame somewhat c learer. First, Mr Rasanathan submitted that admissions are oral or doc umentary statements whic h suggest an inferenc e as to the fac ts in issue. He explained that the sums owing on validly redeemed vouc her is one of the fac ts in issue in this c ase. Sec ond, he appeared to invoke O 27 r 3 of the Rules of Court whic h ordinarily allows a party to rely on admissions of fac t by the 

opposing party to obtain judgment. [note: 52] However, in my view, the first defendant c ould not avail themselves of this rule. 

64     Order 27 r 3 of the Rules of Court provides as follows: 

 Judgment on admission of facts (O. 27, r. 3) 

**3.** Where admissions of fac t are made by a party to a c ause or matter either by his pleadings or otherwise, any other party to the c ause or matter may apply to the Court for suc h judgment or order as upon those admissions he may be entitled to, without waiting for the determination of any other question between the parties, and the Court may give suc h judgment, or make suc h order, on the applic ation as it thinks just. 

65     First, it bears emphasis that admissions of fac t under O 27 r 3 must be _clear_ (see _Singapore Civil Procedure 2013_ vol 1 (GP Selvam gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2013) (“ _Singapore Civil Procedure 2013_ ”) at para 27/3/2). This requirement was noted early on by Sargant J in _Ellis v Allen_ [1914] 1 Ch D 904 who stated (at 909) that the then English equivalent of O 27 r 3 applies only where there is a “c lear admission of fac ts in the fac e of whic h it is impossible for the party making it to suc c eed”. The position in Singapore is no less stric t as Sargant J’s statement has been c ited with 


approval by Lee Seiu Kin JC (as he then was) in _Ow Chor Seng v Coutts Bank (Schweiz) AG_ <span class="citation">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 380</span> at [16]. Sec ond, it must also be stressed that the mere fac t that a statement c an c onstitute an admission for the purposes of s 17 of the Evidenc e Ac t does not _per se_ entitle the party to obtain judgment under O 27 r 3. The admission must not only be c lear but it must in itself admit to the c laim in order for judgment to be entered “ _without waiting for the determination of any other question_ ”. 

66     In the present c ase, it is alleged that Ms Seah’s 13 Marc h affidavit c ontained “admissions”. I note that the 13 Marc h affidavit was filed in c onnec tion with an interloc utory applic ation in relation to an injunc tion and suc h interloc utory affidavits, by their nature, typic ally refer to matters outside the personal knowledge of the deponent. It is relevant to point out that Ms Seah filed four affidavits. Eac h of them c ontained a suitable qualific ation as to the sourc e of the information – they are matters either within her personal knowledge and/or obtained from doc uments in her possession and are true to the best of her information, knowledge and belief. However under s 18(1) of the Evidenc e Ac t, statements made by an agent to any party to the proc eedings under the c irc umstanc es of the c ase as expressly or impliedly authorised by him to make them are nonetheless admissions. Although suc h “admissions” _if clear_ are admissible in evidenc e, the probative weight of the evidenc e would still need to be c onsidered by referenc e to the c irc umstanc es in whic h they were made and may well depend on the sourc e of the deponent’s knowledge. Here, the 13 Marc h affidavit whic h the first defendant sought to rely on was the last in the series of four affidavits. In my view, the four affidavits must be c onstrued together instead of the 13 Marc h affidavit in isolation. Consistent with the interloc utory nature of the four affidavits, Ms Seah qualified in her 13 Marc h affidavit that the figures whic h she provided therein (relating to the total number and value of vouc hers validly redeemed and the total amounts paid by eac h plaintiff ) had been gathered from eac h of the plaintiffs and that “c oordinating efforts ac ross 13 entities worldwide with differing invoic e and payment systems is not an easy task”. [note: 53] Her figures were thus stated to have been “c ollated and prepared to the best of [her] 

ability” [note: 54] and, further, that they were based only on “the most updated figures [the plaintiffs] 

were able to provide”. [note: 55] In these c irc umstanc es, it c an hardly be said that Ms Seah had made c lear and unequivoc al _admissions_ of fac t. Indeed, I am further fortified in my view by the fac t that, in an earlier affidavit dated 5 April 2012 whic h Ms Seah filed in support of the Mareva Injunc tion applic ation, she had also given evidenc e regarding the same matters but her figures on that oc c asion 

differed for several of the c laims. [note: 56] This serves to amplify Ms Seah’s reservation in the 13 Marc h affidavit that she was only doing the best she c ould based on the information provided to her whic h was subjec t to possible c hange. 

67     Further, although the 13 Marc h affidavit referred to the total number of vouc hers sold by eac h of the Groupon entities and the number of “validly redeemed” vouc hers by the end-c onsumers, Ms Seah also asserted that many of the “validly redeemed” vouc hers had to be _refunded_ by the plaintiffs to the end-c onsumers bec ause of the first defendant’s failure to provide the hotel ac c ommodation in spite of their booking c onfirmation. Ms Seah stated c learly in her 13 Marc h affidavit that the endc onsumers have been refunded after having “validly redeemed” the vouc hers but before payment was 

c laimed by the defendants. [note: 57] It is questionable whether the first defendant was entitled to be paid for these “validly redeemed” vouc hers that had to be refunded to the end-c onsumers as a result of the first defendant’s failure to provide the hotel ac c ommodation. I should be c lear that I am not making any finding that this was in fac t the c ase as asserted by Ms Seah. All I am saying is that onc e the 13 Marc h affidavit is read in its entirety, it bec omes far from c lear or unequivoc al that the 13 Marc h affidavit or any of Ms Seah’s other affidavits c ontained admissions of the total amount _owing_ to the first defendant in respec t of the “validly redeemed” vouc hers. 

68     In fac t, the first defendant highlighted in their c losing written submissions that Ms Seah had 


filed c onflic ting affidavits c ontaining “numerous inc onsistenc ies” whic h showed that the plaintiffs “were not sure of the number of Vouc hers sold, redeemed, refunded nor what they paid the 1st/2nd 

Defendants in total”. [note: 58] This point was ac tually highlighted by the first defendant’s c ounsel to disc harge the injunc tion. That being the c ase, it simply does not lie in the mouth of the first defendant to c herry-pic k one aspec t of one of the four affidavits filed by Ms Seah and assert that it c ontained _clear and unequivocal_ admissions. 

69     It is also important to note that, for the purposes of invoking O 27 r 3, the admission sought to be relied on must be a c lear admission of _all_ the fac ts nec essary to establish the c ause of ac tion and not merely evidenc e of some of the fac ts (see _Singapore Civil Procedure 2013_ at para 27/3/2, c iting the Malaysian c ase of _Hasrat Usaha Sdn Bhd v Pati Sdn Bhd_ [2011] 3 MLJ 343 at [37]). In other words, the effec t of the admissions must be, as suc c inc tly stated by GP Selvam J in _Shunmugam Jayakumar and others v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin and others_ <span class="citation">[1996] 2 SLR(R) 658</span> at [35], that “it is unnec essary for the Court to make findings of fac t – it having been admitted by the defendant that they are no longer in issue”. 

70     In my view, I c onsider that even on the assumption that Ms Seah’s 13 Marc h affidavit c ontains c lear admissions of fac ts in issue, those admissions alone are not suffic ient to resolve the c ounterc laim in the first defendant’s favour. This is bec ause there still remains the _further_ question of whether the first defendant had c omplied with the c ontrac tual arrangement under the Co-operation Agreements whic h requires them to submit evidenc e of valid redemption of the vouc hers whic h they say were unpaid within the 28-day window (see [5] above). This c ontrac tual arrangement will be analysed in greater detail below but what is relevant to note here is that Ms Seah’s 13 Marc h affidavit gives absolutely no indic ation of whether the first defendant had satisfied the requirement stipulated by this c lause in respec t of any vouc hers. This is therefore a further question of fac t whic h remains to be determined by the c ourt and, ac c ordingly, the admissions standing alone, even assuming that they are c lear admissions, do not entitle the first defendant to judgment “ _without waiting for the determination of any other question between the parties_ ” as is required by the c lear terms of O 27 r 3. 

71     Finally, but no less signific antly, I find that the first defendant’s invoc ation of O 27 r 3 was entirely misplac ed bec ause of the manner in whic h they sought to rely on the “admissions”. It is highly doubtful that a party seeking judgment on the basis of O 27 r 3 c an isolate only a part of the admissions made by the opposing party for the purposes of proving a partic ular aspec t of his c ase while at the same time ignoring another part of those admissions whic h relate to the same subjec t matter. That, however, was prec isely what the first defendant intended to do here. As mentioned earlier (at [37]), the first defendant was relying only on that part of Ms Seah’s 13 Marc h affidavit whic h pertained to the total value of validly redeemed vouc hers ( _ie_ , Component A). This was ostensibly to make up for their inability to ac tually prove this aspec t of their c laims by adduc ing the relevant primary evidenc e. On the other hand, when it c ame to Ms Seah’s alleged “admissions” regarding the amounts whic h the plaintiffs had paid ( _ie_ , Component B), the first defendant said that her figures in this respec t were unreliable bec ause they did not c orrespond with the first defendant’s own tabulated figures in D2 whic h were supported by their bank statements. It is diffic ult to esc ape the impression, however, that the true reason why the first defendant sought to substitute Ms Seah’s figures here was bec ause, if her evidenc e as rec orded down in Annex A was ac c epted, many of the first defendant’s c laims would be reduc ed to naught (see [37] above). That was c ertainly an unattrac tive proposition for the first defendant. 

72     It appeared to me, therefore, that the first defendant was no more than c herry-pic king from Ms Seah’s 13 Marc h affidavit to prove their c laims. When her “admissions” suited them, they seized upon it. Yet when her “admissions” appeared detrimental, they found a way to disregard it. I do not think 


that this is the proper way for obtaining judgment under O 27 r 3. In my view, Ms Seah’s 13 Marc h affidavit must be looked at in its _totality_ as a matter of fairness to her and, by extension, the plaintiffs. If she has made a statement whic h qualifies or perhaps even c ontradic ts what appears to be an admission of fac t supporting the first defendant’s c laims, that statement c annot be c onveniently brushed aside. Adopting that approac h, then, I find that when Ms Seah’s alleged “admissions” are viewed as a whole, they simply do not admit to the c laim amounts put forward by the first defendant in Annex A. 

**_The overriding importance of Order 18 rule 8_** 

73     In light of the above, it is c lear that the first defendant’s invoc ation of O 27 r 3 to prove their Annex A c laims was c ompletely misguided. Instead, I find that there is another proc edural rule whic h has overriding importanc e here and whose effec t is to _impede_ the first defendant’s relianc e on the alleged “admissions”. I am referring in this regard to O 18 r 8 whic h presc ribes those matters whic h must be _specifically_ pleaded. In partic ular, O 18 r 8(1)( _b_ ) provides as follows: 

 Matters which must be specifically pleaded (O. 18, r. 8) 

 8.—(1) A party must in any pleading subsequent to a statement of c laim plead specifically any matter, for example, performanc e, release, any relevant statute of limitation, fraud or any fac t showing illegality — 

 ... 

 (b) whic h, if not spec ific ally pleaded, might take the opposite party by surprise ... 

 [emphasis added in italic s] 

74     Let me be c lear. As explained in [66]–[68] above, the statements whic h the first defendant are seeking to rely on are not admissions within the meaning of O 27 r 3. If they were, then stric tly speaking, I agree that there is no nec essity to plead them. Here, the alleged “admissions” by Ms Seah merely pertained to one aspec t of the first defendant’s c laims ( _ie_ , Component A). As relianc e on the alleged “admissions” was never a part of the first defendant’s pleaded c ase (espec ially sinc e it c ontradic ts their pleaded c ase), I have no doubt that suc h a development did take the plaintiffs by surprise at trial. 

75     The first defendant’s pleaded c ase c ertainly gave the impression that they would be proving their c laims based on evidenc e of the allegedly redeemed but unpaid vouc hers. Indeed, this manifested itself in the plaintiffs’ request for further and better partic ulars in respec t of those vouc hers. The first defendant also never gave notic e of their intention to rely on the “admissions” c ase theory whic h they advanc ed here: at no time did they apply to amend their pleadings to inc lude this alternative basis of proof whic h, signific antly, gave rise to c laim amounts different from those already pleaded. In these c irc umstanc es, I have little diffic ulty in finding that the plaintiffs would be prejudic ed if the first defendant was allowed to rely on the “admissions”. This was an entirely different route by whic h they sought to prove the total value of redeemed vouc hers and, ac c ordingly, one whic h the plaintiffs would not have c ome to trial expec ting to meet. If they had been pleaded, the plaintiffs submit that they would have adduc ed evidenc e at the trial to explain the proper c ontext of the alleged “admissions” made in Ms Seah’s 13 Marc h affidavit. 

76     In fac t, I go on further to note that the first defendant’s “admissions” c ase theory was not only surprising as a _new method_ of proving their c laims, but that it was also surprising as a method 


yielding c ompletely _new claim amounts_ in respec t of all 13 plaintiffs (see [37] above). In other words, the Annex A c laims whic h were partly derived from the “admissions” ac tually _contradicted_ the first defendant’s pleaded c laims. This c ertainly adds to the already strong perc eption that the plaintiffs would be prejudic ed if the first defendant c ould rely on Ms Seah’s 13 Marc h affidavit in the guise of “admissions”. 

77     In light of the above, I hold that it is impermissible for the first defendant to rely on Ms Seah’s alleged “admissions” to prove their Annex A c laims. 

**Clause 4.2 of the Co-operation Agreements** 

78     So far I have addressed only the question of whether the first defendant’s c laims (in Annex A and Annex B) were proven as a matter of evidenc e. I find that they were not and this is suffic ient to dispose of the c ounterc laim. However, even if I am mistaken, I note that the first defendant was not automatic ally entitled to rec over the c ontrac tual debt c laimed. There was still a further obstac le in c l 4.2 of the Co-operation Agreements. 

79     Clause 4.2 is set out here in full: 

 For any Vouc her that is Validly Redeemed by a Purc haser with Partner, Groupon shall pay to Partner the Groupon Vouc her Pric e less the Suc c ess Fee and also less any amount in respec t of Value Added Tax (“VAT”) c hargeable by Groupon in respec t of the Suc c ess Fee (“Groupon’s VAT”). For the avoidanc e of doubt, Groupon shall retain the Suc c ess Fee plus Groupon’s VAT. That payment shall be made within 7 of Groupon’s working days of Groupon rec eiving from Partner suitable and valid evidenc e (the nature of whic h may be stipulated by Groupon from time to time) evidenc ing that the Vouc her has been Validly Redeemed whic h evidenc e Partner must: (i) provide to Groupon using Groupon’s online partner redemption portal; or (ii) be sent to Groupon by post, fax or email; and for whic h, in both prec eding c ases, suc h evidenc e must be rec eived by Groupon within 28 days of the Vouc her having been Validly Redeemed by the Purc haser of that Vouc her, with the Partner. If that evidenc e is not rec eived by Groupon within that time, then Partner shall lose its right to rec eive any monies from Groupon in respec t of that Vouc her (and Groupon may retain any monies that would have been so payable). 

**_A preliminary observation on the uniformity of cl 4.2_** 

80     I pause to make an important observation whic h is that c ounsel for both parties had proc eeded on the basis that c l 4.2 operates ac ross all 13 of the Co-operation Agreements. However, upon my own inspec tion of the various Co-operation Agreements, I found that this was a wholly inac c urate representation of the fac ts. Not all of the 13 Co-operation Agreements were before me but, from those that were, I was able to disc ern the following. 

81     First, c l 4.2 as it has been reproduc ed at [79] above only appears word for word in _one_ of the 

Co-operation Agreements, namely that entered into with Groupon UK. [note: 59] Further, of the remaining Co-operation Agreements, only one other has a c lause whic h c omes c lose to duplic ating c l 

4\.2 of the UK Co-operation Agreement. That is the UAE Co-operation Agreement. [note: 60] This agreement also c ontains a c l 4.2 whic h for the most part replic ates that in the UK Co-operation Agreement, exc ept that Groupon UAE is required to make payment within three working days after rec eiving evidenc e of valid redemption instead of seven days as is the c ase for Groupon UK. As for the other Co-operation Agreements, there were more observable differenc es whic h I shall proc eed to broadly desc ribe. 


82     For example, looking at the Co-operation Agreements with Groupon Franc e [note: 61] and 

Groupon Poland, [note: 62] it is c lear that c l 4.2 as numbered in these agreements have nothing to do with the respec tive Groupon entity’s payment obligation or with the time required for submission of evidenc e of validly redeemed vouc hers to trigger that obligation. In these two agreements, c l 4.2 relates to a c ompletely different matter: it provides for the parties’ mutual rights to exc lusivity. The searc h for a c lause equivalent to that in the UK Co-operation Agreement instead takes one to c l 2 but, even then, c l 2 is not formulated in the exac t same way. In the Franc e Co-operation Agreement, for instanc e, c l 2 has broken down the material parts of c l 4.2 in the UK Co-operation Agreement into distinc t sub-c lauses. Further, the time frames for Groupon Franc e to make payment and for the c ontrac ting merc hant to submit evidenc e of valid redemption are both differently stipulated as three and 30 working days respec tively. The same kind of departures from c l 4.2 of the UK Co-operation Agreement may also be seen in c l 2 of the Poland Co-operation Agreement. In fac t, a further observable differenc e in this latter agreement is that it does not speak of the “valid redemption” of vouc hers but uses the entirely different terminology of the “perfec tion” of vouc hers instead. Groupon Poland’s payment obligation is thus stated to arise only after a “perfec ted vouc her” has been delivered to them and the “perfec tion” of a vouc her is in turn defined as the performanc e of the vouc her servic e by the c ontrac ting merc hant. 

83     The Co-operation Agreements entered into with Groupon Australia [note: 63] and Groupon New 

Zealand [note: 64] are somewhat similar in so far as the c lauses whic h c over the same subjec t matter as c l 4.2 of the UK Co-operation Agreement are c onc erned. These two agreements c ontain several of the differenc es whic h have been noted above in respec t of the other Co-operation Agreements, _eg_ , a differenc e in the timeframe for Groupon Australia and Groupon New Zealand to fulfil their payment obligations and a differenc e in how the c lauses whic h are materially related to c l 4.2 of the UK Cooperation Agreement are struc tured and numbered. However there is one further differenc e in these two agreements whic h do not appear elsewhere. In this regard, it appears that the mere submission of evidenc e of valid redemption within 28 days will not always entitle the c ontrac ting merc hant to rec eive payment from Groupon Australia and Groupon New Zealand. This is bec ause in c ertain stipulated c irc umstanc es, the c ontrac ting merc hant must submit _additional_ evidenc e in the form of a tax invoic e before it c an rec eive payment. Suc h a requirement is no doubt absent in c l 4.2 of the UK Co-operation Agreement. 

84     Finally, I note that the Co-operation Agreement entered into with Groupon Germany is in the 

German language. [note: 65] It has not been translated into the English language, thus its terms c annot be disc erned. As for the Co-operation Agreement adduc ed in respec t of Groupon Mexic o, it 

appears to be inc omplete as it does not c ontain the relevant general terms and c onditions. [note: 66] Therefore its terms likewise c annot be asc ertained. 

85     The foregoing c learly illustrates that there were multiple layers of differenc es between the Cooperation Agreements and, ultimately, only one c ontained c l 4.2 in the form whic h was argued before me. I would have expec ted c ounsel to bring at least the fac t that there were dissimilarities to my attention but both failed to do so. Instead, they presented the fac ts in a way whic h suggested that c l 4.2 was a standard term appearing c onsistently in all the Co-operation Agreements and engaged eac h other on that basis. What this state of affairs suggested to me was that neither c ounsel had ac tually taken the trouble to look at eac h of the Co-operation Agreements individually. Indeed, as I have pointed out, some agreements were not even adduc ed and there was at least one whic h was not translated into the English language. Counsels’ preferenc e, instead, was simply to adopt the shortc ut of _assuming_ the uniformity of the agreements. This is disappointing. Indeed, this is espec ially so when it is c onsidered that eac h of the first defendant’s 13 c laims arises from alleged breac hes of 


c ontrac t. In these c irc umstanc es, the very least to be expec ted of c ounsel was for them to examine the very terms of the c ontrac t they were both seeking to rely on to prove their c laim or defenc e. It is baffling to find, however, that even suc h a basic exerc ise had not been undertaken. 

86     Be that as it may, I note that both parties proc eeded on the basis that c l 4.2 of the UK Cooperation Agreement was the only c lause for me to c onsider in determining whether the defendants were entitled to rec eive payment on the validly redeemed vouc hers. Their oral and written submissions were foc used entirely on this one c lause. Ac c ordingly, the referenc es to “c l 4.2” in the remainder of this judgment will be to that whic h has been reproduc ed at [79] above. 

**_The burden of proof under cl 4.2: a matter of construction_** 

87     I turn now to address the c ruc ial question regarding who, as between the plaintiffs and the first defendant, had the burden of proving that evidenc e of valid redemption was or was not submitted within the 28-day window. Unsurprisingly, the parties took different views on this matter whic h produc ed c ontrasting results. 

88     The plaintiffs submitted that c l 4.2 was in the nature of a _condition precedent_ sinc e it provided that the first defendant must submit evidenc e of valid redemption within 28 days before triggering the 

plaintiffs’ liability to pay. [note: 67] Ac c ordingly, it was argued that the burden of proof was on the 

first defendant to prove their timely submission of evidenc e. [note: 68] On the other hand, the first defendant submitted that c l 4.2 was in the nature of an _exclusion clause_ sinc e its last sentenc e c ompletely disc harged the plaintiffs’ liability to pay in the event of late or non-submission of evidenc e. [note: 69] It was thus argued that the plaintiffs, as the parties seeking to rely on the exemption 

c lause, had the onus of proving that evidenc e of valid redemption was submitted late or not at all. [note: 70] 

89     In either interpretation, a preliminary question arises in respec t of c l 4.2: _when_ exac tly does “valid redemption” take plac e? This determines the prec ise point at whic h the first defendant’s time for submitting the evidenc e of valid redemption begins to run. There was c onflic ting evidenc e on this issue. One interpretation was that valid redemption oc c urs at the point when the end-c onsumer c hec ks into the hotel to whic h his purc hased vouc her relates. This view was put forward by the plaintiffs’ witness, Mr Adrien Jean Bernard Jorge (“Mr Jorge”), who gave evidenc e on Groupon’s business mec hanism. A sec ond interpretation was that valid redemption takes plac e at an earlier point when the end-c onsumer rec eives a c onfirmation of his hotel booking from the merc hant, _ie_ , the first defendant in this c ase. This view was explained by Ms Seah who was not c alled as a witness but did 

desc ribe Groupon’s vouc her redemption proc ess in her earlier interloc utory affidavits. [note: 71] Ms Seah’s view was brought to Mr Jorge’s attention during c ross-examination and although he maintained his understanding of when “valid redemption” oc c urred, he agreed that Ms Seah’s ac c ount was c orrec t in _most_ c ases. In my view, Ms Seah’s explanation makes more sense bec ause the endc onsumer’s ac tual c hec king into the hotel c an take plac e months after the booking c onfirmation is provided by the merc hant. It does not make c ommerc ial sense that the merc hant c an only seek payment from Groupon after the end-c onsumer had c hec ked into the hotel. Therefore I find that “valid redemption” oc c urs on rec eipt of the booking c onfirmation by the end-c onsumer. The first defendant, ac c ordingly, has 28 days from this point to submit evidenc e of valid redemption. 

90     I c onsider that there is some merit in eac h of the parties’ submissions but, ultimately, neither was c ompletely ac c urate in their c harac terisation of c l 4.2. In my view, both parties fell short bec ause it was simply not possible to attribute one single juridic al desc ription to this verbose c ontrac tual term. Onc e the c lause is broken down into its c onstituent limbs, of whic h I c an disc ern 


three, it bec omes c lear that eac h of them in fac t serves a different purpose although they c ollec tively relate to the same broad subjec t matter of payment on validly redeemed vouc hers by the plaintiffs. I therefore c onsider it benefic ial to reproduc e c l 4.2 again but, on this oc c asion, I have divided it into three limbs, replac ed immaterial portions with an ellipsis, and emphasised material portions in italic s: 

 For any Vouc her that is Validly Redeemed by a Purc haser with Partner, Groupon shall pay to Partner the Groupon Vouc her Pric e less the Suc c ess Fee and also less any amount in respec t of Value Added Tax (“VAT”) c hargeable by Groupon in respec t of the Suc c ess Fee (“Groupon’s VAT”). ... 

 That payment shall be made within 7 of Groupon’s working days of Groupon receiving from Partner suitable and valid evidence ... evidencing that the Voucher has been Validly Redeemed – whic h evidenc e Partner must: (i) provide to Groupon using Groupon’s online partner redemption portal; or (ii) be sent to Groupon by post, fax or email; and for whic h, in both prec eding c ases, suc h evidenc e must be rec eived by Groupon within 28 days of the Vouc her having been Validly Redeemed by the Purc haser of that Vouc her, with the Partner. 

 If that evidenc e is not rec eived by Groupon within that time, then Partner shall lose its right to receive any monies from Groupon in respec t of that Vouc her (and Groupon may retain any monies that would have been so payable). 

 [emphasis added in italic s] 

91     There is little diffic ulty in c onstruing the first limb of c l 4.2 as set out above. It simply c reates an obligation on the plaintiffs to pay to the c ontrac ting merc hant the pric e of a validly redeemed vouc her (less the suc c ess fee and any tax payable). However this payment obligation is not an absolute one as the sec ond limb of c l 4.2 goes on to provide that the plaintiffs’ payment obligation is c ontingent upon the merc hant having provided evidenc e of valid redemption within 28 days of the said redemption. It is only when the merc hant has c omplied with this that the plaintiffs’ payment obligation, whic h must be disc harged within seven working days, bec omes live. The sec ond limb of c l 4.2 thus simply stipulates the _order of performance_ of the c ontrac ting parties’ interdependent and mutual obligations and, seen in this way, the fulfilment of the merc hant’s obligations may properly be desc ribed as a “c ondition prec edent” to the plaintiffs’ performanc e of theirs (see _The Law of Contract in Singapore_ at paras 16.018 and 16.019). Although c l 4.2 in the form as argued by the parties does not appear verbatim in all 13 Co-operation Agreements, I have noted that in so far as the Cooperation Agreements whic h have been disc losed are c onc erned, they at least c ontained an equivalent c ondition prec edent similar to the sec ond limb of c l 4.2. Finally, the third limb of c l 4.2 provides that if the plaintiffs do not rec eive evidenc e of valid redemption within the 28-day window, the merc hant “shall lose its right to rec eive any monies” from the plaintiffs. This limb, to my mind, has the effec t of an exc lusion c lause as it exempts the plaintiffs from any liability to pay the merc hant if, for one reason or another, the relevant evidenc e of valid redemption is not furnished within the 28day window. 

92     Onc e c l 4.2 is dissec ted in the manner above, it bec omes c lear that the first defendant c annot lay emphasis only on its third limb to brand the entire c lause an exc lusion c lause and thereby shift the burden of proof to the plaintiffs. Suc h an approac h c onveniently glosses over the remaining limbs in c l 4.2 and that is lamentable bec ause, in my view, it is the sec ond limb in partic ular whic h the first defendant had to address in the present dispute. As already desc ribed, this limb provides that the plaintiffs’ obligation to make payment is _contingent_ upon the first defendant first having submitted evidenc e of valid redemption within 28 days of the said redemption. Logic ally, therefore, it must be 


the first defendant who bears the burden of proving that they had fulfilled the c ondition prec edent if they intend to assert that the plaintiffs’ payment obligation had subsequently arisen but yet remained undisc harged. Surely it is not for the _plaintiffs_ to prove the fac ts nec essary for making out the _first defendant’s_ c laim. 

**_The first defendant’s alternative arguments to avoid the operation of cl 4.2_** 

93     It is thus for the first defendant to prove that they had submitted evidenc e of valid redemption within the 28-day window in respec t of those vouc hers whic h they c laimed remained unpaid. Before determining whether they had disc harged that burden, however, I note that the first defendant had two further strings to their bow to avoid the operation of c l 4.2. 

94     First, the first defendant argued in oral c losing submissions that even if c l 4.2 was read as imposing a c ondition prec edent, this had to be spec ific ally pleaded by the plaintiffs if relianc e was sought to be plac ed on it. In support of this argument, the first defendant c ited the c ase of _Amixco Asia (Pte) Ltd v Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd_ <span class="citation">[1992] 2 SLR(R) 65</span> (“ _Amixco_ ”) and highlighted, in partic ular, [36] of the judgment where the High Court stated as follows: 

 By O 18 r 7(4) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970 [now the Rules of Court 2014 Rev Ed], a c ondition prec edent nec essary for the c ase of a plaintiff is to be implied in his pleading. The defendant must therefore raise in his defence the point of non-compliance with a condition precedent : O 18 r 8(1). ... [emphasis added in italic s] 

95     The plaintiffs do not dispute the c orrec tness of this proposition in _Amixco_. [note: 72] They ac c ept that they must spec ific ally plead non-c omplianc e with a c ondition prec edent to raise it at 

trial. Their argument, however, is that this is prec isely what they did. [note: 73] I agree with them. There is no doubt that the first defendant’s non-c omplianc e with the 28-day window for submission of evidenc e of valid redemption was suffic iently pleaded. This appears c learly from the following 

paragraphs of the plaintiffs’ defenc e to the c ounterc laim: [note: 74] 

 The Defendants have failed to identify, plead or prove when eac h vouc her was bought or submitted for redemption. In any event, the 28-day period has lapsed and as per the c ontrac tual terms, the Defendants have lost their right to any monies allegedly due under the Co-operation Agreements. 

 It is the Plaintiffs’ pleaded Defence that the Defendants have failed to comply with clause 4.2 in that the 28-day period was not complied with. 

 [emphasis added in italic s] 

96     Sec ond, the first defendant also attempted to argue that, even if the plaintiffs had suffic iently pleaded the c ondition prec edent, this requirement was, in reality, not stric tly insisted upon during the c ourse of the parties’ dealings. It was therefore submitted that it would be “wholly inequitable” for 

the plaintiffs to now raise non-c omplianc e with this requirement as a bar to the c ounterc laim. [note: 75] 

97     In my judgment, it is not open to the first defendant to pursue this line of argument bec ause, on this partic ular oc c asion, it is _their own_ pleadings whic h have been found wanting. The first defendant has simply not pleaded any material fac ts to support an argument either on the basis that the c ondition prec edent had been waived by the plaintiffs or that the plaintiffs were now estopped 


from insisting upon it. These are c ertainly fac ts whic h would render the plaintiffs’ defenc e to the c ounterc laim “not maintainable” and, ac c ordingly, must be spec ific ally pleaded as provided in O 18 r 1( _a_ ) of the Rules of Court. 

98     The first defendant’s various arguments therefore do not relieve them from the burden imposed by c l 4.2. This thus leaves me to c onsider whether they did in fac t manage to disc harge it. 

**_Whether the first defendant had discharged the burden of proof under cl 4.2_** 

99     In this regard, I note that the fourth defendant c learly c onc eded on the stand that she was unable to prove that evidenc e of valid redemption was submitted within 28 days of the valid redemption for eac h of the allegedly unpaid vouc hers. She added, however, that it was in the first defendant’s interests to do so immediately in order to c laim payment from the plaintiffs. However, even ac c epting the fourth defendant’s evidenc e that c laims for payment would typic ally have been made timeously, I am of the view that this is not suffic ient for the purposes of shifting the burden onto the plaintiffs under c l 4.2. This is bec ause what is required of the first defendant under this c lause is proof that they did submit evidenc e of valid redemption within 28 days in respec t of those _exact_ vouc hers whic h they c laimed remained unpaid. The fourth defendant’s general statement c learly lac ks the degree of spec ific ity whic h is required for this purpose. The doc umentary evidenc e whic h shows that the first defendant might have made a timely c laim for payment on some oc c asions (see the examples of email reminders at [60] above) logic ally also c annot form the basis for a broadranging assumption that _this_ was done _all_ the time. In addition, there is no explanation why the first defendant is unable to produc e any evidenc e of valid redemption in respec t of the allegedly unpaid “validly redeemed” vouc hers, whether within or without the 28 days. 

100    In fac t, I make the further observation that, despite the fourth defendant’s c onc ession on the stand, it ac tually appears to have been well within the first defendant’s ability to prove whether or not they had submitted evidenc e of valid redemption for the vouc hers whic h their c laims were based on. The fourth defendant was taken to several doc uments during her c ross-examination whic h bears out this observation. These doc uments were in the form of email c orrespondenc es between representatives of the first and/or sec ond defendants and representatives of the respec tive Groupon 

entities regarding payment on vouc hers whic h had been validly redeemed. [note: 76] In these emails, it is telling that the defendants were able to identify the spec ific vouc hers whic h were due for payment and also to identify the date of redemption for those vouc hers. This therefore shows that the first defendant should be able to determine whether evidenc e of valid redemption had been submitted within 28 days of valid redemption by the end-c onsumers. While it might have been a laborious and time-c onsuming exerc ise for them to ac tually c ompile this information in respec t of the many vouc hers whic h they c laimed remained outstanding, that is the extent to whic h they must be c ommitted to go if they wish to suc c eed on their c laims. 

**Conclusion** 

101    In the premises, I find that the first defendant failed on all their c ounterc laims. 

102    There are two sets of c osts whic h I have to provide for. First, the plaintiffs’ c laims have been dismissed with c osts for failure to c omply with the “unless order”. It was dismissed pursuant to an order of c ourt dated 22 May 2013 when the proc eedings were at the disc overy stage. The plaintiffs submitted that c osts should be fixed at $4,000 while the first defendant submitted c osts fixed at $22,000. Sec ond, as regards the c ounterc laim, the first defendant submitted that c osts should be $70,000 exc luding disbursements while the plaintiffs submitted a sum of $120,000 exc luding disbursements. 


103    The trial was heard over two and a half days. Oral submissions were heard over a full day following the exc hange of written submissions. A further set of written submissions were filed to address spec ific issues whic h I had direc ted the parties to submit on. Both sets of submissions were not substantial. The issues related largely to burden of proof and the c onstruc tion of a partic ular c ontrac tual c lause. The trial was however unnec essarily c omplic ated by the first defendant in c onstantly c hanging both the quantum and basis of their c ounterc laim without due regard to their pleaded c ase. 

104    There were altogether four witnesses, two from eac h side. Although the total number of disc overed doc uments was in exc ess of 1,000 pages, they were mostly vouc hers and other formal doc uments. In all, I award a net sum of $50,000 exc luding disbursements as c osts to the plaintiffs to be paid forthwith by the first defendant.
