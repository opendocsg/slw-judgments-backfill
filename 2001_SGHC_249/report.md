**_Introduction_** 

This ac tion arose out of an ac c ident on a c onstruc tion site at No 19 Lok Yang Way (`the site`). On 2 


September 1999, Wong Jin Fah (`the plaintiff`), a Malaysian with permanent resident status in Singapore, was working at the site when a piec e of metal formwork fell from the partly c onstruc ted building and struc k him on the head. 

The heavy piec e of metal pierc ed and c rac ked the plaintiff`s safety helmet and c aused him to sustain serious injuries; the medic al report produc ed in c ourt opined that the plaintiff was likely to suffer permanent disabilities. 

The plaintiff`s c laim was based on negligenc e, breac h of oc c upier`s liability and breac h of statutory duty on the part of the defendants. 

**_The parties involved_** 

Stamford Tyres International Pte Ltd (`the developers`), through its arc hitec ts, RG Arc hitec ts, awarded L & M Prestressing Pte Ltd (`the first defendants`), a building c ontrac t in Oc tober 1998 for the c onstruc tion of a four-storey warehouse building with anc illary offic e and showroom on the site. 

The first defendants as the main c ontrac tor sub-c ontrac ted the struc tural works to Wei Sin Construc tion Pte Ltd (`the third defendants`). The third defendants in turn sub-c ontrac ted to Sin Chynta Construc tion Pte Ltd (`the fourth defendants`) fabric ation and erec tion of the formwork as well as its dismantling after use. The first defendants also sub-c ontrac ted installation of the roof trusses to Hoe Hoe Engineering Pte Ltd (`the sec ond defendants`) who sub-c ontrac ted the work in turn to the plaintiff. Liberty Citystate Insuranc e Pte Ltd (`the first third party`) are the insurers of the first defendants while Cosmic Insuranc e Corp Ltd (`the sec ond third party`) are the insurers of the third defendants. The diagram below shows the relationship of the parties: 

Please refer to the pdf file or hard c opy of this issue to view the diagam. 

As a sub-c ontrac tor of the first defendants to manufac ture and install roof trusses, the sec ond defendants also provided the requisite materials for suc h installation. 

The third defendants` sc ope of works inc luded the c onstruc tion of c olumns to support the roof, whic h work was sub-c ontrac ted to the fourth defendants. 

**_The accident_** 

On 2 September 1999 at about 10.45am, the plaintiff was informed of the arrival at the site of a trailer c arrying roof trusses; he proc eeded to supervise the delivery and unloading. Ac c ording to the senior safety supervisor of the first defendants, K Suberamaniam (`Suberamaniam`), the plaintiff had his safety helmet on. 

Just before the ac c ident, the plaintiff had c ommenc ed laying timber planks over some potholes on the ground along the vehic le washing bay ac c ess area at the site`s entranc e. The timber planks provided a pathway for the loaded trailer to c ross the washing bay area. 

At that time, two Thai workers of the fourth defendants, Changkwian Thawee (`Changkwian`) and Wongc haree Dewit (`Wongc haree`) were dismantling metal formworks at the fourth storey of the building. The roof beam area in whic h they were working was direc tly above the washing bay area. 


After unloc king eac h piec e of metal formwork, Changkwian and Wongc haree would lower it manually to the ground. Whilst lowering down one (1) of these piec es, Changkwian lost his grip. Although Wongc haree was holding the other end of the formwork, it proved too heavy for him to bear the weight alone. He released the metal formwork, it fell and hit a platform at the sec ond storey before tearing through the safety net surrounding the sec ond storey platform and hitting the plaintiff on the ground. 

The metal formwork was about 300mm wide, 1,500mm long and weighed some 17.4kg. Falling from a height of some 18m, its forc e was strong enough to c rac k the plaintiff`s safety helmet. Suberamaniam (1DW1) who was then at the nearby guardroom some 10m away from the spot, saw the plaintiff lying on the ground. He ran to the plaintiff and found him unc onsc ious with some bleeding on his left forehead. He immediately c arried the plaintiff to the guardroom and performed first-aid proc edure on the plaintiff. Suberamaniam then informed his projec t manager, Leong Chee Soon, who c alled for an ambulanc e to take the plaintiff to hospital. 

**_The injury_** 

The plaintiff was sent to National University Hospital. CT sc ans showed the plaintiff had suffered open frac tures (and bruises) on his forehead and right frontal sinus and extradural haematoma. He was operated on for his forehead frac ture, his blood c lot was evac uated, his torn dura repaired and, he was subsequently transferred to the Department of Rehabilitation Medic ine at Tan Toc k Seng Hospital (on 22 September 1999). 

The plaintiff`s injuries were serious. While he was mentally alert, he had severely reduc ed attention span and initiation; he was disoriented as to plac e, time and person. This suit was c ommenc ed by his next friend who is his brother-in-law. 

The plaintiff`s rehabilitation proc ess was also c omplic ated by disrupted sleep-wake c yc les and rec urrent post-traumatic seizures. Even after c omprehensive rehabilitation, he c ould only manage attention spans of 20 minutes, and was c apable of performing only basic self-c are skills. With his reduc ed safety awareness, he required supervision when he was outdoors. After a whole month of rehabilitation at Tan Toc k Seng Hospital, he was disc harged into the c are of his wife on 22 Oc tober 1999. 

Due to his severe traumatic brain injury, the plaintiff was c ertified to be at risk of seizures, dementia and side effec ts from medic ation, etc. He was also very likely to have permanent and severe c ognitive defic its and disability. Prolonged follow-up and medic al and neurosurgic al review were rec ommended by his doc tors. 

**_The plaintiff`s case_** 

The plaintiff alleged that the ac c ident was c aused or c ontributed to, by the negligenc e of all the four defendants or any one or more of them in that they had, in the main: 

(1) failed to provide any or any adequate c over so that persons, inc luding the plaintiff, would not be exposed to falling objec ts from the building works; 

(2) failed to provide and/or maintain a safe or proper system of work at the building; and 


(3) exposed him to a risk of damage or injury of whic h they knew or ought to have known. 

On oc c upier`s liability, the plaintiff alleged that all the four defendants, or any one or more of them, having a suffic ient degree of c ontrol over the site, were oc c upiers of the site. 

The plaintiff also alleged that all the four defendants or any one or more of them, breac hed their statutory duty under the Fac tories Ac t (Cap 104, 1998 Ed) (`the Ac t`) in that they: 

(1) failed to make and keep safe the plac e at whic h the plaintiff was working, c ontrary to s 33(3) of the Ac t; 

(2) failed to erec t any or any adequate overhead protec tion along the periphery of the building c ontrary to reg 5(1) of the Fac tories (Building Operations and Works of Engineering Construc tion) Regulations (Cap 104, Rg 8, 1999 Ed) (`the Regulations`); and 

(3) failed to use any or any suffic ient overlay or sc reening nets c ontrary to reg 100 of the Regulations. 

**_The first defendants` case_** 

The first defendants` defenc e was, that it had no knowledge of the presenc e of the fourth defendants at the site and that the fourth defendants were the subc ontrac tors of the third defendants. They c ontended that the injury was c aused by the fourth defendants` workers and attempted to shift liability to the third and fourth defendants. 

**_Occupier`s liability_** 

The law in respec t of an oc c upier`s liability is based on the c ommon law (see **Industrial Commercial Bank v Tan Swa Eng** <span class="citation">[1995] 2 SLR 716</span> at 719). The test of who is an oc c upier in law is generally ac c epted as being based on the degree of c ontrol exerc ised by suc h person over a partic ular site or building. The person who is an oc c upier in law is not required to be in exc lusive physic al oc c upation of the premises. In the House of Lords c ase of **Wheat v E Lacon & Co** [1966] AC 552[1966] 1 All ER 582 at 593-594, Lord Denning opined that: 

 wherever a person has a sufficient degree of control over premises that he ought to realise that any failure on his part to use care may result in injury to a person coming lawfully there, then he is an occupier and the person coming lawfully there is his visitor: and the occupier is under a duty to his visitor to use reasonable care. In order to be an occupier it is not necessary for a person to have entire control over the premises. He need not have exclusive occupation. Suffice it that he has some degree of control. He may share the control with others. Two or more may be occupiers. And whenever this happens, each is under a duty to use care towards persons coming lawfully on to the premises, dependent on his degree of control. If each fails in his duty, each is liable to a visitor who is injured in consequence of his failure, but each may have a claim to contribution from the other. 

The above passage is signific ant, when I later deal with the third and fourth defendants` duty and liability as oc c upiers. There is no question that under the law, it is possible to have more than one 


oc c upier liable to a visitor injured at the premises, in c irc umstanc es where the duty to use reasonable c are is found to have been breac hed. 

**_The plea of guilt_** 

The first defendants were originally c harged by the Ministry of Manpower (`MOM`) as the `oc c upier` of a building operations worksite at the site; they were said to have c ontravened reg 5(1) of the Regulations, thereby c ommitting an offenc e under s 88(1) of the Ac t, namely, a c ontravention whic h was likely to c ause the death of, or bodily injury to a person. 

In the statement of fac ts for the c harge, the first defendants were referred to as the `oc c upier` of the site. The relevant portions of **_PP v L & M Prestressing_** (Summons No MOM 4458/99) read as follows: 

 The defendant, which was the occupier and main contractor of the worksite, was carrying out the construction of a 4-storey warehouse building with ancillary office and showroom at the said worksite. 

In the subsequent amended c harge, as well as the ac c ompanying statement of fac ts, the first defendants were similarly referred to as the `oc c upier` of the site. Further, in the first defendants` plea in mitigation dated 28 June 2000, submitted by their c ounsel, they pleaded guilty to the amended c harge under s 88(1) of the Ac t. The plea, as phrased by their c ounsel, stated as follows: 

 The Defendants, L & M Prestressing Pte Ltd, have pleaded guilty to an Amended Charge under section 88(1) of the Factories Act (Cap 104) and punishable under section 89(2) of the said Act. They have also admitted without reservations to the facts of the case as tendered by the Prosecution. 

The first defendants were eventually fined (in August 2000) for c ontravening reg 5(3) of the Regulations, in relation to the ac c ident. 

Consequently, the plaintiff was entitled to assert that under s 45A(1) of the Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97, 1997 Ed), the first defendants` c onvic tion of an offenc e under the Ac t and the Regulations thereunder, should be admissible in evidenc e for the purpose of proving that the c ompany had c ommitted the offenc e. 

**_The issue of trespass_** 

I shall next deal with the issue of trespass. The first defendants alleged the plaintiff was a trespasser. They c ited his refusal to produc e his identific ation c ard in exc hange for a sec urity pass and the inability of Suberamaniam and the sec urity guard (at the main entranc e) to rec ognise the plaintiff, as evidenc e of suc h alleged trespass. Suberamaniam also told the c ourt that there was c onstant sec urity on the site. The sec urity guard took instruc tions from the first defendants` projec t manager, Leong Chee Soon. As the sec urity guard c ontrolled ac c ess to the site under the instruc tions of Leong Chee Soon, it also meant that the sec urity guard had the power to prevent unauthorised persons from entering the site. 


However, the evidenc e pointed the other way. Several witnesses had seen the plaintiff working on the site prior to the ac c ident. The plaintiff`s partner, Neo Ah Guan (`Neo`), was at the site at the material time overseeing the installation works undertaken by the plaintiff`s firm, U Chian Ironworks (`U Chian`). Another of the plaintiff`s witnesses, Tee Tar Foh (PW3), who was a freelanc e worker employed by U Chian at the time, also said that the plaintiff was at the site from July 1999 (when work c ommenc ed at the site), until the day of the ac c ident. The sec ond defendants` witness, Sik Hing (2DW1), their direc tor, also said that he had met the plaintiff at the site before the day of the ac c ident. Chan Wai Keong (2DW2), the projec t c o-ordinator of the sec ond defendants, also said that he had seen the plaintiff on one or two oc c asions before the day of the ac c ident, doing supervision. Aaron Soh Eng Siong (`Soh`), a direc tor of the third defendants, told the c ourt that he had met the plaintiff at the site before the day of the ac c ident. Changkwian (the Thai worker of the fourth defendants who dropped the metal formwork) also testified he had seen the plaintiff at the site before the day of the ac c ident. The testimony of these witnesses was not c hallenged by the first defendants. 

A signific ant fac t whic h emerged from the evidenc e was that there was no c onsistent prac tic e (on the part of the first defendants) requiring persons entering the site to exc hange their identific ation c ards for sec urity passes. Consequently, the plaintiff was an invitee or a business visitor. 

More signific antly, U Chian was engaged by the sec ond defendants as a sub-c ontrac tor and the plaintiff was/is a partner of U Chian. Therefore, he had every right to be at the site with the implied if not express, c onsent, of the first defendants. The fac t that the first defendants were unaware of U Chian`s engagement by the sec ond defendants, c ontrary to the standard sub-c ontrac t terms applic able to the letter of award between the first and sec ond defendants dated 30 Marc h 1999 (see c l 14A.1 at AB97) does not c hange the plaintiff`s position vis-.-vis the first defendants nor render him a trespasser. 

**_Breach of duty to use reasonable care_** 

The first defendants, as `oc c upiers` of the site, owed a duty to a business visitor suc h as the plaintiff, not to c reate a trap or to allow a c onc ealed danger to exist upon the premises, of whic h the first defendants knew or ought to have known. In **Indermaur v Dames** [1866] LR 1 CP 274 (see also **Industrial Commercial Bank v Tan Swa Eng** <span class="citation">[1995] 2 SLR 716</span> at 719 and **Awang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction & Engineering Co** <span class="citation">[1997] 3 SLR 677</span> at [para ]30), Willes J said: 

 ... with respect to such a visitor at least, we consider it settled law, that he, using reasonable care on his part for his own safety, is entitled to expect that the occupier shall on his part use reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual danger which he knows or ought to know; and that, where there is evidence of neglect, the question whether such reasonable care has been taken ... and whether there was contributory negligence in the sufferer, must be determined ... as a matter of fact ... 

The first defendants relied on **Mohd bin Sapri v Soil-Build** <span class="citation">[1996] 2 SLR 505</span> at 505-506 to argue that the duty of an oc c upier to use reasonable c are to prevent unusual dangers whic h the oc c upier knew or ought to have known about, only relates to the physic al c ondition of the premises, as opposed to c urrent operations at the site. The ac c ident to the plaintiff arose from c urrent operations at the site c arried out by the fourth defendants. The c urrent operation was c arried out in an unsafe manner over whic h the first defendants had no c ontrol (see **Mohd Sainudin bin Ahmad v** 


**Consolidated Hotels** [1987] SLR 556 [1989] 1 MLJ 297 ). 

However, it is to be noted that in **_Mohd bin Sapri_** (supra), the Chief Justic e also quoted with approval the c ase of **Ferguson v Welsh** [1987] 3 All ER 777 at 783: 

 It would not ordinarily be reasonable to expect an occupier of premises having engaged a contractor whom he has reasonable grounds for regarding as competent, to supervise the contractors activities in order to ensure that he was discharging his duty to his employees to observe a safe system of work. In special circumstances, on the other hand, where the occupier knows or has reason to suspect that the contractor is using an unsafe system of work, it might well be reasonable for the occupier to take steps to see that the system was made safe. [Emphasis is added.] 

Suberamaniam admitted that he was fully aware that workers were dismantling formworks on the fourth storey of the building at the material time and, that there was inadequate overhead protec tion. Suberamaniam also admitted that the overhead protec tion had not been erec ted, rather, it was in the proc ess of being erec ted. 

The plaintiff`s partner Neo (PW2) had testified that the green netting was about three (3) storeys high. After the ac c ident, he notic ed that the netting was put up to the fourth level. Someone had obviously notic ed the inadequate safety netting and rec tified the omission immediately after the ac c ident. Tee Tar Foh (the plaintiff`s freelanc e worker) had also testified that the area where the ac c ident oc c urred was not c ordoned off at the ground level. 

It was c lear that there was a c onc ealed danger along the perimeter of the building at ground level, due to the dangers posed by falling objec ts. Suc h danger would not be immediately apparent to anyone walking at the ground level below. 

In the c irc umstanc es, the first defendants had failed to give adequate notic e of suc h c onc ealed danger. There was no warning whatsoever to workers on the site of the danger of falling objec ts, in the absenc e of the overhead shelter. Suberamaniam was a full-time senior safety supervisor of the first defendants. He agreed that it was essential for the overhead shelter/protec tion to have been c ompleted before any dismantling of the formworks was c arried out. He also admitted that the overhead shelter had not been erec ted along the periphery of the building under c onstruc tion. He also admitted that there was a breac h of reg 5(1) of the Regulations. 

Even ac c epting that the first defendants c ould rely on the third defendants to dismantle the formworks, the evidenc e c learly showed that the first defendants were fully aware of the unsafe work prac tic e adopted by workers of the fourth defendants, with the absenc e of the safety netting. There is little doubt that the first defendants breac hed their duty to use reasonable c are. As suc h, the ac c ident and the injury to the plaintiff were c aused (or c ontributed to) by the breac hes of the first defendants` duty as oc c upiers of the site. 

Consequently, I agree with c ounsel for the plaintiff that the first defendants had: 

(1) exposed the plaintiff to a risk of injury from a hazard or an unusual or c onc ealed danger, of whic h the first defendants knew or ought to have known; 

(2) failed to warn the plaintiff suffic iently or at all that there were works c arried out on the formwork whic h would pose a hazard or an unusual or c onc ealed danger of whic h they knew or ought to have 


known; and 

(3) c aused or permitted the building or the plac e where the plaintiff was standing to bec ome or remain a hazardous plac e to work or a plac e with unusual or c onc ealed danger. 

**_Negligence_** 

The first defendants argued that they ought not to be made liable, as the work had been subc ontrac ted to the third defendants. However, in **_Mohd bin Sapri v Soil-Build_** (supra) the Court of Appeal made it c lear (at p 514) that: 

 A person who appoints independent contractors does not, ipso facto, absolve himself of any liability in negligence to the employees of his independent contractors. He may still be liable where the working conditions were inherently dangerous, thereby requiring the exercise of significant degree of supervision and control over persons with whom he has no contractual relationship. Alternatively, ... he may have to observe such a duty if he had taken it upon himself to exercise a degree of control and actively co-ordinate the independent contractors activities, given that the work environment itself involved inherent risks or danger. Thus, both elements of danger and control will have to be considered. [Emphasis is added.] 

The first defendants as the main c ontrac tor, were in overall c harge of safety on the site with Suberamaniam as their senior safety supervisor. There had been previous oc c asions where the first defendants had fined the third defendants for c arrying out unsafe work prac tic es at the site. That being the c ase, the first defendants should not have left the matter and method of dismantling formworks, to their sub-c ontrac tors and the third defendants in partic ular, without making c ertain that the latter had taken adequate safety prec autions. 

It should have been reasonably foreseeable that someone c oming onto the site would be injured if the first defendants failed to disc harge their duty. There was also suffic ient proximity between the first defendants and the plaintiff. In **_Awang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction & Engineering Co_** (supra at [para ]20), the Court of Appeal made it c lear that a main c ontrac tor owed a duty of c are to a workman as if he was the workman`s `employer`, notwithstanding that the workman was not employed by him but by a sub-c ontrac tor, if he (the main c ontrac tor) exerc ised or had the right of c ontrol over the workman in respec t of the work whic h the workman was engaged to perform. 

The first defendants had been c onvic ted for breac h of reg 5(1) under the Ac t, to whic h they pleaded guilty. They had then penalised the third defendants by c harging to the latter, (more than) the fine they had paid to the MOM. At the very least, there was a failure on the part of the first defendants, through Suberamaniam, to ensure that workers at the site were qualified to c arry out their work. 

Changkwian (4DW2) who dropped the metal formwork, c onfirmed that he only started working with metal formwork two (2) months prior to the ac c ident. He testified that his fellow worker Wongc haree, was even less experienc ed in handling metal formwork. Changkwian admitted that the first time he ac tually dismantled metal formwork was whilst working at the site; it was also the first time for Wongc haree, a fac t unknown to Suberamaniam. 

Suberamaniam was aware that the third defendants and/or their sub-c ontrac tors had c onsistently failed to c omply with safety regulations. In fac t, there were warning notic es issued by the first to the 


third, defendants. Although there were informal meetings to brief workers on ongoing unsafe prac tic es at the site, there were no spec ific briefings pertaining to safety when dismantling metal formwork. Taking these fac tors into ac c ount, I am of the view that the first defendants owed a duty of c are to all invitees, as they had taken upon themselves the task of exerc ising a degree of c ontrol and had ac tively c o-ordinated the various sub-c ontrac tors` ac tivities, given that the work environment itself involved inherent risks or dangers. 

It is noteworthy that unknown to the MOM (ac c ording to their fac tory inspec tor, Januri Jaafar), Suberamaniam himself did not have the requisite minimum two (2) years` experienc e as a site foreman before taking up his appointment as a site safety supervisor, as required under reg 25(3) of the Regulations. Indeed, it appeared that he was unfamiliar with the safe handling of metal formwork. He was not in a position to give instruc tions on how to dismantle metal formworks safely, even if he had wanted to do so. 

Under reg 5(1) of the Regulations, overhead protec tion must be erec ted along the periphery of every building whic h is under c onstruc tion. The only exc eption is when the building is less than 15m in height. It was c onfirmed by Suberamaniam that no overhead protec tion had been erec ted along the periphery of the building. Januri Jaafar (PW7), of the MOM c onfirmed there was no periphery overhead protec tion around the building, when he visited the site to c onduc t investigations, shortly after the ac c ident. This resulted in the first defendants being c harged, c onvic ted and fined under s 89(3) of the Ac t. 

Under reg 100 of the Regulations, where a sc affold is erec ted in an area where c onstruc tion ac tivities may pose hazards to pedestrian or vehic ular traffic in the form of falling objec ts, overlay or sc reening nets shall be used to envelope the sc affold. The first defendants failed to c omply with this regulation. Suberamaniam c onfirmed that the safety net was only `going up gradually from the third to the fourth storeys` whilst work was already being c arried out at the fourth storey. 

**_Causation_** 

On the question of c ausation, the ac c ident would not have happened had a proper system of supervision been in plac e. Had the overhead protec tion been up to the third storey on the day of the ac c ident, the plaintiff would not have suffered head and other injuries. The impac t of the forc e of the free-falling metal formwork would undoubtedly have been reduc ed by the overhead protec tion, thereby minimising if not, avoiding the ac c ident. Further, had the safety net been raised to the level of the fourth storey, the path of the free-falling metal formworks c ould have been diverted, thereby preventing the ac c ident altogether. There was also a lac k of warning signs in the area immediately below where the dismantling works were being c arried out; added to that is the fac t that the area was not c ordoned off. 

**_The Factories Act and breach of statutory duties_** 

In **_Awang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction & Engineering Co_** (supra at 679), the Court of Appeal made it c lear that the objec t and purpose of the (Fac tories) Ac t deemed it inc umbent on the `oc c upier` of the premises to show that he has taken all reasonable steps to make and keep the plac e of work safe for anyone working there. The rationale, as explained, is that only the `oc c upier` has the requisite knowledge and expertise in respec t of suc h matters, and is in a position to ensure c omplianc e with the Ac t. 


Reading s 88(1) with s 88(2) and (3) of the Ac t, the duty on the first defendants as oc c upier and main c ontrac tor is non-delegable. In **Lim Chin Yok Co v Malayan Insurance Co Inc** [1975] 1 MLJ 101 , Choor Singh J said (at p 103I): 

 A statutory duty is absolute in the sense that whatever the statute prescribes must be strictly performed. If the Act, according to its true construction, has not been complied with, liability is automatic. In this sense the defendants had failed to perform their duty and this breach of duty had resulted in harm to the plaintiff. He was therefore entitled to succeed in his claim for damages against the defendants. 

In the c irc umstanc es, the first defendants breac hed their statutory duty, as they had failed to make and keep safe, the plac e at whic h the plaintiff was working, c ontrary to s 33(3) of the Ac t. They also failed to erec t any or any adequate overhead protec tion along the periphery of the building, c ontrary to reg 5(1) of the Regulations. Their site supervisor (Suberamaniam) did not even have the requisite qualific ation under reg 25(3)(c ). 

Two names whic h c ropped up frequently during the c ross-examination of Suberamaniam were the projec t manager Leong Chee Soon and the safety offic er Daniel Teo. The impression Suberamaniam gave was that Leong Chee Soon and Daniel Teo played important roles in ensuring safety on the site. However, neither of them were c alled to testify and no reasons were offered for their absenc e from c ourt. I c an only surmise that if c alled, their evidenc e would not have been favourable to the first defendants. 

I would therefore allow the c laim by the plaintiff against the first defendants as c laimed. 

**_The second defendants_** 

The sec ond defendants were sub-c ontrac tors of the first defendants. In turn, they sub-c ontrac ted to the plaintiff the work of fabric ating the roof trusses to the building. The plaintiff raised the same c auses of ac tion against the sec ond defendants. However, it is diffic ult to see how the sec ond defendants c an be liable. 

U Chian was engaged by the sec ond defendants by way of a letter dated 18 June 1999 (`the letter`). The sec ond defendants did not have direc t c ontrol and supervision over the manner of performanc e of work by the plaintiff`s firm. Under c l 5 of the letter (see AB115), the plaintiff himself was to employ a skilled and c ompetent supervisor to supervise and c o-ordinate the works at the site. 

The plaintiff`s partner Neo c onfirmed in re-examination (N/E 14) that the sec ond defendants did not supervise the plaintiff or him in their work. Neo c onfirmed that both he and the plaintiff were skilled in the installation of roof trusses and they mainly supervised their own workers. This inc luded taking delivery of the materials at the site. 

The sec ond defendants had no c ontrol over the installation and dismantling of the metal formworks. Neither were they responsible for the erec tion of safety netting where the metal formworks were c onstruc ted. It was c lear from the evidenc e that the c onstruc tion of overhead protec tion and safety netting around the periphery of the building at the site was outside the sec ond defendants` sc ope of work and responsibility. Neither were the sec ond defendants responsible as regards entry of visitors and workers, and the overall safety regulations at the site. There was no evidenc e to c onc lude that 


the sec ond defendants had suffic ient or any c ontrol of the site so as to be deemed an `oc c upier`. 

The ac c ident was c aused by two Thai workers of the fourth defendants. Even if it c an be said that the sec ond defendants owed a duty of c are to the plaintiff as an employee, there was no evidenc e to suggest that the sec ond defendants or their workers c aused or c ontributed to the ac c ident. 

Consequently, the plaintiff`s c laim against the sec ond defendants is dismissed with c osts. 

**_The third defendants_** 

The third defendants` sc ope of work, as a sub-c ontrac tor of the first defendants inc luded, inter alia, struc tural works at the site. The third defendants were also required to erec t the c olumns supporting the roof of the building; they sub-c ontrac ted part of their work to the fourth defendants. 

The third defendants` c ontention was simply that their relationship with the fourth defendants was not one of master and servant, but that the latter was employed as an independent c ontrac tor. Henc e, they were not responsible for any harm c aused by the fourth defendants` Thai workers to the plaintiff. 

However, that was not the evidenc e adduc ed in c ourt. At the material time, there was indeed a relationship of master and servant between the third and fourth defendants. 

An employee is a servant if he is `subjec t to the c ommand of his master as to the manner in whic h he shall do his work` (see **Yewens v Noakes** [1880] 6 QBD 530 at 532-533). In **Queensland Stations v Federal Commissioner of Taxation** [1945] 70 CLR 539 Latham CJ (at p 545) defined it thus: 

 If the work to be done by one person for another is subject to the control and direction of the latter person in the manner of doing it, the person doing the work is a servant and not an independent contractor, and prima facie his reward would be wages. An independent contractor undertakes to produce a given result, but is not, in the actual execution of the work, under the order or control of the person for whom he does it. 

The c onventional test is as stated by Denning LJ in **Stevenson Jordan & Harrison v Macdonald & Evans** [1952] 1 TLR 101 at 111 where he established the `organisation` or `enterprise c ontrol` test. The question to be answered appears to be whether the person`s work was subjec ted to c oordinational c ontrol as to `where` and `when`, rather than the `how`: 

 under a contract of service, a man is employed as part of the business, and his work is done as an integral part of the business; whereas, under a contract for services, his work, although done for the business, is not integrated into it but only accessory to it. 

That muc h is c lear. 

The third defendants sub-c ontrac ted labour from the fourth defendants. On the day of the ac c ident, the fourth defendants` two Thai workers were c ontinuing to dismantle formworks based on instruc tions given to them the previous day, by the third defendants` foreman. 


The evidenc e was that the fourth defendants` workers rec eived instruc tions direc tly from the third defendants. Changkwian maintained that the instruc tions to dismantle the metal formworks c ame from the third defendants. It was revealed by Tan Ken Siong (`Tan`), a direc tor of the fourth defendants, that his workers took instruc tions from the third defendants` representatives at the site. Tan (4DW1) testified that a foreman and a supervisor on the site gave instruc tions to dismantle the metal formworks. 

The third defendants` direc tor, Soh, had c ontrac ted workers from the fourth defendants after his c ompany ran into problems with their initial sub-c ontrac tor. Soh said he did not take any steps to verify whether the fourth defendants` workers were skilled or qualified to c arry out dismantling of metal formworks. He was under great pressure to c omplete the third defendants` sc ope of works as the original sub-c ontrac tor his c ompany hired failed to c arry out the work expeditiously. I very muc h doubt that Soh was at all c onc erned with whether the fourth defendants` workers were skilled. He hardly dealt with the fourth defendants` workers and left it to his site supervisor, Lim Che Leng (`Lim`), to take c are of the operations at the site. 

Lim (3DW2) on his part did not perform his duties satisfac torily. He was not even aware when the projec t was sc heduled to be c ompleted. In fac t, when asked if he oc c asionally c hec ked on the works, his answer was in the negative. Pressed further on the point, Lim c ountered that the site engineer of the first defendants was supposed to c hec k on the progress of the work relating to metal formworks that it was not his, but the engineer`s, responsibility. It turned out that Lim did not c hec k on the fourth defendants` workers on the day of the ac c ident. Neither did he brief them regarding safety proc edures for the dismantling. In fac t, Lim was aware of the dismantling work on the day of the ac c ident. He saw the fourth defendants` workers working at the edge of the building; he ac knowledged that there was a risk of falling objec ts. Lim was also aware that there was no overhead protec tion and that the safety net was not up to the level where the fourth defendants` Thai workers were working. Not only did Lim fail to supervise and fail to instruc t the fourth defendants` workers to take extra c are (bec ause there was no overhead protec tion), he also failed to inform Suberamaniam about these unsafe work prac tic es. 

It turned out that the fourth defendants` workers who c arried out the dismantling work were neither skilled, qualified nor suffic iently experienc ed to c arry out the dismantling work. 

The evidenc e revealed that the third defendants were unable to c omplete their work in ac c ordanc e with the c ontrac tual deadline stipulated by the first defendants. Indeed, Soh c onfirmed that the projec t was already behind sc hedule between July and August 1999. In c onsequenc e, the third defendants rec eived a c laim for liquidated damages from the first defendants. 

As a result of the delay in c ompletion and the threat of liquidated damages, the third defendants rushed their work and c ut c orners in terms of safety and safe work prac tic es. No one supervised the fourth defendants` workers who turned out to be inexperienc ed and unqualified. Had there been supervision by Lim or anyone else, the ac c ident may not have happened. 

The evidenc e suggests a lac k of c hain of c ommand between the third and fourth defendants. The fourth defendants` workers rec eived no proper instruc tions, were not supervised and had to improvise their own methods of work. 

**_Occupier`s liability_** 


Consequently, the third defendants had a suffic ient degree of c ontrol over the site. In **China Insurance Co v Woh Hup** [1975-1977] SLR 583 [1977] 2 MLJ 57 at 59A, the c ourt ac c epted the definition of an `oc c upier` as `he who has the immediate supervision and c ontrol and the power of permitting or prohibiting the entry of other persons`. The third defendants c an justifiably be regarded as an `oc c upier`. In c onsequenc e of the failure to supervise the fourth defendants` workers, the third defendants rendered the site an unsafe plac e of work. 

In the c irc umstanc es, I allow the plaintiff`s c laims against the third defendants. 

**_The fourth defendants_** 

By an oral agreement entered in early August 1999, between the third and fourth defendants, the former agreed to engage the latter as a sub-c ontrac tor to supply workers to install and dismantle the metal formworks at the site. The fourth defendants c harged a lump sum of $45,000 for the subc ontrac t. 

As stated earlier, the Thai workers of the fourth defendants were inexperienc ed; they also had no proper supervision. The fourth defendants vic ariously owed a duty of c are to the plaintiff to provide a safe and proper system of work. In **Dobb & Co v Hecla** [1972-1974] SLR 522 [1973] 2 MLJ 128 at 129, the c ourt said: 

 A person who, though not an occupier of premises, actually creates a danger and has reason to expect that other persons will be lawfully on the premises during the existence of that danger owes them a duty to take reasonable care. This duty arises quite independently of the occupation of premises. It does not arise out of any invitation or licence. 

Changkwian told the c ourt (NE 230) that the first time he had dismantled metal formworks was when he was employed by the fourth defendants. Although Changkwian had attended a c arpentry c ourse (c onduc ted by a Singapore institute) in Singapore, that only taught him how to assemble metal formworks (NE 232); he was never taught how to dismantle metal formworks. To make matters worse, the worker who was paired with Changkwian on the day of the ac c ident, Wongc haree, had even less experienc e than Changkwian in handling metal formworks. It was the first time Wongc haree dismantled metal formworks while working at the site. 

The Thai workers adopted unsafe work prac tic es; Changkwian told the c ourt that whenever a metal formwork was stuc k, he would shake the formwork to loosen it. Changkwian admitted that suc h methods he and Wongc haree employed were an unsafe method of dismantling metal formworks. He further c onc eded that if he had adopted a safe method, the ac c ident would not have oc c urred. Changkwian was also fully aware that the area below the dismantling works was not c ordoned off and lac ked overhead protec tion. The evidenc e also revealed that Changkwian did not shout any warning when the metal formwork fell. 

There was ample evidenc e of a failure to ensure and put in plac e, a system of proper supervision. Tan told the c ourt that no one was employed by the fourth defendants to supervise the dismantling of the metal formworks, the reason being that the job was only for 2[half ] months. During that period, Tan did not visit the site. Apparently he would meet Soh outside the site (NE 215). Tan`s son Tan Yew Keng (4DW4) testified (NE 283-284) that he only went to the site to pass tools to the fourth defendants` workers but did not supervise the works or visit the site although he was a site 


supervisor himself. Tan c onsistently maintained that the third defendants were c ontrac tually bound to supervise his workers and implement safe working prac tic es. Tan admitted that he had been shown warning notic es by the third defendants pertaining to breac hes of safety at the site. These warning notic es had been issued by the first defendants c onc erning the danger of falling roof materials. Although Tan c laimed he had asked Soh to send a foreman to instruc t and supervise his workers on how to remove the roof materials, Tan did not follow-up to c hec k whether this was done. 

The evidenc e also revealed that the fourth defendants` workers had to work more than 90 hours a week at the site; they would have been tired out from the long hours and their physic al c ondition and alertness must have been affec ted. 

The fourth defendants would or should have known that their Thai workers were not qualified or experienc ed to dismantle the metal formworks. Changkwian knew that the safe way to dismantle metal formworks was by means of ropes, but this was never put into prac tic e. There was a lac k of supervision of the workers c oupled with the omission to c ordon off the area below the dismantling works. Further, the fourth defendants failed to stop all dismantling works, despite being aware of the lac k of overhead protec tion. 

Consequently, I also allow the plaintiff`s c laims against the fourth defendants. 

**_Contributory negligence_** 

Was there c ontributory negligenc e on the plaintiff`s part as all the defendants c ontended? They alleged that he was aware of the dismantling works and thus the danger, yet the plaintiff went ahead to lay the wooden planks at a plac e that was so near to the building. 

A referenc e to the House of Lords dec ision in **AC Billings & Sons v Riden** [1958] AC 240[1957] 3 All ER 1 would be helpful at this stage. Their Lordships made it c lear that the c ontrac tors in the c ase owed a duty to all persons who might be expec ted lawfully to visit the house to take suc h c are as was, in all the c irc umstanc es, reasonable to ensure that they were not exposed to danger. Where the plaintiff **_was aware of the danger_** , but in all the c irc umstanc es, a reasonable person would have risked inc urring it, the c ontrac tors were not absolved from liability either by giving a warning or by relianc e on the plaintiff`s knowledge. In c onsidering what a reasonable person would realise or would do in a partic ular situation, regard must be had to human nature, and if in that situation, the great majority of people would behave in one way, it is not right to say that a reasonable person would have behaved in another. Lord Reid put it very suc c inc tly ([1958] AC 240 at 255; [1957] 3 All ER 1 at 8) as follows: 

 I agree with Hallett J that the question is not whether she realised the danger but whether the facts which she knew would have caused a reasonable person in her position to realise the danger. But in considering what a reasonable person would realise or would do in a particular situation we must have regard to human nature as we know it, and, if one thinks that in a particular situation the great majority of people would have behaved in one way, it would not be right to say that a reasonable man would or should have behaved in a different way. A reasonable man does not mean a paragon of circumspection. [Emphasis is added.] 

To say from the outset that the plaintiff was aware of the danger of falling metal formwork would be premature. One must first c onsider whether the plaintiff **_was indeed aware of the danger_** from 


falling metal formwork. The c ase **The Heranger** [1939] AC 94 established that the burden of proving c ontributory negligenc e on the plaintiff rests on the defendant(s). This may be inferred from the plaintiff`s own evidenc e ( **Baker v E Longhurst & Sons** [1933] 2 KB 461) or, on a balanc e of probabilities from the fac ts ( **Gibby v East Grinstead Gas and Water Co** [1944] 1 All ER 358). 

The defendants tried to c onvinc e the c ourt that the plaintiff should not have been working at the area below the dismantling works. Their c ounsel tried to show that the area was an obvious danger zone given the dismantling works that was going on above. The plaintiff`s partner (Neo) had however testified that he did not think that a piec e of formwork might be allowed to fall from the building. Indeed, Suberamaniam said he did not expec t objec ts to fall into the washing bay. Lim Che Leng of the third defendants said that he did not expec t that formwork would fly off. Wong Koc k Keong (4DW3), the fourth defendants` foreman, maintained that it was unexpec ted for flying objec ts to fall out of the safety net. Suc h c onsistent evidenc e c onfirmed that a reasonable person would not perc eive the area below the dismantling works as a danger zone. 

The defendants sought to argue that the area was out of bounds to people working at the site that it was only for vehic les to move in and out of the site. However, this was not borne out by the evidenc e from Chan Wai Kheong (2DW2) of the sec ond defendants; the dismantling works on the upper levels were not that obvious, partic ularly to onlookers from below. There was no indic ation that the area was out of bounds as no warning signs were plac ed around the area; neither was it c ordoned off. Januri Jaafar had opined that there was no reason for the plaintiff not to be there, unless the area was c ordoned off. 

Consequently, there was insuffic ient evidenc e to c onc lude that the plaintiff was aware of the danger of falling metal formwork. In any c ase, in view of the distanc e of the washing bay area from the edge of the building, it c ould not be regarded that a reasonable man would or should have behaved in a different manner. The plaintiff was wearing a safety helmet at the time of the ac c ident. Suberamaniam had also c onfirmed that the plaintiff was not in breac h of any safety prac tic es. To ac c ept the defendants` c ontention would be to put an onerous burden on the plaintiff to behave with exc eptional c aution. 

**_The issue of joint and several liability_** 

Counsel for the plaintiff submitted one (1) judgment sum should be awarded against all four (4) defendants, c iting **Dingle v Associated Newspapers** [1961] 2 QB 162[1961] 1 All ER 897 in support. In that c ase, Devlin LJ said ([1961] 2 QB 162 at 188-189; [1961] 1 All ER 897 at 916): 

 Where injury has been done to the plaintiff and the injury is indivisible, any tortfeasor whose act has been a proximate cause of the injury must compensate for the whole of it. As between the plaintiff and the defendant it is immaterial that there are others whose acts also have been a cause of the injury and it does not matter whether those others have or have not a good defence. These factors would be relevant in a claim between tortfeasors for contribution, but the plaintiff is not concerned with that; he can obtain judgment for total compensation from anyone whose acts has been a cause of his injury. If there are more than one of such persons, it is immaterial to the plaintiff whether they are joint tortfeasors or not. If four men, acting severally and not in concert, strike the plaintiff one after another and as a result of his injuries he suffers shock and is detained in hospital and loses a months wages, each wrongdoer is liable to compensate for the whole loss of earnings. If there were four distinct physical injuries, each man would be liable only for the consequences peculiar to the injury he inflicted, but in the example I have given the loss of earnings is one injury caused in part by all four defendants. 


In the loc al c ase of **Oli Mohamed v Murphy** [1969-1971] SLR 270 [1969] 2 MLJ 244 at 245, Choor Singh J said: 

 Counsel for the second defendant submitted that if the court holds that both defendants were equally negligent, then the judgment against the second defendant should be only for 50% of the total sum assessed as damages in this case. In my opinion this submission also fails. It is clear law that if each of several persons, not acting in concert, commits a tort against another person substantially contemporaneously and causing the same or indivisible damage, each tortfeasor is liable for the whole damage. 

And he c ited with approval Devlin LJ`s dec ision on this point in **_Dingle v Associated Newspapers_** (supra). 

In **Chuang Uming v Setron** <span class="citation">[2000] 1 SLR 166</span> the Court of Appeal held (at p 168): 

 Where the damage or injury was occasioned by more than one party, the question whether there should be joint or separate liability depended essentially on the facts and in particular the damage caused. If the damage caused could be identified and isolated as attributable to the negligent act or the breach of contract of each party, then a separate judgment in respect of that damage could be entered against each of [the parties]. If, however, the damage caused by the parties could not be so identified and isolated, but form indivisible parts of the entire damage, it would not be possible to enter separate judgments against each of them. On the facts, both the defective workmanship and the defective design contributed to the tile debonding. The contractors and the architects defaults indisputably overlapped and contributed to the same damage. A joint judgment was therefore the natural result. 

I had found that the first, third and fourth defendants were eac h a proximate c ause of the injury inflic ted on the plaintiff. Although they were not ac ting in c onc ert when the ac c ident happened, their c ontemporaneous ac ts of omission c aused the indivisible damage to the plaintiff. The defendants left it to the others to take the nec essary prec autions and, c umulatively, they did nothing at all. Eac h turned a blind eye to safe working prac tic es and relied on the others. Their faults and breac hes indisputably overlapped suc h that eac h of them must be held liable to the plaintiff for the whole damage. 

**_The first and second third parties_** 

By an All Risks Insuranc e Polic y dated 11 Dec ember 1998, the first third party agreed to indemnify the first defendants, the first defendants` sub-c ontrac tors, nominated sub-c ontrac tors and their c ontrac tor, against c ertain liabilities, for the period 8 November 1998 to 7 September 2000. 

The first third party in the main sought to c onvinc e the c ourt that it was not liable to indemnify the third and the fourth defendants, for their liability to the plaintiff. The relevant portions of the insuranc e polic y stated as follows: 

 Name of Insured 


 L & M Prestressing Pte Ltd as main contractor & their subcontractors, nominated subcontractors and their contractors and Stamford Tyres International Pte Ltd as principle FTRR&I 11 Third Chin Bee Road Singapore 618687. 

 Period of Insurance 

 From 8th November 1998 to 7th September 2000. 

 Contract Title 

 Proposed erection of a 4-storey single-user, single occupier warehouse Building with ancillary office and showroom on Lot 2864W (Plot A2932) MK 6 at 19 Lok Yang Way Singapore. 

 Endorsements, Warranties and/or Clauses Printed in this Policy or attached hereto 

 Employers Representatives, Government and Statutory Board Employees as Third Party It is hereby declared and noted that employer, consultants and their authorised representative and employees, Government and Statutory Board Employees shall be regarded as Third Parties. 

The third defendants joined the sec ond third party to the proc eedings. The third defendants c laimed a dec laration that the Public Liability Polic y issued by the sec ond third party c overed the third defendants` legal liability. The sec ond third party`s polic y was a general polic y. The relevant c lauses are as follows: 

 Name of Insured 

 Wei Sin Construction Pte Ltd 

 Period of Insurance 

 From 1st January 1999 to 31st December 1999 (both dates inclusive) 

 Place to which Policy applies 

 Anywhere in Singapore 

 Description of risk 

 General third party indemnity in respect of legal liability caused by the fault or negligence of the insured in connection with the business. 


 Warranty 

 Warranted that if the Insured is covered under any other policy for Public Liability Insurance the Corporation will not indemnify the insured nor be called upon to contribute under this policy. 

The sec ond third party`s defenc e was that the warranty in the polic y has the effec t of exc luding its liability. The third defendants` polic y with the sec ond third party avoided liability if there was any other polic y c overing third party liability. The first defendants` polic y with the first third party was a Contrac tors` All Risks Polic y with a muc h wider sc ope of c overage. 

The sec ond third party argued that the third defendants were c overed by the first third party that is, the spec ific Contrac tor`s All Risks Polic y issued to c over any liability to third parties under the projec t. The third defendants` insuranc e polic y with the sec ond third party c overed all their building projec ts in Singapore for a one-year period of 1999. On the other hand, the first defendants` insuranc e polic y with the first third party was spec ific ally for the Lok Yang Way projec t c overing the period 8 November 1998 to 7 September 1999. 

As a matter of interpretation, the first third party`s polic y did c over the third defendants. In the c irc umstanc es, the sec ond third party`s warranty c lause c ame into operation, exc luding c overage of indemnity for the third defendants. Henc e, the first third party`s insuranc e polic y should indemnify the third defendants in respec t of their liability to the plaintiff. 

The fourth defendants also sought to rely on the first third party`s Contrac tor`s All Risks Polic y. They pleaded that they were the sub-c ontrac tor of the third defendants; even so, the fourth defendants were not the insured under the polic y sc hedule. The polic y only c overed main c ontrac tors, their appointed sub-c ontrac tors and nominated sub-c ontrac tors. The fourth defendants did not fit into any of these c ategories. In **_Awang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction & Engineering Co_** , the Court of Appeal (supra at [para ]58), held that the term `sub-c ontrac tors` did not inc lude sub-subc ontrac tors. Suc h an interpretation was also in line with the intention of the parties. As stated earlier, there was a spec ific c lause, namely c l 14A.1(e), in the first defendants` sub-c ontrac t with sub-c ontrac tors (inc luding the third defendants) whic h prohibited further sub-c ontrac ting by the third defendants, without prior written c onsent. 

**_Conclusion_** 

In summary, I find that the first, third and fourth defendants are liable for the ac c ident and I award one interloc utory judgment against them in favour of the plaintiff. Damages to the plaintiff will be assessed/awarded by the Registrar at a later stage and the c osts of suc h assessment shall be reserved to the Registrar. The plaintiff`s c laim against the sec ond defendant is dismissed with c osts. The first third party shall indemnify the first and third defendants for their liability to the plaintiff. However, the fourth defendants` c laim against the first third party is dismissed with c osts. 

Having given the matter due c onsideration, I am not inc lined to make either a ` **_Bullock_** order` or a ` **_Sanderson_** order` for c osts in this c ase, as neither is appropriate even though the plaintiff`s c laims against the four defendants were in the alternative. 

(delivering the supplemental judgment): 


After I had released my judgment dated 31 August 2001, c ounsel for the plaintiff wrote in for further submissions on the issue of c osts, in partic ular with referenc e to the last paragraph of my judgment; I had dec lined to make either a **_Bullock_** or a **_Sanderson_** order for c osts in favour of the plaintiff. 

Counsel for the plaintiff sought to persuade me to make one of these two orders for c osts. The **_Bullock_** order for c osts is derived from the c ase **Bullock v London General Omnibus Co** [1907] 1 KB 264. In essenc e it means that the plaintiff pays the c osts of the suc c essful defendant. Onc e he has paid, he is allowed to rec over these c osts from the unsuc c essful defendant (on the same issues) in addition to his own c osts inc urred in respec t of the c laim against the unsuc c essful defendant. 

The **_Sanderson_** order for c osts c omes from the c ase **Sanderson v Blyth Theatre Co** [1903] 2 KB 533. When suc h an order is made, it means that the unsuc c essful defendant has to pay direc t to the suc c essful defendant, the latter`s c osts, in addition to paying the c osts of the plaintiff inc urred in respec t of the c laim against the unsuc c essful defendant. 

Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that his c lient should not be made to pay the c osts of the suc c essful sec ond defendant as suc h c osts were reasonably and properly inc urred, that being the test propounded in both c ases. 

Elaborating on the above submission, c ounsel for the plaintiff pointed out that when the plaintiff c ommenc ed these proc eedings (on 11 July 2000), he was not in a position to know whic h party/parties had c aused the ac c ident. The investigations by MOM had also not been c ompleted. Consequently, the plaintiff had no alternative but to sue all the defendants. It was only in the c ourse of trial that evidenc e emerged as to the parties who were ac tually responsible for the plaintiff`s injuries. 

Counsel submitted that reasonableness must be measured at the time when the plaintiff brought the ac tion the c ourt will look at all the fac ts whic h the plaintiff knew. He c ited **Besterman v British Motor Cab Co** [1914] 3 KB 181 whic h headnotes read: 

 A plaintiff who was injured in a collision between a motor cab and an omnibus joined the owners of both vehicles as defendants in an action to recover damages for injuries sustained. He obtained a verdict with damages against the motor cab company, but the omnibus company obtained a verdict in their favour. The judge made an order for payment to the plaintiff by the motor cab company of the plaintiffs costs against the omnibus company and of the costs which the omnibus company recovered against the plaintiff:

 Held , that the judge had a discretion to make the order, although before the issue of the writ the motor cab company had not intimated to the plaintiff their intention to throw the responsibility for the accident on the other defendants. 

 There is no rule to the effect that, in order to justify an order on an unsuccessful defendant to pay the successful co-defendants costs, the unsuccessful defendant must, before the issue of the writ, have given notice to the plaintiff that he is going to throw the blame on the other defendant; it is a question in all cases whether it was a reasonable and proper course for the plaintiff to join both the defendants in the action. 

Applying **_Besterman_** `s reasoning to our c ase, c ounsel for the plaintiff said: 


(1) (long) after the ac c ident, the plaintiff`s medic al c ondition was suc h that he was in no position to provide any useful information on the ac c ident so as to enable his c ounsel to identify all the tortfeasors with reasonable c ertainty; 

(2) at the time the writ was filed, it was reasonable to inc lude the first, sec ond and third defendants in the ac tion. Neither he nor his solic itors knew: (a) the identity of the person(s) who dropped the metal formwork or who the latter`s employer was, (b) how the ac c ident oc c urred, (c ) who was responsible for the ac c ident or the c irc umstanc es leading to the ac c ident. That was why the plaintiff initially pleaded res ipsa loquitur in the statement of c laim. It was reasonable to sue the first defendants bec ause they were the main c ontrac tors. It was also reasonable and appropriate to inc lude the sec ond defendants sinc e they were the ones who appointed the plaintiff to manufac ture and install roof trusses. It also appeared to be reasonable to inc lude the third defendants in the ac tion bec ause the plaintiff`s next friend (Ho Chia Hao) had found the third defendants` signs around the site; 

(3) it was only on 8 August 2000 that the plaintiff`s solic itors rec eived a c opy of the MOM investigation report (`the MOM report`) dated 12 July 2000 (AB156-162). Upon their rec eipt of the same, the plaintiff`s solic itors dec ided it was nec essary to inc lude the fourth defendants in the ac tion, the person responsible for dropping the metal formwork being their employee. The MOM report did not even mention the third defendants as a responsible party; the third defendants` role only emerged during the trial. 

Counsel for the first defendant on the other hand urged me not to c hange my dec ision on c osts. He noted that the plaintiff did not make any allegation against the sec ond defendants in their pleadings or submissions; neither did the other defendants. Indeed, throughout the c ourse of the (lengthy) trial, no attempt was made to shift blame onto the sec ond defendants; neither were they c ross-examined on the issue. He pointed out that the plaintiff served the writ of summons on the sec ond defendants even before the first defendants had filed their defenc e (on 6 Oc tober 2000). When the first and third defendants filed their defenc es, neither made any allegation against the sec ond defendants. Under suc h c irc umstanc es, the plaintiff should have disc ontinued these proc eedings against the sec ond defendants. As for the evidenc e adduc ed at the trial, the fac ts whic h emerged pertained to liability of the first and/or the third defendants only. 

As for the late issuanc e of the MOM report, c ounsel pointed out that as the ac c ident took plac e on 2 September 1999, the c laim would only have been time-barred on 2 September 2002. Why were the plaintiff`s solic itors in suc h a hurry to issue the writ of summons on 11 July 2000 instead of waiting for the report? Even if they were anxious to issue the writ quic kly, the plaintiff`s solic itors need not have served it immediately on the sec ond defendants. They should have delayed servic e until **_after_** they had rec eived the MOM report and seen the defenc es filed by the first and third defendants. Had they done so, they would/should not have pursued the c laim against the sec ond defendants. Instead, c ounsel for the plaintiff vigorously c ross-examined the sec ond defendants` witnesses (2) unlike him whilst c ounsel for the third defendants did not c ross-examine them at all. There were many stages where the plaintiff c ould have disc ontinued the ac tion against the sec ond defendants after the writ/defenc es were filed, after the affidavits of evidenc e-in-c hief were exc hanged, during the c ourse of the trial. Sinc e his solic itors c hose to c ontinue the c laim against the sec ond defendants, it was only right that the plaintiff should bear the c onsequential c osts, not the other three (3) defendants. 

Counsel for the first defendants c ited two (2) c ases in support of his arguments. The first was **_Mohd bin Sapri v Soil-Build_** (supra), whic h I have referred to earlier on the issue of liability. In that c ase, the appellant/plaintiff had appealed against the dismissal of his c laim against the fourth defendant 


(Soil-Build) to the ac tion; Soil-Build (`SB`) were the main c ontrac tors in the c onstruc tion of a warehouse whic h belonged to the third defendants CMB Pac kaging Singapore; SB had employed Sprinkler Engineering Pte Ltd (`SE`) as spec ialist sub-c ontrac tors for the installation of a fire-fighting or sprinkler system for the warehouse. SE appealed against the trial c ourt`s finding that they were one-third ([frac 13]) liable to the plaintiff for his injuries and also on the issue of c osts (on whic h the trial judge had ordered SE to bear 50% of SB`s c osts payable by the plaintiff for the period after 16 November 1994, that being the date when SB had made to the plaintiff a very generous offer to settle); SE had disc laimed any responsibility whatsoever for the plaintiff`s injuries. On the issue of c osts, the appellate c ourt said (at p 521): 

 The effect of SEs denial of liability was not ineluctably to compel the plaintiff to sue SB. It was not as if SE, in defending the claim, was attempting to pin liability on SB. It is apparent from our perusal of SEs defence that by its denial of liability, it was putting the blame on the plaintiff himself. There was no suggestion that SB should be the proper party to answer for the plaintiffs injuries. These were important considerations which the Court of Appeal took into account in Mulready s case in deciding that a Bullock order would not be appropriate. 

 If the plaintiff includes an additional defendant because of his uncertainty of the law rather than the facts, the court will not make either a Bullock or Sanderson order ( Poulton v Moore [1913] WN 349) ... 

 These observations are apposite in the present case. In any event, the plaintiffs decision to sue SB has been questionable. The pleaded causes of action alleging SBs liability qua employer and occupier were clearly unsustainable. As counsel for SE has pointed out, the plaintiff must have known that his own negligence caused the accident. The facts surrounding the accident were matters which were wholly within the plaintiffs knowledge ... 

The sec ond c ase c ounsel relied on was Chao J`s dec ision in **Virco Metal Industries v Carltech Trading and Industries** <span class="citation">[2000] 2 SLR 201</span>. In that c ase, the plaintiffs who were tenants of two (2) units of an industrial building sued the landlord Carltec h (the first defendant) and Kee and Ah Cheong as the sec ond and third defendants respec tively; Kee and Ah Cheong were two (2) other tenants. The plaintiffs c laimed for damage to their premises arising from a fire whic h broke out near the entranc e of Kee`s premises, ignited by a defec tive power switc h loc ated there. The fire spread from Kee`s premises to Ah Cheong`s premises. The plaintiffs c laimed that Ah Cheong was liable on the basis that the c ontents of Ah Cheong`s premises had aggravated and inc reased the c ombustion, enhanc ed the heat and spread the fire. The plaintiffs` c laim against the first and sec ond defendants was allowed but his c laim against Ah Cheong was dismissed. Chao J refused to make a **_Bullock_** or **_Sanderson_** order for c osts in the plaintiffs` favour. He said (at [para ]55): 

 The plaintiffs claim against the third defendant is dismissed with costs which shall be borne equally by the first and second plaintiffs. I do not think this is a case where I ought to make a Bullock or Sanderson order. The facts do not warrant the bringing in of Ah Cheong as a party, and, especially, for continuing with the action against Ah Cheong after the plaintiffs were in possession of the report of Capt Lee [from the Singapore Civil Defence Force]. Neither Carltech nor Kee sought in their pleadings to shift any part of the liability for the damages suffered by Virco and GJ [the plaintiffs] onto Ah Cheong. 


Counsel for the sec ond and third defendants aligned themselves with the submission of c ounsel for the first defendants. Mr Yu for the sec ond defendants said if the plaintiff had offered to disc ontinue this ac tion against his c lients before trial c ommenc ed, the sec ond defendants would have agreed, with minimum c osts to the plaintiff. Mr Fazal Mohd for the third defendants expressed similar sentiments, pointing out that his c lients never blamed the sec ond defendants, they only alleged negligenc e on the part of the first and fourth defendants. He noted that even after trial c onc luded (5 May 2001), the plaintiff, in his c ounsel`s final submissions (see para 3 pp 52-62) still maintained that the sec ond defendants were liable. 

In his reply to the defendants` submissions, c ounsel for the plaintiff defended his c lient`s dec ision to sue the sec ond defendants and to pursue that c laim to its finality. He pointed out that the fac t the first and third defendants did not shift blame onto the sec ond defendants should not be c onc lusive as the first defendants also did not shift liability onto the third defendants who were ultimately found to be liable. He explained that the plaintiff was in need of urgent funds for medic al and hospitalisation expenses and, the only way to obtain funding was to issue the writ quic kly and thereafter, apply to c ourt for interim payment (under O 29 r 10 of the Rules of Court) and whic h was done and granted, the amount being c ontributed by the first, third and fourth defendants. Counsel further sought to distinguish the c ase of **_Mohd bin Sapri_** (supra) on its fac ts. Unlike the plaintiff in that c ase, the plaintiff here was not in full possession of the fac ts surrounding the ac c ident. If indeed the pleadings were to be the yardstic k for his c ontinuing proc eedings against the various defendants, the plaintiff would have had to disc ontinue ac tion against the third defendants sinc e no one (inc luding the MOM) blamed the third defendants, yet they were held to be liable. I note, however, that this submission is not quite c orrec t; as was pointed out by c ounsel for the first defendants, the fourth defendants did attempt to shift blame onto the third defendants in their defenc e (para 5) filed on 13 Oc tober 2000. 

**_The decision_** 

Having heard c ounsel`s further submissions on behalf of the plaintiff and three (3) of the four (4) defendants, I am not inc lined to c hange my original order for c osts. Ac c ordingly, I c onfirm my earlier dec ision not to grant the plaintiff either a **_Sanderson_** or **_Bullock_** order for c osts; the fac ts do not warrant either order being made. 

Whilst the submission of c ounsel for the plaintiff was persuasive, in partic ular that the plaintiff was not in full possession of the c irc umstanc es/fac ts surrounding the ac c ident and a suit had to be issued quic kly and interim payment then applied for, to ease the plaintiff`s financ ial hardships, there are other fac tors whic h negate these c onsideration. I refer in partic ular to the Rules of Court governing c onduc t of trials; they have c hanged dramatic ally sinc e the 1914 c ase of **_Besterman v British Motor Cab Co_** (supra). We now have O 38 r 2(1) under our Rules of Court, it introduc ed the c onc ept of written evidenc e-in-c hief for all witnesses (save for those subpoenaed). 

Even if the plaintiff c an be exc used for his earlier ac ts, first in instituting proc eedings so quic kly against the sec ond defendants and, his later omission in not disc ontinuing those proc eedings up to the stage of c lose of pleadings (despite the absenc e of any blame levelled against the sec ond defendants by any of the other defendants), his omission thereafter to disc ontinue the ac tion against the sec ond defendants c annot be overlooked. I note that the affidavits of evidenc e-in-c hief were exc hanged on 29 January 2001 whereas trial before me only c ommenc ed a week later (on 5 February 2001). There was ample opportunity for the plaintiff`s solic itors to review the written testimony of Sik Hing (2DW1), the managing direc tor of the sec ond defendants, filed on 11 January 2001 and to dec ide whether it was feasible to pursue the plaintiff`s c laim. The extrac ts from the c ases **_Mohd bin Sapri_** 


and **_Virco Metal Industries_** set out in [para ]110-111 above would aptly apply to the plaintiff. Having c hosen to c ontinue his ac tion to the bitter end against the sec ond defendants (against whom no order for interim payment was made), I do not think it is fair that the other defendants should be mulc ted in c osts for the plaintiff`s unsuc c essful ac tion. Ac c ordingly, my previous order for c osts stands. 

In the c ourse of the trial, c ounsel for the first and sec ond third parties informed me that they had resolved the issue of apportionment of liability between themselves amic ably. I have now been informed that the two third parties will share liability on 50:50 basis and I rec ord the c onsent order ac c ordingly. As between the three (3) defendants, I c onfirm that the first, third and fourth defendants will eac h be liable for one-third ([frac 13]) of the damages to be assessed in favour of the plaintiff. 

## Outcome: 

Order ac c ordingly.
