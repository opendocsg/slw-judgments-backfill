**Background Facts** 

1       On 10 February 2010, Steven Chong JC (as he then was) dismissed the c laim made by David Lam Chi Kin (“the appellant”) against Deutsc he Bank Aktiengesellsc haft’s (“the bank”) in Suit No. 834 of 2008 and granted judgment for some US$1.135 million (“the High Court judgment”) in respec t of the bank’s c ounterc laim against the appellant. The appellant has appealed to the Court of Appeal against the High Court judgment (in Civil Appeal no. 41 of 2010). The appeal is sc heduled to be heard in the week c ommenc ing 16 August 2010. 

2       In exec ution of the High Court judgment, the bank c ommenc ed these bankruptc y proc eedings against the appellant on 29 Marc h 2010 for his failure to c omply with the bank’s statutory demand for payment of the judgment debt. On 17 April 2010, the appellant applied before an AR for the bankruptc y applic ation to be set aside or for an unc onditional stay of the bankruptc y proc eedings pending his appeal against the High Court judgment. On 14 May 2010, the AR granted the appellant a stay on c ondition that he provide sec urity for $500,000 either by payment into c ourt or by any other agreed means by 4 June 2010. The appellant appealed against the AR’s dec ision on the ground that he did not have the financ ial means to provide the sec urity ordered. 

**The appeal against the AR’s decision** 

**_The appellant’s submissions_** 

3       The appellant stated that the parties have filed their respec tive Cases already and the appeal before the Court of Appeal was less than two months away. Although the bank argued before the AR that a c onditional stay of the bankruptc y proc eedings was appropriate bec ause there was a risk that the appellant was dissipating his assets by selling his apartment in Singapore, the appellant pointed out that his previous two affidavits had disc losed that he needed to liquidate his assets in order to pay for the legal fees for the ac tion and he argued that the sale of his apartment was towards this end. For instanc e, in his affidavit of 5 November 2009 (filed for another hearing), the appellant said (at [4] to [6] thereof ) that he did not have suffic ient funds at that point in time to appoint new lawyers to represent him in this ac tion due to some liquidity issues and that he dec ided to liquidate 


some of his assets and, if the need arose, would approac h his relatives for financ ial assistanc e. The AR was of the view that the said affidavits were not c lear enough to address the c onc ern of dissipation of assets and therefore ordered a c onditional stay of the bankruptc y proc eedings. 

4       In his notic e of appeal, the appellant sought to admit further evidenc e before me by way of his affidavit affirmed in Hong Kong SAR and filed on 31 May 2010 (“the new affidavit”), whic h is after the hearing before the AR. He also asked that the bankruptc y proc eedings be set aside or, alternatively, that they be stayed unc onditionally pending the appeal against the High Court judgment. 

5       The new affidavit dealt with two main matters. The first was that the sale of his apartment in Singapore was not for the purpose of dissipating his assets here. The sec ond matter c onc erned his inability to put up the sec urity of $500,000 ordered as well as to pay the judgment debt. The appellant submitted that his property at 180A Benc oolen Street #12-07 Singapore 189647 (“the Benc oolen property”) was sold to financ e the legal c osts of the ac tion and that there was no intention to dissipate assets. He thought this was c lear enough from [6] of the affidavit of 5 November 2009 (see [3] above). He granted an option to purc hase on 26 November 2009 and therefore did not file an affidavit on this issue. 

6       In the new affidavit, the appellant c onfirmed that the Benc oolen property was sold to financ e the fees payable to his previous lawyers, M/s Lee & Lee, the fees payable to M/s M Pillay for the trial and the appeal therefrom and the sec urity for c osts of the appeal. Besides these, he also had to sell the Benc oolen property as he c ould no longer afford to pay the monthly mortgage payments of about $13,000 to the United Overseas Bank. The net sale proc eeds, after repaying the mortgage, amounted to about $400,000, most of whic h were used to provide for the said legal fees and sec urity for c osts of the appeal. In respec t of sec urity for c osts of the appeal, he provided the presc ribed amount of $20,000 and when further sec urity was requested by the bank, he provided another $10,000 in sec urity to obviate further legal c osts in unnec essary interloc utory applic ations and appeals. 

7       The appellant’s agreement with the purc hasers of the Benc oolen property was for him to rent it for three months from the date of c ompletion of the sale and purc hase (in February 2010) at a monthly rent of $4,150. Unfortunately, he c ould not afford to c ontinue renting it after about one month and had to surrender the tenanc y prematurely on 14 Marc h 2010. He c ould no longer afford to live in Singapore and therefore left for Hong Kong that day to try to seek assistanc e from relatives and friends. He c ame here from Hong Kong in 1996. He separated from his wife in April 2003 and was ordered to pay $4,000 a month as maintenanc e for her and their daughter. He c ould not afford to make this monthly payment any more. 

8       Save for the Benc oolen property, almost all of the appellant’s assets were in foreign c urrenc y deposits with financ ial institutions suc h as the bank. As a result of the financ ial turmoil in September and Oc tober 2008, most of these deposits were wiped out. He lost all his foreign c urrenc y deposits of NZD30 m with the bank alone. All he has now is an amount of about $9,000 whic h he needs for living and medic al expenses (for his diabetes and hypertension). 

9       The appellant also has an outstanding judgment for JP Y 29,062,179.35 (or about USD323,000) entered against him by BNP Paribas Wealth Management (“BNP”) in Suit No. 375 of 2008. He paid BNP $30,000 upfront and agreed to pay $5,000 monthly (up to July 2010) and thereafter $10,000 monthly. He paid up to April 2010 but c ould not make the instalment payments after that. 

10     The appellant affirmed that he does not have the means to provide the $500,000 sec urity ordered by the AR or to pay the judgment sum owing to the bank. 


11     Before the AR and before me, the appellant relied on sec tion 65(4)(b) of the Bankruptc y Ac t (Cap 20). Sec tion 65(4) is in the following terms: 

 When a bankruptc y applic ation has been made against a debtor on the ground that the debtor – 

 (a) has failed to pay a judgment debt, and there is pending an appeal from or an applic ation to set aside, the judgment or order by virtue of whic h the judgment debt is payable; or 

 (b) has failed to c omply with a statutory demand, and there is pending an applic ation to set aside the statutory demand, 

 the c ourt may, if it thinks fit, stay or dismiss the applic ation. 

12     The appellant submitted that the legislative intent of sec tion 65(4)(b) is c lear. It is to prevent a party from suffering the prejudic e assoc iated with bankruptc y before his appeal against a judgment debt (whic h forms the basis of the bankruptc y applic ation) is heard. This rationale, it was argued, applies fully to the fac ts here espec ially sinc e the appellant has affirmed on affidavit that he is unable to pay the judgment debt and the sec urity ordered and that all he has is about $9,000 for his living and medic al expenses. As the Court of Appeal will be hearing the appeal against the High Court judgment in less than two months and the respec tive Cases have already been filed, the bank would suffer no prejudic e from an unc onditional stay of the bankruptc y proc eedings. 

**_The bank’s submissions_** 

13     The bank objec ted to the admission of the new affidavit as it was made after the hearing before the AR. Even if the new affidavit was admitted by the c ourt, the bank argued that it would not provide a basis for the c ourt to reverse the AR’s dec ision. 

14     At the hearing before the AR, the bank relied on sec tion 64(1) of the Bankruptc y Ac t whic h states: 

 The c ourt may at any time, for suffic ient reason, make an order staying the proc eedings on a bankruptc y applic ation, either altogether or for a limited time, on suc h terms and c onditions as the c ourt may think just. 

The bank relied on _Lee Kiang Leng Stanley v Lee Han Chew (trading as Joe Li Electrical Supplies)_ <span class="citation">[2004] SGHC 151</span> for the proposition that sec tion 64(1) allows the c ourt to order sec urity for the full amount or part of the judgment debt as a c ondition for staying bankruptc y proc eedings. 

15     It was just for the AR to order the appellant to furnish sec urity for part of the judgment debt as there was solid evidenc e of a real risk of dissipation of assets by the appellant. The appellant sold the Benc oolen property on 9 Dec ember 2009 for $1.05 million. This took plac e during the c ourse of the trial. The trial was heard on 30 November, 1, 2 and 23 Dec ember 2009. The appellant c laimed that he sold the Benc oolen property to help pay his legal fees. In support of this, he relied solely on a single sentenc e at [6] of his affidavit of 5 November 2009 whic h was filed for his applic ation to vac ate the trial dates. That sentenc e was: 

 I c ame out from this PTC even more c onvinc ed that I will require representation by a lawyer, and I dec ided that I would liquidate some of my assets and if the need arose, approac h my relatives for financ ial assistanc e. 


16     The AR felt that the above statement did not refer to the sale of the Benc oolen property and was therefore insuffic ient to address the c onc ern of dissipation of assets. He was satisfied that the pending appeal before the Court of Appeal was a _bona fide_ one but did not see any grounds to set aside the bankruptc y proc eedings. 

17     The appellant, it was submitted, was hoping to repair his position at the eleventh hour by seeking the c ourt’s leave to adduc e the new affidavit. The appellant had enough time, between 21 April 2010 when the bank filed its affidavit to 14 May 2010 when the AR heard the applic ation for a stay, to file an affidavit whic h would fully explain his dec ision to sell the Benc oolen property during the trial. However, the appellant c hose not to do so. 

18     Even if the new affidavit was admitted on appeal and ac c epted at fac e value, it would not provide any basis to reverse the AR’s dec ision. Firstly, impec uniosity would not operate as a bar to an order for sec urity. Rather, it is a fac tor whic h the c ourt may take into ac c ount in dec iding whether it is just to order the provision of sec urity. Sec ondly, it is not suffic ient to c omplain that the sec urity order is diffic ult to meet. The c ourt has to be satisfied that it would be impossible to c omply with the sec urity order. The fac t that a man has no c apital of his own does not mean that he c annot raise any c apital from friends, business assoc iates and relatives ( _M V Yorke Motors (A firm) v Edwards_ [1982] 1 WLR 444). Although these observations were made in the c ontext of an applic ation for summary judgment, the bank argued that they were equally applic able to any situation where the c ourt has disc retionary power whether to impose a financ ial c ondition on a party. 

19     The bank pointed out that in the new affidavit, the appellant said “most” of the net sale proc eeds of $400,000 were used to pay legal fees and to provide sec urity for c osts of the appeal before the Court of Appeal and not that “all” were used for those purposes. This was on the assumption that he rec eived no more than $400,000 out of the sale pric e of $1.05 million. He also c laimed that he left for Hong Kong to try to seek assistanc e from relatives and friends. It was therefore within his means to raise c apital. He was silent on whether he was suc c essful in that objec tive. 

**The decision of the court** 

20     It seems to me that the more appropriate provision for the appellant to rely on in sec tion 65(4) (a) rather than sec tion 65(4)(b) of the Bankruptc y Ac t. 

21     I dec ided to admit the new affidavit as it merely elaborates on the appellant’s alleged financ ial woes, something that was already in c ontention. What I found sorely lac king in the new affidavit was doc umentary proof of how the sale proc eeds from the Benc oolen property were utilized for eac h stated purpose. 

22     The sale was c ompleted only in February this year and the appellant would surely still have the c ompletion ac c ount from his c onveyanc ing lawyer. This would have shown the amount ac tually paid to the mortgagee bank and whether he truly rec eived only “about $400,000”. 

23     It was easily within the appellant’s ability to produc e rec eipts from his former and his present solic itors on the amount of legal fees paid by him thus far but the appellant appears to expec t everyone to simply ac c ept what he has stated in his new affidavit. He did not even mention how muc h he paid his solic itors exc ept that the amount of legal fees and sec urity for c osts took up “most” of the $400,000. The trial was not a long one in any event. 

24     There is also no doc ument to bac k up his statements about the rental agreement with the 


purc hasers of the Benc oolen property. He left Hong Kong for Singapore 14 years ago and has now returned to Hong Kong. The new affidavit states a “c are of” residential address in Hong Kong with no explanation as to whose flat he is presently staying in. 

25     The appellant was also c ompletely silent on his efforts to seek financ ial assistanc e from his relatives and friends in Hong Kong sinc e his departure from Singapore on 14 Marc h 2010 although that was one of his professed objec tives in leaving. 

26     The appellant’s unsatisfac tory ac c ount of how the sale proc eeds of the Benc oolen property were utilized c oupled with the lac k of doc umentary proof leaves one with serious doubts about the truth of his assertions of impec uniosity. An applic ant against whom judgment has been entered after a trial and who is seeking the c ourt’s protec tion from bankruptc y proc eedings should be c andid and forthc oming. 

27     Even if we assume that he rec eived only $400,000 out of the sale proc eeds of the Benc oolen property, he has not properly ac c ounted for this amount. I dec ided to proc eed on this assumption and made a generous allowanc e of three-quarters of that amount for his alleged payments. After deduc ting $30,000 for the sec urity for c osts of the appeal against the High Court judgment, he would have $270,000 to pay his former and his c urrent solic itors. That leaves the appellant with at least $100,000 and it is this amount that I ordered him to provide sec urity for by 1 July 2010. The amount in the AR’s order on sec urity is therefore varied from $500,000 to $100,000. The c osts of this Registrar’s Appeal are to abide by the c osts of the appeal before the Court of Appeal. 

28     The appellant has appealed against the order for sec urity in [27] above (in Civil Appeal No. 115 of 2010) and has applied for the appeal to be heard on an expedited basis. A Judge has dispensed with the filing of the Rec ord of Appeal and the Appellant’s Case. The Court of Appeal will hear the appeal on Friday, 6 August 2010.
