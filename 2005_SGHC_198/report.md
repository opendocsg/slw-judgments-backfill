1       The Raffles Town Club saga moves on. After the primary dispute had been determined by the Court of Appeal on 23 August 2005 in <span class="citation">[2005] 4 SLR 351</span> and the defendant c ompany, Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd (“the Company”), applied to put forward a sc heme of arrangement to its c reditors, one would have thought that the next steps in the matter would be the presentation of the sc heme proposal, and then the vote thereon. 

2       That was not to be. First, the plaintiffs, a group of members of the Raffles Town Club (“the Club”), applied for the appointment of a Spec ial Rec eiver and Manager for the Company and a Mareva injunc tion against it. I rejec ted that applic ation, whic h then went up to the Court of Appeal on an expedited appeal and met with the same result. 

3       Next, the plaintiffs took out another applic ation, this time with the purpose of restraining the Company from instituting ac tions against a few of the plaintiffs for unpaid subsc riptions, although the applic ation was framed in wider terms. I rejec ted that, and there is no appeal. 

4       Then, it is the Company’s turn. On 12 Oc tober 2005, it applied to have the timelines for the c onsideration of the sc heme proposal and the c onvening of the meeting to disc uss the sc heme moved bac k a sec ond time. 

5       There is a history to the timelines. This started with the Company’s applic ation relating to the sc heme proposal. The applic ation (Summons in Chambers No 4437 of 2005) was not the usual applic ation under s 210 of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed) in that it did not seek direc tions as to when notic e of the proposed sc heme was to be given to the potential sc heme members. The only date set out in the applic ation was that the meeting was to be held on or before 15 Dec ember 2005. 

6       When parties appeared before me on that applic ation, I felt that the Company should be given the opportunity to propose a sc heme of arrangement, but on tighter timelines. After c onferring with c ounsel for the Company, I gave direc tions that the meeting to disc uss the sc heme was to be held by 26 Oc tober 2005 and that notic e of the meeting and c opies of the proposed sc heme were to be advertised and posted by 28 September 2005. 

7       Subsequently, the timelines were moved with the c onsent of the parties. This was rec orded in an order of c ourt of the Court of Appeal of 19 September 2005, whereby the two dates were c hanged to 19 Oc tober 2005 for the advertising and posting of the sc heme proposal and 16 November 


2005 for the meeting. 

8       Thus, when the Company filed the present applic ation, it was seeking to extend timelines it had assented to twic e before. In this applic ation, the Company wanted the dates to be moved to 7 November 2005 and 2 Dec ember 2005. 

9       The applic ation was not viewed unfavourably bec ause of the previous extension _per se_. There may be valid grounds whic h nec essitate an extension. The onus is on the Company to show that there are good reasons. 

10     What were the grounds put forth? An affidavit was sworn by Graham Kiy (“Kiy”), the general manager of the Club, whic h set out the reasons for the applic ation. In paras 4, 5 and 6 of the affidavit, Kiy deposed: 

4\. Firstly, the Company has been ac tively seeking ways to work out a pac kage whic h would be more palatable to Sc heme Creditors. I have been advised that the Company’s solic itors had at a previous hearing informed the Honourable Justic e Kan Ting Chiu that the Company was prepared to offer up to one-third of the Approved Sc heme Claims of the Sc heme Creditors in c ash by way of instalments. After c onsultation with several Sc heme Creditors and others involved in the proc ess, the Company has agreed to a further signific ant enhanc ement and is now in the proc ess of finalising the details, the financ ing and the mec hanic s of the enhanc ement. 

5\. Sec ondly, in relation to the financ ing and mec hanic s of effec ting the enhanc ement and funding, the Company also wishes to inform this Court that the shareholders of the Company who would be providing the financ e are separately advised by separate lawyers. 

6\. Finally, the proc ess of furnishing the nec essary information to the Sc heme Managers and the Company’s solic itors has also taken longer than expec ted. 

11     Counsel for the Company also explained that more time was needed bec ause the c ash c omponent of the proposed sc heme, whic h was c ontemplated to be paid in instalments, was being inc reased. 

12     Counsel for the plaintiffs opposed the applic ation and argued that it should be rejec ted, and I agreed with him. 

13     The Company has been holding out this promise of a sc heme proposal sinc e 30 August 2005, when its applic ation was first filed. Even at that time, its c ounsel stated that it was already working on a preliminary draft sc heme with its external financ ial advisers. When it sought yet more time to put up the proposal, one would expec t, at the minimum, some disc losure on: 

 (a) what had been done in the meantime towards the finalisation of the proposed sc heme; 

 (b) whic h c omponents of the proposal were outstanding; 

 (c ) how muc h time was required to c omplete eac h of the outstanding c omponents; and 

 (d) why the Company waited till 12 Oc tober 2005 (one week before the time for issuing the notic e and posting the proposed sc heme) to make the applic ation. 

14     Kiy’s affidavit is c learly inadequate. He stated his position as the General Manager of the Club. He deposed that the Company is the proprietor of the Club, but he did not state if he had any 


duties and responsibilities in the Company and did not say if he is involved in any way in the preparation of the proposed sc heme. 

15     The statements in paras 4, 5 and 6 of his affidavit are unac c eptably vague. They lead the reader to ask: 

 (a) did Kiy get his information from the persons involved in putting up the proposal? 

 (b) what are the “further signific ant enhanc ement” and “the details, the financ ing and the mec hanic s of the enhanc ement”? 

 (c ) how many shareholders will be providing the financ ing, and how muc h financ ing is envisaged to be c oming from them? 

 (d) why has the furnishing of the nec essary information taken longer than expec ted, and how muc h effort has been exerted to get the information? and 

 (e) why c ould the timelines agreed to on 19 September 2005 not be met? 

16     I have some doubts as to whether Kiy is the proper person to depose the affidavit in support of the applic ation. Those direc tly involved, _eg_ the direc tors of the Company, the external financ ial advisers and the legal advisers, are better plac ed than him to do that. As things were, I found that the Company had not done nearly enough to disc harge its onus.
