**Introduction** 

1       That the c ivil proc edure rules, as enc apsulated in the form of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules of Court”), are an indispensable tool in ensuring the proper dispensation of justic e in the litigation proc ess is a self-evident truism that c an hardly be disputed. In this regard, c entral to the effic ac y of the Rules of Court are the provisions therein that stipulate stric t timelines that parties to c ourt proc eedings are not, in general, allowed to derogate from. Absent suc h timelines, the litigation proc ess would be c onsiderably more c umbersome and proc eedings lengthened, all of whic h would no doubt hinder the overriding goal of fac ilitating the fair and expedient disposal of c ases before the c ourts. 

2       Nonetheless, given that the effic ac y of the Rules of Court is, one posits, predic ated upon the assumption that the forum in whic h the legal battle should be fought is that of the Courts (as should be plainly apparent from its phraseology, _i.e._ the Rules _of Court_ ), should parties be obliged to remain filial to the timelines as envisaged therein if their primary assertion is that the _litigation_ proc ess does not represent the most appropriate mec hanism to govern the proc edural aspec ts of the legal battle that will take plac e? Stripped of its verbiage, that was, in essenc e, the question that had to be grappled with, and c onsidered, here. 

**The Facts** 

3       It may be of some utility, however, to prefac e any observations as to the merits of the matter before me with a brief eluc idation of the fac tual matrix that forms its sc affold. The basic fac ts themselves were relatively straightforward, though I should stress that these purported fac ts (as c anvassed by the plaintiff) had yet to stand up to the rigours of c hallenge in the light of the fac t that the defendants had, for reasons that will soon bec ome plainly evident, yet to file their defenc e to the ac tion. Nonetheless, so as to provide a referenc e point for the ensuing disc ourse, I shall set out the basic fac ts as c ontended by the plaintiff in its Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim dated 20 Marc h 2007 (“the Statement of Claim”). At the risk of reiteration, it should be noted that nothing in my dec ision turned on the verac ity of the fac ts as stated hereinafter. 

4       Ac c ording to the plaintiff, on several oc c asions over the c ourse of 2005, Mr Yap Tec k Siong and Mr Lee Boon Hiok, who were the fourth and fifth defendants respec tively, represented to three 


brothers, namely Kheh Thiam Hoo (“KTH”), Kheh Kim Chong (“KKC”) and Khek Lay Chin (“KLC”), that the first defendant, Carona Holdings Pte Ltd, was the owner and operator of a c onsumable produc t known as “GoGo Franks” and that they ( _i.e._ the fourth and fifth defendants) had developed a marketing c onc ept for the produc t and were looking to franc hise it to third parties. 

5       After purportedly c oming to an in-princ iple agreement with the fourth and fifth defendants that they would be given the exc lusive territorial rights to the “GoGo Franks” franc hise in Singapore, sometime on or about 11 Oc tober 2005, KKC and KLC inc orporated Go Go Delic ac y Pte Ltd, the plaintiff in this ac tion, and installed themselves as its direc tors and KTH as its manager. It would appear that the plaintiff’s inc orporation was predic ated primarily on its potential use as a vehic le for the proposed “GoGo Franks” franc hise in antic ipation of rec eiving c onfirmation as the sole and exc lusive distributor of the produc t. 

6       As a further step in antic ipation of being awarded the said franc hise, the plaintiff took up tenanc y at Bukit Panjang Plaza, with the aim of setting up a “GoGo Franks” outlet there for a spec ified period, inc urring in the proc ess start-up c osts of some $43,963.79. It was also c ontended that in doing so, the fourth and fifth defendants misled the plaintiff into purc hasing numerous items that were represented by the fourth and fifth defendants to be nec essary for the furnishing and setting up of the Bukit Panjang Plaza outlet. These items were purc hased from a c ompany related to the fourth and fifth defendants, Carona Fast Food Pte Ltd, _i.e._ the sec ond defendant. Muc h to their c hagrin, they were later to find out that the purc hases from the sec ond defendant were, in the main, superfluous and surplus to the requirements for the Bukit Panjang Plaza outlet. 

7       In any event, after somewhat protrac ted negotiations, the plaintiff, on or about 13 April 2006, entered into an exc lusive Franc hise Agreement with the first defendant under whic h it was agreed that in c onsideration for paying c ertain sums of monies, the first defendant would provide the nec essary doc umentation and know-how in relation to the running of the proposed “GoGo Franks” franc hise (“the Franc hise Agreement”). Though the prec ise details of the Franc hise Agreement need not be expounded upon here, two matters that relate to it should be touc hed upon briefly at this junc ture: first, under the Franc hise Agreement, the plaintiff was duty-bound to purc hase all “operating supplies”, food supplies in more c ommon parlanc e, from a designated seller, in this c ase, Foodplex Trading Pte Ltd, who was the third defendant in this ac tion; and sec ond, that under Clause 23.13.1 of the Franc hise Agreement (“the arbitration c lause”), the parties c ontrac ted to resolve any disputes that may arise by means of arbitration. The arbitration c lause reads as follows: 

 Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement inc luding any questions regarding its existenc e, validity or termination shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in Singapore in ac c ordanc e with the rules of the Singapore Arbitration Centre for the time being in forc e whic h rules are deemed to be inc orporated by referenc e into this c lause... 

 [emphasis added] 

8       Ac c ording to the plaintiff, though it rendered payment in ac c ordanc e with the Franc hise Agreement, the first defendant failed to perform its obligations as stipulated therein. Amongst others, the plaintiff alleged that the first defendant breac hed the terms of the Franc hise Agreement by virtue of its failure to provide adequate training and by its purported entranc e into separate franc hise agreements with other third parties in breac h of the exc lusive franc hising c lause found therein. 

9       Based on the above fac tual matrix, on 20 Marc h 2007, the plaintiff filed this ac tion against the five defendants (c ollec tively, “the defendants”), in whic h it c laimed, _inter alia_ , as follows: 


 (a) Against the first defendant, for numerous breac hes of the Franc hise Agreement; 

 (b) Against the sec ond defendant, for “forc ing upon the plaintiff” the sale of the items that was effec ted in antic ipation of the setting up of the Bukit Panjang Plaza outlet (see [6] above); 

 (c ) Against the third defendant, for the provision of food supplies that were either spoilt or rotting, and henc e, not fit for c onsumption (see [7] above); and 

 (d) Against the fourth and fifth defendants, for numerous misrepresentations ac ross the entire spec trum of events. 

10     Instead of taking the well-trodden path of filing a defenc e to the c laim, on the day the defenc e was due ( _i.e._ 18 April 2007), the defendants, plac ing relianc e on the arbitration c lause as found in the Franc hise Agreement, sought to have the dispute resolved by arbitration and applied for the proc eedings to be stayed (“the stay applic ation”) pursuant to s 6 of the Arbitration Ac t (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Arbitration Ac t”). In the interest of c ompleteness, the salient parts of s 6 of the Arbitration Ac t read as follows: 

**6.** — (1) Where any party to an arbitration agreement institutes any proc eedings in any c ourt against any other party to the agreement in respec t of any matter whic h is the subjec t of the agreement, any party to the agreement may, at any time after appearanc e and before delivering any pleading or taking any other step in the proc eedings, apply to that c ourt to stay the proc eedings so far as the proc eedings relate to that matter. 

 (2) The c ourt to whic h an applic ation has been made in ac c ordanc e with subsec tion (1) may, if the c ourt is satisfied that — 

 (a) there is no suffic ient reason why the matter should not be referred in ac c ordanc e with the arbitration agreement; and 

 (b) the applic ant was, at the time when the proc eedings were c ommenc ed, and still remains, ready and willing to do all things nec essary to the proper c onduc t of the arbitration, 

 make an order, upon suc h terms as the c ourt thinks fit, staying the proc eedings so far as the proc eedings relate to that matter. 

 ... 

 (5) For the purposes of this sec tion, a referenc e to a party inc ludes a referenc e to any person c laiming through or under suc h party. 

11     At this junc ture, I should pause briefly to highlight that it is axiomatic that only parties to an arbitration agreement may rely on an arbitration c lause to stay proc eedings (if any support was required for this self-evident proposition, see Lawrenc e Boo, “Arbitration”, (2003) 4 SAL Ann Rev 48 (Singapore: Singapore Ac ademy of Law, 2004) at para 3.19). Stric tly speaking, as should be apparent from the above rendition of events, the sole signatories of the Franc hise Agreement were the first defendant and the plaintiff. Nonetheless, in applying to have the judic ial proc eedings stayed against _all five defendants_ , c ounsel for the defendants, Mr Adrian Tan, c ontended that the sec ond to fifth defendants were equally able to seek the benefit of the arbitration c lause. Mr Tan, in essenc e, c anvassed what appeared to be a three-fold argument: first, that s 2 of the Contrac ts (Rights of Third Parties) Ac t (Cap 53B, 2002 Rev Ed) allowed the sec ond to fifth defendants to plac e relianc e on 


the arbitration c lause notwithstanding the fac t that they were non-signatories to the Franc hise Agreement; sec ond, that the sec ond to fifth defendants were, in the c irc umstanc es, parties to the Franc hise Agreement; and third, that the plaintiff, having seemingly admitted in various parts of the Statement of Claim that the sec ond and fifth defendants were parties to the Franc hise Agreement, were estopped from denying any c ontrary state of affairs thereafter. Needless to say, the plaintiff strenuously rejec ted these c ontentions, asserting, in the main, that eac h of its c laims against the defendants was distinc t and that the High Court remained the most appropriate forum for the resolution of the matter. For reasons that would be expounded upon at a more c onvenient stage, it would not be nec essary for me to c onsider, and c onsequently, elaborate upon, the merits underlying eac h of these c ontentions. 

12     Notwithstanding the fac t that the above applic ation to stay the matter was taken out by the defendants, c onspic uously; no defenc e was filed by any of them. Indeed, to date, none of the five defendants have filed their defenc e to the ac tion, nor have any of them applied to extend time to file their defenc e. Consequently, on 25 April 2007, one week after the defenc e had originally been due, the plaintiff took out an applic ation for judgment in default of defenc e (“the default judgment applic ation”). 

13     At the c onc lusion of the proc eedings before me, I granted the default judgment applic ation, and made no order in relation to the stay applic ation. As the reasoning that I adopted in arriving at the former dec ision suggests the c onc eptual symmetry of the relevant loc al c ases on a point that appears _hitherto_ to be the subjec t of some (ac ademic ) debate, I thought it of some utility to set out my reasons in full. 

**The Arguments Before The Court** 

14     From the earlier exposition of the c ase fac ts, it should be apparent that the two disc rete applic ations that were before me nec essitated the resolution of two interlinked, albeit disc rete, questions: first, whether a plaintiff ought to be granted judgment in default of defenc e in a situation where an applic ation for a stay of proc eedings was still pending disposal, and sec ond, if so, whether suc h a stay should be granted on the fac ts of _this_ partic ular c ase. However, at the c ommenc ement of the proc eedings before me (and this was subsequently c onfirmed at the c onc lusion of the proc eedings), both parties were _ad idem_ on the fac t that if I were to find in favour of the plaintiff in the default judgment applic ation, as a matter of c ourse, the attendant question of whether there should be a stay of these proc eedings bec omes wholly moot sinc e there would be, stric tly speaking, no judic ial proc eedings to stay until an applic ation to set aside the default judgment was made (see, in this regard, _Patel v Patel_ [2000] QB 551). Ac c ordingly, I restric ted the arguments at first instanc e to those that the parties intended to c anvass in relation to the default judgment applic ation. In this regard, sifting the wheat from the c haff, the question that was before me was, in my opinion, singular in nature and c an be phrased as suc h: does a pending stay applic ation _ipso facto_ c ease the applic ability of the timelines under the Rules of Court for servic e of the Defenc e? 

15     Counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Alfred Dodwell, c ontended that it does not. In his view, the question of whether time c eases to run had already been disc ussed, at length, in the rec ent High Court dec ision of Belinda Ang J (“Ang J”) in _Australian Timber Products Pte Ltd v Koh Brothers Building & Civil Engineering Contractor (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2005] 1 SLR 168</span> (“ _Australian Timber_ ”), a dec ision whic h he felt was squarely applic able in the c irc umstanc es. Plac ing sole relianc e on the said c ase, he c ontended that it stood for the proposition that time would not stop merely bec ause a stay applic ation had been taken out and that, ac c ordingly, the failure on the part of the defendants to remain filial to the timelines stipulated in the Rules of Court had been fatal to their c ase. 


16     Mr Tan, prehaps unsurprisingly, c anvassed the diametric ally opposing view. He pointed out that it was trite law that a party seeking to stay proc eedings c ould not be c ompelled to file its defenc e while a stay applic ation was pending final disposal: see, for example, _Samsung Corp v Chinese Chamber Realty Pte Ltd and Others_ <span class="citation">[2004] 1 SLR 382</span> (“ _Samsung Corp_ ”). Extending that logic , Mr Tan argued that it must follow that the timelines whic h would c onventionally operate for a defendant to file its defenc e c eased to operate until the stay applic ation had been fully disposed of. If, in fac t, that were the c ase, Mr Tan suggested that a plaintiff c ould not apply for default judgment in default of defenc e, sinc e the defenc e was, tec hnic ally speaking, not due yet in the absenc e of any further timelines that were imposed by the c ourts. 

**Analysis of the Law** 

17     Commenc ing on my analysis of the parties’ respec tive c ontentions, I should highlight that, as the defendants rightly point out, it was c onventional wisdom that the Court c ould not c ompel a defendant to file its defenc e while a stay applic ation was pending final disposal. The motivations underlying suc h a stanc e were of no real dispute: it c onstitutes a trite princ iple of law that the privilege of a stay of judic ial proc eedings would be immediately lost if the party applying for suc h stay had taken a “step in the proc eedings”. As c orrec tly observed in _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ , vol 2 (Butterworths: Singapore, 2003) (“ _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ ”) at para 20.035 (and as c ited approvingly in the High Court dec ision of _Chong Long Hak Kee Construction Trading Co v IEC Global Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2003] 4 SLR 499</span> (“ _Chong Long Hak Kee_ ”) at [9]): 

 It is generally accepted that any step [taken] which affirms the correctness of the proceedings or demonstrates a willingness or intention to defend the substance of the claim in court instead of arbitration may be construed as such. 

 [emphasis added] 

18     As suc h, as parties are deemed to have waived their c ontrac tual right to arbitration the moment they take a step that affirms the c orrec tness of the c ourt proc eedings or a willingness to defend the substanc e of the matter in c ourt, the filing of any pleadings, without c aveat, is c onstrued as a quintessential step that serves as a demonstration of the intention of the party to defend the substanc e of the c laim in the judic ial proc eedings and, onc e suc h a step had been taken, the c ourt no longer had any disc retion to stay the proc eedings: see _Chong Long Hak Kee_ at [9]. 

19     The motivations underlying the position that a defendant ought not to be c ompelled to file a defenc e in suc h c irc umstanc es c an be seen from another, more prac tic al, perspec tive – namely that a party should not be made to devote already limited resourc es to the running of two separate c ourses of ac tion (one on the question of whether the judic ial proc eedings should be stayed, and the other on the substantive merits of the matter) at the same time. As was c ogently reasoned by Woo Bih Li JC (as he then was) in _Yeoh Poh San and Another v Won Siok Wan_ <span class="citation">[2002] 4 SLR 91</span> (“ _Yeoh Poh Sun_ ”), at [27]: 

 The point is that while a defendant is seeking to stay the proc eedings, whether by way of original applic ation or an appeal, the defendant should not be required to meet the plaintiff’s c laim on the merit s. A defendant is entitled to focus his attention on the appeal for a stay and not be distracted by running two contradictory courses of action at the same time. 

 [emphasis added] 

20     Based on the reasoning above, I was of the view that the law, as it presently stood, was 


unequivoc al in its support of the point that Mr Tan dealt with at length before me and in his submissions; namely that a defendant c annot be c ompelled to _file its defence_ before its stay applic ation was heard and disposed of. Indeed, even Mr Dodwell appeared to be agree, c onc eding at the c ommenc ement of the proc eedings that the plaintiff would not be able, under law, to c ompel the defendants to file their defenc e. Nonetheless, in my view, the real c rux of the issue _vis-à-vis_ the default judgment applic ation should be plac ed on a markedly different footing: the question that nec essitated resolution here was _not_ whether the defendants _can be compelled to file a defence_ (a query whic h must unambiguously be answered in the negative), but the tec hnic ally separate (though, no doubt, interlinked) matter of whether the _time for filing a defence_ would c ontinue to run. 

21     Indeed, as I understood it, it was in this c ontext that the plaintiff appeared to plac e heavy relianc e on _Australian Timber_. Given the plaintiff’s c onsiderable dependenc e on the said dec ision, it would be of signific ant utility to take a c loser look at the fac ts and reasoning in that c ase. The fac ts therein are quite straightforward. In that c ase, the plaintiff had c ommenc ed an ac tion in the Subordinate Courts against the defendant for monies unpaid for work that had been done on behalf of the defendant. The defendant had applied to stay the ac tion under s 6(1) of the Arbitration Ac t by virtue of an arbitration c lause that existed in the c ontrac t between the parties. Muc h like the fac ts here, after applying to stay the judic ial proc eedings, the defendant failed to serve his defenc e. The plaintiff thus proc eeded to obtain judgment in default of defenc e. The defendant c onsequently applied to set aside the said judgment. The applic ation was refused at first instanc e, though on appeal, the Distric t Judge in c hambers reversed that dec ision and set aside the default judgment. This dec ision was itself appealed by the plaintiff to the High Court. 

22     In the High Court, Ang J was of the opinion that the default judgment should not have been set aside and c onsequently, reversed the dec ision of the Distric t Judge in c hambers. In the c ourse of her dec ision, Her Honour made several pertinent observations on the steps that a defendant must take if a plaintiff were to apply for summary judgment before a pending stay applic ation had been heard and where the timeline for the filing of the defenc e had almost lapsed. Of espec ial importanc e in the matter that was before me were Her Honour’s observations at [16], wherein she noted as follows: 

 ... a pending stay application in itself does not stop time running for the service of the defence. The Rules of Court have their own selfc ontained provisions relating to the servic e of defenc e, time extension and default judgment. Unless and until there is a stay order to halt proceedings, the plaintiff is entitled to give notice to the defendant to serve its defence. It is for a defendant, faced with a 48-hour notice to serve its defence, to respond appropriately. A proactive approach should be adopted. The defendant could have seen the duty registrar to bring forward the hearing date of the stay application for immediate hearing as a matter of urgency or apply for an extension of time to serve the defence under O 3 r 4 and at the same time seek an urgent hearing of the matter ... 

 [emphasis added] 

23     At first blush, given that they afford no real ambiguity, Her Honour’s views (as reproduc ed above) appeared to me to squarely apply on the fac ts of this c ase: juxtaposing the reasoning found in Her Honour’s observations onto the fac ts of this c ase, it would appear that onc e the defendants here had taken c ognisanc e of the possibility of the plaintiff moving to apply for judgment in default (a fac t that they would have been painfully aware of by the time the plaintiff gave the usual prerequisite 48-hour notic e on 20 April 2007), they should have taken the pre-emptive step of making a further applic ation (an urgent one, if need be) to seek an extension of time or taken out an urgent applic ation before the Duty Registrar to get the matter of the stay applic ation heard on an urgent basis. This, they failed to do. 


24     Nonetheless, Mr Tan pinned his c olours on the argument that _Australian Timber_ (at least insofar as the c omments reproduc ed above at [22] were c onc erned) was not applic able on the fac ts in the matter before me. His protestations, as I understood it, were two-fold: first, that _Australian Timber_ was easily distinguishable on the fac ts sinc e that matter was one in whic h the c ourt was c onsidering the question of whether a default judgment should be set aside (a point whic h did not arise in this c ase), and sec ond, that Her Honour c ould not have intended to c reate any artific ial bifurc ation between the failure to make an applic ation to extend time and one to file a defenc e – in Mr Tan’s view, both ac tions would have amounted to a “step in the proc eedings” whic h would have ac ted as a _de facto_ waiver of the right to apply to stay the matter. Curiously (and it is c urious for reasons I will later set out), Mr Tan did not extend suc h a c ontention by c anvassing the attendant argument that the observations made in _Australian Timber_ were wrong in law and should not be followed. 

25     Mr Tan’s first protestation, in my view, c ould be dealt with summarily. In my opinion, the distinc tion highlighted by Mr Tan, was, in the c irc umstanc es, one without a differenc e. In fac t, on c lose inspec tion, it was c lear that the c omments in _Australian Timber_ (as reproduc ed in [22] above) were _consciously directed_ to _the precise situation_ in whic h the defendants found themselves – _i.e._ where a plaintiff began the proc ess of applying for default judgment before a stay applic ation has been disposed of. In that c ontext, there appeared to be little merit to Mr Tan’s argument on this point. 

26     Mr Tan’s sec ond protestation, at least in the manner in whic h he c ouc hed it, was, I feel, equally bound to fail. To rec apitulate, Mr Tan had suggested that Ang J c ould not have intended to have c reated a bifurc ation between the _filing of a defence_ and the _filing of an extension of time to file a defence._ In my view, the _converse_ is true: the c omments made in _Australian Timber_ were _clearly intended_ to c reate a bifurc ation between an applic ation to extend time and one to file a defenc e. Indeed, that this was so was patently evident from Ang J’s observations at [23] of the said dec ision, wherein Her Honour reasoned as follows: 

 ...an applic ation by the defendant to extend time to serve the defenc e will not constitute a step in the proceedings within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Arbitration Act ...In the present c ase, the defendant c learly intends to seek a stay. An application to extend time would be to safeguard the defendant’s position pending the determination of the stay application as opposed to an act that seeks to contest the proceedings on its merits. 

 [emphasis added] 

27     Her Honour’s c omments must be seen in the c ontext of the domestic arbitration regime. As alluded to earlier, under the domestic arbitration regime, c ourts have no jurisdic tion to stay proc eedings where a party has “taken a step in the proc eedings”, for it has long been ac c epted that the making of suc h a step is representative of the party’s waiver of the right to seek rec ourse to alternative dispute mec hanisms to resolve the dispute. Given that c onventional wisdom informs us that the filing of a defenc e without c aveat would be tantamount to taking suc h a step in an ac tion (see [17] to [19] above), Her Honour’s c omments (that an applic ation for a stay did not amount to a step in the proc eedings) were, quite unambiguously, an allusion to the fac t that a bifurc ation did, in fac t, exist between _the filing of a defence_ and an _extension of time to file a defence_. Mr Tan’s sec ondary protestation therefore similarly c ould not be c ountenanc ed. 

28     Ac c ordingly, in the premises, I was not persuaded that either protestation on the part of Mr Tan c onstituted c onsiderable barriers to the granting of default judgment. 


29     If that represented the end of the matter, there would be no doubt as to where this dec ision must lie. Nonetheless, as I alluded to earlier (see [24] above), I found it c urious that Mr Tan did not attempt to explic itly c anvass the broader argument that the observations made in _Australian Timber_ were wrong in law and therefore should not be followed. Indeed, though he may not have realised it, Mr Tan had, in fac t, made an implied c ontention to that effec t by suggesting that an _extension of time to file a defence_ was, in and of itself, a c onc eptual admission that was tantamount to a waiver, for it presupposes that a defenc e (with its attendant substantive disc ussion of the merits of the c ase) would have to be filed in due c ourse. In my view, suc h a c ontention would be squarely at odds with Her Honour’s views as reproduc ed earlier (see [26] above) and invariably brought into sharp foc us the c onsistenc y of the learned judge’s c omments in _Australian Timber_ with c ontemporary jurisprudenc e. 

30     Suc h an argument would, in fac t, not be wholly far-fetc hed, for the jurisprudential approac h adopted in _Australian Timber_ appeared somewhat distinc t from the approac h that had been adopted in other jurisdic tions. In the UK, for example, a request for an extension of time has, in _some_ instanc es, been deemed to be evidenc e of an intention to deliver a statement of defenc e, thus c onstituting a deemed waiver of the right to arbitration (see the House of Lords’ dec ision in _Ford’s Hotel Co v Bartlett_ [1896] AC 1, though _c/f London Sack & Bag Co Ltd v Dixon & Lugton Ltd_ [1943] 2 All ER 763). The same position appeared to have found favour in Malaysia as well: see the c omments of the Malaysian Federal Court in _Sanwell Corp v Trans Resources Corp Sdn Bhd & Anor_ [2002] 2 MLJ 625 (“ _Sanwell Corp_ ”) at p 631. These would appear to be further buttressed by the observation made in _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ , at para 20.035, that “an applic ation to extend time to file a defenc e” c onstituted a _clear example_ of an ac tion that would amount to “a step in the proc eedings”. In this c ontext, there would appear to be a c onsiderable amount of ac ademic and jurisprudential disc ourse that c ould form a viable platform on whic h Mr Tan c ould have c hallenged the rec titude of Her Honour’s observations in _Australian Timber_ and for him to c ontend that an applic ation to extend time would, invariably, c onstitute a “step in the proc eedings”. 

31     Indeed, even when observed through the somewhat more myopic lens of its c onsistenc y with _domestic jurisprudence_ , at least one ac ademic c ommentator has expressed the view that _Australian Timber_ c annot be rec onc iled with domestic c ase law. Assoc iate Professor Lawrenc e Boo (see Lawrenc e Boo, “Arbitration” (2004) 5 SAL Ann Rev 47 (Singapore Ac ademy of Law: Singapore, 2005) at para 3.15 to 3.18) had suggested that the approac h taken in _Australian Timber_ may well be inc onsistent with the Court of Appeal’s dec ision in _Samsung Corp_ , in partic ular with the c omments made by Chao Hic k Tin JA (as he then was) in the latter dec ision where His Honour noted as follows (at [18]): 

 The timeframe prescribed in the Rules of Court for the filing of Defence is a general rule and should be applied in the normal sort of a case where there is no dispute as to the jurisdiction of the court. Where, in a c ase, an applic ation has been made for a stay of proc eeding on the ground that the dispute ought to be referred to arbitration there is, in our opinion, muc h forc e in the c ontention that this question must first be determined before any further steps be taken in the proc eeding. If the stay applic ation should suc c eed, the dispute will be transferred to a different forum for determination. If it should fail, the court would no doubt make the necessary consequential orders, including setting the time-limit for the filing of Defence. 

 [emphasis added] 

32     Though Assoc Prof Boo’s c ommentary appeared to stop short of explic itly artic ulating the inc onsistenc y that purportedly existed between the two c ases, save to highlight that the c omments made in _Australian Timber_ (see [22] above) had “unwittingly added a question mark to the prac tic e in 


relation to the filing of the Defenc e”, it was c lear (to me) that, in his view, the above extrac t as found in _Samsung Corp_ would support the proposition that the timelines that would otherwise c onventionally operate under the Rules of Court in relation to the filing of the Defenc e would immediately c ease to operate onc e an applic ation for a stay is made. 

33     If, indeed, Assoc Prof Boo was right, and the c omments made in _Australian Timber_ were at odds with those made in _Samsung Corp_ , _stare decisis_ being what it was, I would be bound to follow the approac h adopted in the latter dec ision, being a dec ision of the highest c ourt in this land. Nonetheless, in my view, any inc onsistenc ies underlying the reasoning adopted in the two c ases were, for reasons I would highlight in due c ourse, more perc eived than real. 

34     Nonetheless, before doing so, it would be appropriate to first deal with the _conceptual_ c onc erns that have been raised at [30] above. It should be c lear that the resolution of this turned on the interpretation that should be ac c orded to the phrase “step in the proc eedings”. This phrase should not be taken literally, insofar as not every literal step, or applic ation, would amount to a “step in the proc eedings” that has the effec t of waiving any right to seek arbitration. A c ontrac tual agreement to arbitrate is exac tly that – a _contractual_ agreement. Suc h c ontrac tual agreements do not oust the jurisdic tion of the c ourts, whic h retain a residual disc retion from the outset and even if and when the said c ourt dec ides to stay the c ourt proc eedings in favour of arbitration. Ac c ordingly, some steps, whether mandatory or otherwise, invariably have to be taken in c ourt even if a party had the unstinting intention to request a stay of ongoing judic ial proc eeding in favour of arbitration. Quintessential examples of c ourt-related “steps” that would not be tantamount to being “steps in the proc eedings” and that would, c onsequently, not prejudic e an applic ant’s right to apply for a stay of proc eedings, are legion and c an easily be found in many reported dec isions: see, for example, _International SOS Pte Ltd v Overton Mark Harold George_ <span class="citation">[2002] 4 SLR 226</span> (“ _International SOS_ ”) and _Star Trans Far East Pte Ltd v Norske-Tech Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1995] 3 SLR 631</span>. 

35     How, though, would the c ourt disc ern as to what c onstitutes a step in the proc eeding and what does not? Conventionally, the task for the c ourt in any suc h determination would be to asc ertain the nature of the ac tion taken and whether suc h ac tion amounted to a c lear and unequivoc al intention to proc eed with the matter in a judic ial forum. Put another way, the c ourt has to query whether the step taken amounts to a waiver of the right to arbitration insofar as suc h step amounted to a demonstration of a willingness to defend the _substance of the claim in court_ : see, in this regard, _Eagle Star Insurance v Yuval Insurance_ [1978] 1 Lloyds’ Rep 357 and _Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraq Airways Co_ [1994] 1 Lloyds’ Rep 276. 

36     Of c ourse, the question of whether or not an ac t amounted to a demonstration of a willingness to defend the substanc e of a c laim c ould only be answered in referenc e to the fac tual matrix that is ac tually before the c ourt and by taking into ac c ount the parties’ motivations for taking any ac tion in c ourt objec tively. As astutely observed in another ac ademic c ommentary (see Mic hael 

Mustill & Stewart C Boyd, _Commercial Arbitration_ , 2nd ed (Butterworths: London, 1989) at p 472): 

 “The c irc umstanc es whic h ac c ompany an ac t may be looked at to see whether the ac t amounts to an elec tion to give up the right to a stay. Thus, an application to the Court which might otherwise amount to a step in the proceedings is deprived of this characteristic if the applicant makes it clear...that he intends to insist on a reference to arbitration ” 

 [emphasis added] 

37     Lest it be suggested that this position has no relevanc e in the domestic c ontext, I might add that this appeared to be c onsistent with domestic jurisprudenc e that highlights that any step taken 


need not be done at the expense of any right to stay the proc eedings as long as suc h step is taken with the c aveat that the appropriate reservations were made: see _Australian Timber_ at [22] and _WestLB AG v Philippine National Bank & Others_ <span class="citation">[2007] 1 SLR 967</span> at [40] to [43]. Though extrinsic to the reasoning that was relevant here, it may be useful to highlight that the view that a mere reservation would be suffic ient to c aveat any applic ation that delved into the merits of the c ase as “a step in the proc eedings” was not one that was unanimous: see, for instanc e, the reservations of the High Court in _Lian Teck Construction Pte Ltd v Woh Hup (Pte) Ltd and Others_ <span class="citation">[2006] 4 SLR 1</span> at [19]. 

38     Reverting bac k to the disc ourse relevant to the matter at hand, it was therefore c lear that the question of whether an applic ation to extend time would be a “step in the proc eedings” must be seen in the c ontext of the fac tual matrix that is before the c ourt: see _International SOS_ at [5]. Where a party seeks an extension of time for reasons extrinsic to the possibility of advanc ing the c laim in an arbitral forum, for example, I would have no doubt that suc h an applic ation for extension of time would c onstitute a step in the proc eedings: see, in this regard, the c omments in _Sanwell Corp_ on the Malaysian High Court dec ision of _Usahabina v Anuar bin Yahya_ [1998] 7 MLJ 691. These c ase fac ts, however, c ould not have been more different. Here, if the defendants were to apply for an extension of time, there would have been no need to delve into the merits of the c ase, even on a superfic ial level. Instead, all that the ac c ompanying affidavit would have to highlight would be the fac t that suc h an extension of time would be needed to ac c ommodate the hearing of the pending stay applic ation. Ac c ordingly, when one takes c ognisanc e of the bac kdrop underlying suc h an applic ation, any applic ation for extension of time taken out as a result of the need for a stay applic ation to be disposed of first c ould not, in my view, be seriously c anvassed to be tantamount to a “demonstration of a willingness to defend the substanc e of the c laim in c ourt”. Putting it another way, it would be c lear to all the parties c onc erned (and indeed, to the arbiter hearing the matter) that suc h an ac t had “been done manifestly without prejudic e to an intention to invoke arbitration and merely to preserve the status quo until a summons to stay is promptly issued”: see _Blueflame Mechanical v David Lord Engineering Services_ 8 Const LJ 263 (21 February 1992, transc ript available on Lexis). In these c irc umstanc es, I saw no reason why fidelity to the approac h advoc ated in _Australian Timber_ would be c onc eptually problematic. 

39     That, however, was not the end of the debate, for whatever the c onc eptual merits of _Australian Timber_ , if as Assoc Prof Boo appears to suggest, the said c ase c ould not be rec onc iled with the views of Chao JA in _Samsung Corp_ (see [31] above), I would be bound, in law, to give effec t to the latter. Nonetheless, with the greatest respec t, I have to depart c ompany with Assoc Prof Boo as to the interpretation that should be ac c orded to the observation in _Samsung Corp_. Whilst I ac c ept that read _in vacuo_ , one c ould well suggest that the above extrac t from _Samsung Corp_ should be taken to mean that the timelines for the filing of the defenc e c ease to be applic able the moment a party applies for a stay, in my view, to ac c ord it suc h an interpretation would be to pay mere lip servic e to the underlying fac tual matrix in that c ase. In ensuring that the c omments in question would not be read out of c ontext, it was important to bear in mind that the issue of primary importanc e in that c ase was whether a party c ould apply for summary judgment where there had been a pending stay applic ation. Given that the final order made by the Court in _Samsung Corp_ was that no O 14 applic ation c ould be brought before the stay applic ation has been fully disposed of, the attendant question that would no doubt have invariably plagued the mind of the c ourt there would be whether suc h a dec ision would strip away a plaintiff’s right to apply for summary judgment thereafter given that no proc edural timelines mandate any further filing of a defenc e in the event of a dismissal of the stay applic ation. When one takes c ognisanc e of the c onc erns of the c ourt there, it would immediately be apprec iated that Chao JA’s c omments were, in all likelihood, meant to do nothing more than to assuage and allay the c onc erns (on the part of potential plaintiffs) that defendants may attempt to frustrate any possible summary judgment applic ation by delaying the filing of a defenc e after a failed stay applic ation on the basis that there were no timelines that applied to the filing of a 


defenc e after the hearing of a stay applic ation. Put another way, His Honour was merely impressing the point that the c ourt would be seised of further powers to impose further timelines where there has been an unsuc c essful stay applic ation so that a party would be c ompelled to file his defenc e and the plaintiff c ould proc eed (if so desired) with a summary judgment applic ation. In my view, His Honour was not, as apparently c ontended by Assoc Prof Boo, purporting to suggest that the timelines under the Rules of Court immediately c ease to be applic able the moment a stay applic ation is made. 

40     That this must be the proper interpretation to be ac c orded to His Honour’s c omments in _Samsung Corp_ is further fortified by his approving referenc e to, and relianc e on, the dec ision of _Yeoh Poh Sun_. In _Yeoh Poh Sun_ , Woo JC had arrived at the c onc lusion that if a plaintiff insisted on the filing of a defenc e pending an appeal against an unsuc c essful stay applic ation, the defendant should apply for an extension of time. This, of c ourse, predic ated its applic ability on the assumption that time c ontinued to run in suc h an instanc e. Given that the entire basis as to why time c ontinued to run was that “there [was] no existing order for a stay” (see _Yeoh Poh Sun_ at [17]), a state of affairs that was equally applic able to an applic ation for a stay _at first instance_ as it was on a _dismissed stay application that was pending appeal_ , that _Samsung Corp_ c ited _Yeoh Poh Sun_ with approval amounted to a strong indic ation that Chao JA c ould not have intended to suggest that timelines for the filing of a defenc e c ease to be relevant onc e a stay applic ation was filed. 

41     Based on the above reasoning, I was of the opinion the two c ases did not make strange bedfellows and were, instead, c omfortably rec onc ilable in the following manner: _Samsung Corp_ merely stands for the proposition that a defendant c ould not be c ompelled to file a defenc e whilst an applic ation for a stay in favour of arbitration was pending, a moot point in most instanc es sinc e it was not likely that the plaintiff in most instanc es would even press the matter (as Woo JC noted in _Yeoh Poh Sun_ at [15]); _Australian Timber_ , on the other hand, c aters for the situation where a plaintiff does, in fac t, dec ide to press the matter – in suc h c irc umstanc es, it informs us that the defendant has to be proac tive in ensuring that the Court grants some form of c onc ession to ensure that the defendant would not fall foul of the timelines stipulated in the Rules of Court. When seen in this c ontext, it would be right to suggest that _Samsung Corp_ “must be read subjec t to” _Australian Timber_ (see Jeffrey Pinsler, _Singapore Court Practice 2006_ (LexisNexis: Singapore, 2006) at para 62/9/8) sinc e the latter dec ision merely defines what must be done if a plaintiff dec ides, whatever his motivations, to file an applic ation for a judgment in default of defenc e whilst a stay applic ation is pending. 

42     That _Australian Timber_ and _Samsung Corp_ c ould be rec onc iled was, in my view, most fortuitous, for there was a lot to rec ommend the approac h that had been taken in the former dec ision. Any other position would be tantamount to suggesting that every single stay applic ation, even if they were patently unmeritorious, would override the timelines that were to be adhered to till the stay applic ation was finally disposed of. While this appeared, at first glanc e, to be a superfic ially seduc tive position, the demerits of suc h an approac h were, in my view, all too apparent: any defendant desirous of delaying proc eedings to suit his purposes would be immediately seised of a further weapon in his arsenal that would allow him to bring to a halt, albeit temporarily, any pending c ourt proc eedings by surreptitiously applying for a stay, notwithstanding the c omplete lac k of any legal basis for doing so. To this end, the approac h adopted in _Australian Timber_ possessed the attrac tion of ensuring that only _reasonable_ applic ations for extension of time are granted (bec ause if the applic ation were patently bound to fail, _e.g._ there is no arbitration c lause in the c ontrac t to even speak of, then the applic ation for extension of time would no doubt be refused) and ac c ordingly, had the effec t of ac ting as a desirable sieve against those whose singular goal in applying for a stay would be to delay the expeditious resolution of the dispute. To put it simply: genuine _bona fide_ applic ations for a stay would in no way be prejudic ed, but applic ations for a stay without the slightest iota of merit would, quite appropriately, be severely hampered. 


43     For the above reasons, I was of the view that Ang J’s observations in _Australian Timber_ were not only representative of the law in Singapore, but of signific ant merit given that they c omport wholly with logic. Needless to say, I found no reason to depart from it. Juxtaposing the state of the law, as desc ribed above, to the fac ts that were before me, it would follow that the defendants should have taken a more pro-ac tive approac h onc e they rec eived the 48-hour notic e and should have either applied for an extension of time to file a defenc e, or have taken out an urgent applic ation for their matter to be heard before time to file their defenc e expired. Given their failure to do either, I found in favour of the plaintiff in the default judgment applic ation. 

44     In the light of the c onc lusion I arrived at in the default judgment applic ation, as parties had agreed at the onset of these proc eedings, the attendant question of whether a stay of proc eedings should be allowed bec ame ac ademic given the absenc e of proc eedings on whic h any stay order might be attac hed. It was therefore unnec essary for me to proffer any views as to the substantive merits of the stay applic ation. 

**Conclusion** 

45     All is not lost for the defendants, who, quite apart from exploring the usual route of appealing this dec ision, would still be able to take out an applic ation to set aside the default judgment I granted. This, of c ourse, gives rise to the attendant question of whether plaintiffs in general should take the c ourse of ac tion that the plaintiff in this c ase had taken. In my opinion, where a stay applic ation appears to be made _bona fide_ (though I stress that I made no determination on _these_ fac ts), justic e is not best served by holding a Sword of Damoc les over the defendants’ head by applying for judgment in default of defenc e. In most c onventional situations, all this ac hieves is the invariable esc alation of c osts, sinc e a c onsc ientious defendant would apply for an extension of time, whic h, for _bona fide_ applic ations, are no doubt bound to be granted as a matter of c ourse. For that reason, as a matter of good prac tic e, there may be c onsiderable merit in not pressing for the filing of a defenc e if a defendant files what appears to be a _bona fide_ applic ation for a stay of proc eedings: see, onc e more, the c omments made in _Yeoh Poh Sun_ at [15]. 

46     For those reasons, I have to c onc ede that the plaintiff’s default judgment applic ation possessed somewhat of an artific ial air, for it served to avoid a realistic disposal of the substantive question that _should_ have been before me, namely whether the judic ial proc eedings should be stayed in favour of arbitration proc eedings. Whatever my reservations, however, it was c lear to me that the plaintiff’s arguments were tec hnic ally c orrec t in law and that the defendants should, for reasons disc ussed earlier, have applied for an extension of time. Though the Rules of Court should not be used as a trap for the unwary, and though my sympathies were very muc h with the defendants, exc eptions should not be easily made in light of the ease of seeking rec ourse to the prec autionary measures available in this instanc e. In the c irc umstanc es, I therefore had little option but to make the order that I did in favour of the plaintiff in its default judgment applic ation. 

47     As a c orollary to the above, however, I was not inc lined to make any order in relation to the defendants’ stay applic ation at this junc ture pending any further ac tion that might be taken by either party to set aside or vary my order _vis-à-vis_ the default judgment applic ation.
