**Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the judgment of the court):** 

1       This is an appeal by the grandc hildren of one Low Kim Tah (“LKT”), who died intestate, against the dec ision of the trial judge in Originating Summons No 826 of 2003 ( _Low Geok Khim v Low Geok Bian_ [2006] 2 SLR 444 (“ _Low Geok Khim_ ”)) that the money in six joint ac c ounts held in the names of LKT and his youngest son, one Low Geok Bian (“LGB”), vested benefic ially in LGB as the surviving joint ac c ount holder upon LKT’s death on 6 Dec ember 1997. 

2       This appeal raises an important issue as to the c urrent state of the law in Singapore regarding the applic ation of the presumption of advanc ement in a father-and-c hild relationship. The joint administrators of the estate of LKT (“the Estate”), _viz_ , one Low Geok Khim (“LGK”) and one Low Geok Beng (“Geok Beng”), brought this ac tion to determine the respec tive rights of the Estate and LGB to the money in the six joint ac c ounts totalling $4,471,144.28. Subsequently, Geok Beng was disc harged as joint administrator, leaving LGK, who is the first respondent in this appeal, as the sole administratrix of the Estate. LGK and LGB and Geok Beng are three of the ten c hildren of LKT. The partic ulars of the six joint ac c ounts as at the date of the death of LKT are as follows: 

 (a) POSB Ac c ount No 042-07218-5 opened on 4 Marc h 1983 – $221,207.11 (“Ac c ount 1”); 

 (b) OCBC Easisave Ac c ount No 516-054889-001 opened on 25 February 1995 – $2,004,604.97 (“Ac c ount 2”); 

 (c ) OCBC Easisave Ac c ount No 516-054889-002 opened on 25 February 1995 – 


 $2,004,604.97 (“Ac c ount 3”); 

 (d) OCBC Easisave Ac c ount No 516-054889-003 opened on 11 Marc h 1995 – $114,441. (“Ac c ount 4”); 

 (e) OCBC Easisave Ac c ount No 516-054889-004 opened on 19 April 1995 – $114,072. (“Ac c ount 5”); and 

 (f ) OCBC Fixed Deposit Ac c ount No 516-549706-501 opened (with an initial sum of $3,000,000) on 23 Marc h 1990 – $12,212.82 (“Ac c ount 6”). 

3       The original applic ation required the c ourt to determine whether the sum of $90,028.84 in a seventh joint ac c ount, _viz_ , POSB Ac c ount No 045-07219-3 opened on 4 Marc h 1983 and held in the joint names of LKT and LGK, belonged benefic ially to LGK or to the Estate on a resulting trust. Subsequently, LGK agreed to relinquish any c laim to the money in the said joint ac c ount and, ac c ordingly, there is no dispute between the benefic iaries of the Estate over this sum of money. 

4       The appellants are the c hildren of one Low Yok Kay (“Yok Kay”) and one Low Geok Khoon (“Geok Khoon”), the two elder sons of LKT who had predec eased him. They were joined as c odefendants to the ac tion on 6 August 2003 in order to c ontest the c laim of LGB that, as the surviving holder of the six joint ac c ounts, he was entitled to the benefic ial ownership of the money in the said ac c ounts. The appellants took the position that LGB held the money in Ac c ounts 1 to 6 on a resulting trust for the Estate. 

**Background** 

5       LKT was, as desc ribed by the trial judge, a typic al Chinese patriarc h and a self-made businessman. Starting from a humble family business dealing mainly in livestoc k trading in the early 1940s, he expanded his business to inc lude real estate development. To this end, he inc orporated a family c ompany known as Hup Choon Kim Kee Pte Ltd (“HCKK”) on 1 February 1963 to take over the bulk of his assets. LKT was then 57 years old while LGB was 20 years old. Most of his sons helped out in the family business at some time or other, with Yok Kay, Geok Khoon and LGB being the ones who were ac tively involved in the running of the business. 

6       Upon the inc orporation of HCKK in 1963, LKT allotted the share c apital to himself and his c hildren as follows: 

 Name Number of shares LKT 1, Yok Kay 1, LGB 905 Geok Khoon 730 Geok Hwee 730 Geok Choo 730 Geok Beng 730 LGK 160 Geok Yin 150 


 Geok Kiow 150 

 Geok Up 150 

7       On 15 Oc tober 1983, the shareholders of HCKK passed a spec ial resolution to wind up the c ompany voluntarily. The distribution of the assets to the shareholders was effec ted as set out in a Distribution Agreement Deed dated 15 May 1985 signed by LKT and all his c hildren. 

8       However, some of the properties held by HCKK, spec ific ally the land at Ava Road and the properties known as 263 and 263A Balestier Road (“the Ava/Balestier properties”), c ould not be c onveniently distributed at that time as they were under development. Ac c ordingly, a new c ompany, Hup Choon Kim Kee Realty Pte Ltd (“HCKK Realty”), was inc orporated to hold the Ava/Balestier properties on trust for LKT and all his sons exc ept Geok Choo. Sometime in 1989, HCKK Realty sold the Ava/Balestier properties and, on c ompletion on 12 Marc h 1990, realised the net sum of $14,329,643.75. The proc eeds were then distributed on 23 Marc h 1990 as follows: 

 Name Share of the Ava/Balestier properties 

 Amount rec eived 

## LKT 21/100 $3,009,225. 

 Estate of Yok Kay 

## 21/100 $3,009,225. 

## LGB 18/100 $2,579,335. 

 Estate of Geok Khoon 

## 14/100 $2,006,150. 

 Geok Hwee 13/100 $1,862,853. Geok Choo 0/100 $ Geok Beng 13/100 $1,862,853. 

9       On the very same day that LKT rec eived his c heque for $3,009,225.19, being his share of the proc eeds of sale, he had it deposited, through LGB, into his personal c urrent ac c ount, OCBC Ac c ount No 516-033719-001. LKT then immediately transferred out of that ac c ount a sum of $3m to open a fixed deposit ac c ount, _viz_ , Ac c ount 6 (with a provision for the right of survivorship, but whic h was operative on one signature only), to be plac ed under two separate deposits of $1,500,000 eac h. Further deposits of $86,710.62 and $87,292.98, whic h c ame from LKT’s other fixed deposit ac c ount at OCBC’s head offic e at Chulia Street, and a separate sum of $10,000 were subsequently deposited in Ac c ount 6 in May 1990, June 1990 and January 1991 respec tively. Thereafter, no other money was deposited in Ac c ount 6. No withdrawal was made from Ac c ount 6 in the next five years, during whic h the c apital sum and ac c rued interest ac c umulated to just short of $4m. 

10     However, during the period from February to April 1995, the bulk of the money in Ac c ount 6 was withdrawn and used to open Ac c ounts 2 to 5. These ac c ounts were also opened jointly in the names of LKT and LGB, also with rights of survivorship and also operative on one signature only. It would appear that LGB was aware that these ac c ounts were being opened as the related signature c ards had his signatures on them. These ac c ounts were c alled Easisave ac c ounts as they c ombined features of a savings ac c ount and a c urrent ac c ount, and, for this reason, funds held in suc h ac c ounts are given a lower rate of interest than ordinary fixed deposit ac c ounts. It is c ommon ground that LGB did not put any money into Ac c ounts 1 to 6 and that he also did not draw out any money 


from these ac c ounts. 

11     LKT died intestate on 6 Dec ember 1997 at the age of 91. Apart from the money in Ac c ounts 1 to 6, LKT left other assets totalling about $6.9m, the distribution of whic h is not in dispute among the benefic iaries. Up to the date of LKT’s death, only LGB was aware of the existenc e of Ac c ounts 1 to 6 sinc e he was present when all the ac c ounts were opened and the signature c ards were signed by him. None of the other family members was aware of the existenc e of these ac c ounts as LKT had never mentioned or spoken to them about the ac c ounts. 

**Issues before the trial judge** 

1       2 The only issue before the trial judge with respec t to Ac c ount 1 was whether LGB held the money in the joint ac c ount benefic ially or on a resulting trust. However, with respec t to Ac c ounts 2 to 6, the trial judge was asked to determine the benefic ial ownership of the money in the said ac c ounts on the basis of the following questions: 

 (a) Whether LKT had the mental c apac ity to open Ac c ount 6 in 1990 and Ac c ounts 2 to 5 in 1995. 

 (b) If so, whether he had intended to open the five ac c ounts as joint ac c ounts with LGB. 

 (c ) If so, whether the presumption of advanc ement should be applied in favour of LGB. 

 (d) If so, whether the presumption was rebutted on the fac ts. 

Issues (a) and (b) are questions of fac t, whilst issues (c ) and (d) are issues of fac t and law in relation to the presumption of advanc ement as an evidentiary guide or princ iple. 

**_Issues (a) & (b) – Mental capacity and intention of LKT_** 

13     In respec t of issues (a) and (b), the appellants had c alled two doc tors to testify on the mental state of LKT. The first, Dr Tang Kok Foo (“Dr Tang”), a neurologist, had examined LKT in February 1995, May 1995, November 1996 and April 1997. He testified that LKT was already suffering from advanc ed dementia in 1995, due likely to Alzheimer’s disease, and that it bec ame very advanc ed in 1996. However, he was also of the view that LKT’s dementia would have been mild in 1990. The sec ond doc tor, Dr Tan Chue Tin, a psyc hiatrist, did not personally examine LKT but based his opinion on the findings of Dr Tang and on LKT’s c ourt testimony in Suit No 854 of 1991 (“Suit 854/1991”) in April 1994. His opinion was that LKT would have had very limited or little awareness of his situation when he opened Ac c ounts 2 to 5 in 1995, and that in 1990, it was more likely than not that LKT was similarly limited in his awareness when he opened Ac c ount 6. 

14     By way of response, LGB relied on the opinions of two other doc tors. However, one of them, Dr Lee Suan Yew, who had treated LKT from 1987 to 1992, submitted a report but did not testify, whilst the one who did testify, Dr Yeo Kah Loke Brian (“Dr Yeo”), had not personally examined LKT but gave his opinion on the basis of the findings of Dr Tang. Dr Yeo opined that if LKT was suffering from any form of dementia in 1995, it was more likely to be vasc ular dementia and not Alzheimer’s dementia, and that “it would not be possible to c onc lude from an examination of the dec eased in 1995, that he was not in a c oherent mental state a few years prior to 1995, muc h less in 1990”. Dr Yeo also opined that in view of the gradual progression of Alzheimer’s disease, it would not nec essarily mean that LKT was not able to reason immediately prior to 1990 or in 1994. He was of the view that LKT was in a more c oherent mental state in April 1994 when he gave evidenc e in c ourt in 


Suit 854/1991. 

15     The trial judge, after c onsidering the expert evidenc e and also evidenc e from two other sourc es relating to LKT’s medic al c ondition, _viz_ , (a) the testimonies of LGK, the sole administratrix, and LGB to the effec t that LKT was in good health until his death, and (b) Lai Kew Chai J’s ac c eptanc e of LKT’s testimony in 1994 in Suit 854/1991 in preferenc e to that of an opposing witness, found that LKT had the mental c apac ity to open Ac c ount 6 in 1990. 

16     At the trial, the appellants had also alleged that LKT had intended Ac c ount 6 to be in his sole name, but bec ause of his medic al c ondition, might not have been aware that he had opened a joint ac c ount with LGB. Counsel for the appellants had c ontended that bec ause of the suspic ious state of the doc umentation relating to the opening of the ac c ount, LGB had opened the joint ac c ount for LKT without the latter’s awareness. The trial judge, after a c areful and detailed examination of the related banking forms, signature c ards and other doc uments, c onc luded that they were insuffic ient to prove that LKT did not intend to open or was not aware of the opening of Ac c ount 6 as a joint ac c ount in 1990 (see _Low Geok Khim_ ([1] _supra_ ) at [36]). 

17     In respec t of the opening of Ac c ounts 2 to 5 in 1995, the trial judge found (at [37]–[38]) that LKT was suffering from mild dementia whic h did not deprive him of his mental c apac ity to open those ac c ounts. The trial judge further held that even if he was wrong in his finding with regard to LKT’s mental c apac ity to open Ac c ounts 2 to 5, the money in those ac c ounts would automatic ally revert bac k to Ac c ount 6 for the purpose of determining its ownership. 

**_Issues (c) & (d) – Application of the presumption of advancement_** 

18     In respec t of issue (c ), the trial judge was of the view that the presumption of advanc ement applied to the money held in Ac c ounts 1 to 6 in view of the father-and-son relationship between LKT and LGB. In respec t of issue (d), he found that, on the evidenc e before him, the presumption had not been rebutted. 

**The appeal** 

19     The appellants’ arguments, as set out in their c ase, skeletal arguments and c ounsel’s oral pleadings, all of whic h the respondents have opposed, are as follows: 

 (a) The trial judge was wrong in fac t to find that LKT had the requisite mental c apac ity to open Ac c ount 6 in 1990 and Ac c ounts 2 to 5 in 1995 respec tively. 

 (b) If LKT did have the requisite mental c apac ity to open Ac c ount 6, he did not intend to open it as a joint ac c ount, and henc e, LKT did not intend LGB to have the money in the ac c ount upon his death. 

 (c ) Given the mental state of LKT, the presumption of advanc ement was not a sensible guide to determine LKT’s intention in opening Ac c ounts 2 to 6. 

 (d) The trial judge was wrong to apply the presumption of advanc ement to Ac c ounts 1 to 6 as LGB was self-supporting and not financ ially dependent on LKT when the joint ac c ounts were opened. 

 (e) The presumption of advanc ement was rebutted on the fac ts. 


**_Mental capacity of LKT_** 

20     Counsel for the appellants submitted that the trial judge’s finding that LKT had the mental c apac ity to open Ac c ounts 2 to 5 in 1995 was based on the erroneous finding that “if the dec eased had dementia, it was mild dementia, and not severe dementia” (see _Low Geok Khim_ at [37]). It was submitted that this finding disregarded the evidenc e of three of the doc tors who had testified that LKT was suffering from advanc ed dementia in February 1995. We do not find it nec essary to examine the medic al evidenc e in detail on this point. However, it is pertinent to observe that the opening of Ac c ounts 2 to 5 in 1995, when c ompared to the c irc umstanc es in whic h Ac c ount 6 was opened in 1990, made no c ommerc ial sense. The reason is that the opening of Ac c ounts 2 to 5 resulted in LKT getting a lower rate of interest than if he had allowed the money to remain on fixed deposit in Ac c ount 6. He was not in need of liquid funds at the time Ac c ounts 2 to 5 were opened sinc e he still had his c urrent ac c ount. Furthermore, he had not drawn out a single c ent from Ac c ount 6 sinc e it was opened. Given that LKT had been an astute and suc c essful businessman, his ac tions in 1995 were inexplic able exc ept on the basis that his mental state had deteriorated to the extent that he was not fully aware of the c ommerc ial c onsequenc es of his own ac tions, even though he might have had the mental c apac ity to open banking ac c ounts. He was then aged 89 and suffering from either advanc ed vasc ular dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. 

21     Notwithstanding our observations on LKT’s mental state in 1995, we agree with the trial judge that this fac t is not c ritic al to the primary issue in this c ase, whic h is LKT’s mental c ondition in 1990. What happened in 1990 was of greater signific anc e than what happened later in 1995 sinc e the money in Ac c ounts 2 to 5 c ame from Ac c ount 6. This is reflec ted in the trial judge’s findings on the law and the fac ts, as well as in the arguments of c ounsel for the parties before us. 

22     However, c ounsel for the appellants was unable to say anything useful to c hallenge the c orrec tness of the trial judge’s finding on LKT’s mental state in 1990, having regard to (a) Dr Tang’s evidenc e that LKT had mild dementia in 1990 and that a person with suc h a medic al c ondition would usually be able to make reasonably good dec isions, and (b) the fac t that Lai Kew Chai J had found that even in 1994, LKT was reasonably c ompetent when he testified in c ourt in Suit 854/1991. Counsel’s attempt to refute the trial judge’s finding on this issue was futile. For these reasons, we have no basis to disagree with the trial judge’s finding that there was insuffic ient evidenc e to show that LKT did not know that he was opening a joint ac c ount with LGB in 1990. 

23     However, before we c onsider the trial judge’s findings on the law and the fac ts on the issue of the applic ation of the presumption of advanc ement, it is pertinent to note that when LKT opened Ac c ount 6 in 1990 and then Ac c ounts 2 to 5 in 1995, using money from Ac c ount 6, he stipulated in the bank’s ac c ount opening doc uments that one signature alone would be suffic ient to operate the ac c ounts. The signific anc e of this, whic h we will c onsider in greater detail later, is that in 1995, it would appear that LKT, notwithstanding his mental state, did not wish to relinquish c ontrol of the operation of Ac c ounts 2 to 5. 

**_Presumption of advancement_** 

24     In the c ourt below, it was the appellants’ c ase that as LGB was self-supporting and not financ ially dependent on LKT in 1990 and 1995 (and the same argument would apply in the c ase of Ac c ount 1 whic h was opened in 1983, when LGB was already 40 years old), the presumption of advanc ement was not applic able as the presumption was premised on a father’s moral or equitable obligation to provide for his c hildren. Counsel c ited the following passage from _Snell’s Equity_ (John Mc Ghee gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 31st Ed, 2005) at para 23-02: 


 The presumption of advanc ement applies to c ertain transfers between parties where it may be readily inferred that A would have intended to make a gift to B. It is found therefore where A is under an equitable obligation to support or make provision for B. Examples are where A is the husband or father of B. It is, in effec t, a c ounter-presumption whic h provides prima facie evidenc e about A’s intentions as to where the benefic ial interest in the property should lie. Its effec t is to negative any initial presumption that the transfer c reates a resulting trust. 

Counsel also c ited in support of his argument the c ase of _Ang Toon Teck v Ang Poon Sin_ [1998] SGHC 67 where Judith Prakash J had suggested that the presumption of advanc ement should not be applied between a father and a 50-year-old financ ially self-supporting son as the latter’s need for support in those c irc umstanc es was absent. 

25     The trial judge rejec ted this argument on the ground that the presumption of advanc ement had been explained by Lord Eldon in _Murless v Franklin_ (1818) 1 Swans 13 at 18; 36 ER 278 at 280 without referenc e to the need for financ ial support, implying that the basis of the presumption was not the moral or equitable obligation on the part of one party to provide for another, suc h as between a father and his c hild or between a husband and his wife. The trial judge quoted the following passage from _Murless v Franklin_ (see _Low Geok Khim_ at [44]): 

 It is settled that though, in general c ases, if A. purc hases with his own money, and the c onveyanc e is taken in the name of B ., an implied trust in favour of A. arises from the payment of the purc hase money; yet that doc trine has exc eptions. One exc eption is, that if a man purc hases in the name of his son, and no ac t is done to manifest an intention that the son shall take as trustee, that intention will not be implied from the payment of the purc hase money by the father, but the purc hase is prima facie an advanc ement. 

The trial judge also observed that neither Prakash J nor c ounsel had referred to any c ases stating that the presumption of advanc ement c ould only arise in a transac tion of property from a parent to a c hild when it c ould be inferred that the parent was making a financ ial provision for the c hild. 

26     The trial judge also quoted a passage from the judgment of Willmer LJ in _In re Pauling’s Settlement Trusts_ [1964] Ch 303 at 336 on the relationship between the presumption of advanc ement (equity approves of gifts by a father to a c hild) and the presumption of undue influenc e (equity dislikes and distrusts gifts by a c hild to a parent). On the basis of these two passages, the trial judge proc eeded to state (at [47]) the law as follows: 

 When one c onsiders the presumption of advanc ement as expounded in Murless v Franklin and In re Pauling’s Settlement Trusts , one must be c autious about adopting the narrower approac h. As the presumption operates as an exc eption to the rule on resulting trusts, the rationale for the presumption should be c onsidered. The underlying reason for having an exc eption is that the parent would have intended the c hild to have the benefit of the property bec ause of the parentc hild relationship between them. There is no nec essity to restric t the operation of the presumption of advanc ement to a c hild in need of financ ial support. There is no reason to suppose that a parent c ould have intended the c hild to have the benefit if the latter was financ ially dependent, but not if he was financ ially sound. 

The trial judge ac c ordingly held that the presumption of advanc ement was applic able to the six joint ac c ounts. 

27     Before us, c ounsel for the appellants c ontended that the trial judge was wrong, as a matter of law, in holding that the presumption of advanc ement was not based on a dependenc y relationship 


giving rise to a moral or equitable obligation on the part of the provider. He referred us to another passage from the judgment of Lord Eldon in _Murless v Franklin_ ([25] _supra_ ) whic h prec eded the passage quoted by the trial judge (see [25] above). It reads: 

 The general rule that on a purc hase by one man in the name of another, the nominee is a trustee for the purc haser, is subject to exception where the purchaser is under a species of natural obligation to provide for the nominee. The purc hase in this c ase being prima facie a provision for the sons, it is nec essary to repel that presumption by evidenc e whic h shows that, at the time, the father intended the purc hase for his own benefit. Possession taken by the father at the time would amount to such evidence. [emphasis added] 

This passage supports c ounsel’s submission that the origin of the presumption was that of the dependenc y of the c hild for support from his father and the natural feeling of paternal love and affec tion of the one for the other. Counsel in his written submissions also referred to _Bennet v Bennet_ (1879) 10 Ch D 474 where the underlying basis for the presumption was also explained in the c ontext of an _in loco parentis_ relationship. 

28     In _Bennet v Bennet,_ a mother had purc hased an investment in the name of her son and the question was whether the presumption of advanc ement applied. Jessel MR held that as a mother had, in the eyes of equity, no equitable obligation to advanc e or make provision for her c hild, unlike in the c ase of a father, the presumption did not apply where a mother purc hased property or made an investment in the name of her c hild, or in the joint names of herself and her c hild. In suc h a c ase, whether there was any intention on the part of the mother to make an advanc e to the son was a question of evidenc e. If there was no evidenc e to show an advanc e, the property would be held on a resulting trust. Jessel MR explained the interac tion between these two presumptions in equity (at 476) as follows: 

 The doc trine of equity as regards presumption of gifts is this, that where one person stands in suc h a relation to another that there is an obligation on that person to make a provision for the other, and we find either a purc hase or investment in the name of the other, or in the joint names of the person and the other, of an amount whic h would c onstitute a provision for the other, the presumption arises of an intention on the part of the person to disc harge the obligation to the other; and therefore, in the absenc e of evidenc e to the c ontrary, that purc hase or investment is held to be in itself evidenc e of a gift. 

 In other words, the presumption of gift arises from the moral obligation to give. 

 That rec onc iles all the c ases upon the subjec t but one, bec ause nothing is better established than this, that as regards a c hild, a person not the father of the c hild may put himself in the position of one in loco parentis to the c hild, and so inc ur the obligation to make provision for the c hild. 

 ... 

 [A] person in loco parentis means a person taking upon himself the duty of a father of a c hild to make provision for that c hild. It is c lear that in that c ase the presumption c an only arise from the obligation, and therefore in that c ase the doc trine c an only have referenc e to the obligation of a father to provide for his c hild, and nothing else. 

 But the father is under that obligation from the mere fact of his being the father, and therefore no evidence is necessary to shew the obligation to provide for his child, because that is part of 


 his duty. In the case of a father, you have only to prove the fact that he is the father, and when you have done that the obligation at once arises; but in the case of a person in loco parentis you must prove that he took upon himself the obligation. 

 [emphasis added] 

29     In our view, these statements in _Murless v Franklin_ and _Bennet v Bennet_ make it c lear that a dependenc y relationship was the original basis of the presumption of advanc ement. However, in the same period that these c ases were dec ided, some English equity judges were also prepared to apply the presumption in c ases where the element of dependenc y was absent, so long as there was a parental relationship between the donor and the donee. For example, in _Hepworth v Hepworth_ (187071) LR 11 Eq 10, the testator, by his will, settled £1000 reduc ed annuities on eac h of his three granddaughters, the c hildren of his only son, and two years later, transferred a sum of £3200 reduc ed annuities, whic h was all the property he had, to his son. He died at the age of 92, having resided for the last ten years of his life with his son, who was a man of c onsiderable property. Malins VC, in holding that there was an absolute gift of the annuities to the son, said (at 12–13): 

 The law is not doubtful that if this had been a transfer to a stranger it would have operated as a trust, but if a gift is made in favour of a c hild the presumption of law is, that it is intended as an advanc ement or provision for the c hild. The old c ases turned upon the question, whether the c hild was provided for or not, but rec ent authorities have gone upon whether the gift was intended as an advanc ement or not. 

 Thus, in the present c ase, the transfer having been made to the son, it is thrown upon those who deny that it was an absolute gift to prove that there was no intention on the part of the father to make an advanc ement or provision for his son. Here the son was evidently c apable of maintaining himself, for it is in evidenc e that he was possessed of c onsiderable property, and, in fac t, it was the son who maintained his father. That he well performed the duty of taking c are of him is evident from the fac t that the father lived with the son for ten years, till his death at the age of ninety-four. The father, on the other hand, had no objec t in the world upon whom to bestow his property but his son and his son’s c hildren, and it was the most natural thing that the father should have c ome to the determination to make over to his son during his lifetime this property, being well satisfied that what he gave to his son would be disposed of in the way he c onsidered best for the benefit of his own c hildren. The son seems to have been perfec tly ready to fulfil this duty sinc e by his will he left all his property for the benefit of his wife and c hildren. 

 ... 

 In Sidmouth v Sidmouth an observation made by Lord Langdale is very appropriate, where he says: “The parent may judge for himself, when it suits his own c onvenienc e, or when it will be best for his son, to sec ure him any benefit whic h he voluntarily thinks fit to bestow upon him; and it does not follow that, bec ause the reason for doing it is not known, there was no intention to advanc e at all.” Here the father was at liberty to say he would give this sum to his son, and there is no presumption to rebut the prima fac ie rule of law, that a father who gives property to his son does so by way of advancement or provision for him. 

 [emphasis added] 

30     In _Sidmouth v Sidmouth_ (1840) 2 Beav 447; 48 ER 1254 _,_ the father had bought c ertain stoc k in the name of the son, who was an adult living with the father and dependent on him for support. The c ourt held that the presumption of advanc ement applied. Lord Langdale MR reasoned (at 


457;1258) as follows: 

 Consider the situation in whic h they stood – the son unmarried, living in the house of his father, and wholly maintained by him, having future expec tations from another sourc e, but no present maintenanc e exc ept from his father, and having very great future expec tations from his father’s large property; and then c onsider what the father c ould mean by transferring sums of stoc k into the name of his son, with an intention to rec eive the dividends himself. It is c lear that he meant to c ontinue to maintain his son; it is probable that if he had meant only a c ontingent provision in the event of the son surviving him, he would have made a transfer into the joint names of himself and his son, for this would have given the absolute power over the stoc k to the survivor; if he had intended, notwithstanding the transfer to the son, to retain the absolute dominion in himself, it is probable he would have taken care to extend the power so as to enable himself to sell and transfer ; but it is sc arc ely to be c onc eived why he should make any transfer at all if he intended the son to have neither any present interest in the stoc k, nor any power over it, nor any future benefit of any kind from it. [emphasis added] 

3       1 _Hepworth v Hepworth_ ([29] _supra_ ) appears to be an extreme c ase where the presumption of advanc ement was held to apply. However, to our knowledge it has never been disapproved. _Hepworth v Hepworth_ c ould well be regarded as a c ase where the presumption was applied by reason of parental affec tion or regard of the father for his only surviving son, although this basis does not seem, to our knowledge, to have been followed in subsequent c ases. However, some Canadian c ourts have ac c epted parental love and affec tion as a basis for the applic ation of the presumption: see the disc ussion at [18]–[21] of the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in _Saylor v Madsen Estate_ (2006) 261 DLR (4th) 597. 

32     We should also mention that in the c ase of _Phng Siew Hoon v Phng Siew Lan_ [1991] SGHC 129, the judge did not apply the presumption on the basis of love and affec tion, but instead held that love and affec tion were part of the evidenc e of the father’s intention to make a gift to the daughter. In that c ase, the father was terminally ill and warded in hospital. His other c hildren did not visit him, at least not as often as the defendant, a married daughter who had visited him regularly to c omfort him. On one of these visits at night, the father gave a c heque of $500,000 to her. After his death, the estate c laimed the money on a resulting trust on the ground that the father did not intend the defendant to have the money as he had amply provided for her and that her husband was already supporting her. The defendant, on the other hand, testified that the dec eased had told her that the c heque was meant for her. The judge held that there was ample evidenc e in that c ase that the father had intended to give the proc eeds of the c heque to her. 

33     In our view, the passage we have earlier quoted from para 23-02 of _Snell’s Equity_ ([24] _supra_ ) has summed up the legal position c orrec tly. Some transfers of property from father to son or from husband to wife are more readily inferable as gifts from one party to the other, thereby raising the presumption of advanc ement. For example, if a father were to purc hase a property or open a fixed deposit ac c ount in the name of an infant son who is dependent on him for support, the presumption would apply without more. If, in the c ase of any suc h relationship, the c ourt does not apply the presumption, it would be bec ause there is some c ontemporary evidenc e, either in the form of dec larations made by the father or in the way he deals with the property or the deposit, that shows he intends to retain ownership of the property or the money. This is also established law. The presumption is not absolute and may be rebutted by evidenc e. In our view, the amount of evidenc e required to rebut the presumption would depend on the strength of the presumption, _ie,_ how readily the c ourt would be prepared to make the presumption_._ It would be a rare c ase for the presumption to be rebutted where there is no other evidenc e to show what the intention of the father is when he purc hases property in the name of his son or daughter. However, in a number of rec ent English and 


Singapore dec isions, the c ourts have held that bec ause of c hanged soc ial c onditions, the presumption of advanc ement may be rebutted by very little evidenc e. We will now examine these dec isions in the c ontext of whether the presumption of advanc ement has been rebutted in this c ase. 

**_Current judicial treatment of presumption_** 

34     In the c ourse of c onsidering whether the presumption of advanc ement had been rebutted, the trial judge referred to the c urrent judic ial trend in England and Singapore in treating the presumption of advanc ement with less robustness than in the past, the proc ess having started with _Pettitt v Pettitt_ [1970] AC 777, where the House of Lords showed their disdain for the presumption as an evidentiary tec hnique to resolve disputes relating to title to property between husband and wife. In that c ase _,_ the husband had done work and expended money in improving the matrimonial home whic h was benefic ially owned by the wife. The husband c laimed a share of the property on the ground that there was a c ommon intention that he should have a share in the matrimonial home. The wife argued that the c ourt should apply the presumption of advanc ement to presume that the husband had intended to make her a gift of the value of the work and the money expended on the house. It was in this partic ular c ontext that the House of Lords rejec ted the argument and held that the presumption was not applic able. Lord Reid said (at 793) that: 

 It was argued that the present c ase c ould be dec ided by applying the presumption regarding advanc ement. It was said that if a husband spends money on improving his wife's property, then, in the absenc e of evidenc e to the c ontrary, this must be regarded as a gift to the wife. I do not know how this presumption first arose, but it would seem that the judges who first gave effec t to it must have thought either that husbands so c ommonly intended to make gifts in the c irc umstanc es in whic h the presumption arises that it was proper to assume this where there was no evidenc e, or that wives' ec onomic dependenc e on their husbands made it nec essary as a matter of public polic y to give them this advantage. I c an see no other reasonable basis for the presumption. These c onsiderations have largely lost their forc e under present c onditions, and, unless the law has lost all flexibility so that the c ourts c an no longer adapt it to c hanging c onditions, the strength of the presumption must have been muc h diminished. I do not think that it would be proper to apply it to the c irc umstanc es of the present c ase. 

Three of the other law lords agreed with Lord Reid. It was expressly remarked by Lord Diploc k (at 824) that “[t]he old presumptions of advanc ement and resulting trust are inappropriate to these kinds of transac tions”. In c ontrast, Lord Upjohn was of the opinion (at 813) that the presumptions, “when properly understood and properly applied to the c irc umstanc es of today ... remain[ed] as useful as ever in solving questions of title”. 

35     In _Pettitt v Pettitt_ , the House of Lords were c onc erned with a matrimonial home owned solely by the wife to whic h the husband had made c ontributions in improving it. In suc h a situation, their Lordships felt that it was inappropriate to apply the presumption in modern soc ial c onditions in England where it was normal for a c ouple to work and c ontribute jointly to the purc hase and upkeep of the matrimonial home. Henc e, instead of applying the presumption and then c onsidering the evidenc e to see whether it was rebutted, the c ourts should c onsider whether the c ommon intention of the parties was to give eac h other a share in the property and if so, what they intended the quantum of their respec tive shares in the matrimonial home to be. _Pettitt v Pettitt_ did not involve a c ase of a traditional soc ial setting where the wife was a full-time housekeeper who did not work but instead looked after the husband, c hildren and the home whilst the husband worked and was the sole provider of all the living and financ ial needs of the family. In other words, _Pettitt v Pettitt_ was not c onc erned with a situation where it c ould be said that the husband was in a relationship with the wife (or even a woman) where he was or c ould be c onsidered to be under a moral or equitable obligation 


to support and provide for her. In our view, the observations of the House of Lords in _Pettitt v Pettitt_ should be understood against the fac tual matrix of that c ase and the ec onomic and soc ial c onditions whic h their Lordships c onsidered relevant to the c ase. 

36     The trial judge also referred to a number of dec isions whic h have reiterated the observations of the law lords in _Pettitt v Pettitt_ , suc h as _McGrath v Wallis_ [1995] 2 FLR 114, where the English Court of Appeal said that those observations applied to the situation in that c ase c onc erning a father and son. He also referred to: (a) a Privy Counc il dec ision on appeal from Singapore, _viz_ , _Neo Tai Kim v Foo Stie Wah_ [1985] 1 MLJ 397 (“ _Neo Tai Kim_ ”); and (b) this c ourt’s dec ision in _Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew_ [1999] 4 SLR 560 (“ _Teo Siew Har_ ”) as having followed the judic ial trend in England. These c ases require a c loser examination for a better understanding of what they ac tually dec ided in relation to the presumption of advanc ement, whic h we will now proc eed to do. 

**_Neo Tai Kim v Foo Stie Wah_** 

37     In this c ase, the Privy Counc il had to dec ide the benefic ial ownership of six properties and a business whic h were plac ed in the name of the wife at the instanc e of or with the c onc urrenc e of the husband. The trial judge held that one of the properties purc hased as the matrimonial home and also the business belonged benefic ially to the wife, while the remaining five properties were owned benefic ially by the spouses equally as the purc hase money c ame from a business in whic h they were equally interested. The Court of Appeal reac hed the same c onc lusion. The husband appealed in relation to the matrimonial home and the business c ontending that he was entitled to half of the assets, while the wife c ross-appealed in relation to the five properties arguing that she was entitled to full ownership thereof. An important issue that arose was the status of the presumption of advanc ement under Singapore law. The Privy Counc il held that the presumption of advanc ement was not applic able in determining the ownership of the matrimonial home as there was a c ommon intention, as found by the trial judge, that it was to belong to the wife benefic ially. With regard to the five properties, the Privy Counc il held that in a c ase where both spouses were the providers of the purc hase money, the presumption was no more than a c irc umstanc e of evidenc e to rebut the inferenc e of joint ownership. Lord Brightman, who delivered the judgment of the Privy Counc il, said at 399 of the judgment ([36] _supra_ ): 

 Counsel for the wife plac ed before their Lordships a powerful argument that as the presumption of advanc ement would have applied if the husband had been the sole provider of the purc hase money, there was no logic al reason for reac hing a different c onc lusion bec ause the purc hase money was provided by both spouses. 

 The nature of the presumption of advanc ement is ac c urately stated in Snell’s Princ iples of Equity, 27th Edition, pages 176 et seq , under the distinguished editorship of Sir Robert Megarry VC. “This presumption of advanc ement, as it is c alled, applies to all c ases in whic h the person providing the purc hase-money is under an equitable obligation to support, or make provision for, the person to whom the property is c onveyed. [ e.g. ] where the former is the husband or father of, or stands in loco parentis to, the latter... Ac c ordingly, if a man buys property and has it c onveyed to his wife... prima facie this is a gift to her... However, under modern c onditions, with the reduc tion in the wife’s ec onomic dependenc e on her husband, the forc e of the presumption is muc h weakened...” The qualific ation expressed in the final sentenc e of this quotation reflec ts views whic h had been expressed four years earlier by Lord Diploc k in Pettitt v Pettitt , at page 824. Sir Robert Megarry rightly referred to “this presumption of advanc ement, as it is c alled” bec ause, as Lord Upjohn pointed out in Pettitt v Pettitt at page 814, “it is no more than a c irc umstanc e of evidenc e whic h may rebut the presumption of resulting trust”, i.e. a trust resulting to the husband if he is the provider of the money. In a c ase suc h as the present, where 


 both spouses are the providers of the money, it is no more than a c irc umstanc e of evidenc e whic h may rebut the inferenc e that they are equally interested. 

38     Having referred to the presumption of advanc ement within its historic al c ontext and under modern c onditions, Lord Brightman c ontinued with his opinion on the operation of the presumption in a c ase where the spouses have both c ontributed to the purc hase of the properties (at 400) as follows: 

 In the opinion of their Lordships the presumption of advanc ement is not an immutable rule to be applied blindly where there is no direc t evidenc e as to the c ommon intention of the spouses. It is rather a guideline to be followed by the c ourt in an appropriate c ase when it searc hes for the intention whic h ought, in the absenc e of evidenc e, to be imputed to the parties. It is proper for the trial judge to review the bac kground of the c ase and to dec ide in appropriate c irc umstanc es that the guideline is not one whic h c an sensibly be followed in the c ase before him. In the instant c ase the trial judge had to c onsider the affairs of a Chinese family and the legal effec t of the purc hase of a number of houses out of the funds of businesses in whic h they [the husband and the wife] were equal partners. The trial judge, with his knowledge of loc al c onditions, c onsidered it inappropriate to apply the presumption of advanc ement to suc h a c ase, and so did the Court of Appeal. The view taken by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal in Singapore as to what is appropriate to a c ase c onc erning the loc al Chinese c ommunity ought not to be disturbed by their Lordships. Their Lordships therefore ac c ept, as c orrec t, the opinion of the trial judge and of the Court of Appeal that the c irc umstanc es of the present c ase were not appropriate for the applic ation of the presumption of advanc ement so as to vest the entire benefic ial interest in the five properties in the wife. 

39     It is c lear from this passage that Lord Brightman did not purport to give any views on the prevailing soc ial norms and c onditions that might affec t the operation of the presumption of advanc ement to the fac ts of the c ase. Instead, his Lordship relied entirely on the findings of the Court of Appeal on this point. In this respec t, we should also point out that the Court of Appeal, apart from stating that it had c onsidered _Pettitt v Pettit,_ had also said nothing about this subjec t: s e e _Neo Tai Kim v Foo Stie Wah_ [1980-1981] SLR 215. The Court of Appeal simply held that the presumption was rebutted bec ause the purc hase of the five properties c ame from joint assets. The Privy Counc il agreed with the Court of Appeal. In our view, the Privy Counc il’s observations on the presumption of advanc ement in _Neo Tai Kim_ are relevant to c ases of joint c ontributions by spouses to the purc hase of properties in the name of the wife, whether as the matrimonial home or as investments. 

**_McGrath v Wallis_** 

40     In _McGrath v Wallis_ ([36] _supra_ ) _,_ the father and his adult son were living together in a house whic h the father sold bec ause it was too big for their needs. To move elsewhere, he needed financ ing to buy another property. Bec ause he was unemployed, the building soc iety would not ac c ept him as a sole mortgagor. The property was ac c ordingly purc hased in the names of both the father and the son. The father then arranged with his solic itors to draw up a deed of trust to dec lare that he and his son would hold 80% and 20% of the property respec tively. Although the trust deed was never signed, the father did not tell the solic itors not to proc eed with the dec laration of trust. It was in this c ontext that Nourse LJ held, after referring to _Pettitt v Pettitt_ ([34] _supra_ ) _,_ that the presumption of advanc ement was applic able but that it was also readily rebutted by c omparatively slight evidenc e in the c ase of a father-and-son relationship. In that c ase, the English Court of Appeal held that the presumption of advanc ement was rebutted by three c onsiderations: (a) the father originally wanted to put the house in his own name, but he c ould not get a mortgage from the building soc iety bec ause he was unemployed and henc e, he had to put the name of his son, who qualified for a loan, as the 


mortgagor; (b) the father had wanted the trust deed to be signed, and had not instruc ted the solic itors that it would not be signed; and (c ) there was no other evidenc e that the father had dec ided to divest his interest in the house. 

_Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew_ 

41     In this c ase, the appellant was a full-time housewife. Her husband had purc hased the property in her name and had arranged for it to be financ ed on different oc c asions. She made no monetary c ontributions to the property. Chao Hic k Tin JA, who delivered the judgment of this c ourt, ac c epted the c onc ession by c ounsel for the appellant that the applic ation of the presumption of advanc ement had diminished in rec ent years in line with c hanging soc ial norms. Chao JA referred to the statement of Lord Diploc k in _Pettitt v Pettitt_ ([34] _supra_ ) that it would be an abuse of legal tec hnique to apply to transac tions between the post-war generation of married c ouples presumptions whic h were based upon inferenc es of fac t whic h an earlier generation of judges had drawn as to the most likely intentions of spouses belonging to the propertied c lasses of a different soc ial era. He then referred to _Neo Tai Kim_ and quoted (at [26]) the following passage from the judgment of Lord Brightman: 

 In the opinion of their Lordships the presumption of advanc ement is not an immutable rule to be applied blindly where there is no direc t evidenc e as to the c ommon intention of the spouses. It is rather a guideline to be followed by the c ourt in an appropriate c ase when it searc hes for the intention whic h ought, in the absenc e of evidenc e, to be imputed to the parties. It is proper for the trial judge to review the bac kground of the c ase and to dec ide in appropriate c irc umstanc es that the guideline is not one whic h c an sensibly be followed in the c ase before him. 

After referring also to _McGrath v Wallis_ ([36] _supra_ ) and the dec ision of the British Columbia Supreme Court in _Russell v Russell_ [1975] 4 WWR 517, Chao JA c onc luded thus (at [29]): 

 Thus the c urrent judic ial approac h towards the presumption of advanc ement is to treat it as an evidential instrument of last resort where there is no direc t evidenc e as to the intention of the parties rather than as an oft-applied rule of thumb. [emphasis added] 

42     We should point out that c ounsel for the appellant in _Teo Siew Har_ ([36] _supra_ ) had c onc eded the judic ial trend as expressed in the dec isions referred to. However, he also c ontended that most of the c ases whic h had ac c orded lesser importanc e or usefulness to the presumption of advanc ement were those involving matrimonial proc eedings, and that these judic ial statements had no applic ation to a c laim by a c reditor against the husband and the wife, as was the issue in that c ase. In that c ase _,_ the dispute regarding ownership was not between husband and wife. Counsel for the appellant thus c ontended that where the c ase c onc erned a c reditor of the husband who was seeking to enforc e a judgment against property held in the wife’s name, the presumption would be more easily applied, all the more so in a c ase where the wife was a full-time home maker who had no financ ial means of her own and depended entirely upon her husband, like the appellant. The c ourt rejec ted this submission and held that how the presumption was to be applied did not depend on the nature of the proc eedings, matrimonial or otherwise, and that whether or not the presumption would apply in a partic ular c ase would have to depend instead on the fac ts and c irc umstanc es of the c ase. The c ourt, c iting _Harrods Ltd v Tester_ [1937] 2 All ER 236, did not think that suc h a rule as c ontended for by the appellant c ould be distilled from the c ases. 

43     Given the c onc lusions we have reac hed in this appeal, based on an examination of the relevant rec ent judgments in situations involving properties purc hased by fathers in the names of their c hildren or by husbands in the names of their wives, we are of the view that c ounsel’s argument in 


_Teo Siew Har_ was not without merit. Although the sc enario in _Harrods Ltd v Tester_ was similar to that in _Teo Siew Har_ in that both involved c laims by c reditors, it is apparent from the fac ts of the former c ase that the husband did not intend to make a gift of the money in the bank ac c ount to the wife. There, the husband had opened a bank ac c ount in the name of the wife, who gave a mandate authorising the husband to draw on the ac c ount. All payments into the ac c ount were made by the husband, and the wife would ask for the husband’s c onsent before she drew on the ac c ount. The c reditors of the wife sought to garnish the money in the ac c ount. It was held by the English Court of Appeal in that c ase that the money belonged to the husband and there was a resulting trust in favour of the husband. Consequently, it is diffic ult to see why the dec ision in _Harrods Ltd v Tester_ was c onsidered as a refutation of the argument raised by the appellant’s c ounsel in _Teo Siew Har_. In our view, it is c orrec t to say that the c ases where the presumption of advanc ement was held to have lost its robustness or diminished in importanc e were c ases c onc erning joint c ontributions by married c ouples in ac quiring the matrimonial home or properties ac quired using joint savings. They were not c onc erned with the traditional and well-established c ategories of father–and-c hild and husband-andwife relationships where one party is under a moral or equitable obligation to support the other party. _Teo Siew Har_ was c onc erned with the traditional husband-and-wife relationship where the wife was ec onomic ally dependent on the husband. In fac t, in _Teo Siew Har,_ this c ourt applied the presumption without expressly saying so, but it was also able to c onc lude that the husband had some interest in the property bec ause he had public ly dec lared that the property belonged to him and his wife jointly as he had purc hased it as their matrimonial home. The wife’s appeal was dismissed on the ground that this was suffic ient evidenc e to ground a Mareva injunc tion to prevent her from selling the property and keeping the entire proc eeds of sale. 

44     It is relevant to note that in _Teo Siew Har,_ Chao JA’s statement (at [29]) that the use of the presumption should be a last resort is relevant only in a situation where the c ourt needs to determine t he _intention of both parties._ Cases involving the intention of both parties would normally be those c onc erned with property, suc h as the matrimonial home, where both parties have c ontributed or agreed to c ontribute to the ac quisition and subsequent upkeep of the property. It is obvious that the intention of both parties would not be relevant in the traditional type of relationship where the provision or advanc ement is made unilaterally by the provider. In the traditional relationship of fatherand-c hild or husband-and-wife, where one provides for the other, it is always the intention of the provider alone that is relevant. The presumption of advanc ement has been applied in England in suc h relationships for over two c enturies and justified on the basis of a _moral or equitable obligation_ on the part of one to c are for the other. Suc h moral obligations do not c hange even if soc ial c onditions c hange. Henc e _,_ we find it diffic ult to ac c ept an argument that in modern Singapore, fathers and husbands have somehow c hanged their paternal or marital obligations so radic ally that the presumption is no longer applic able or should not be applied. There is no doubt that many married women in Singapore are financ ially independent of their husbands. But there are also many of them who are not or who c hoose to be housewives in order to look after their husbands, their c hildren and their homes. Infant c hildren will always be financ ially dependent on their fathers and mothers. In our view, in the c ase of suc h relationships, there is no reason to treat the presumption of advanc ement as having lost its robustness or diminished in its vigour, and there is no reason why it should not be applied to resolve questions of title in the absenc e of any evidenc e indic ating otherwise. 

45     It is also c lear from _Neo Tai Kim_ itself that the Privy Counc il did not think so in the traditional type of husband and wife relationship, and father and c hild relationship. We have earlier referred to a passage in the judgment of Lord Brightman where he ac knowledged that c ounsel for the wife had plac ed before their Lordships a “powerful argument” that the presumption of advanc ement would have applied if the husband had been the sole provider of the purc hase money (see [37] above). In this respec t, we agree with the observation of Lord Upjohn in _Pettitt v Pettitt_ ([34] _supra_ at 813) that the presumption remains as useful as ever in solving questions of title. 


**_Was the presumption of advancement in favour of LGB rebutted?_** 

46     For the reasons given in the previous paragraphs, we agree with the trial judge that the presumption of advanc ement was _prima facie_ applic able to Ac c ounts 1 to 6 by virtue of the relationship between LKT and LGB. The issue that remains to be dec ided is whether the trial judge was c orrec t in holding that the presumption was not rebutted by the evidenc e. The trial judge found that the only relevant rebuttal evidenc e was the appellants’ suggestion that LKT, being 84 years old in 1990, needed the assistanc e of LGB to operate his ac c ounts for him, but rejec ted it as insuffic ient. Instead, he found that the $3m that was deposited in Ac c ount 6 was more than suffic ient for LKT’s personal needs, and that “[i]f he had not intended for [LGB] to have the moneys after he died, he would have left instruc tions for their distribution” (see _Low Geok Khim_ ([1] _supra_ ) at [59]). Further, he c onsidered that it was not likely that a Chinese patriarc h like LKT would have intended his sons and daughters to have equal shares and that his distribution of the shares in the family c ompany (see [6] above) reflec ted a more traditional and c onservative outlook. The trial judge ac c ordingly found it more probable than not that when LKT opened Ac c ounts 1 to 6, he intended LGB to have the money upon his death. 

47     In our view, the proper princ iple to apply in relation to rebutting the presumption of advanc ement is that the more readily the presumption may be inferred from the relationship, the greater is the evidenc e needed to rebut it, and c onversely, the less readily the presumption is inferable, the lesser is the evidenc e needed to rebut it. Applying this princ iple, we respec tfully disagree with the trial judge on the c onc lusion to be drawn from the evidenc e. 

48     The trial judge found that the presumption was not rebutted for the following reasons: (a) that if LKT had not intended LGB to have the money in the six joint ac c ounts, he would have left instruc tions for its distribution; and (b) as LKT was a typic al Chinese patriarc h, he was not likely to have intended to give equal shares to his sons and daughters. In our view, both these c onsiderations are inc onsistent with LKT’s c onduc t in dying intestate and leaving another sum of about $7m in his estate to be distributed ac c ording to the law of intestac y. The other fac t whic h was not drawn to the trial judge’s attention was that at the same time that LKT opened Ac c ount 6 in 1990 with the $3m distributed to him from the dissolution of HCKK Realty, LGB had also rec eived his own distribution of about $2.5m. We should ask whether, in these c irc umstanc es, LKT would have intended to give another $3m to LGB. If he had suc h an intention, it would have been easier for him to direc t the liquidators to remit the $3m to LGB direc tly. The fac t that he opened a joint ac c ount with LGB, but made it operative with only one signature, was c learly, in our view, indic ative of an intention to retain full c ontrol of the money in the ac c ount rather than to give it away. It might be argued that the intention was to give it away only upon his death. But, in our view, that is an argument that has no fac tual basis on the evidenc e before us. 

49     It may be rec alled that although LKT brought LGB along with him to open Ac c ount 6 jointly, it was only for that purpose and none other. LGB c andidly admitted under c ross-examination that LKT did not tell him why he was opening a joint ac c ount with him. He also admitted that LKT did not tell him that his intention in opening the joint ac c ounts in 1983 and 1990 was to give the money in the ac c ounts to him upon the death of LKT. LGB said he wished LKT had told him as suc h. LGB’s attitude when c ross-examined seemed to be that he was brought along for no reason other than to open the joint ac c ount. But the evidenc e shows that LKT made sure that only he c ould draw on the joint ac c ount, although he had stipulated that either signature was suffic ient to operate the ac c ount. After Ac c ount 6 was opened, LGB had nothing more to do with it. LKT kept the interest ac c ruing on the deposit and also dec lared it as his own for inc ome tax purposes. The c irc umstanc es relating to the opening of Ac c ount 1 and Ac c ounts 2 to 5 were the same as those for Ac c ount 6. In short, LGB was treated more like a nominee than as a potential benefic iary under the survivorship c lause. 


50     Counsel for LGB c ontended before us that LKT was aware that in opening a joint ac c ount, he was giving away money to the joint signatory. He pointed out that ac c ording to the “Administrator’s Summary” whic h was c irc ulated to the benefic iaries of the Estate on or about 5 July 2002 as a summary of all the information and doc uments pertaining to the joint ac c ounts, LKT had on one oc c asion, in the presenc e of LGB and Geok Beng, asked Geok Beng to sign some bank doc uments to open an ac c ount with him. Geok Beng had then said to LKT: “You sign with Bian”, to whic h LKT then replied in Hokkien, “Ah Beng doesn’t want money”. It was argued that this showed that LKT understood that opening a joint ac c ount with Geok Beng was a way of giving money to him. Henc e, by parity of reasoning, when LKT opened Ac c ount 6, he intended LGB to have the money in it. When c ross-examined on this point, Geok Beng admitted that he did not remember when the c onversation took plac e and what LKT had meant by those words. We note that the trial judge gave no c onsideration to this c onversation. Neither should we, given the absenc e of the c ontext in whic h the c onversation took plac e and when it took plac e. 

51     The princ iples that have been applied to determine whether the presumption of advanc ement has been rebutted have been settled for a long time. We have earlier c ited the statement of Lord Eldon in _Murless v Franklin_ (see [27] above) that “[p]ossession taken by the father at the time would amount to suc h evidenc e” suffic ient to rebut the presumption of advanc ement even in c ases where the father has purc hased property in the name of the c hild, but has retained c ontrol over it. We have also referred to the statement of Lord Langdale MR in _Sidmouth v Sidmouth_ (see [30] above) that “if [the father] had intended, notwithstanding the transfer to the son, to retain the absolute dominion in himself, it is probable he would have taken c are to extend the power so as to enable himself to sell and transfer”_._ This was prec isely what LKT did in the c ase of Ac c ount 6, and later Ac c ounts 2 to 5. He retained absolute dominion, as a fac t, of Ac c ount 6 in himself. LGB was not given the opportunity to operate the ac c ount. LKT kept all the ac c rued interest and retained the power to c lose and/or deal with Ac c ount 6 as he wished, and this was demonstrated by his opening another four joint ac c ounts with money from Ac c ount 6. Even then, he c ould have c losed all the ac c ounts and retaken possession of the money in these ac c ounts without the knowledge and c onsent of LGB. The same c onditions were applic able to Ac c ount 1. The present c ase stands in stark c ontrast to c ases where property, suc h as stoc ks or shares or real estate, are purc hased in the name of the son or jointly with the son, thereby vesting the title in the son immediately and requiring the c onsent of the son if the father wishes to regain title over the property. Here, LKT had full and c omplete dominion over the money in the six joint ac c ounts throughout his life. In our view, this fac t is suffic ient to rebut the presumption that LKT intended for LGB to have the money in the joint ac c ounts upon his death. 

_Position of joint bank accounts_ 

52     An instruc tive illustration of the applic ation of the presumption of advanc ement to joint bank ac c ounts may be seen in the dec ision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in _Saylor v Madsen Estate_ ([31] _supra_ ). The fac ts in that c ase are similar to the fac ts in the present c ase. The father, who died in 1998, had made one of his daughters (“Ms Brooks”) a joint signatory to his bank ac c ounts whic h provided for a right of survivorship. In September 1997, the joint ac c ounts were c losed and the funds deposited into an investment ac c ount, whic h again was a joint ac c ount with Ms Brooks and had a right of survivorship. The issue was whether the father had intended to make a gift of that money to Ms Brooks or whether he intended to remain the benefic ial owner of it. The trial judge was of the view that the joint ac c ount agreement was not determinative of the relationship between the father and Ms Brooks. The evidenc e showed that from 1991, the father was in c ontrol of his financ es and that he c laimed all the interest from the joint ac c ounts for tax purposes. During the father’s lifetime, Ms Brooks did not deposit any of her own money into the ac c ounts and only drew out c heques on her father’s direc tions. As a result, the trial judge found that there was “no evidenc e to support 


[Ms Brook’s] position that [the dec eased] intended to gift the c ontents of his joint ac c ounts to her”. 

53     The Ontario Court of Appeal, in upholding the dec ision, said (at [27]) that bank doc uments c ould be strong evidenc e of a party’s intention at the time the parties signed them, but that they should not be assigned presumptive value when trying to determine a party’s intention. The probative value of suc h doc uments, like any other relevant evidenc e, c ould only be asc ertained after an assessment of the totality of the relevant evidenc e and, as the c ase demonstrated, these doc uments did not always provide ac c urate evidenc e of the parties’ intent. The c ourt then went on to hold (at [40]) that regardless of whether the trial judge had applied the presumption of advanc ement or a resulting trust, the trial judge’s finding that no gift to Ms Brooks was intended was c orrec t. 

**Conclusion** 

54     For the above reasons, we hold that the money in the six joint ac c ounts is held by LGB on a resulting trust for the Estate. The appeal is therefore allowed. As regards the c osts of the appeal and of the trial in the c ourt below, we make the following orders: 

 (a) LGK, the sole administratrix, will be entitled to c osts on an indemnity basis out of the Estate in due c ourse of administration. 

 (b) The appellants will be paid their c osts out of the Estate on a standard basis. 

 (c ) LGB will bear his own c osts. C opyright © Government of Singapore.
