**Introduction** 

1       This was an ac tion by the plaintiff, Giuffrida Luigi (“GL”), against the first defendant, Julius Baer (Singapore) Ltd (“JBS”), a c ompany inc orporated in Singapore, whic h is in members’ voluntary liquidation. GL was seeking an order to reverse the rejec tion by the liquidators of JBS of his proof of debt dated 23 Dec ember 2008 and lodged on 30 Dec ember 2008, and for that proof of debt to be admitted by the liquidators. The sec ond defendant, Bank Julius Baer & Co Ltd (“Bank Julius Baer”), whic h is inc orporated in Switzerland, was added as a party to the ac tion. 

2       In essenc e, GL held an ac c ount with JBS whic h was in c redit. However, JBS said that the ac c ount had been transferred to Bank Julius Baer and that any payment obligation rests with the latter. GL’s position was that he did not c onsent to the transfer and he sought payment from JBS. Bank Julius Baer ac knowledged GL as its c ustomer but there was a Swiss order whic h had attac hed GL’s ac c ount with it. 

**Background** 

3       The details of the bac kground that led to this ac tion is set out in the affidavit of Goh Thien Phong (“Goh”) of Pric ewaterhouse Coopers LLP filed on 13 Marc h 2009. He is one of the liquidators of JBS appointed by a resolution passed at the Extraordinary General Meeting of JBS on 21 May 2008. He stated: 

6\. JBS was formerly known as BDL Banc o Di Lugano (Singapore) Ltd (“BBDL”). It was inc orporated on or about 18 Marc h 2002. At all material times, it was operating as a merc hant bank in Singapore. 

7\. On or about 3 January 2006, the name of BBDL was c hanged to Bank Julius Baer (Singapore)     Ltd (“BJBS”). On or about 29 April 2008, the name of BJBS was c hanged to the present name. For c onvenienc e, I shall hereinafter refer to BBDL/BJBS as JBS. 


8\. The reason stated for the c hange of name from BJBS to JBS was due to the withdrawal of the banking lic enc e by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”). ... 

9\. JBS is the wholly owned subsidiary of Bank Julius Baer. 

10\. On or about 21 May 2008, JBS went into members’ voluntary liquidation. ... 

11\. On or about 30 Dec ember 2008, the Plaintiff’s solic itors, M & A Law Corporation, served on the Liquidators the POD [ _ie_ , GL’s proof of debt]. 

12\. In the POD, the Plaintiff c laimed for the sums of US$3,000,000, Euro 3,000,000 and Swiss     Franc 125,000, being sums deposited into his Bank Ac c ount No. 8500215 Golfc lub (“Ac c ount”) on or about 8 May 2003, together with ac c rued interest. 

13\. I examined the POD. The matters set out below reflec t my findings. 

14\. Annexed hereto and c ollec tively marked as “GTP-1” is a bundle of exhibits whic h are relevant to the present proc eedings. 

_Account_ 

15\. By an Ac c ount Mandate dated 8 May 2003 (“Ac c ount Mandate”) (exhibited at pages 15 to 22 herein), the Plaintiff applied to open the Ac c ount with JBS on the terms and c onditions set out therein. 

16\. On or about 16 May 2003, the Ac c ount was opened. That day, the sums of     US$3,126,400.00 and Euro 3,097,800.00 were deposited into the Ac c ount. On or about 28 May 2003, a sum of Swiss Franc 134,400.00 was deposited into the Ac c ount. Copies of the relevant statements of the Ac c ount dated 30 June 2003 are exhibited at pages 39 to 41 herein. 

17\. By a letter dated 15 Marc h 2007 (“Letter”), JBS and Bank Julius Baer informed the Plaintiff, _inter alia_ , that with effec t from 1 July 2007, all of JBS’s banking undertaking would be transferred to and vested in the Singapore branc h of Bank Julius Baer. 

18\. A c opy of the Letter, together with the English translation, is exhibited at pages 23 to 26 herein. I wish to highlight that the Ac c ount number is stated at the top right c orner of the Letter. 

19\. The Letter further states, _inter alia_ , that: 

 (a) as a result of the transfer, on or about 1 July 2007, the Ac c ount would be transferred to Bank Julius Baer. However, the Ac c ount number would remain the same and Marc o, who is the relationship manager of the Plaintiff, would c ontinue to assist him; 

 (b) with effec t from 1 July 2007: 

 (i) all obligations, rights, titles and interests relating to and under, inter alia , any c redit fac ilities, transac tions, c ontrac ts and any other agreements or arrangements whatsoever (c ollec tively “Agreements”) entered into with or granted to JBS would be assigned and vested in Bank Julius Baer; 


 (ii) JBS would be released and disc harged from further performanc e under the Agreements and all c laims and liabilities thereof; and 

 (iii) Bank Julius Baer would assume further performanc e of all obligations under the Agreements and all c laims and liabilities thereof; 

 (c ) after 1 July 2007, the Plaintiff would c ontinue to be served on the same terms and c onditions on whic h he transac ted with JBS; 

 (d) after the transfer, the operations of JBS would be wound down and c losed, leaving Bank Julius Baer as the sole presenc e of the Julius Baer Group in Singapore; 

 (e) with effec t from 1 July 2007, JBS would be released and disc harged, and the obligations of BJBS under the Ac c ount would be performed by Bank Julius Baer; and 

 (f ) Bank Julius Baer would assume further performanc e of all obligations under the Ac c ount and all c laims and liabilities thereof. 

20\. The Letter also provides that if he was not agreeable to the transfer, the Plaintiff should notify his relationship manager, ie Marc o, in writing by 15 April 2007, after whic h the Ac c ount would be transferred to Bank Julius Baer with effec t from 1 July 2007. 

21\. The Plaintiff failed to notify JBS and/or Marc o of his objec tion to the transfer by 15 April 2007 or at all. 

 Account transferred to Bank Julius Baer 

22\. On or about 1 July 2007, the business and operations of JBS were transferred to the Singapore branc h of Bank Julius Baer. 

23\. As part of the above transfer, the Ac c ount was transferred to Bank Julius Baer. 

24\. When the Ac c ount was transferred from JBS to Bank Julius Baer on or about 1 July 2007, the c redit balanc es in the Ac c ount were also transferred. 

25\. ... 

 JBS’s merchant licence withdrawn in March 2008 

26\. After the transfer, JBS bec ame dormant. On or about 10 Marc h 2008, JBS surrendered its merc hant bank lic enc e to MAS and c eased all merc hant banking ac tivities. 

4       GL’s position was that he did not rec eive the letter dated 15 Marc h 2007 (“Letter”) and that he did not c onsent to the transfer of his ac c ount from JBS to Bank Julius Baer. As mentioned, he wanted the former to be liable to him for his money and not the latter. 

5       It was not disputed that Bank Julius Baer was in a financ ial position to pay GL and had ac c epted him as its c ustomer. However, there were legal proc eedings in Zuric h, Switzerland, c ommenc ed by other parties, as a result of whic h an attac hment order was made against assets of GL inc luding, in partic ular, his ac c ount held with the branc h of Bank Julius Baer in Singapore. Those proc eedings are still c ontinuing but GL’s position was that the attac hment order (even if it was still 


valid) did not apply to JBS, whic h is a separate legal entity. If his ac c ount was still with JBS, as he c ontended, he was seeking payment from the liquidators of JBS. 

**The issues** 

6       There were two main issues before me: 

 (a) whether the defendants c ould rely on c l 11.2 of c ertain terms and c onditions to establish that JBS c ould transfer its obligations to another party even without the c onsent of GL; and 

 (b) whether GL had impliedly c onsented or was estopped from denying the transfer. 

**Clause 11.** 

7       It is undisputed that GL had signed an Ac c ount Mandate Master No 8500215 GOLFCLUB. There was a referenc e in the opening portion of the Ac c ount Mandate in c l 8.2 thereof to “Terms and Conditions”. 

8       The opening portion stated, “This Ac c ount Mandate, the Terms and Conditions, the Servic es Doc uments and the Sec urity Doc uments (where applic able) shall apply to the Ac c ount and the Servic es and shall be binding on the c lient”. 

9       Clause 8.2 of the Ac c ount Mandate stated, _inter alia_ : 

 8.2 ... The Client agrees to be bound by the Terms and Conditions and ac knowledges that it has rec eived a c opy of, read and fully understood the said Terms and Conditions and the Risk Disc losure Statement. 

10     Initially, no set of Terms and Conditions was adduc ed in evidenc e. I was given the impression that there was none. However, on 24 August 2009 at the initial hearing of this ac tion, c ounsel for the defendants said that he had just rec eived a set of the terms and c onditions referred to in the Ac c ount Mandate and produc ed it for c onsideration. In that set, c l 12.2 was relevant as it purported to allow JBS to transfer GL’s ac c ount to another party without the need for GL’s c onsent. Counsel for the defendants asked for and was granted leave to file an affidavit to exhibit that set of the terms and c onditions. The date at the bottom of eac h page thereof was “09-2004”. 

11     The affidavit filed for the defendants to exhibit the terms and c onditions was from Noah Kan Wai Yim, the exec utive direc tor of Bank Julius Baer. However, he exhibited a different set of terms and c onditions with the date “04.2002” printed at the bottom of eac h page and the relevant provision was c l 11.2. Clause 11.2 stated, _inter alia_ : 

 11.2 ... The Bank may assign or otherwise transfer all or any of its rights, interest, powers or obligations under these Terms and Conditions, the Ac c ount Mandate and any Servic es Doc uments or Sec urity Doc uments and any Ac c ount or Servic es or transac tions to whic h they relate and/or the Collateral and may deliver the same to the transferee(s), who shall thereupon bec ome vested with all the rights, interests and powers in respec t thereof whic h were formerly vested in the Bank. ... 

12     It was not in dispute that c l 11.2 was wide enough to allow JBS to transfer GL’s ac c ount to Bank Julius Baer without the c onsent of GL but the question remained as to whether the set of the terms and c onditions exhibited was the set referred to in GL’s Ac c ount Mandate. 


13     Firstly, Counsel for GL pointed out that GL had signed the Ac c ount Mandate and many other banking doc uments but not any set of terms and c onditions. Sec ondly, the set exhibited appeared to c ontain 21 pages bec ause at the bottom of eac h page, there was suc h a referenc e, eg, “Page 6/21”. Yet, there were in fac t 24 pages with, for example, the last two pages referring to “Page 23/21 and Page 24/21”. 

14     Thirdly, the c ontents page indic ated that Produc t Conditions c ould be found at page 12 but was in fac t starting from page 14. 

15     I ac c epted that it was not nec essary for GL to sign the set of terms and c onditions. They c ould have been inc orporated by referenc e. Also, although the disc repanc ies pointed out c ould have been innoc uous if seen in isolation, I took into ac c ount the totality of the c irc umstanc es whic h eventually led to the disc losure of this set of terms and c onditions. As I mentioned earlier, no set of terms and c onditions was disc losed initially. There was no hint from either of the defendants that there were standard terms and c onditions whic h inc luded a term to allow JBS to transfer GL’s ac c ount without the need for his c onsent but that the set had been misplac ed. The burden was on the defendants to persuade the c ourt that the set exhibited was the c orrec t set and, in the c irc umstanc es, I was of the view that it had not disc harged its burden. 

**Did GL impliedly consent or was he estopped from denying the transfer?** 

16     I c ome bac k to the Letter (of 15 Marc h 2007) whic h purportedly informed the ac c ount holder of the matters stated in para 19 of Goh’s affidavit whic h I have referred to. 

17     GL did not dispute the c ontents of the Letter but, as mentioned above, he said that he did not rec eive it. It transpired that this was bec ause he had given instruc tions for mail to be held by JBS. The operation of the “Hold Mail” servic e is governed by c l 3 of the Ac c ount Mandate whic h stated: 

 3.1 The Bank may, if so requested by the Client, and if the Bank in its sole disc retion thinks fit, refrain from dispatc hing by mail or otherwise sending to the Client, any c ommunic ations, notic es, c onfirmations, advic es, statements or any other form of c orrespondenc e (c ollec tively “the Correspondenc e”) relating to the Ac c ount, any of the Servic es and/or any transac tions c arried out by the Client and/or the Authorised Representative but instead plac e the said Correspondenc e in a folder (“Hold Mail folder”) made out in the Client’s name at the Bank for safekeeping (suc h safekeeping servic e being the “Hold Mail Servic e”). Regardless of the nature of any Correspondenc e, the Bank shall not be required to give notic e of the Correspondenc e to the Client or take any other ac tion in relation to the Correspondenc e... 

 3.2 The Client ac knowledges and authorizes the Bank to treat all Correspondenc e plac ed in the Hold Mail Folder as having been duly delivered to and rec eived by the Client. The date of the relevant Correspondenc e shall be deemed to be the date of rec eipt of the same by the Client. 

 3.3 The Client shall at least onc e in every period of twelve (12) months either c ollec t in person or give instruc tions for the c ollec tion or disposal of all Correspondenc e retained in the Hold Mail Folder... 

 3.4 The Client releases the Bank from all responsibility in respec t of the Correspondenc e and waives any c laim whatsoever whic h the Client may at any time have against the Bank arising out of the provision of the Hold Mail Servic e. 

3\. ... 


18     In these c irc umstanc es, I did not think it was open to GL to allege that he did not rec eive the Letter. Under the applic able terms, the Letter was deemed to have been duly delivered to and rec eived by him. He must have known the risks assoc iated with a “Hold Mail” servic e and he voluntarily ac c epted the risk. 

19     The next question then was whether GL ought to have responded to the Letter and the effec t of silenc e. 

20     In my view, the c irc umstanc es were suc h that GL ought to have raised an objec tion if he was not agreeable to the transfer of his ac c ount. A c ustomer should not be permitted to allow the bank to think that it has his c onsent when he c ould so easily have indic ated otherwise. Of c ourse the ideal situation would have been to obtain the written c onsent of eac h and every c ustomer but the reality of the exerc ise was suc h that some might not bother to give the c onsent even though they did not objec t. The exerc ise to transfer all ac c ounts should not have to be halted bec ause of the lac k of written c onsent of every c ustomer but, having said that, the transferor and transferee also take the risk that in other c irc umstanc es, the c ourt may c onc lude that silenc e is not enough to signify c onsent. In _Midlink Development Pte Ltd v Stansfield Group_ <span class="citation">[2004] 4 SLR(R) 258</span> at [51], the c ourt expressed the view that there may be a duty to speak arising from the relationship of the parties. I agreed. In view of the relationship and the Letter, there was a duty on GL to speak out, based on his deemed knowledge, if he wanted to objec t. 

21     However, that was not all. As I mentioned above, there were Swiss proc eedings against GL. Apparently, on 1 July 2008, a Swiss attac hment order was made against GL. Its terms applied to balanc es from ac c ount number 8500215 “whic h is administered at the branc h in Singapore Julius Baer & Co AG (Julius Baer & Co Ltd) 1 George Street, #21-02, 049145 Singapore”. This was not a referenc e to a Singapore c ompany but a branc h of Bank Julius Baer (the sec ond defendant). 

22     GL admitted that he rec eived the Swiss attac hment order on 4 August 2008. He instruc ted Swiss solic itors to assist him to oppose it. The opposition was c ontained in his letter of 7 August 

2008\. Para 5 and the relevant part of para 6 thereof states: 

 5 The offic e of forc ed prosec ution in Zuric h is not c ompetent to exec ute the attac hment. The c reditors name only one ac c ount at the Singapore branc h of the bank Julius Bar Co. AG. If there is a predominant c onnec tion of the c laim with a spec ific branc h the attac hment must be levied at the seat if [ sic ] this branc h ac c ording to Federal c ourt dec isions 107 III 147 et.seq. and 128 III 473 et.seq. The predominant c onnec tion with the branc h in Singapore is stated sinc e there is only one ac c ount named and sinc e I have no relationship with the bank in Zuric h. 

6\. ... 

 The Zuric h authorities and c ourts lac k jurisdic tion to levy attac hment on ac c ounts with the Singapore branc h of Bank Julius Bar Co. AG. Therefore the attac hment must be disc harged. 

23     GL’s solic itor, Dr Alberto Ferrari sought to explain GL’s knowledge or rather, the lac k thereof, in his sec ond affidavit filed on 1 Dec ember 2009 whic h stated at paras 14 to 17 as follows: 

14\. Where a legal entity whic h has its seat in Switzerland holds assets abroad through a foreign branc h, Swiss law deems suc h assets to be situated within the jurisdic tion and may entertain an applic ation for an order to prevent their dissipation. However, this is not the c ase where suc h foreign branc h is in fac t an independent legal entity under the law where it is inc orporated. Here, the separate foreign legal personality of the entity must be respec ted. There 


 is no basis for a worldwide freezing order under Swiss law. 

15\. Henc e at the time, the c lient made the preliminary c hallenge on the Attac hment Order as against the Ac c ount that was held in the name of “Bank Julius Baer Co AG” as it was understood that “Bank Julius Baer Co AG” was a c ompany inc orporated in Singapore. It was presumed that this entity was the original entity the c lient c ontrac ted with, namely “BDL Banc o di Lugano (Singapore) Ltd” whic h subsequently c hanged its name to “Bank Julius Baer (Singapore) Ltd”. 

16\. As it has now been unc overed, “Bank Julius Baer Co AG” is in fac t a foreign branc h that does not have an independent legal personality. However, this does not detrac t from the “knowledge” or belief of the c lient at the material time. 

17\. I have also been asked to explain the use of the word “branc h” as shown in the English translation of the letter of 7 August 2008 as well as in the Attac hment Order and whether that shows that the c lient must have knowledge that the entity “Julius Baer Co AG” was a separate c ompany from “Bank Julius Baer (Singapore) Limited”. As explained above however, the use of the word “branc h” will not nec essarily explain whether the “branc h” is an independent legal entity to the princ ipal and is separately inc orporated in the foreign jurisdic tion or whether it has no separate personality to its princ ipal. The question of the “branc h”’s personality depends on the law of the jurisdic tion in whic h it is registered or inc orporated. 

24     It seemed to me that whether a branc h of Bank Julius Baer was a separate entity from the princ ipal or not, the point was that it must have been c lear to GL and his solic itor in early August 2008 that his ac c ount was no longer being held by a Singapore c ompany but by a branc h of Bank Julius Baer. This must have been all the more important to GL if, as he had asserted, he wanted to “transac t with a Singapore inc orporated entity under the laws of Singapore” (see para 5 of GL’s first affidavit filed on 18 February 2009). Yet, there was no protest from him in August 2008 that the ac c ount had been transferred. 

25     On the c ontrary, on 12 September 2008, GL and a solic itor from Rajah & Tann LLP (his Singapore solic itors) went to the offic e of the sec ond defendant in Singapore to withdraw money held in the ac c ount. GL was unsuc c essful. An affidavit from Thong Chee Kun (“Thong”) of Rajah & Tann LLP was filed on 1 Dec ember 2009. He said at paras 3 to 7 as follows: 

3\. I attended with the c lient at the Julius Baer offic es at 1 George Street, #21-04, Singapore 049145 on or about 12 September 2008. We were attended by one Mr Marc o Diana and one     Mr Vic tor Sim (Complianc e & Legal). I informed Mr Vic tor Sim that we wish to c hec k on the status of the ac c ount and obtain a statement, sinc e the Order under sec tion 68 of the Criminal     Proc edure Code (Cap. 68) had been lifted by the Corrupt Prac tic es Investigating Bureau of Singapore (“CPIB”). 

4\. An ac c ount statement was furnished to the c lient but Mr Vic tor Sim said that the ac c ount remains frozen, as direc ted by the bank in Lugano (Switzerland). I informed him that there was no legal basis for them to freeze the ac c ount in Singapore as the said Order was lifted. 

5\. Mr Vic tor Sim said that he c ould not do anything as direc tions c ame from the bank in Lugano (Switzerland). I replied that we may have to c hallenge this and raise the issue to the Monetary     Authority of Singapore (the c entral bank of Singapore), if nec essary, as the bank in Singapore was subjec t to loc al regulations and rules. He apologized again and said that there was nothing he c ould do without direc tions from Switzerland. 


6\. The Plaintiff then asked whether he c ould make spec ific requests to withdraw c ertain sums for spec ific purposes suc h as paying for his legal fees. I added that any suc h withdrawals would be small c ompared to the amount in the bank ac c ount. Mr Vic tor Sim said that he would c hec k on this matter. 

7\. Mr Vic tor Sim also provided me with the c ontac t details of his c ounterpart in Lugano (Switzerland) who told him to freeze the ac c ount. I was informed that his name is Mr Carlo Broc hetta and was given his telephone number and email address. 

26     I should mention that although a Swiss c ourt had lifted the attac hment order, there was apparently an appeal against the lifting order whic h is still in progress in Switzerland. 

27     Ac c ording to GL, it was only when he rec eived the statement of ac c ount on 12 September 2008 that he realised that the ac c ount was held by “Bank Julius Baer & Co Ltd” but this name was similar to the name “Bank Julius Baer (Singapore) Ltd”. He had thought that it was the same entity. However, there is a statement at the bottom of eac h page of the statement stipulating that Bank Julius Baer is “Inc orporated in Switzerland”. 

28     Notwithstanding his knowledge of the terms of the Swiss attac hment order and also of this statement of ac c ount, GL had proc eeded to ask for withdrawal of funds but his request was not ac c eded to. 

29     In the c irc umstanc es, I was of the view that GL was estopped from denying that his ac c ount had been validly transferred to and held by Bank Julius Baer. I reac hed this view even if he did not notic e the referenc e to the plac e of inc orporation in the statement of ac c ount bec ause, in my view, he nevertheless had the knowledge from the Swiss attac hment order. 

30     Counsel for GL submitted that GL did not, by his request to withdraw money, ac knowledge the relationship with Bank Julius Baer but that he was merely seeking to terminate that relationship. However, Thong’s affidavit showed that GL was seeking to withdraw part, not all, of the money for spec ific purposes. 

31     However, one other point was raised for GL. He said that he had thought all along that his ac c ount was still being held by JBS bec ause of c ertain proc eedings in Singapore and it was only in early November 2008 that he learned otherwise. By then, his Swiss solic itors informed him that they had rec eived papers from the Swiss c ourt whic h showed that the ac c ount had been transferred from JBS to Bank Julius Baer. Around the same time, his Singapore solic itors also advised that the two were different entities. 

32     Some two years earlier, on 7 September 2006, the Corrupt Prac tic es Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) in Singapore had sent a letter to “Bank Julius Baer (Singapore) Ltd” to seize GL’s ac c ount under s 68 of the Criminal Proc edure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed). GL then sought to c hallenge the seizure order by filing Originating Summons No 1036 of 2008 on 6 August 2008 to ask for leave to apply for a judic ial review of the seizure order. Eventually, CPIB agreed to lift the seizure order whic h was done on 8 September 2008. 

33     Ac c ording to GL, he had believed up till then that his ac c ount was with “Bank Julius Baer (Singapore) Ltd” as the seizure order was addressed to it and had not been varied. Even his applic ation was made on that basis. 

34     I noted that the Singapore seizure order prec eded the Swiss attac hment order. In my view, 


when GL rec eived the Swiss attac hment order, he and his solic itors must have realised that the ac c ount was no longer held by a Singapore c ompany but, apparently, it did not matter to them then. The applic ation for judic ial review in Singapore would have been made on the basis of the earlier seizure order but that did not take into ac c ount the information disc losed by the Swiss attac hment order. 

35     In my view, the CPIB proc eedings did not show that by early August 2008, GL still had no knowledge that his ac c ount was being held by a different entity. 

36     In the c irc umstanc es, I dismissed GL’s ac tion with half of the c osts to be paid by him to be agreed or taxed.
