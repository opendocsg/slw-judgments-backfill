**Introduction** 

1       As fittingly observed by the Court of Appeal in _Re Beloff Michael Jacob QC_ <span class="citation">[2014] 3 SLR 424</span> (“ _Re Beloff_ ”) at [42], the suitability of _ad hoc_ admissions under the new statutory framework pursuant to the Legal Profession (Amendment) Ac t 2012 (Ac t 3 of 2012) (“the 2012 Amendment”) is now to be viewed through the prism of “need”. While it is true that it is no longer nec essary to show that the issues in the c ase are of “suffic ient diffic ulty and c omplexity”, whic h was a requirement under s 21 of the Legal Profession Ac t (Cap 161, 1990 Rev Ed), the c orrec t c harac terisation of the issues before the c ourt c ontinues to play a vital role in the admission applic ation. After all, the requirement of “need” must nec essarily be examined with referenc e to the issues as that will, in turn, have a direc t bearing on the size of the pool of available loc al c ounsel to address those issues and, c orrespondingly, the need for foreign c ounsel’s assistanc e. 

2       Sinc e the introduc tion of the 2012 Amendment, effec tively only one applic ation has been allowed – _Re Andrews Geraldine Mary QC_ <span class="citation">[2013] 1 SLR 872</span> (“ _Re Andrews_ ”). I should mention that when Ms Geraldine Andrews QC was elevated to the English Benc h after the c onc lusion of the trial she was admitted to argue, Mr Ric hard Millet QC was admitted in her plac e to argue the appeal. His applic ation was largely unc ontested as Ms Geraldine Andrews QC’s admission was for the trial of the ac tion _and_ any appeal therefrom. There have been five other applic ations, whic h were not allowed for a variety of reasons: see _Re Caplan Jonathan Michael QC_ <span class="citation">[2013] 3 SLR 66</span> (“ _Re Caplan_ ”), _Re Lord Goldsmith Peter Henry PC QC_ <span class="citation">[2013] 4 SLR 921</span> (“ _Re Lord Goldsmith”), Re Beloff_ , _Re Fordham, Michael QC_ <span class="citation">[2015] 1 SLR 272</span> (“ _Re Fordham_ ”) and _Re Rogers, Heather QC_ <span class="citation">[2015] 4 SLR 1064</span> (“ _Re Rogers_ ”). These applic ations were disallowed bec ause the “spec ial reason” requirement for the ring-fenc ed areas of legal prac tic e under s 15(2) of the Legal Profession Ac t (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“LPA”) was not satisfied ( _Re Caplan_ , _Re Lord Goldsmith_ , and _Re Fordham_ ), bec ause the issues were “uniquely loc al” ( _Re Rogers_ ), and bec ause the issues were “well within the range of c ompetent Singapore c ounsel” (see _Re Beloff_ at [80]). 


3       The present applic ation is for Mr Samuel Sherratt Wordsworth QC to be admitted to represent the Kingdom of Lesotho (“Lesotho”) in Originating Summons No 492 of 2016 (“OS 492”), whic h is Lesotho’s applic ation to set aside a Partial Award on Jurisdic tion and the Merits dated 18 April 2016 (the “Award”) arising from an investor-state arbitration. Mr Wordsworth was the lead c ounsel for Lesotho in the arbitration. Apart from the fac t that the seat of the arbitration was Singapore, there is nothing “loc al” about this c ase at all. All the parties are resident outside jurisdic tion. It c onc erned alleged breac hes of international obligations and events whic h oc c urred in Lesotho. Fundamentally, the origin of the dispute c an partly be trac ed to a multilateral treaty involving 15 States of the Southern Afric an Development Community (“SADC”). It is also c ommon ground that the legal issues whic h will be fully ventilated in OS 492 are predominantly governed by princ iples of public international law, whic h is not a ring-fenc ed area of legal prac tic e requiring “spec ial reason” to be shown before Mr Wordsworth c an be admitted (s 15(2) of the LPA). 

4       Typic ally, the question of nec essity is viewed from the perspec tive of the litigant seeking the admission. However, there is nothing in the 2012 Amendment to limit the c ourt’s assessment of nec essity only with referenc e to the needs of that party. This dec ision will examine the extent to whic h the question of nec essity should _also_ be examined from the perspec tive of the c ourt and if so, how this c onsideration would feature under the new statutory framework. It is unc ontroversial that the setting-aside applic ation in OS 492 is unique in many aspec ts. The c ourt’s eventual dec ision on the merits of the setting-aside applic ation will undoubtedly have a bearing on the jurisprudenc e in an emerging area of public international law. It is therefore essential for the c ourt to rec eive profic ient assistanc e from lawyers with partic ular expertise in this area of the law. Would this c onsideration fall within the rubric of the ultimate question, namely “whether having regard to all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, it is reasonable to admit the foreign c ounsel” (see _Re Beloff_ at [53])? 

**Background** 

5       The arbitration c onc erned the alleged expropriation by Lesotho of mining leases granted to and held by the defendants in OS 492, who were the c laimants in the arbitration. They are: (a) Swissborough Diamond Mines (Pty) Limited, (b) Mr Josias Van Zyl, (c ) The Josias Van Zyl Family Trust, (d) The Burmilla Trust, (e) Matsoku Diamonds (Pty) Limited, (f ) Motete Diamonds (Pty) Limited, (g) Orange Diamonds (Pty) Limited, (h) Patiseng Diamonds (Pty) Ltd, and (i) Rampai Diamonds (Pty) Limited (referred to c ollec tively as “the defendants”). The 1st defendant is a c ompany registered under the laws of Lesotho. The 2nd defendant is a South Afric an national who inc orporated the 1st defendant and is one of its shareholders. The 3rd and 4th defendants are trusts established under the laws of South Afric a; they are alleged to hold the remaining shares in the 1st defendant. The 5th to 9th defendants are c ompanies inc orporated under the laws of Lesotho who were the original lic ensees 

of the mining leases. [note: 1] 

**_The SADC Treaties_** 

6       As mentioned, this c ase has a signific ant public international law dimension to it. In addressing the defendants’ c laims, the arbitral tribunal had to c onsider and interpret the following three treaties or international instruments: 

 (a) The Treaty of the Southern Afric an Development Community, Windhoek, 17 August 1992 (in forc e 30 September 1993) (“SADC Treaty”); 

 (b) The Protoc ol on the Tribunal in the Southern Afric an Development Community, Windhoek, 7 August 2000 (in forc e 14 August 2001) (“SADC Tribunal Protoc ol”); and 


 (c ) The Protoc ol on Financ e and Investment, Maseru, 18 August 2006 (in forc e 16 April 2010) (“SADC Investment Protoc ol”). 

7       The SADC Treaty is a multilateral treaty to whic h 15 member states, inc luding Lesotho, are 

parties to. [note: 2] It established the SADC, an international organization with separate personality under international law. 

8       Artic le 9 of the SADC Treaty provides for the establishment of a tribunal (“SADC Tribunal”) to adjudic ate on disputes whic h may be referred to it. Artic le 10 of the SADC Treaty provides for the establishment of a Summit of Heads of State or Government of all member states (“SADC Summit”) as 

the supreme polic y-making organ of the SADC. [note: 3] The SADC Tribunal c ame into being on 14 August 2001 with the inc orporation of the SADC Tribunal Protoc ol as part of the SADC Treaty. The SADC Tribunal Protoc ol established, among other things, the c omposition, powers, func tions, jurisdic tion, and proc edures of the SADC Tribunal. 

9       The SADC Investment Protoc ol entered into forc e on 16 April 2010. In the arbitration, the defendants invoked Artic le 28 to Annex 1 of the SADC Investment Protoc ol as the provision on whic h the jurisdic tion of the arbitral tribunal was founded. So far as is relevant, Artic le 28 states: 

1\. Disputes between an investor and a State Party c onc erning an obligation of the latter in relation to an admitted investment of the former, whic h have not been amic ably settled, and after exhausting loc al remedies shall, after a period of six (6) months from written notific ation of a c laim, be submitted to international arbitration if either party to the dispute so wishes. 

 ... 

4\. The provisions of this Artic le shall not apply to a dispute, whic h arose before entry into forc e of this Annex. 

10     The words “investor” and “investment” are defined in Artic le 1(2) of Annex 1 of the SADC 

Investment Protoc ol: [note: 4] 

 (a) The word “investor” means “a person that has been admitted to make or has made an investment”; 

 (b) The word “investment” means “the purc hase, ac quisition or establishment of produc tive and portfolio investment assets” and inc ludes “shares, stoc ks and debentures of c ompanies or interest in the property of suc h c ompanies” and “rights c onferred by law or under c ontrac t, inc luding lic enc es to searc h for, c ultivate, extrac t or exploit natural resourc es”. 

**_The defendants’ claims_** 

11     The fac tual narrative out of whic h the arbitration arose spanned a period of nearly 25 years. It began with the 1st defendant being granted mining leases in respec t of five areas in Lesotho 

sometime in 1988. [note: 5] Between 1989 and 1990 the 1st defendant entered into lic ensing agreements with the 5th to 9th defendants by whic h eac h of the five c ompanies would hold and 

exerc ise the rights to one of the five areas c overed by the mining leases. [note: 6] Sometime in the middle of 1991, disputes emerged over the validity of the mining leases and the measures taken by Lesotho whic h purported to c anc el them. This led to a further dispute over whether the 1st and 5th to 9th defendants were entitled to c ompensation from Lesotho. The dispute over Lesotho’s purported 


interferenc e with the defendants’ mining leases led to protrac ted litigation between the defendants 

and Lesotho or its governmental agenc ies from 1991 to 2000. [note: 7] The defendants c ommenc ed proc eedings in the Lesotho High Court to rec over damages for Lesotho’s expropriation of the five mining leases. However, in separate proc eedings, the Lesotho High Court made a dec laration that the lease held through the 9th defendant was void _ab initio_. That dec ision was upheld on appeal on 6 Oc tober 2000, after whic h the defendants did not c ontinue to pursue any of the c laims for 

c ompensation that they had started in the c ourts of Lesotho. [note: 8] 

12     The defendants then took their c laims to the SADC Tribunal. On 12 June 2009, the defendants instituted proc eedings against Lesotho before the SADC Tribunal c laiming c ompensation for the 

alleged expropriation by Lesotho of the mining leases. [note: 9] They alleged that Lesotho had breac hed a number of provisions in the SADC Treaty as well as its obligations under international law 

and as a member state of the SADC. [note: 10] 

13     The proc eedings before the SADC Tribunal c ame to a halt when the SADC Summit unanimously resolved not to renew the terms of offic e of five judges of the SADC Tribunal, whose terms were to expire in Oc tober 2010. This dec ision not to renew the terms of offic e was initiated by the Republic of Zimbabwe as a result of separate proc eedings before the SADC Tribunal unrelated to the defendants’ 

c laims. [note: 11] The SADC Tribunal thus bec ame inquorate and c eased to func tion from Oc tober 

2010\. It was then dissolved by the SADC Summit in August 2012, as a result of whic h it was, and remains, unable to hear the defendants’ c laims. Although a new protoc ol governing the func tioning of the SADC Tribunal was adopted by the SADC Summit on 19 August 2014, it had not c ome into forc e 

as at the date of the Award. [note: 12] 

**_The arbitration_** 

14     On 20 June 2012, the defendants served a Notic e of Arbitration on Lesotho pursuant to Artic le 

28(1) of Annex 1 to the SADC Investment Protoc ol. [note: 13] The hearing of the arbitration took plac e 

in August 2015 in Singapore. [note: 14] The defendants sought the following reliefs from the arbitral 

tribunal in the first phase of the proc eedings: [note: 15] 

 (a) A dec laration that it had jurisdic tion to dec ide the dispute submitted by the defendants; 

 (b) A dec laration that Lesotho had violated its obligations under the SADC Tribunal Protoc ol, the SADC Investment Protoc ol and the SADC Treaty; 

 (c ) A dec laration that it would award suc h relief and c ompensation to the defendants as c ould have been granted by the SADC Tribunal; and 

 (d) An award in the defendants’ favour of the c osts inc urred in c onnec tion with the arbitration proc eedings. 

The defendants also requested that the tribunal issue an award at the c onc lusion of the sec ond phase of the proc eedings awarding suc h relief and c ompensation that c ould have been granted by the SADC Tribunal, along with interest on the sums awarded and c osts. 

15     Lesotho c hallenged the jurisdic tion of the arbitral tribunal and requested that it dismiss the defendants’ c laims with c osts. 


**_The Award_** 

16     On 18 April 2016, the arbitral tribunal, by a majority of 2-1, rendered the Award. In the Award, 

the arbitral tribunal: [note: 16] 

 (a) Held that it had jurisdic tion to hear and determine the c laims of the 2nd to 4th defendants, but not of the 1st and 5th to 9th defendants, whose c laims were ac c ordingly dismissed; 

 (b) Determined that, as against the 2nd to 4th defendants, Lesotho had breac hed its obligations in the SADC Treaty, the SADC Investment Protoc ol and the SADC Tribunal Protoc ol; 

 (c ) Ordered the parties to establish a new tribunal to hear and determine the defendants’ part-heard c laims whic h had been pending before the SADC Tribunal; and 

 (d) Ordered that Lesotho pay the defendants’ c osts of the arbitration (“the c osts dec ision”). 

The dissenting arbitrator issued a separate opinion to explain why he did not agree with the majority as regards its finding that the arbitral tribunal had jurisdic tion over the defendants’ c laims. 

17     The arbitral tribunal rec ently issued an interpretation award dated 27 June 2016 in whic h it stated that the 1st and 5th to 9th defendants are not prec luded from applying to partic ipate in the 

arbitration of the part-heard c laims before the new tribunal. [note: 17] 

18     To apprec iate Lesotho’s arguments in OS 492, it will be useful to outline the different views taken by the majority and the dissenting arbitrator. The differenc es in views will have a bearing on the question of nec essity in having Mr Wordsworth argue the jurisdic tional c hallenge. 

19     The majority of the arbitral tribunal, _inter alia_ , reac hed the following c onc lusions in arriving at its ruling on jurisdic tion: 

 (a) The defendants had an “investment” within the meaning of Artic le 1(2) of the SADC Investment Protoc ol. The investment c omprised the shares in the 1st and 5th to 9th defendants, the mining leases and the rights arising thereunder, and the money, effort and resourc es expended to pursue the exploitation of the mining leases. [note: 18] The defendants’ investment survived the termination of the mining leases bec ause the right to bring a c laim arising from an investment was a nec essary and integral part of the “investment” to be protec ted under international law. [note: 19] 

 (b) Not all the defendants were “investors” within the meaning of Artic le 1(2) of Annex 1 of the SADC Investment Protoc ol. The 1st and 5th to 9th defendants were not investors, and henc e, not proper parties to pursue the c laim against Lesotho, bec ause they had assigned their rights before the c urrent dispute arose. The 2nd to 4th defendants were “investors” by virtue of their ownership of shares and indirec t ownership of the mining leases, and henc e, the proper parties to pursue the c laim. [note: 20] 

 (c ) The investment arising out of the mining leases was an “admitted investment” within the meaning of Artic le 28(1) of Annex 1 of the SADC Investment Protoc ol. The tribunal noted that it was the investment c reated through the mining leases that needed to be “admitted” by Lesotho; the c laim for c ompensation, as an integral part of the underlying investment, did not need to be 


 separately admitted. There was no formal admission proc edure in this c ase. However, the tribunal was satisfied, based on Lesotho’s c onduc t over the years in relation to the mining leases, that it had c onfirmed, authorised and ac c epted the investment, and that the investment arising out of the mining leases and related shares were therefore an “admitted investment”. [note: 21] 

 (d) The SADC Investment Protoc ol would apply to the defendants’ “admitted investment” provided that there was a dispute between the defendants and Lesotho after the Protoc ol entered into forc e. The tribunal was not persuaded by Lesotho’s argument that applying the SADC Investment Protoc ol to existing investments at the time it entered into forc e would result in a retroac tive applic ation of its provisions c ontrary to Artic le 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (23 May 1969), 1155 UNTS 331 (entered into forc e 27 January 1980). [note: 22] 

 (e) There was a dispute between an “Investor” and a “State Party” in relation to an admitted investment. The dispute here was over the defendants’ sec ondary right to seek relief from the SADC Tribunal. Although the wrongful interferenc e with that right was the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal, whic h was an ac t of an international organisation, the tribunal found that the dispute still related to a “State Party” (Lesotho) sinc e the ac ts of interferenc e were undertaken partly in an international organisation and partly in Lesotho’s own separate dec isions. [note: 23] 

 (f ) The tribunal had jurisdic tion to determine whether the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal violated either the SADC Treaty and SADC Investment Protoc ol or international law sinc e this dispute arose after the Investment Protoc ol c ame into forc e; it would not have jurisdic tion to dec ide the underlying dispute, whic h oc c urred before the SADC Investment Protoc ol bec ame effec tive. [note: 24] 

 (g) Sinc e the tribunal defined the relevant “dispute” as being the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal, the primary remedy available to c orrec t the alleged wrong would have been the reestablishment of an international tribunal to hear the part-heard c laims, whic h is not a remedy the domestic c ourts of Lesotho were empowered to grant. Therefore there was no loc al remedy to be exhausted and suc h a requirement c ould not pose a barrier to the establishment of jurisdic tion over the dispute. [note: 25] 

20     The dissenting arbitrator essentially rejec ted the defendants’ attempt to re-c harac terise the relevant “dispute” as being the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal, rather than the expropriation of the mining leases, whic h the defendants had c onc eded would not fall within Artic le 28(1) of Annex 1 to the Investment Protoc ol. The dissenting arbitrator arrived at a c ontrary view based on the following premises: 

 (a) The shuttering of the SADC Tribunal was not a free-floating wrong but an essential c omponent of the underlying c ause of ac tion for the expropriation of mining leases. That expropriation oc c urred before the SADC Investment Protoc ol entered into forc e. Ac c ordingly, the arbitral tribunal had no jurisdic tion over any of the defendants’ c laims under Artic le 28(4) of Annex 1 to the SADC Investment Protoc ol. [note: 26] 

 (b) Even if the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal was a disc rete c ause of ac tion, the resolution of the SADC Summit to shut down the SADC Tribunal was not c onc erned with any aspec t of the defendants’ investment at all – it was not a dispute c onc erning Lesotho’s obligation in relation to any spec ific investment, but a dispute c onc erning the legality of the SADC’s polic y dec ision. Henc e, the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal was not a dispute “c onc erning an obligation of [Lesotho] in relation to an admitted investment of [the defendants]” within the meaning of Artic le 


 28(1) of Annex 1 to the SADC Investment Protoc ol, with the result that the arbitral tribunal would still lac k jurisdic tion over the dispute. [note: 27] 

 (c ) The tribunal also lac ked jurisdic tion bec ause the c ondition prec edent requiring the exhaustion of loc al remedies in Artic le 28(1) of Annex 1 to the SADC Investment Protoc ol had not been satisfied. The relevant breac h was the expropriation of the mining leases, and not the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal, as the majority had found. The defendants had not exhausted loc al remedies in Lesotho in respec t of the expropriation. [note: 28] 

**_Lesotho’s application to set aside the Award_** 

21     In OS 492, Lesotho seeks an order that the Award be reversed and/or wholly set aside on the basis that the tribunal did not have jurisdic tion to hear the dispute. It relies, in this regard, on s 10(3) of the International Arbitration Ac t (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”) and, in the alternative, on s 3(1) of the IAA read with Artic le 34(2)( _a_ )(iii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commerc ial Arbitration set out in the First Sc hedule of the IAA. 

22     Lesotho also seeks to set aside the c osts dec ision in the Award for lac k of due proc ess, but it is unnec essary to say more about this for present purposes as the arguments before me foc used princ ipally on whether Mr Wordsworth should be admitted to argue the c hallenge to the tribunal’s jurisdic tion. Counsel for the applic ant readily ac c epted that the due proc ess c hallenge is fairly straightforward and that if it were the only issue in OS 492, Mr Wordsworth’s applic ation would not pass muster. However, if Mr Wordsworth is admitted to argue the jurisdic tional c hallenge, it would then be eminently sensible and expedient for him to address the c osts dec ision as well. 

23     Lesotho argues that the tribunal did not have any jurisdic tion over the defendants’ c laims for nine reasons: 

 (a) First, Annex 1 of the SADC Investment Protoc ol does not apply to investments whic h were already in existenc e at the time of its entry into forc e. 

 (b) Sec ond, the defendants’ supposed right to bring the mining lease c laims in the proc eedings before the SADC Tribunal does not c onstitute a distinc t “investment” within the meaning of Artic le 1(2) of Annex 1 to the SADC Investment Protoc ol. 

 (c ) Third, the defendants’ mining leases c laims in the proc eedings before the SADC Tribunal, and their ability to bring those c laims before the SADC Tribunal, were not “admitted” as an investment within the meaning of Artic le 28(1) of Annex 1 to the SADC Investment Protoc ol. 

 (d) Fourth, the dispute before the tribunal was substantially the same as the one before the SADC Tribunal in 2009. The dispute therefore arose before the SADC Investment Protoc ol entered into forc e and is exc luded from the tribunal’s jurisdic tion by virtue of Artic le 28(4) of Annex 1. 

 (e) Fifth, the tribunal’s jurisdic tion under Artic le 28(1) of Annex 1 to the SADC Investment Protoc ol was limited to c laims of breac hes by Lesotho of obligations deriving from the SADC Investment Protoc ol only. Claims whic h were premised on obligations in the SADC Treaty or SADC Tribunal Protoc ol did not give rise to disputes “c onc erning an obligation” of Lesotho “in relation to an admitted investment” of the defendants within the meaning of Artic le 28(1) of Annex 1 to the SADC Investment Protoc ol. 

 (f ) Sixth, none of the obligations found to have been breac hed by the tribunal stand “in 


 relation to an admitted investment” of the defendants. 

 (g) Seventh, the tribunal’s jurisdic tion under Artic le 28(1) of Annex 1 over alleged breac hes of obligations was limited to ac tions taken by Lesotho within its territory, and did not extend to Lesotho’s partic ipation in the SADC Summit resolution to shutter the SADC Tribunal. 

 (h) Eighth, the defendants failed to exhaust loc al remedies before the c ourts of Lesotho prior to bringing their c laim before the arbitral tribunal, as required by Artic le 28(1) of Annex 1 to the SADC Investment Protoc ol. The tribunal found that the relevant breac h of Lesotho was the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal for whic h no loc al remedies were available. 

 (i) Ninth, the 1st and 5th to 9th defendants did not qualify as “investors” as defined in Artic le 1(2) of the SADC Investment Protoc ol. Although the tribunal already found that it had no jurisdic tion over the c laims of these six defendants, Lesotho argues that the tribunal exc eeded its jurisdic tion to the extent that it ordered a new tribunal to be established to hear the c laims of all the defendants whic h had been pending before the SADC Tribunal. [note: 29] 

**The present application** 

**_Overview of the admissions regime_** 

24     _Ad hoc_ admissions of foreign c ounsel are governed by s 15 of the LPA, the relevant portions of whic h are as follows: 

 Ad hoc admissions 

**15.** —(1) Notwithstanding anything to the c ontrary in this Ac t, the c ourt may, for the purpose of any one c ase, admit to prac tise as an advoc ate and solic itor any person who — 

 ( a ) holds — 

 (i) Her Majesty’s Patent as Queen’s Counsel; or 

 (ii) any appointment of equivalent distinc tion of any jurisdic tion; 

 ( b ) does not ordinarily reside in Singapore or Malaysia, but has c ome or intends to c ome to Singapore for the purpose of appearing in the c ase; and 

 ( c ) has spec ial qualific ations or experienc e for the purpose of the c ase. 

 (2) The c ourt shall not admit a person under this sec tion in any c ase involving any area of legal prac tic e presc ribed under sec tion 10 for the purposes of this subsec tion, unless the c ourt is satisfied that there is a spec ial reason to do so. 

 ... 

 (6A) The Chief Justic e may, after c onsulting the Judges of the Supreme Court, by notific ation published in the Gazette, spec ify the matters that the c ourt may c onsider when dec iding whether to admit a person under this sec tion. 

25     Sec tion 15(6A) is to be read with Paragraph 3 of the Legal Profession (Ad Hoc Admissions) 


Notific ation 2012 (S 132/2012), whic h spec ifies four matters (“Notific ation matters”) the c ourt may c onsider when dec iding whether to admit an applic ant under s 15 of the LPA: 

 Matters specified under section 15(6A) of Act 

 3. For the purposes of sec tion 15(6A) of the Ac t, the c ourt may c onsider the following matters, in addition to the matters spec ified in sec tion 15(1) and (2) of the Ac t, when dec iding whether to admit a person under sec tion 15 of the Ac t for the purpose of any one c ase: 

 ( a ) the nature of the fac tual and legal issues involved in the c ase; 

 ( b ) the nec essity for the servic es of a foreign senior c ounsel; 

 ( c ) the availability of any Senior Counsel or other advoc ate and solic itor with appropriate experienc e; and 

 ( d ) whether, having regard to the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, it is reasonable to admit a foreign senior c ounsel for the purpose of the c ase. 

26     The analytic al framework for dec iding _ad hoc_ admission applic ations was set out in _Re Beloff_. The c ourt must first be satisfied that the three mandatory requirements in s 15 of the LPA – the formal requirements in ss 15(1)( _a_ ) and ( _b_ ) and the requirement of spec ial qualific ations or experienc e for the purpose of the c ase in s 15(1)( _c_ ) – are satisfied, before it c an go on to c onsider the Notific ation matters and dec ide whether to exerc ise its disc retion to admit the applic ant (see _Re Beloff_ at [54]). If any mandatory requirement is not met, the question of disc retion does not arise. There may of c ourse be substantial overlap between the matters to be c onsidered under s 15(1)( _c_ ) and the Notific ation matters but they should, for c larity of analysis, remain distinc t requirements (see _Re Beloff_ at [58]; _Re Rogers_ at [9]). 

27     The Notific ation matters do not c onstitute a stric t four-stage test. Rather, eac h matter is a signpost pointing to the ultimate question of whether it is reasonable to admit the applic ant (see _Re Beloff_ at [53]; _Re Fordham_ at [45]). Reasonableness, for this purpose, is synonymous with the overarc hing requirement of “need”. Henc e, the c ourt should have regard to the Notific ation matters but “the broad princ iple in ac c ordanc e with whic h the disc retion must be exerc ised is that foreign senior c ounsel should only be admitted on the basis of ‘need’” (see _Re Beloff_ at [65]). The various Notific ation matters, however, allow the c ourt to assess the question of nec essity from various angles (see _Re Rogers_ at [49]). 

28     It goes without saying that not all the four matters must be satisfied in every applic ation to warrant the _ad hoc_ admission (see _Re Andrews_ at [45]). The c ourt is duty-bound to c onsider all four matters, although it has the disc retion to attribute the appropriate weight to eac h fac tor in the c ontext of the c ase (see _Re Andrews_ at [63]; _Re Beloff_ at [65]). 

29     It was not disputed that Mr Wordsworth had met the formal requirements in s 15(1)( _a_ ) and s 15(1)( _b_ ). It was also undisputed that no “spec ial reason” for admission under s 15(2) of the LPA need be shown here. That leaves two issues for my determination: whether Mr Wordsworth possesses “spec ial qualific ations and experienc e for the purpose of the c ase” and, if so, whether I should, having c onsidered the Notific ation matters, exerc ise my disc retion to admit him to represent Lesotho in OS 492. 

**_The parties’ arguments_** 


30     At this junc ture, it will be useful to first rec ap the positions taken by the parties in this applic ation. 

31     Broadly speaking, the applic ant made the following submissions: 

 (a) Mr Wordsworth satisfies the requirement in s 15(1)( c ) of the LPA. His expertise in public international law and investor-state arbitration are highly relevant to the spec ific issues in this c ase. [note: 30] As lead c ounsel for Lesotho in the arbitration, Mr Wordsworth has spec ific knowledge of the issues raised in OS 492. In addition, he has general experienc e arguing, in other investor-state arbitrations, the spec ific jurisdic tional arguments raised by Lesotho in OS 492, in partic ular, what c onstitutes an “investment” in international investment law. [note: 31] 

 (b) Having regard to the Notific ation matters, it is reasonable to admit Mr Wordsworth. The fac tual and legal issues involved in this c ase are c omplex, novel, and of unusual importanc e. For example, the extent of a member state’s liability for the ac ts of an international organisation is unsettled at international law. [note: 32] The jurisdic tional c hallenge in OS 492 also involves a highly c omplex and lengthy fac tual matrix. The c ourt’s resolution of that c hallenge would entail the interpretation and applic ation of a set of multilateral treaties and its dec ision would have implic ations for the rights and obligations of other sovereign states. [note: 33] It follows, based on the fac tual c omplexity and prec edential value of OS 492, that it is nec essary to have Mr Wordsworth, with his breadth of expertise, argue the jurisdic tional c hallenge, and that the pool of loc al prac titioners having c omparable experienc e is very limited. [note: 34] 

32     The defendants opposed the applic ation on the following grounds: 

 (a) Mr Wordsworth does not satisfy the requirement in s 15(1)( c ) of the LPA. The defendants submitted that the c ourt’s dec ision in OS 492 would turn on the interpretation of the IAA, and not the public international law issues that the applic ant had identified. There is a dispute as to whether Lesotho c an even resort to the relevant provisions of the IAA to c hallenge the Award, in partic ular, whether s 10(3) of the IAA permits a c hallenge to a dec ision on jurisdic tion and the merits of a c ase, like the Award, as opposed to only “pure jurisdic tional rulings”. [note: 35] Ac c ordingly, Mr Wordsworth’s experienc e would not be espec ially relevant to the issues in OS 

492\. [note: 36] 

 (b) It is not reasonable to admit Mr Wordsworth. The arguments on jurisdic tion raised by Lesotho in OS 492 are not espec ially c omplex and c an be resolved applying well-established princ iples of treaty interpretation, investment treaty jurisprudenc e, and the dec isions of the SADC Tribunal. [note: 37] The multilateral nature of the treaties does not of itself c reate any additional layer of diffic ulty or c omplexity. [note: 38] Further, Lesotho has not taken reasonable steps to asc ertain the availability of appropriate loc al c ounsel. Therefore, it is not open to Lesotho to argue that there is any nec essity for foreign c ounsel given that it had failed to undertake a genuine searc h for loc al c ounsel in the first plac e. Lesotho would not suffer substantial prejudic e in its c onduc t of OS 492 if it is represented by loc al c ounsel instead of Mr Wordsworth. [note: 39] 

33     The AttorneyGeneral supported the applic ation. While agreeing largely with the applic ant that the balanc e is in favour of admitting Mr Wordsworth, the AttorneyGeneral also urged the c ourt to c onsider the wider public interest in enhanc ing the attrac tiveness of Singapore as a venue for 


international arbitration. The AttorneyGeneral submitted that it would be an assuranc e to parties who arbitrate in Singapore that their lead c ounsel c ould c ontinue, provided he had suffic ient expertise 

and experienc e, to appear on their behalf should the arbitral award be c hallenged in c ourt. [note: 40] 

34     The applic ation was opposed by the Law Soc iety of Singapore. As regards the s 15(1)( _c_ ) requirement, it noted that there is no indic ation of how Mr Wordsworth’s experienc e would relate to 

the spec ific issues surrounding the various SADC Treaties. [note: 41] With regard to the Notific ation matters, it stressed that the absenc e of any effort by Lesotho to c onsider the availability of loc al 

c ounsel failed to give “due c redit to the experienc e and quality of the loc al Bar”. [note: 42] On the whole, it is not reasonable, and would in fac t be “dangerous”, to admit Mr Wordsworth simply bec ause 

he was lead c ounsel in the underlying matter. [note: 43] 

**_Underlying rationale of the admissions regime_** 

35     Under the admissions regime following the 2012 Amendment, foreign c ounsel will only be admitted on the basis of “need”. The word “need” has many shades of meaning. One partic ular “need” whic h Parliament sought to address with the 2012 Amendment was that of litigants in c ommerc ial c ases who were unable to sec ure the servic es of Senior Counsel (“SC”). This diffic ulty arose from the frequenc y with whic h loc al SCs, who were mainly c lustered in a few large firms, were prevented from ac ting against loc al banks or c orporate c lients due to potential c onflic ts of interest (see _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (14 February 2012) vol 88 at p 1106 (Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Law) and _Re Beloff_ at [41]). Parliament therefore intended, by the 2012 Amendment, “to give the c ourts greater disc retion” to admit foreign c ounsel in suc h “c omplex c ivil matters”. However, Parliament did not intend this illustration to be exhaustive of all the c irc umstanc es in whic h a need for foreign c ounsel would arise (see _Re Andrews_ at [37]), though it would nonetheless be the “paradigm example” of need (see _Re Beloff_ at [43]). Henc e, the Court of Appeal explained in _Re Beloff_ that the rationale underlying the 2012 Amendment was a broader proposition than the paradigmatic example Parliament gave. That broader proposition was embodied in the Minister for Law’s c omment that foreign c ounsel would be admitted on the basis of need, but that it would not be a free for all. The Court of Appeal, however, made c lear in _Re Beloff_ at [42] that “need” was a stringent standard and that admitting foreign c ounsel based on “need” was not the same as admitting foreign c ounsel merely bec ause it was “desirable or c onvenient or sought as a matter of c hoic e”. In their view, the threshold of “need” would be met if the litigant seeking admission of foreign c ounsel would be prejudic ed should the applic ation be disallowed. 

36     It is essential to be c lear what “need” and “prejudic e” mean in this c ontext. The Court of Appeal’s observation at _Re Beloff_ at [42] may be read to imply that “need” is to be viewed _only_ from the perspec tive of the litigant. However, Parliament did not intend to limit the inquiry into the question of nec essity only to the needs of the litigant. In my view, “need” should be broadly c onstrued to also enc ompass the need of the c ourt to rec eive profic ient assistanc e from c ounsel with the requisite expertise and experienc e. This seems to be the import of two observations in _Re Beloff_. 

37     First, the Court of Appeal noted at [49], in relation to the requirement that “spec ial reason” be shown for ring-fenc ed areas of law under s 15(2) of the LPA, that these areas of law were direc tly related to loc al soc ietal norms and shared values. As a result, “it would _presumptively_ be the c ase that in these areas, the c ourt would be best assisted by loc al c ounsel” (emphasis in original) save where spec ial reasons are shown. It stands to reason that even when dealing with areas of law whic h are not ring-fenc ed, the guiding question is still whether the c ourt would be best assisted by loc al or foreign c ounsel, although there should be no presumption either way. 


38     Sec ond, the Court of Appeal noted at [43] that there might be a need for foreign c ounsel even where a litigant was able to selec t from a substantial pool of loc al SCs if, for example, the c ase involved “an area of law so esoteric that no loc al lawyer [c ould] c laim any expertise in it”. The potential prejudic e to suc h a litigant would stem from the lac k of ac c ess to foreign c ounsel with the relevant broad and wide-ranging experienc e in that area of law. If the litigant has ac c ess to suc h expertise, the c ourt too would benefit from the assistanc e of foreign c ounsel to adroitly address suc h esoteric issues of law. Suc h “need” must nec essarily be assessed with referenc e to the spec ific issues of the c ase for whic h the applic ant seeks admission. This is entirely in line with the Court of Appeal’s observation (at [44]) that the foc us under the new admissions regime is no longer on the c omplexity and diffic ulty of the issues _per se_ but whether, “having regard to the _issues_ whic h do arise and all other relevant c onsiderations, there is a _need_ for foreign c ounsel to be admitted in a given c ase bec ause of a lac k of available and appropriate loc al c ounsel” (emphasis added). 

39     There are therefore two overarc hing c onc erns: identifying the issues in c ontention, and assessing whether there is a need for foreign c ounsel’s assistanc e with referenc e to those issues. The need for foreign c ounsel’s assistanc e is to be assessed from both the litigant’s and the c ourt’s perspec tive. Typic ally, the c ourt, when viewing the matter through both lenses, should in almost all c ases arrive at the same outc ome, sinc e the c ompetent presentation of the litigant’s c ase would invariably assist both the litigant and the c ourt. I should add that in c ases involving areas of law whic h the c ourt may not be fully _au fait_ with, the need for c ompetent representation assumes, from the c ourt’s perspec tive, even greater signific anc e. This should be self-evident sinc e the c ourt’s dec ision will not only have direc t bearing on the c ase at hand but will have wider implic ations for future c ases. As will be seen below, these overarc hing c onc erns inform eac h step of the analytic al framework. 

40     With these c onsiderations in mind, I turn to address the present applic ation. 

**_Special qualifications and experience for the purpose of the case_** 

41     In relation to s 15(1)( _c_ ) of the LPA, I observed in _Re Rogers_ (at [17]) that an applic ant must possess spec ial qualific ations or experienc e relevant to the _specific issues_ whic h arise in the c ase at hand, and not just expertise in a generic prac tic e area. This requires the issues to be c learly identified (see _Re Fordham_ at [50]). The identific ation of those issues must be fair. They should not be framed too narrowly or too generally; the proc ess of identific ation must strive to c apture the essenc e of the underlying dispute while remaining neutral as regards the outc ome of the admission applic ation (see _Re Rogers_ at [22]). 

42     It is apparent from the survey of the parties’ submissions that there is no c ommon ground as to what the spec ific issues are before the c ourt in OS 492. The c harac terisation of the underlying issues will therefore be pivotal in resolving the question of whether Mr Wordsworth possesses spec ial qualific ations and experienc e for the purpose of s 15(1)( _c_ ). This muc h was agreed by c ounsel for the respec tive parties during the oral hearing. Indeed, the approac h taken by the Court of Appeal in _Re Beloff_ was to c onsider the nature of the legal and fac tual issues in order to assess whether the foreign c ounsel in question had the requisite and partic ular experienc e (at [58]). There will be an unavoidable overlap between this inquiry and the first Notific ation matter – _ie_ , the nature of the fac tual and legal issues in the c ase. However, it is important to remember that the foc us of the s 15(1)( _c_ ) requirement is on the _relevance_ of c ounsel’s qualific ations and experienc e to the spec ific issues and not on whether those issues are diffic ult or c omplex (see _Re Fordham_ at [50]). 

43     In my assessment, the spec ific issues in OS 492 are intrinsic ally in the realm of public international law. The interpretation of Artic le 28(1) of Annex 1 to the SADC Investment Protoc ol is at 


the c ore of Lesotho’s c hallenge to the Award. The arbitral tribunal relied on Artic le 28(1) in founding its jurisdic tion to hear the dispute. The main question, as I see it, is whether the tribunal was right in interpreting the term “investment” as enc ompassing both a right to exploit the mining leases and a right to a remedy for interferenc e with that underlying investment. That was a c ruc ial point of departure between the majority of the tribunal and the dissenting arbitrator. Addressing this issue c alls for expertise in the field of investor-state arbitration. The interpretation of Artic le 28(1) also engages three subsidiary questions of public international law. The first is whether there is any retroac tive applic ation of the SADC Investment Protoc ol c ontrary to Artic le 28(4) of Annex 1 to the Protoc ol. Additionally, given the majority’s c harac terisation of the relevant “dispute” as being the SADC’s Summit’s shuttering of the SADC Tribunal, two c ritic al and related questions arise for c onsideration: the liability of Lesotho for the ac ts of the SADC Summit, and c onsequently, whether and how the requirement to exhaust loc al remedies c an apply in the c irc umstanc es of the dispute. Addressing these questions inevitably requires extensive expertise in public international law. 

44     In this regard, I disagree with the defendants’ attempt to c harac terise the issues as engaging largely with the interpretation of the IAA. Pertinently, c ounsel for the applic ant highlighted the fac t that the c ourt will not be able to avoid the public international law dimension in OS 492 for the simple reason that jurisdic tional c hallenges are determined by the c ourt on a _de novo_ standard of review (see _AQZ v ARA_ <span class="citation">[2015] 2 SLR 972</span> at [49]; _PT First Media TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK) v Astro Nusantara International BV and others and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2014] 1 SLR 372</span> 

at [162]–[163]). [note: 44] Henc e, the c ourt, for the purposes of OS 492, c an and will fully rehear the arguments that were made before the tribunal on the question of its jurisdic tion. It follows that the arguments whic h the defendants will raise on the applic ability of the IAA are additional issues that c ounsel for Lesotho in OS 492 will have to address as well. But the presenc e of those additional issues does not c ause the public international law issues to fall away or fade into the bac kground. They remain very muc h the princ ipal issues in OS 492. 

45     I also do not ac c ept the Law Soc iety’s argument that the applic ant’s qualific ations and expertise must be relevant to the spec ific issues surrounding the SADC treaties. As I indic ated at the oral hearing, that would be framing the issues far too narrowly. In any event, Mr Wordsworth does have partic ular expertise in relation to the SADC treaties as he was the lead c ounsel in the underlying arbitration where the interpretation of the treaties oc c upied c entre stage. 

46     I turn to c onsider Mr Wordsworth’s spec ial qualific ations and expertise for the purpose of the spec ific issues in OS 492. In doing so, I bear in mind a number of observations that have been made in previous c ases. The Court of Appeal has noted that it is suffic ient that the applic ant has a “notable and partic ular expertise” relevant to the issues in the c ase at hand; there is no additional demand that the applic ant must be among the foremost spec ialists in that area of law (see _Re Beloff_ at [57]). It has also been said that the spec ial qualific ations and expertise must indic ate that the foreign c ounsel “will be able to expertly disc harge his or her duties to the c lient _and the court_ ‘for the purpose’ of the c ase for whic h _ad hoc_ admission is sought” (see _Re Andrews_ at [39]) (emphasis added). This statement illustrates onc e again that the overarc hing c onc ept of “need” must be looked at both from the perspec tive of the c lient and the c ourt. 

47     In his affidavit in support of this applic ation, Mr Wordsworth desc ribed his qualific ations and 

experienc e in this manner: [note: 45] 

 I am widely-regarded as a leading prac titioner in the fields of public international law and international arbitration, and am regularly instruc ted by Governments in international c ases. I regularly appear before various international tribunals, inc luding the International Court of Justic e, and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Apart from my professional prac tic e, I am 


 also presently a Visiting Professor teac hing investment arbitration at Kings College, London. I believe that my expertise in public international law is relevant to, and will assist the Honourable Court in determining the issues c onc erning Lesotho’s jurisdic tional c hallenge in OS 492 ... the issues c onc erning Lesotho’s jurisdic tional c hallenge in OS 492 do raise extremely fine, intric ate and novel public international law princ iples and c onc epts. 

 ... 

 In addition to the above, I would emphasise that I was lead c ounsel for Lesotho in the underlying arbitration proc eedings to OS 492. As suc h, I am intimately familiar with the c omplex fac tual and legal issues underlying Lesotho’s c ase, and am fully aware of the material, fac tual and legal points arising therein. 

48     I have no doubt that Mr Wordsworth possesses spec ial qualific ations and experienc e for the purpose of OS 492. He has broad experienc e in public international law, being regularly instruc ted by states both in c ases before the International Court of Justic e and before arbitral tribunals. He also has expertise in investor-state arbitrations, where he has been instruc ted both by investors in their 

c laims for expropriation against states, and by states in their defenc es to suc h c laims. [note: 46] Having approac hed investor-state disputes from both the state’s and the c laimant’s perspec tive, Mr Wordsworth would no doubt have built up c onsiderable expertise whic h he c an bring to bear on the issues in OS 492. More importantly, as pointed out by c ounsel for the applic ant, Mr Wordsworth has argued the spec ific issues raised in OS 492 in c ases whic h he had previously argued – suc h as the c ore dispute in OS 492 of how an “investment” is to be c harac terised. I am satisfied, therefore, that Mr Wordsworth meets the mandatory requirement in s 15(1)( _c_ ). 

49     That brings me to an observation on a point of prac tic e. The linkage between the c ases Mr Wordsworth had previously handled and the spec ific issues in OS 492 was not made explic it in his supporting affidavit. That supporting affidavit only c ontained a short overview of Mr Wordsworth’s experienc e (see [47] above) and a _curriculum vitae_ listing his past c ases along with a brief desc ription of their subjec t matter. The link between his experienc e and the issues in the present c ase was only fleshed out in the applic ant’s submissions. I expressed some c onc ern in _Re Rogers_ (at [35]) that the supporting affidavit in that c ase did not show the nexus between the identified issues and the applic ant’s expertise. Mr Wordsworth’s affidavit only appended his _curriculum vitae_ listing the c ases he had previously c onduc ted; it was only in the applic ant’s submissions that the prec ise issues in some of these c ases were identified, and the relevanc e of the expertise gleaned from those c ases explained. I should reiterate that it is good prac tic e to furnish suc h details in the _supporting affidavit itself_ rather than in the submissions. In addition, it is inc umbent upon the loc al instruc ting solic itor, and not the applic ant, to ensure that the supporting affidavit c ontains suffic ient information to assist the c ourt, partic ularly on whether the identified issues fall within the domain of the applic ant’s expertise (see _Re Rogers_ at [43]). In this c ase, however, the lac k of detail in the supporting affidavit was eventually and suffic iently addressed in c ounsel’s submissions. 

**_The Notification matters_** 

50     I now c ome to the question of whether, having regard to the Notific ation matters, I should admit Mr Wordsworth for the purpose of OS 492. The ultimate question, as mentioned, is whether, having regard to all the c irc umstanc es of the c ases, it is reasonable that I do so. 

_Nature of the factual and legal issues_ 

51     The c ourt’s task when c onsidering the first Notific ation matter is to undertake a qualitative 


evaluation of the issues in order to determine whether they are c omplex, or diffic ult, or novel, or of signific ant prec edential value. The more this is so, the smaller might be the pool of loc al c ounsel able and available to handle the c ase and the greater might be the need to admit foreign c ounsel (see _Re Beloff_ at [61]; _Re Rogers_ at [57]). There may well be a need for foreign c ounsel to assist in a c ase whic h may not be partic ularly c omplex, but whic h will be of signific ant prec edential value or of signific ant public interest (see _Re Andrews_ at [48]; _Re Rogers_ at [51]). 

52     It appears that the foc us of OS 492 will be primarily on legal issues. The only fac tual dispute seems to be over the c orrec tness of the tribunal’s finding that the defendants’ investment was “admitted” by Lesotho through its c onduc t (see [19(c )] above), although that fac tual dispute does not appear to me easy to resolve given that the tribunal founded its dec ision on a broad range of 

c onduc t by Lesotho and its governmental authorities. [note: 47] The rest of the tribunal’s findings, and Lesotho’s c hallenge, will largely engage the interpretation of the SADC Treaties and the applic ation of princ iples of public international law. Some of these legal issues are fairly c omplex, whic h resulted in the divergenc e of views between the majority of the arbitral tribunal and the dissenting arbitrator. The defendants’ relianc e on the SADC Summit’s shuttering of the SADC Tribunal as giving rise to Lesotho’s breac hes of its international obligations led to a fundamental disagreement on what the relevant dispute was. Apart from c omplexity, the issues in OS 492 are novel and will no doubt be of signific ant prec edential value in interpreting the SADC Treaties. The c ourt’s dec ision in OS 492 will therefore be of signific ant public interest, possibly even internationally. The issues in OS 492 therefore tic k all four boxes of c omplexity, diffic ulty, novelty, and prec edential value. This militates strongly in favour of admitting Mr Wordsworth. 

_Necessity for foreign counsel and availability of local counsel_ 

53     It has been the prac tic e of the c ourt to c onsider the sec ond and third Notific ation matters together (see _Re Caplan_ at [66]; _Re Rogers_ at [55]). This is due to the inevitable overlap between the two: if there are fewer loc al c ounsel with appropriate experienc e, the nec essity of having the servic es of a foreign c ounsel would naturally be greater (see _Re Andrews_ at [52]). 

54     It will be c ruc ial to have the servic es of foreign c ounsel in c ases where there are no loc al lawyers with appropriate expertise or experienc e; in this c ontext, appropriate expertise refers to experienc e whic h allows foreign c ounsel to put forward and argue the litigant’s c ase c ompetently, having regard to the spec ific issues raised in the underlying c ase (see _Re Andrews_ at [52]). Conversely, there is no need for foreign c ounsel to c onduc t a c ase if the issues are “not unduly c omplex and well within the range of c ompetent Singapore c ounsel” (see _Re Beloff_ at [82]). 

55     I should emphasise that there is stric tly no need for a litigant to exhaust _all_ options in approac hing loc al c ounsel before a c ourt will c onsider his applic ation for the _ad hoc_ admission of foreign legal c ounsel (see _Re Andrews_ at [77]). The inquiry is whether there has been _reasonably_ c onsc ientious effort to sec ure the servic es of c ompetent loc al c ounsel (see _Re Caplan_ at [69]). 

56     I ac c ept the applic ant’s submission that the pool of Singapore c ounsel having experienc e in the 

fields of public international law and investor-state arbitrations is limited. [note: 48] I note that the AttorneyGeneral also took the view that the pool of loc al advoc ates able and available to deal with 

OS 492 is relatively small. [note: 49] Henc e, the need for the servic es of Mr Wordsworth, who has the appropriate expertise to assist the c ourt on the jurisdic tional c hallenge in OS 492, essentially speaks for itself. 

57     At this junc ture, I should deal with a number of arguments c onc erning the nec essity of foreign 


c ounsel and the availability of loc al c ounsel. 

58     The defendants put forth two arguments why there is no nec essity for the servic es of Mr Wordsworth in this c ase. 

59     First, the defendants argued that the present c ase is similar to _Re Beloff_ , where the Court of Appeal found that there was no nec essity for foreign c ounsel bec ause, as in this c ase, the litigant was already represented by one of Singapore’s largest law firms. Even if Mr Wordsworth’s experienc e made him more qualified than loc al c ounsel, it would not be a suffic ient reason for his applic ation to be granted. The defendants relied on this observation by the Court of Appeal in _Re Beloff_ at [87]: 

 The question is not whether the litigant will find assistanc e from foreign c ounsel who might seem in some way more c apable than available loc al c ounsel. The real question is whether the litigant c an find good and adequate assistanc e here, or from the other viewpoint, whether the litigant would be materially prejudic ed if deprived of the servic es of the foreign c ounsel. 

They also relied on _Re Lord Goldsmith_ , where the c ourt noted that the argument that foreign c ounsel would do “an even better job” than available loc al c ounsel did not address the question of nec essity, for nec essity “would imply that there was some c hanc e that the issues in a c ase would not be properly ventilated or framed without the partic ipation of foreign senior c ounsel” (at [54]). 

60     I ac c ept that the requirement of nec essity is not made out just bec ause foreign c ounsel has more impressive qualific ations or c redentials than loc al c ounsel. However, the c ourts’ c onc lusions that there was no nec essity for foreign c ounsel in _Re Beloff_ and _Re Lord Goldsmith_ have to be understood with referenc e to the _issues_ in those c ases. In _Re Lord Goldsmith_ , the issues in that c ase were entirely related to the Singapore c ontext – the applic ant sought admission to argue a c onstitutional c hallenge to a _local_ penal provision. It was therefore suffic ient that the litigants were represented by an SC. The loc al-c entric nature of the issues substantially dec reased the need for foreign c ounsel. In _Re Beloff_ , the c ourt found that two of the issues c onc erned matters of Singapore law; therefore, “Singapore c ounsel would ordinarily be best plac ed to deal with suc h issues”. The third issue, while unc ommon, had been settled by a dec ision of the Court of Appeal and any argument on that front “would be well within the range of c ompetent Singapore c ounsel” (at [80]). Owing to the fac t that the issues engaged questions of Singapore law, the litigants in those c ases naturally fac ed an uphill task in persuading the c ourt of the nec essity for foreign c ounsel. It was therefore unsurprising that the argument that foreign c ounsel would be _more capable_ than loc al c ounsel was not favourably rec eived. In this c ase, Lesotho’s position is _not_ that Mr Wordsworth should be admitted _even though_ there are loc al c ounsel with the appropriate expertise to handle OS 492. It is the c onverse: Mr Wordsworth should be admitted _because_ loc al c ounsel with suc h expertise is very limited. That Mr Wordsworth is more qualified than loc al c ounsel to argue the c ase is in favour of, and not against, admission. 

61     Sec ond, the defendants suggested that an applic ation to set aside an arbitral award was akin to an appeal in that strong written advoc ac y would usually be determinative of the result rather than 

oral advoc ac y. [note: 50] This submission was also advanc ed by the Law Soc iety. [note: 51] It is c orrec t that, in the main, written submissions are more useful in appellate advoc ac y and, more generally, in proc eedings whic h are foc used squarely on issues of law rather than fac t. Bec ause of the wider sc ope for foreign c ounsel in the preparation of written advoc ac y, the need to admit foreign c ounsel to present the c ase orally may be less c ompelling, as noted in _Re Lord Goldsmith_ at [37]. I was also referred to my dec ision in _Re Fordham_ , where I said that this observation applied with equal forc e to judic ial review proc eedings, whic h are c entred entirely on issues of law. I found that there was no need for the applic ant to be admitted in that c ase bec ause he c ould provide input in c rafting 


the written submissions whic h c ould then be presented in c ourt by loc al c ounsel (at [86]). 

62     The prec eding observations on written advoc ac y must not be taken out of c ontext. The issues in _Re Lord Goldsmith_ and _Re Rogers_ c entred on questions of Singapore law. In both these dec isions, there was nothing pec uliarly c omplex about the c ase whic h made them out of the ordinary from a legal perspec tive (see _Re Lord Goldsmith_ at [64]; _Re Fordham_ at [83]–[84]). In fac t, the underlying c ase in _Re Lord Goldsmith_ involved a ring-fenc ed area of Singapore law. The c ourt had already found in both c ases that loc al c ounsel would be well-plac ed to argue the issues without the need for foreign c ounsel. The question was whether anything would be gained by having foreign c ounsel present the c ase orally even though all the issues were within the range of loc al c ounsel’s expertise. The c ourt expec tedly held that there was no suc h need. While it added that foreign c ounsel c ould still assist with the preparation of the written submissions, that should be read as no more than a suggestion that foreign c ounsel c ould supplement the efforts of loc al c ounsel who would be doing most of the preparation sinc e the issues were loc al-c entric in nature. That suggestion resonates less strongly in this c ase where, as I have found, the issues are c omplex and of an international nature, and there are probably few loc al advoc ates with the requisite expertise to address them. On the other hand, the issues are well within the range of Mr Wordsworth’s expertise. To limit his involvement to assisting in the preparation of written submissions even though he is best-plac ed to assist the c ourt would not produc tively serve the needs of the litigant and the c ourt. 

63     On the third Notific ation matter, the defendants submitted that the bare assertion by c ounsel for the applic ant that they had c onsidered the available loc al c ounsel was insuffic ient to disc harge their burden of proving they had taken reasonable steps to asc ertain the availability of c ompetent 

loc al c ounsel [note: 52] – this bare assertion fell short of the standard established in _Re Caplan_ where this c ourt noted (at [23]) that full details of efforts to sec ure loc al c ounsel had to be furnished in the supporting affidavits for _ad hoc_ admission, inc luding (a) the nature of the c ontac t between the party and loc al c ounsel; (b) the mode of c ontac t; (c ) the date(s) and duration(s) of any meetings; and (d) a summary of the disc ussions with loc al c ounsel. In addition, date of loc al c ounsel’s refusal to take up the c ase and the reasons given should also be spec ified. 

64     The proc edural requirement in _Re Caplan_ enables the c ourt to answer the broader question of whether there has been a “reasonably c onsc ientious” searc h for loc al c ounsel. What c onstitutes a reasonably c onsc ientious searc h would naturally depend on the nature of the issues in eac h c ase. Although this proc edural requirement does not appear to have been fulfilled on the fac e of the supporting affidavit, I have already taken c ognisanc e of the lac k of available loc al c ounsel in the field of public international law – see [56] above. In these _unique_ c irc umstanc es, there might have been little utility in formally approac hing loc al c ounsel and rec ording the details of their inability or unavailability to ac c ept the brief. This might have been an exerc ise in futility. That c ounsel for the applic ant omitted to do so is henc e understandable. I should however c aution that the dispensation of the requirement to take steps to asc ertain the availability of c ompetent loc al c ounsel would only be permitted in exc eptional c irc umstanc es of whic h the present c ase is one. 

65     As regards the third Notific ation matter, the Law Soc iety submitted that “[t]he nurturing and growth of our loc al bar should not be impeded in the absenc e of good reasons to do so” and that parties should not be allowed simply to apply for the admission of a foreign legal c ounsel as a first 

port of c all. [note: 53] While I ac c ept that this is a relevant c onsideration in the _ad hoc_ admission proc ess, this c onc ern does not arise in this applic ation. It only assumes signific anc e in situations where c ompetent loc al c ounsel with the requisite expertise and experienc e _for the purposes of the case_ are available. It does not c ome into play where the issues before the c ourt involve areas of law for whic h there is a disc ernible lac k of suitable loc al c ounsel. In my view, the admission of Mr 


Wordsworth would in fac t further the objec tive in “nurturing” the loc al Bar in the area of public international law. I am sure the experienc e of working with Mr Wordsworth on these issues will be benefic ial to at least the instruc ting solic itors. 

_Reasonableness_ 

66     I should mention two other c onsiderations whic h have featured in the parties’ submissions: first, the signific anc e of Mr Wordsworth having been lead c ounsel in the underlying arbitration; sec ond, the AttorneyGeneral’s submission that the admissions regime should be c onsistent with the wider public interest in promoting the attrac tiveness of Singapore as a venue for arbitration. 

67     Both these c onsiderations found favour with the c ourt in _Re David Joseph QC_ <span class="citation">[2012] 1 SLR 791</span> (“ _Re Joseph_ ”). That was the last oc c asion on whic h foreign QCs were admitted to appear in an arbitration-related matter. That was an applic ation under the admissions regime prior to the 2012 Amendment. Nonetheless, the outc ome in that c ase illustrates that the c ourt’s real c onc ern is with the underlying issues and whether the c ourt would, along with the litigant, benefit from foreign c ounsel’s assistanc e. The c ourt in that c ase noted that sinc e Mr Joseph QC was overall lead c ounsel in the arbitration, he would “be muc h better plac ed to address the c ourt” on the legal issues in light of his familiarity with the c ase and his c onsiderable expertise (at [52(a)]). That having been said, the c ourt nevertheless added the following words of c aution (at [59]): 

 In view of the strong emphasis on developing international arbitration law in Singapore, it would be very muc h in line with the wider public interests to admit the Applic ant in relation to the pending matters before the High Court. It must, however, be stressed that this does not mean that in future every applic ation involving the same Queen’s Counsel who has been the lead c ounsel in the arbitration proc eedings below will be favourably viewed. Not only must the legal issues be of suffic ient diffic ulty and c omplexity, the Court must also be c onvinc ed that the issues argued are inextricably linked to the arbitration proceedings and that there will be a real benefit in having the same counsel assist the Court. A matter c entric approac h that pays partic ular attention to the suffic ienc y of c omplexity and diffic ulty of the issues raised will have to be adopted. [emphasis added]. 

68     In my view, under the present legislative framework, the applic ant’s prior involvement in a c ase is not _per se_ a dec isive fac tor. In other words, if the nature of the issues is “well within the range of c ompetent Singapore c ounsel”, the applic ant’s prior involvement in the underlying dispute would not make it any more reasonable to admit him. It would be, at best, a residual fac tor whic h c an be c onsidered under the fourth Notific ation matter, under the rubric of “reasonableness”. In the present c ase, Mr Wordsworth’s prior involvement is a fac tor in favour of admission bec ause his expertise in the public international law issues arising from the arbitration will be direc tly relevant in OS 492 – see [48] above. His prior involvement alone would not have been suffic ient to warrant his admission. It only had a positive bearing on his admission owing to the lac k of suitable loc al c ounsel to address those issues. 

69     As to the AttorneyGeneral’s submission on the polic y c onsideration in promoting Singapore as a venue for international arbitration, I do not think that, in itself, would _directly_ address the primary question of “need”. In the c ontext of the present dispute, bec ause of the potential impac t of the c ourt’s dec ision in the setting-aside applic ation c oupled with the lac k of suitable loc al c ounsel to address the issues thereunder, it is a relevant c onsideration under the c urrent admissions regime that parties who opt to use Singapore as a venue for international arbitration should have the assuranc e that our c ourts will adopt a robust approac h to ac hieve a just outc ome in c hallenges to arbitral awards. In doing so, the c ourt must be willing to rec ognise the need for foreign legal representation 


partic ularly to meet the needs of litigants in situations where suitable loc al c ounsel with the requisite expertise and experienc e are limited or unavailable. However, the inc rease in Singapore’s attrac tiveness as a venue for international arbitration is a positive effec t of robust judic ial rulings on suc h c hallenges; it was never intended to be nor should it be the dominant reason for admitting foreign c ounsel as that would dilute the legislative emphasis on “need” as the basis of admission. In my judgment, under the c urrent legislative framework, suc h c onsiderations would be better plac ed as fac tors whic h the c ourt _may_ take into ac c ount, when c onsidering the fourth Notific ation matter, to determine the overall reasonableness of admitting the applic ant. But as mentioned earlier (at [28]), the c ourt may dec ide the appropriate weight to ac c ord to eac h of the Notific ation matters. In this c ase, I plac ed greater weight on the first three Notific ation matters in dec iding to admit Mr Wordsworth. The polic y c onsideration of promoting Singapore as a venue for international arbitration was less germane to my dec ision. 

70     I add a final point. The defendants submitted that admitting Mr Wordsworth would prejudic e them sinc e they would not have the benefit of being represented by a QC. Given my view that the nature of the issues warrant the admission of the applic ant, it is open to the defendants, should they wish to do so, to seek admission of a suitable foreign c ounsel provided their prospec tive applic ant satisfies the three mandatory requirements under s 15 of the LPA. The defendants are already represented by a team led by an SC but there is no rule against a party being represented by both an SC and a QC (see _Re Joseph_ at [52(b)]; _Re Beloff Michael Jacob QC_ <span class="citation">[2000] 1 SLR(R) 943</span> at [13]). 

**Conclusion** 

71     For the foregoing reasons, I allow the applic ation with no order as to c osts. 

72     I wish to rec ord my gratitude to all c ounsel, partic ularly c ounsel for the AttorneyGeneral and for the Law Soc iety, for their assistanc e in arriving at this dec ision.
