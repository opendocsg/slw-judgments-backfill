Lee Seiu Kin J: 

1       The dispute in both Originating Summons No 54 of 2008 (“OS 54/2008”) and No 90 of 2008 (“OS 90/2008”) c onc erns the c ollec tive sale of Regent Garden Condominium (“the property”), a strata title development c onsisting of 31 units of apartments. The subsidiary proprietors of 25 of the units (“the majority owners”), making up over 80% of the share value in the property, had c onsented to the sale of the property for $34m to Allgreen Properties Limited (“Allgreen”) and made an applic ation under s 84A of the Land Titles (Strata) Ac t (Cap 158, 1999 Rev Ed)(“the Ac t”) to the Strata Titles Board (“STB”) for an order for c ollec tive sale of the property. The subsidiary proprietors of the remaining six units (“the minority owners”) filed their objec tions to the STB. The majority owners subsequently disc overed that they had overestimated the development c harge payable and that they c ould have sold the property for more than the $34m. The majority owners informed the STB that the revised valuation was a higher sum and this led the STB to intimate that it was not inc lined to make an order for sale on the basis that the property was worth more than the sale pric e of $34m. On learning about this, Allgreen, whic h was not a party in the proc eedings before the STB induc ed the minority owners to agree to the c ollec tive sale by offering them an additional payment over and above what was c ontemplated for their units in the sale and purc hase agreement. The minority owners then purported to sign up to the agreement and withdrew their objec tions to the applic ation to the STB. Thus, before me, Allgreen essentially argued that the sale and purc hase agreement was 


valid and binding, and sought its spec ific performanc e and/or damages. Allgreen was in the c urious position of being supported by the minority owners who had initially opposed the applic ation to the STB and resisted by the majority owners who had applied to the STB for an order c ompelling the former to proc eed with the c ollec tive sale. 

**Events leading up to the Sale and Purchase Agreement** 

2       I turn now to the detailed bac kground fac ts. Between 26 August 2006 and February 2007, the majority owners entered into a c ollec tive sale agreement (“the Collec tive Sale Agreement”) with one another for the sale of all their 25 residential units and the c ommon property in the property. The minority owners did not sign the Collec tive Sale Agreement. 

3       Pursuant to c l 4 of the Collec tive Sale Agreement, the majority owners c onfirmed and ratified the appointment of a sale c ommittee (“the Sale Committee”), whic h _inter alia_ would be the majority owners’ agent for the purpose of negotiating and finalising the c ollec tive sale and obtaining any nec essary orders from the STB (see c l 4.3.2.1 of the Collec tive Sale Agreement.) 

4       Clause 10.1 of the Collec tive Sale Agreement stated: “The Sale Pric e shall be applied by the Solic itors in ac c ordanc e with the terms of this Agreement and apportioned as set out in Sc hedule F.” Sc hedule F sets out a method of apportionment whic h essentially ensured that the subsidiary proprietors of eac h unit ended up with a share of the sale proc eeds proportionate to the share value and strata area of that unit. 

5       The Sale Committee appointed Colliers International (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Colliers”), a firm of international valuers, as the property c onsultants to market the property and advise them on the open market value and henc e the reserve pric e of the property. In seeking to determine the reserve pric e for the property, Colliers had determined the pric e on a per square foot (“p.s.f.”) per plot ratio (“p.p.r.”) basis whic h worked out to be about $336 p.s.f.p.p.r. After taking into ac c ount the development c harge, whic h at the time it estimated to be about $7.6m, Colliers rec ommended a minimum reserve pric e of $30m (as reflec ted in the definition of “Reserve Pric e” in c l 1.1 of the Collec tive Sale Agreement). 

6       The development c harge is a tax levied on a developer who redevelops a piec e of land, thereby resulting in an enhanc ement of its value. This c harge is typic ally c alc ulated based on the differenc e between the value of the proposed development and the development baseline. The development baseline is, in turn, pegged to the value of the subjec t land, or previous highest value for whic h a development c harge has been paid. Broadly speaking, the higher the development baseline, the lower is the development c harge payable. In the c ontext of a c ollec tive sale of all the units in a c ondominium for the purposes of redevelopment, the development c harge payable will have a direc t effec t on the pric e a developer would pay for the land as this is a direc t c ost of developing the land. 

7       In January and February 2007, an invitation to submit offer (“ISO”) for the property was c onduc ted by Colliers on behalf of the majority owners. In c onjunc tion with the ISO, an investment memorandum was prepared by Colliers to invite developers to submit their offers (“the Investment Memorandum”). The Sale Committee dec ided not to apply to the URA to asc ertain the ac tual development baseline; thus, the parties involved c ould only work on the basis of estimates of the development c harge payable (“the estimated development c harge”). In the Investment Memorandum, Colliers marketed the property on the basis of a base plot ratio of 0.835 (whic h was the 1980 approved Gross Floor Area), resulting in the estimated development c harge being $7,189,663. The c hairman of the Sale Committee, Wong Lai Keen, averred that this was bec ause of Colliers’ advic e that the alternative method of asc ertaining the development c harge payable on the basis of the Gross 

 [note: 1] 

 [note: 2] 

 [note: 3] 


Floor Area was “a good guide”. However, it was apparent from an e-mail sent by Colliers to the Sale Committee dated 9 April 2007 (set out at [39] _infra_ ) (“the 9 April 2007 e-mail”) that the Sale Committee had dec ided against making a development baseline enquiry bec ause it felt that the subsidiary proprietors of the property were unlikely to agree to pay for the extra c ost (whic h had been quoted by an arc hitec tural firm at $11,000). 

8       After the ISO c losed on 13 February 2007, Colliers wrote to the subsidiary proprietors of the property on 14 February 2007 to inform them that several offers for the purc hase of the property had been rec eived, the highest of whic h was Allgreen’s bid of $34m. Allgreen’s bid was premised on the estimated development c harge being about $7.6m. 

**The Sale and Purchase Agreement** 

9       On 26 April 2007, the Sale Committee, on behalf of the Majority Owners, entered into the Sale and Purc hase Agreement with Allgreen, pursuant to whic h the Sale Committee, for and on behalf of the Majority Owners, agreed to sell and Allgreen agreed to purc hase all 31 units and the c ommon property in Regent Garden, for $34m. At all material times, Allgreen was represented by YeoLeong & Peh LLC (“YLP”), while the majority owners were represented by Tan & Au LLP (“T&A”). 

10     The following are the material c lauses of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement : 

 Cl 3(5): 

 Notwithstanding anything herein provided, the sale and purchase of the Property is conditional and subject to the approval of the Strata Title[s] Board (“the Board”) to the sale herein. For the avoidanc e of doubt, if the Board dismisses the Vendors’ applic ation for c auses whic h c an be rec tified by the Vendor, then any referenc e herein to the order of the Board shall inc lude suc h order of the Board upon subsequent applic ations by the Vendor after rec tific ation has been done by the Vendor. In the event the Board does not approve the sale due to c auses whic h the Vendor [is] unwilling to rec tify or otherwise, all monies paid by the Purc haser towards the purc hase of the Property shall be refunded to the Purc haser without any interest, c ompensation or deduc tion whatsoever and the Purc haser shall have no c laim whatsoever against the Vendor but without prejudic e to any other rights or remedies available to the Vendor at law or in equity against the Purc haser. Eac h party shall bear their or his own solic itors’ c osts in the matter. 

 Cl 3(6): 

 The Vendor shall apply to the Board for the Board’s Order within 3 months from the date of this Agreement. The Vendor undertakes to expeditiously proc ure suc h applic ation to the Board using [its] best endeavours. 

 Cl 3(8): 

 If at any time on or before the expiry of 12 months from the date of this Agreement, all the owners shall unanimously consent to the Collec tive Sale and the sale herein, then the c ondition set out in Clause 3(5) hereof shall be deemed to be satisfied. 

 [emphasis added] 

11     Clause 24 of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement was a material replic ation of c l 10.1 of the Collec tive Sale Agreement (see [4] _supra_ ), and stated: 

 [note: 3] 

 [note: 4] 

 [note: 5] 


 The Purc hase Pric e shall be distributed ac c ording to the terms of the c ollec tive sale agreement made between the Vendors and ac c ording to the Method spec ified thereunder and as stipulated in Schedule C. [emphasis in original] 

Sc hedule C of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement reproduc ed Sc hedule F of the Collec tive Sale Agreement. 

12     The Sale Committee engaged DTZ Debenham Tie Leung (SEA) Pte Ltd (“DTZ”) to c arry out a valuation of the property. In their valuation report dated June 2007 (“the first valuation”), DTZ advised that the open market value of the property after, _inter alia_ , deduc ting the estimated development c harge of $7,636,447, was $33.1m. 

**The application to the STB** 

13     Armed with the c onsent of more than 80% of the subsidiary proprietors, the majority owners made the applic ation to the STB as envisaged in c l 3(5) of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement on or about 23 July 2007. On 27 July 2007 the minority owners filed their objec tions and supplemental objec tions to the c ollec tive sale with the STB. The STB then direc ted that the majority and minority owners enter into mediation. Between 3 September and 24 Oc tober 2007, the majority owners filed affidavits to respond to the objec tions filed by the minority owners, and to state why the c ollec tive sale for the property should proc eed. 

14     Meanwhile on 23 July 2007, pursuant to an applic ation by Allgreen to asc ertain the ac tual development c harge payable, the Urban Redevelopment Authority wrote to Allgreen and the Sale Committee (“the 23 July 2007 URA letter”) to inform Allgreen that the development c harge payable was $950,894.00 (“the ac tual development c harge”). It should be noted that this is about $6.6m less than the estimated $7.6m in the ISO. 

15     It appears that, at the first mediation before the STB on 4 September 2007, the solic itor from T&A, Ms Carolyn Tan, informed the STB of the 23 July 2007 URA letter advising on the quantum of the development c harge. The STB indic ated that the inc orrec t valuation (based on the earlier overestimation of the development c harge) would be a ground for dismissing the majority owners’ applic ation for a sale order. The STB direc ted the Sale Committee to obtain fresh valuation reports to asc ertain the true market value of the property as at the date of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement, _ie_ , 26 April 2007. Final mediation was ordered to be held on 15 Oc tober 2007. 

16     The Sale Committee instruc ted DTZ to review their valuation. In September 2007, DTZ issued its revised valuation report (“the sec ond valuation”) in whic h it stated that the open market value of the property as at 26 April 2007 was $39.7m based on the development c harge advised by the URA on 23 July 2007. The Sale Committee also instruc ted an independent valuer, HBA Group Property Consultants Pte Ltd (“HBA”) to c onduc t a fresh valuation of the property to c onfirm its true market value as at 26 April 2007. 

17     At the final mediation session on 15 Oc tober 2007, the STB was informed of the sec ond valuation by DTZ. As no settlement appeared to be in sight, the STB hearing was fixed on 30 January 

2008\. Subsequently, in HBA’s valuation report dated November 2007, HBA advised that the market value of the property was $42m as at 26 April 2007 (“the third valuation”). 

**The minority owners’ consent to sale and aftermath** 

18     Negotiations took plac e between Ms Carolyn Tan from T&A and Ms Jennifer Yeo from YLP at a

 [note: 7] 

 [note: 8] 

 [note: 9] 

 [note: 10] 


meeting on 19 November 2007 (“the 19 November 2007 meeting”) pertaining to the disparity between the estimated development c harge and the ac tual development c harge, and the possibility of Allgreen inc reasing the purc hase pric e. The parties differ on the outc ome of the 19 November 2007 meeting and I shall disc uss this further at [66] _et seq_ below. 

19     Between 26 and 28 November 2007, Allgreen proc ured the c onsent of all the minority owners to the sale of Regent Garden by offering additional payments to them (“the additional payments to the minority owners”). The amount of these payments has not been disc losed. The last of the minority owners c onsented to the sale on 28 November 2007. As Allgreen did not have in its possession the original c opies of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement and Collec tive Sale Agreement (whic h were in the possession of T&A), the minority owners indic ated and expressed their c onsent by exec uting deeds of c onsent (“the deeds of c onsent”) and signing on photoc opies of the Collec tive Sale Agreement. 

20     On 26, 27 and 28 November 2007, the minority owners wrote to the STB, eac h advising that he or she had agreed in writing to sell his or her unit in the property to Allgreen, and withdrawing his or her objec tion to the c ollec tive sale. 

21     Subsequently, by a letter dated 30 November 2007, YLP wrote to T&A as follows: 

2\. We are pleased to inform you that unanimous c onsent to the Collec tive Sale [Agreement] and the sale in the [Sale and Purc hase] Agreement has been obtained. The c ertified true c opies of the respec tive c onsent letters and withdrawal notic es to the Strata Title[s] Board issed by the [minority owners] of Regent Garden are attac hed for your rec ord. 

3\. In view of the aforesaid, pursuant to Clause 3(8) of the [Sale and Purc hase] Agreement, the c ondition set out in Clause 3(5) of the [Sale and Purc hase] Agreement shall be deemed to be satisfied. 

 ... 

6\. Meanwhile, kindly proc eed to withdraw the applic ation to the Strata Title[s] Board for the     Board’s order by 03/12/07. We would apprec iate it if you c ould c c us a c opy of the withdrawal notic e and keep us posted of developments in this regard. 

 [emphasis in original] 

22     The majority owners later appointed Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC (“WTL”) as their solic itors in respec t of the dispute c onc erning the sale of the property. WTL sent a letter dated 19 Dec ember 2007 (“the 19 Dec ember 2007 WTL letter”) to YPL, _inter alia_ stating the majority owners’ position that Allgreen had wrongfully breac hed and repudiated the Sale and Purc hase Agreement as well as an alleged further agreement (“the alleged Further Agreement”) that Allgreen and the majority owners had entered into during the 19 November 2007 meeting (this is disc ussed in detail at [66] _et seq_ below). WTL c laimed that by making the additional payments to the minority owners so as to c ause an unequal and disproportionate amount to be distributed to all the subsidiary proprietors of the property, Allgreen had ac ted c ontrary not only to Sc hedule C of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement, but also the implied terms in the Sale and Purc hase Agreement and the alleged Further Agreement. WTL stated that the majority owners ac c epted Allgreen’s wrongful repudiation of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement and alleged Further Agreement, and therefore that the majority owners would treat themselves as being disc harged from the same. A further letter to similar effec t dated 4 January 2008 was sent to YLP, in whic h WTL requested YLP to arrange for the return of Allgreen’s c opy of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement for c anc ellation. 

 [note: 11] 

 [note: 12] 


23     Allgreen in turn appointed Drew & Napier LLC (“D&N”) to ac t for it in respec t of the dispute c onc erning the sale of the property. By a letter dated 8 January 2008, D&N responded to WTL’s letters dated 19 Dec ember 2007 and 4 January 2008 as follows: 

3\. Your allegation that our c lients have breac hed the [Sale and Purc hase] Agreement and the grounds on whic h that allegation [is] premised are without basis, as is your allegation that our c lients had given any indic ation that they were willing to enter into, or entered into a further agreement with your c lients. 

4\. Contrary to your assertions, there was no mistake as regards the sale pric e and neither was the transac tion entered into in bad faith. 

5\. Further, as there has now been unanimous c onsent as to the sale of [the property], c lause 3(5) of the [Sale and Purc hase] Agreement is deemed to be satisfied. Your assertion that the sale of Regent Garden is c onditional upon a sale order being obtained from the Strata Titles Board is erroneous. 

6\. Ac c ordingly, your c lients have no basis to terminate the [Sale and Purc hase] Agreement. It c ontinues to subsist and remains enforc eable. 

7\. However, it is c lear from your letters of 19 Dec ember 2007 and 4 January 2008 that your c lients have evinc ed a c lear and unequivoc al intention to no longer be bound by the [Sale and     Purc hase] Agreement, inc luding their obligation under the [Sale and Purc hase] Agreement to c omplete the sale and purc hase of [the property]. 

8\. In the c irc umstanc es, we have instruc tions to c ommenc e proc eedings against your c lients for spec ific performanc e of the [Sale and Purc hase] Agreement as well as all remedies available to our c lients at law and in equity. 

 ... 

10\. Our c lients reserve the right to ac c ept your c lients’ repudiation and c laim damages against your c lients, inc luding damages for loss of profit being the differenc e in value between the sale pric e of $34 million and the market value of [the property]. 

 ... 

**The STB hearing** 

24     At the STB hearing on 30 January 2008, the STB c onc luded that the transac tion was not in good faith taking into ac c ount the sale pric e, and ac c ordingly dismissed the applic ation (“the STB dec ision”). An appeal against the STB dec ision was filed on 26 February 2008 in Originating Summons No 254 of 2008 (“OS 254/2008”). 

**The applications** 

25     In OS 54/2008 filed on 10 January 2008, the members of the Sale Committee c ommenc ed proc eedings against Allgreen on a representative basis, eac h suing in his or her c apac ity as well as on behalf of the other majority owners of the property. The members of the Sale Committee sought the following alternative remedies: 

 [note: 13] 


 (a) A dec laration that the majority owners were no longer bound by and were disc harged from further performanc e of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement by reason of there being no approval given by the STB for the sale of the property to Allgreen ( ie , the c ondition in c l 3(5) of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement was not satisfied: see [10] supra ). 

 (b) An order for resc ission of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement by reason of the parties’ mistake regarding the development c harge payable resulting in the parties agreeing to the sale pric e of $34m, whic h was at gross undervalue for the property, or rec tific ation of the said agreement by inc reasing the sale pric e to reflec t the development c harge. 

 (c ) A dec laration that the parties had entered into the alleged Further Agreement under whic h Allgreen had agreed to top up the sale pric e of the property by not less than $5.7m with an order for spec ific performanc e of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement and the alleged Further Agreement. 

 (d) A dec laration that Allgreen were in wrongful breac h and repudiation of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement and/or the alleged Further Agreement, whic h the majority owners had ac c epted suc h that they were released from their obligations under the Sale and Purc hase Agreement and/or the alleged Further Agreement and entitled to damages. 

26     Allgreen filed OS 90 of 2008 on 18 January 2008 naming the majority owners as the defendants. The substantive relief was a dec laration that the Sale and Purc hase Agreement was valid and subsisting (“Prayer 1”), an order that the majority owners withdraw their applic ation to the STB for c ollec tive sale of the property (“Prayer 2”), an order that the majority owners c omplete the sale and purc hase of the property on the terms of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement (“Prayer 3”) and an order for damages in lieu of or in addition to spec ific performanc e (“Prayer 4”). By Summons No 547 of 2008 (SUM 547/2008) filed on 5 February 2008, the majority owners applied for leave to issue a third party notic e against the minority owners on the ground that it was nec essary on ac c ount of the majority owners seeking a determination of the following issues: 

 (a) whether Allgreen, direc tly or indirec tly, had entered into a separate agreement or made arrangements with the minority owners (singly or c ollec tively) under whic h the minority owners would rec eive extra sums in addition to their respec tive shares of the sale pric e of $34m; 

 (b) if so, whether (i) the minority owners had wrongfully proc ured or induc ed Allgreen to breac h the Sale and Purc hase Agreement and Collec tive Sale Agreement; and/or (ii) the minority owners and Allgreen had unlawfully c onspired with eac h other to injure and/or to c ause loss to the majority owners by unlawful means, namely by allowing the sale of the property to Allgreen to proc eed at a gross undervalue and/or by c ausing the minority owners to rec eive a disproportionately larger sum for the sale of their respec tive units than the majority owners; 

 (c ) if so, an order that the minority owners are liable to the majority owners for damages for all loss and damages arising in c onsequenc e; 

 (d) whether the damages payable to the majority owners should be the sum of $5.7m or $7m (see [66] infra ); 

 (e) whether by exec uting the deeds of c onsent, the minority owners are deemed parties to the Collec tive Sale Agreement and/or Sale and Purc hase Agreement; 

 (f ) whether the minority owners c an be said to have unanimously c onsented to the c ollec tive sale of the property at the pric e of $34m and on terms set out in the Collec tive Sale Agreement 

 [note: 14] 


 and Sale and Purc hase Agreement; 

 (g) whether, even if the minority owners c ould be deemed parties to the Collec tive Sale Agreement and/or Sale and Purc hase Agreement, the minority owners were in breac h of the Collec tive Sale Agreement, in partic ular c l 9.1.16 thereof; and 

 (h) whether the minority owners were required to ac c ount to the majority owners for the extra sums rec eived or to be rec eived by them and to disgorge any and all suc h sums rec eived, to be distributed amongst all the subsidiary proprietors of the property in ac c ordanc e with the sharing arrangements under the Sale and Purc hase Agreement and Collec tive Sale Agreement. 

**Preliminary issue** 

27     I shall first deal with a preliminary issue raised by WTL. This was that Allgreen c ould not apply for an order of spec ific performanc e of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement as it was c ontrary to the STB dec ision (whic h WTL c alled “the STB order”) and the c ourt’s jurisdic tion to interfere with that dec ision arose only where there was an appeal on the points of law (see WTL’s submissions for OS 54/2008 at [17]). I found this objec tion to be misc onc eived. Under s 84A of the Ac t STB has the power to order a c ollec tive sale whic h is binding on all subsidiary proprietors, even those who have not c onsented to the c ollec tive sale (see s 84A(2) of the Ac t). The dec ision of the STB in this c ase was to dec line to order a c ollec tive sale. There is no power on the part of the STB to prohibit a c ollec tive sale where all the owners have agreed to it. While s 84A(6) provides for the STB to approve an applic ation for c ollec tive sale even where no objec tion has been filed, this pertains to the situation where there is no unanimous c onsent and, an applic ation having been made to the STB, the minority owners have not filed any objec tion within the time limit in s 84A(4). Read in the c ontext of the whole of s 84A, it is c lear that s 84A(6) rec ognises that in suc h a situation the majority owners still require an order for sale from the STB notwithstanding that no objec tion has been filed. 

28     The parties in the present c ase are not asking me to re-visit the STB’s dec ision and make an order for sale – that is the subjec t of an appeal against the STB’s dec ision in OS 254/2008 (see [26] _supra_ ). The present applic ations are based on private c ontrac t ( _viz_ , the Sale and Purc hase Agreement, Collec tive Sale Agreement and/or the alleged Further Agreement) and it was eminently within this c ourt’s jurisdic tion to hear them. Thus, I turn now to the issues in the c ase. 

**Issues to be determined** 

29     The first issue to be determined was whether the Sale and Purc hase Agreement subsisted and was binding on the majority owners. This turned on the determination of several sub-issues: (a) whether there had been a c ommon mistake in relation to the ac tual development c harge so as to invalidate the Sale and Purc hase Agreement; (b) whether Allgreen had breac hed any terms (express or implied) of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement, Collec tive Sale Agreement and/or the Ac t by offering or making the additional payments to the minority owners; and (c ) whether there was unanimous c onsent under c l 3(8) of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement suc h that c l 3(5) of the same agreement was deemed to be satisfied. 

30     I found that: first, there was no c ommon mistake suc h as to affec t the validity of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement bec ause there is c lear evidenc e that the majority owners had full knowledge that the estimated development c harge was prec isely that – only an estimate. Thus, they entered into the Sale and Purc hase Agreement having dec ided to take the risk of any inc rease in the development c harge. Sec ondly, there was no express or implied term in the Sale and Purc hase Agreement, Collec tive Sale Agreement and/or the Ac t prohibiting the additional payments to the minority owners. 


Thirdly, c l 3(8) was satisfied by the deeds exec uted by the minority owners. 

31     This brought me to the sec ond issue, whic h was whether there was a further agreement that Allgreen would pay at least $5.7m to the majority owners. I found that there was no suc h further agreement, and that even if there was, it was only oral and therefore, being a c ontrac t for the sale of immovable property, no ac tion c ould be brought on it under s 6(d) of the Civil Law Ac t (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)(“Civil Law Ac t”). 

32     Ac c ordingly, I gave an order in terms of prayers 1 and 3 of OS 90/2008, with the date for c ompletion of the sale of the property fixed on 16 May 2008. For the avoidanc e of doubt, I also dec lared that the minority owners were bound by the terms of the Collec tive Sale Agreement and the Sale and Purc hase Agreement. 

33     I refused the applic ation for leave in SUM 547/2008 on the following grounds. Issues (a), (g) and (h) were not nec essary to the determination of OS 90/2008. In respec t of issues (b)(i) and (ii), (c ) and (d), I had already determined that there was no breac h of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement (as well as the Collec tive Sale Agreement and/or the Ac t) and thus there was no question of wrongful c onduc t on the part of Allgreen and the minority owners. Issues (e) and (f ) had been answered in the positive in determining OS 90/2008 (see [32] _supra_ ). 

34     OS 54/2008 was ac c ordingly dismissed. 

35     I shall now elaborate on the reasons for my dec ision. 

**Common mistake** 

36     WTL submitted that the Sale and Purc hase Agreement, and in partic ular the sale pric e of $34m, had been based on a c ommon mistake as to the ac tual development c harge for the property. At all times prior to the 23 July 2007 URA letter (see [16] _supra_ ), the Sale Committee and Allgreen had been under the impression that the ac tual development c harge would be in the region of $7m. As a result of this mistake, Allgreen had offered and the Sale Committee had agreed to ac c ept $34m as the pric e for the property (whic h was slightly higher than the first valuation of $33.1m). WTL referred me to _Great Peace Shipping Pte Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd_ [2003] QB 679 (“ _The Great Peace_ ”) and argued that the test for whether the mistake was suc h as to render the subjec t matter of the parties’ agreement essentially and radic ally different from what the parties believed to exist was satisfied, sinc e the c onditions set out in _The Great Peace_ (at [76] of that c ase) had been fulfilled: both Allgreen and the majority owners had assumed that the development c harge would be in the region of at least $7m; neither party had warranted that the development c harge would be in the region of $7m; it was neither party’s fault that the development c harge was mistakenly estimated; the fac t that the development c harge was grossly overestimated resulted in the sale pric e of the property under the Sale and Purc hase Agreement being an undervalue, whic h prompted the STB to dismiss the applic ation for the c ollec tive sale; and the mistake in the development c harge, whic h in turn c aused the property to be grossly undervalued, was a vital attribute of the c onsideration (being the sale pric e) to be provided, sinc e a high development c harge would lower the open market value and henc e sale pric e of the development. 

37     On the other hand, D&N submitted that the majority owners were fully aware that they had used an estimated development c harge for the purpose of determining the sale pric e of the property under the Sale and Purc hase Agreement; that they had rejec ted Colliers’ advic e to asc ertain the ac tual development c harge payable; and that although Allgreen had offered to make the sale pric e subjec t to any c hanges in the development c harge whic h was payable, the majority owners had 


deliberately and c onsc iously rejec ted this offer in favour of loc king in the sale pric e at $34m in order to ensure c ertainty of sale. In support of its submissions, D&N referred me to an exc hange of e-mail between Colliers’ representative and the Sales Committee. In the 9 April 2007 e-mail, Colliers had informed the Sales Committee as follows: 

 Dear Sale Committee, 

 Following the meeting on 2 April 2007 at M/s YeoLeong & Peh’s offic e, we note that the subjec t of the development baseline for Regent Garden was brought up again by Ms Wong Lai Keen [see [7] supra ]. 

 If you all c an rec all, the subjec t of the development baseline was brought to attention soon after our appointment by the sale c ommittee as the marketing agent sometime in July 2006. For buildings approved prior to 1 September 1989, there is a requirement for an arc hitec t to rec ompute the Gross Floor Area (GFA) of the building ac c ording to the new definition of GFA when a Development Baseline enquiry is made. We obtained a verbal quotation of $11,000/from M/s Cyril K H Seah Arc hitec ts to rec ompute the GFA, and this was c onveyed to the sale c ommittee then. The sale committee felt that owners were unlikely to pay for the extra cost, considering that the MC funds could not be used for this purpose. Hence, the development baseline enquiry was not made. 

 However, for our marketing purposes, we applied at our own c ost to URA for the planning rec ords to obtain the approved GFA for Regent Garden based on the submission plans bac k in 1980. The approved GFA in 1980 was indic ated as 5880.44 sq m, whic h translates to a plot ratio of 0.8355. This was of course subject to the usual disclaimer that it shall not be construed as the development baseline, but it will at least provide the developers with a guide as to the estimated development baseline, in lieu of an official baseline enquiry reply ... 

 [emphasis added] 

Wong Lai Keen’s response to this was: 

 After muc h deliberation, the Sale Committee has dec ided not to subjec t the [Sale and Purc hase Agreement] to any development baseline. We need to have more c ertainty of sale. 

38     The following passage from _Chitty on Contracts_ , vol 1 (Sweet & Maxwell, 29th Ed, 2004) (“ _Chitty on Contracts_ ”) (at para 5-052) is a helpful summary of the present state of the law on c ommon mistake: 

 In c ases in whic h there is some other c ommon mistake [other than as to the existenc e or ownership of things] as [to] the surrounding fac ts, or perhaps the law, the c ontrac t may be void but only if the mistake means that performanc e of the c ontrac t would be impossible, or would be essentially or fundamentally different to what was c ontemplated by the parties. There are rival formulations of the princ iple. One is Lord Atkin’s, that a c ommon mistake as to the quality of the subjec t matter may render a c ontrac t void if it makes the thing without the quality essentially different from the thing as it was believed to be [per Bell v Lever Brothers, Ltd [1932] AC 161 at 218]. The other is the Court of Appeal’s in The Great Peace , that a c ommon mistake may render a c ontrac t void if it makes the c ontrac tual adventure impossible... Both make it c lear that it will only be in exc eptional c irc umstanc es, when the mistake makes the c ontrac t c ompletely different to what the parties both thought they were about, that the c ontrac t will be void for c ommon mistake. [emphasis added] 

 [note: 15] 

 [note: 16] 


39     It should further be noted that whatever the formulation used, a c ontrac t will not be void for c ommon mistake if one of the parties has assumed responsibility for the risk of that mistake: see _Chitty on Contracts_ at para 5-054. In _The Great Peace_ , Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR stated (at [84]): 

 Onc e the c ourt determines that unforeseen c irc umstanc es have, indeed, resulted in the c ontrac t being impossible of performanc e, it is next nec essary to determine whether, on [a] true c onstruc tion of the c ontrac t, one or [the] other party has undertaken responsibility for the subsistenc e of the assumed state of affairs. This is another way of asking whether one or other party has undertaken the risk that it may not prove possible to perform the contract... [emphasis added] 

40     In the present c ase, the Sale and Purc hase Agreement was not void for c ommon mistake for the following reasons. First, it is c lear that the c ommon mistake must be as to an existing state of affairs ( _ie_ , fac t) or law (see 5-052 in _Chitty on Contracts_ , set out at [40] _supra_ ; see also _The Great Peace_ at [76]). Given that the majority owners knew that the estimated development c harge was prec isely that – an estimate – there c ould have been no material c ommon mistake as to fac ts (suc h as the ac tual development c harge or ac tual market value of the property). 

41     In any c ase, the key point is that the majority owners had assumed the risk that the ac tual development c harge would be higher than the estimated development c harge by c onsc iously dec iding not to make a development baseline enquiry and by not making the sale subjec t to any development baseline (see [39] _supra_ ). They had c hosen to enter into the Sale and Purc hase Agreement in the knowledge that the figure of around $7m was an estimate of the development c harge and c annot now be allowed to esc ape their c ontrac tual obligations merely to esc ape what has turned out to be a bad bargain. It should also be noted that the assumption of risk was not one-sided. Had it turned out that the development c harge payable was in fac t muc h higher than the estimated development c harge, the Sale and Purc hase Agreement would have been equally enforc eable against Allgreen. Indeed this was the very essenc e of the dec ision of the Sale Committee not to subjec t the c ollec tive sale to any development baseline as they wanted to have “more c ertainty of sale” (see [39] _supra_ ). In respec t of the development c harge, the bargain between the parties was that Allgreen was to bear the risk of it being higher than the $7m-odd estimated and it would c orrespondingly rec eive the benefit of it being less than that sum. 

**Additional payments to the minority owners** 

42     WTL submitted that, by agreeing with the minority owners to make additional payments to them, Allgreen had ac ted in breac h of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement. The equitable distribution of the sale proc eeds envisaged in c l 24 of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement (whic h materially reproduc ed c l 10.1 of the Collec tive Sale Agreement) and Sc hedule C of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement (whic h materially reproduc ed Sc hedule F of the Collec tive Sale Agreement see [13] _supra_ ) had been dislodged by the additional payments to the minority owners whic h resulted in them rec eiving a disproportionately larger amount of money than the majority owners for the units of the same strata area and share value. WTL also argued that it was implic it in c l 3(8) of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement that any negotiations for the proc urement of unanimous c onsent should not be c arried out to the detriment of the majority owners. It argued that the making of the additional payments to the minority owners was also in violation of the objec ts and intents of the Ac t whic h was to ensure that the sale proc eeds would be fairly distributed amongst all owners suc h that no one owner is treated less favourably than another. 

43     D&N submitted that nothing in the Sale and Purc hase Agreement, Collec tive Sale Agreement or 


the Ac t expressly prohibited the making of the additional payments to the minority owners. Clause 24 of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement (materially reproduc ing c l 10.1 of the Collec tive Sale Agreement) expressly referred to the “Purc hase Pric e” of the property, whic h is the $34m. It was c lear that it was this $34m that had to be apportioned in ac c ordanc e with Sc hedule C (materially reproduc ing Sc hedule F of the Collec tive Sale Agreement). There was nothing in the Sale and Purc hase Agreement or the Collec tive Sale Agreement whic h stipulated that any payments made over and above the sale pric e under those agreements had to be apportioned in ac c ordanc e with the method of apportionment in the sc hedules, or that no payments over and above the sale pric e c ould be made to any of the owners of the property, whether by Allgreen or by the other owners. Similarly, there was nothing in the Ac t whic h prohibited developers from either negotiating direc tly with minority owners or providing them monetary inc entives in order to proc ure their c onsent to a c ollec tive sale. 

44     D&N further argued that WTL had not fulfilled their burden of proving that an implied term against the making of the additional payments to the minority owners existed, pointing me to the authority of _Loh Siok Wah v American International Assurance Co Ltd_ <span class="citation">[1999] 1 SLR 281</span> (“ _Loh Siok Wah_ ”) (at [29]). It pointed out that the more c omplex a c ontrac t, the less room there is for implied terms (espec ially where solic itors are involved): _Jani-King (GB) Ltd v Pula Enterprises Ltd_ [2008] 1 All ER (Comm) 451; _Oshawa v Village Shopping Plaza_ 1989 ACWSJ Lexis 18518 (at [18] to [20]). D&N referred me to the affidavit of Tan Tiong Cheng (Managing Direc tor of Knight Frank Pte Ltd) filed on 18 January 2007 in OS 90/2008 to show that the prac tic e of offering additional payments to minority owners to proc ure their c onsent to the sale of the relevant property is widely adopted within the industry. It c ontended that, in light of suc h industry prac tic e, the majority owners would have made express provision in the Collec tive Sale Agreement and/or Sale and Purc hase Agreement if they did not want suc h payments to be made. 

45     I found that there was no express provision against the making of the additional payments to the minority owners in the Collec tive Sale Agreement or Sale and Purc hase Agreement. Clause 24 of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement c learly provides that the method of apportionment set out in Sc hedule C pertains to the Purc hase Pric e. Although “Purc hase Pric e” is not explic itly defined in the Sale and Purc hase Agreement, c l 1 c learly provides that Allgreen shall purc hase all 31 units and the c ommon property in the property for $34m. (The Collec tive Sale Agreement is even c learer: c l 10. refers to “the Sale Pric e” whic h is defined in c l 1.1 as “the total Sale Pric e of All Units in ac c ordanc e with this Agreement”.) No express provision is made in either agreement as to the legitimac y or distribution of any payments made in addition to this purc hase or sale pric e. 

46     As for the existenc e of the implied term, the following c onditions (whic h may overlap) are set out in _Loh Siok Wah_ at [29] for the implic ation of a term into a given c ontrac t: 

 (1) [the term] must be reasonable and equitable; 

 (2) it must be nec essary to give business effic ac y to the c ontrac t, so that no term will be implied if the c ontrac t is effec tive without it; 

 (3) it must be so obvious that “it goes without saying”; 

 (4) it must be c apable of c lear expression; and 

 (5) it must not c ontradic t any express term of the c ontrac t. 

47     It is apparent that c ondition (2) is in fac t the “business effic ac y” test while c ondition (3) is the “offic ious bystander” test: see _Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Pte Ltd_ 


<span class="citation">[2006] 1 SLR 927</span> (“ _Forefront Medical Technology_ ”) at [28] to [31]. In _Forefront Medical Technology_ , the Court of Appeal dec ided that these two tests are in fac t integrated and c omplementary, in the sense that “the ‘offic ious bystander’ test is the prac tic al mode by whic h the ‘business effic ac y’ test is implemented” ( _Forefront Medical Technology_ at [36]). In other words, to quote Sc rutton LJ in _Reigate v Union Manufacturing Company (Ramsbottom) Limited_ [1918] 1 KB 592 at 605 (quoted with approval i n _Forefront Medical Technology_ at [35]; see also _Telestop Pte Ltd v Telecom Equipment Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2004] SGHC 267</span> at [68]): 

 [a] term c an only be implied if it is nec essary in the business sense to give effic ac y to the c ontrac t; that is, if it is suc h a term that it c an c onfidently be said that if at the time the c ontrac t was being negotiated some one had said to the parties, “What will happen in suc h a c ase,” they would have both replied, “Of c ourse, so and so will happen; we did not trouble to say that; it is too c lear”. 

48     The c ourt will not lightly imply terms into a c ontrac t (espec ially c ontrac ts negotiated between parties at arms’ length, as in the present c ase) and the majority owners have not persuaded me that an implied term against the making of the additional payments to the minority owners exists. Without suc h a term, the Sale and Purc hase Agreement was still perfec tly c apable of performanc e, in the sense of the sale of the property to Allgreen for the pric e of $34m, and thus the “business effic ac y” test (as integrated with the “offic ious bystander” test) was not fulfilled. WTL’s argument that it was implic it in c l 3(8) that any negotiations for the proc urement of unanimous c onsent should not be c arried out to the detriment of the majority owners is also weak. Quite apart from the fac t that it does not pass the business effic ac y test, it begs the question of what c onstitutes “detriment” to the majority owners. The fac t that the majority owners now have to sell the property below its “market value” c annot suffic e, sinc e under ordinary c ontrac tual princ iples parties c annot be allowed to esc ape a properly formed c ontrac t simply bec ause it turned out to be a bad bargain after they had asc ertained what the development c harge was. Nor c an the fac t that the majority owners end up rec eiving disproportionately less than the minority owners c onstitute “detriment”, sinc e WTL would then be making the proposition that although the majority owners had, at the time of signature, been perfec tly willing to sell their units at a partic ular pric e, the fac t that the minority owners will rec eive a larger sum in order for the sale to proc eed is somehow detrimental to the majority owners even though this will permit the sale to be c arried out on exac tly the same terms as the majority owners had c ontrac ted for in respec t of their units. 

49     I note that WTL had c ast aspersions on the evidenc e of Tan Tiong Cheng as to the alleged industry prac tic e of the making of additional payments to the minority owners (in WTL’s skeletal submissions in response to D&N’s submissions made on 28 February 2008 at [64] to [68]). However, I had in any c ase given little weight to this evidenc e in reac hing my dec ision that WTL had failed to satisfy the test for implying a term against the making of the additional payments to the minority owners. 

50     It remains to deal with WTL’s submissions in respec t of the Ac t. Sinc e the unanimous c onsent of the owners of the property had been obtained there is no need for an order by the STB under s 84A of the Ac t in order for the Sale and Purc hase Agreement to be binding on all the owners (see [59] _infra_ ). 

51     For these reasons, I found that there was no express or implied term in the Sale and Purc hase Agreement, Collec tive Sale Agreement and the Ac t prohibiting the additional payments to the minority owners. It follows that there was in fac t no wrongful repudiation of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement (and Collec tive Sale Agreement) by Allgreen to be ac c epted by the majority owners and thus I did not order any damages to be paid to the majority owners. It also follows that the minority owners are 


entitled to retain these additional payments and are under no obligation to share the additional payments they have rec eived from Allgreen with the majority owners. 

**Whether cl 3(5) of the Sale and Purchase Agreement was fulfilled** 

52     WTL submitted that, the parties having agreed in c l 3(5) of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement (see [10] _supra_ ) that the sale to Allgreen of the property was “c onditional and subjec t” to the STB’s approval, the parties were disc harged from the Sale and Purc hase Agreement sinc e the STB had not approved the sale during the STB hearing. It further submitted that c l 3(5) c ould not be deemed to be fulfilled by virtue of c l 3(8) of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement (see [12] _supra_ ) for the reasons set out below. 

53     Firstly, the minority owners c ould not have unanimously c onsented to the sale as they were not even parties to the Collec tive Sale Agreement. The minority owners had purported to c onsent to the Collec tive Sale Agreement between 26 and 28 November 2007. This was outside the permitted time as defined in c l 1.1 of that agreement ( _ie_ , a period of six months from the first subsidiary proprietor’s signature on 26 August 2006). That being the c ase, they were only entitled to bec ome parties to the Collec tive Sale Agreement with the approval of the Sale Committee, whic h was not obtained in the present c ase. They c ould not by signing the deeds of c onsent (see [21] _supra_ ) unilaterally make themselves parties to the Collec tive Sales Agreement. To support this prerequisite of approval by the Sales Committee, WTL relied on: c l 3.5 of the Collec tive Sale Agreement whic h provides that a person who is not party to the Collec tive Sale Agreement has no right under the Contrac ts (Rights of Third Parties Ac t)(Cap 53B, 2002 Rev Ed) to enforc e any term of that agreement; apparently well-known and established princ iples that a non-party to an agreement c annot unilaterally make itself party to the agreement without the prior approval of the existing parties thereto; and c l 4 of the Collec tive Sale Agreement, in partic ular c l 4.3.2.1, whic h c onstituted the Sales Committee as the agent for the c onsenting owners under the Collec tive Sale Agreement and c l 4.2.7, whic h gave the Sales Committee the authority to sign on behalf of those c onsenting owners any doc uments required by the purc haser for the purposes of or inc idental to suc h a sale. 

54     Sec ondly, WTL submitted that “unanimous c onsent” must mean that the minority owners c onsented to the sale of the property to Allgreen on the same and identic al terms as those agreed to by the majority owners as set out in the Collec tive Sale Agreement and Sale and Purc hase Agreement, so as to be in c omplete ac c ord with the majority owners. In partic ular, the minority owners must have also agreed to sell their respec tive units on a c ollec tive basis for a total sale pric e of $34m and for eac h of the owners to get a share of the sale pric e of $34m based on the method of apportionment set out in Sc hedule F of the Collec tive Sale Agreement (whic h is the same as that in Sc hedule C of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement). The additional payments to the minority owners, although it would not affec t the distribution of the $34m rec eived as the sale pric e under the Sale and Purc hase Agreement, would effec tively result in the minority owners getting a larger proportion of the ac tual sale proc eeds as c ompared with majority owners having units of equivalent strata area or share value, displac ing the agreed method of apportionment under whic h owners were to rec eive a share of the proc eeds in proportion to the strata area or share value of their units. Therefore, there c ould be no unanimous c onsent under c l 3(8) suc h as would fulfil c l 3(5) of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement. 

55     Thirdly, c l 3(8) was intended for the benefit of the parties. It c ould not have been c ontemplated by the parties that c l 3(8) would be used in a manner that would result in loss to the majority owners (as they would have to sell their units below the market pric e, whic h WTL submitted was at least $39.7m for the property: see [18] _supra_ ), wrongful gain to Allgreen (sinc e it would get the property for less than its market value) and disproportionate gain to the minority owners (see 


[44] _supra_ ). 

56     D&N submitted that it was not nec essary to obtain the STB’s approval for the sale of the property. There were two ways in whic h sale of the property c ould be ac hieved: first, the statutory route via an applic ation to the STB under s 84A of the Ac t (as envisaged in c ll 3(5) and (6) of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement); and sec ondly, the c ontrac tual or c ommon law route whereby all the subsidiary proprietors of the property c ould unanimously c onsent to the sale (as envisaged in c l 3(8)). In respec t of WTL’s arguments pertaining to whether the minority owners were parties to the Collec tive Sale Agreement, the key provision pertaining to permitted time was c l 3.1.4 of that agreement. Clause 3.1.4 provided that the Collec tive Sale Agreement would expire if subsidiary proprietors holding at least 80% of the share values of the property did not sign the Collec tive Sale Agreement within the permitted time. However, the requisite 80% c onsent had been obtained in the present c ase and the Collec tive Sale Agreement did not expire. There was nothing in c l 3.1.4 or indeed the rest of the Collec tive Sale Agreement to prevent other subsidiary proprietors from bec oming party to the Collec tive Sale Agreement after the permitted time, and in fac t, c l 3(8) of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement envisaged that either party had up to 12 months from the date of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement to proc ure the c onsent of the minority owners, _ie_ , after the permitted time and indeed even after the applic ation to the STB for an order of sale. It was ludic rous to suggest that the minority owners had to be or were represented by the Sale Committee in signing up to the Collec tive Sale Agreement, sinc e prior to suc h signing they would not have indic ated their c onsent to being bound by its terms, inc luding those c lauses c onstituting the Sales Committee as agent and representative of the c onsenting owners. Finally, D&N c ontended that the minority owners had expressed their c onsent to the Collec tive Sale Agreement in the same manner as the majority owners. D&N pointed out that there was no real differenc e between the c ases of one of the majority owners, Alias B Mhd Sarif (who had signed a letter on 21 February 2007 expressing his c onsent to Collec tive Sale Agreement, followed by signing on a c opy of the Collec tive Sale Agreement ), and one of the minority owners, Li Hang, who had signed a deed of c onsent and signed on a c opy of the Collec tive Sale Agreement. D&N referred me to c l 3.4 of the Collec tive Sale Agreement, whic h allowed for exec ution of the Collec tive Sale Agreement on separate c opies thereof and at different times. 

57     In my view, it was c lear that the failure to obtain approval for the c ollec tive sale of the property at the STB hearing was not fatal to the Sale and Purc hase Agreement. An applic ation to the STB under s 84A of the Ac t is only nec essary where there is no unanimous c onsent by the subsidiary proprietors of the property in question. This is also evident from the statement of then Minister of State for Law, Assoc iate Professor Ho Peng Kee, at the Sec ond Reading of the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Bill that: 

 [N]o applic ation needs to be made to the Strata Titles Board if all the owners agree to the sale. In other words, applic ation to the Board is not a pre-requisite to all en-bloc sales but only when there is no unanimous c onsent. 

The terms agreed to by the parties in the Sale and Purc hase Agreement also leave no doubt that the parties had c ontemplated that the approval of the STB would not be nec essary where there is unanimous c onsent. Although c l 3(5) states that “the sale and purc hase of the Property is c onditional and subjec t to the approval of the Strata Title Board”, c l 3(8) provides that (and it is worth setting out the c lause again in full): 

 If at any time on or before the expiry of 12 months from the date of this Agreement , all the owners shall unanimously consent to the Collec tive Sale and the sale herein, then the condition set out in Clause 3(5) hereof shall be deemed to be satisfied. [emphasis added] 

 [note: 17] [note: 18] 

 [note: 19] 

 [note: 20] 


58     I turn next to the question of whether c l 3(8) of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement was satisfied. There is no definition of the terms “the Collec tive Sale” or “the sale herein”, but I ac c ept WTL’s interpretation of these as referring to the Collec tive Sale Agreement and the Sale and Purc hase Agreement respec tively. 

59     In respec t of WTL’s first submission on c l 3(8) (see [55] _supra_ ), the relevant c lauses of the Collec tive Sale Agreement are set out for ease of referenc e: 

 3.1.2 This Agreement shall be exec uted by the subsidiary proprietors of the units having not less than eighty perc ent (80%) of the share values as shown in the sc hedule of strata units for the [property] within the permitted time. 

 ... 

 3.1.4 This Agreement shall expire and be of no further effec t upon any of the following events arising (whic hever is earlier):

 3.1.4.1 if only subsidiary proprietors holding less than eighty perc ent (80%) of the share values in the [property] sign this Agreement within the permitted time; or 

 3.1.4.2 if within twelve (12) months from the date the subsidiary proprietors of the units having not less than eighty per c ent (80%) of the share values as shown in the sc hedule of strata units for the [property] have signed this Agreement 

 3.1.4.2.1 There is no Contrac t of Sale; and 

 3.1.4.2.2. Where applic able, an applic ation to the STB has not been made pursuant to the terms of the Contrac t of Sale and/or this Agreement. 

 3.1.4.3. The c ompletion of the Collec tive Sale to the Purc haser and the delivery of vac ant possession in ac c ordanc e with the terms of the Contrac t of Sale. 

60     I was of the view that the provision relating to “permitted time” in c l 3.1.4.1 merely pertains to the period within whic h subsidiary proprietors holding at least 80% of the share values in the property must sign the Collec tive Sale Agreement, in order for it to remain in forc e. There is no provision in either the Collec tive Sale Agreement or Sale and Purc hase Agreement mandating that the minority owners must obtain approval from the Sale Committee before they c ould bec ome party to the Collec tive Sale Agreement. The provisions relied on by WTL did not in fac t support this proposition. Clause 3.5 of the Collec tive Sale Agreement, whic h provides that a party who is not party to the Collec tive Sale Agreement has no right to enforc e any term of that agreement, merely begs the question of how one bec omes a party to the agreement. Clause 4 does not c reate an all-powers agenc y but instead provides for the authority of the Sale Committee to ac t on behalf of the c onsenting owners in c ertain spec ific matters or situations and whic h do not inc lude the approving of the entry into the Collec tive Sale Agreement of subsidiary proprietors who had not earlier c onsented to it. Indeed, the term “Consenting Owners” is simply defined in c l 1.1 of the Collec tive Sale Agreement as “the subsidiary proprietors who have signed this Agreement”. This must be read together with c l 3.4 whic h provides that the Collec tive Sale Agreement “shall be regarded as exec uted notwithstanding that it is exec uted on separate c opies thereof and at different times”. Thus, in prac tic e, a subsidiary proprietor is deemed to have c onsented to the Collec tive Sale Agreement so long as he exec utes, _ie_ , signs on a c opy of that Collec tive Sale Agreement, within 12 months from the date of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement (see c l 3(8) of the Sale and Purc hase 


Agreement). This is prec isely what the minority owners did in this c ase: see [21] _supra_. The c laim that “well-established c ontrac tual princ iples” that a non-party c annot unilaterally make itself party to an agreement without the prior approval of the existing parties thereto also holds no water, sinc e if this is the c ase, it must also logic ally mean that every majority owner who c omes onto the Collec tive Sale Agreement must seek the approval of the existing parties, _viz_ , the Collec tive Sale Committee, yet WTL had itself ac c epted that no suc h approval was required for the majority owners. 

61     As for WTL’s sec ond submission on c l 3(8) (see [56] _supra_ ), I have already explained how the additional payments to the minority owners do not in fac t dislodge the method of apportionment stipulated by the Collec tive Sale Agreement and Sale and Purc hase Agreement (see [47] _supra_ ). Thus, there is no basis to say that the minority owners had not c onsented to the terms of these agreements. 

62     Finally, in respec t of WTL’s third submission on c l 3(8), there was in fac t no “wrongful gain to Allgreen” as I have already dec ided above that the additional payments to the minority owners whic h resulted in their c onsent to the Collec tive Sale Agreement and Sale and Purc hase Agreement were not in breac h of those agreements or the Ac t (see [53] _supra_ ). For the same reason, it c annot be argued that c l 3(8) c annot operate in a situation where there is “disproportionate gain to the minority owners”. Nor c an it be said that c l 3(8) c ould not be relied on where this resulted in loss to the majority owners, sinc e suc h an argument would c ontravene the well-established princ iple that parties to a valid c ontrac t c annot exc use themselves from its terms merely bec ause they turn out to have made a bad bargain. 

63     For these reasons, I found that c l 3(8) of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement had been satisfied, suc h that the c ondition of sale in c l 3(5) of the same agreement was deemed to be satisfied. Therefore, the Sale and Purc hase Agreement subsisted suc h that the majority owners were obliged to c omplete the sale thereunder. 

**Alleged Further Agreement** 

64     WTL submitted that at the 19 November 2007 meeting, the parties had reac hed the alleged Further Agreement (see [24] _supra_ ) under whic h Allgreen agreed to pay the majority owners an amount of money on ac c ount of the fac t that the ac tual development c harge had turned out to be below the estimated development c harge on whic h the $34m offer had been based (“the additional sum”). WTL submitted that the additional sum c ould be c omputed as follows: 

 (a) $5.7m – being the differenc e between the sale pric e of $34m and $39.7m (the sec ond valuation: see [18] supra ); 

 (b) $6.35m – being the differenc e between the sale pric e of $34m and $40.35m (the average of the sec ond valuation of $39.7m and the third valuation of $41m: see [19] supra ); or 

 (c ) $6,685,553.00 – being the differenc e between the ac tual development c harge of $950,894.00 and the estimated development c harge of $7,636.447.00. 

65     WTL referred me to the affidavit of Ms Carolyn Tan filed on 22 January 2008, in whic h Ms Carolyn Tan averred that (at [31]): 

 The meeting [between her and Ms Jennifer Yeo (the solic itor from YLP) on 19 November 2007] therefore c onc luded on the basis and understanding that [Allgreen] and the Sale Committee represented by Jennifer and [her] respec tively agreed in princ iple for [Allgreen] to pay an 


 Additional Sum equivalent to the savings in the development c harge payable at the very minimum (“the Further Agreement”), and that Jennifer would revert to [her] with [Allgreen’s] instruc tions on whether they were agreeable to the Additional Sum being inc reased to $6.85 million. This was to salvage the deal for [Allgreen] by assisting them to overc ome the valuation problem in the sale pric e. 

66     However, WTL was unable to point to any direc t doc umentary evidenc e of the alleged Further Agreement. I was referred to [32] of Ms Carolyn Tan’s affidavit filed on 22 January 2008 for the explanation for this: 

 After that meeting, I c alled Ms Wong [Lai Keen] [see [7] supra ] to inform her of the positive development and the Further Agreement reac hed. Ms Wong then enquired whether I should have the Further Agreement and the fac t that Jennifer was to revert to me on [Allgreen’s] position as to the request for payment of the Additional Sum of $6.85 million c onfirmed in writing. I assured Ms Wong that there was no need for that. Based on Jennifer’s standing in soc iety and my great respec t and regard for Jennifer and the fac t that we had hitherto enjoyed a good working relationship, I saw no reason nor nec essity to request from Jennifer or to put on rec ord what we had agreed upon in writing. 

67     D&N submitted that Allgreen did not agree with the majority owners’ ac c ount of what had transpired during the without prejudic e disc ussions between the parties. Ac c ording to the affidavit evidenc e of Ms Jennifer Yeo: 

 There was no agreement whether in princ iple or otherwise on any ‘settlement’. Neither was there any ‘in princ iple’ understanding that there would be any settlement. Further, I expressly told Ms Carolyn Tan that I had no mandate at all to agree to any kind of settlement on behalf of the Defendant. She was told repeatedly that there must first be an offer in writing for the Defendant’s c onsideration. 

68     However, D&N c ontended that even if I were to ac c ept the minority owners’ ac c ount, there was no basis in law for the alleged Further Agreement. First, there was a lac k of agreement on the amount to be paid under the alleged Further Agreement, whic h rendered it unc ertain. D&N tabulated the different amounts that the majority owners had c laimed were to be paid to the majority owners under the alleged Further Agreement. It pointed out that the majority owners were trying to c irc umvent this fundamental unc ertainty by asking the c ourt to dec ide on the appropriate c omputation of the sum to be paid (see [66] _supra_ ). It c ontended that the lac k of agreement on the amount to be paid was further c orroborated by the fac t that a draft supplemental agreement whic h had been sent by T&A to YLP on 29 November 2007 (“the draft supplemental agreement”) was left blank where the amount that Allgreen had allegedly agreed to pay should have been stipulated. 

69     Sec ondly, the alleged Further Agreement was not enforc eable as s 6(d) of the Civil Law Ac t (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) states that: 

 No ac tion shall be brought against... any person upon any c ontrac t for the sale or other disposition of immovable property, or any interest in suc h property... unless the promise or agreement upon whic h suc h ac tion is brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, is in writing and signed by the party to be c harged therewith or some other person lawfully authorised by him. 

The alleged Further Agreement was a variation of a c ontrac t for the sale of immovable property and was also subjec t to the requirements of this sec tion: _Chitty on Contracts_ at para 4-015. The alleged 

 [note: 21] 

 [note: 22] 

[note: 23] 


Further Agreement was c learly not in writing and the draft supplemental agreement failed to c onstitute a memorandum or note thereof, sinc e suc h a memorandum or note must evidenc e in writing all the material terms of the agreement, inc luding the pric e: _Tay Joo Sing v Ku Yu Sang_ <span class="citation">[1994] 3 SLR 719</span> at [19] (“ _Tay Joo Sing_ ”). 

70     D&N submitted that the fac t that the alleged Further Agreement was a mere afterthought on the majority owners’ part was c lear from the evidenc e. In various c orrespondenc es to YLP after the alleged meeting between Ms Carolyn Tan and Ms Jennifer Yeo on 19 November 2007, T&A had not onc e mentioned the alleged Further Agreement. It was only in the 19 Dec ember 2007 WTL letter (see [24] _supra_ ) that the existenc e of the alleged Further Agreement was first raised. 

71     D&N also submitted that there was no c onsideration for the alleged Further Agreement, sinc e in exc hange for the additional sum to be paid under it, the majority owners merely promised to use their best endeavours to obtain the STB’s approval for the sale of the property, whic h they were already obliged to do under c l 3(6) of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement. Finally, it advanc ed the argument that the alleged Further Agreement had been obtained by ec onomic duress, _viz_ , the possibility that the Sale and Purc hase Agreement might not be c ompleted bec ause the majority owners would objec t to the sale at the STB hearing. 

72     I found that there was no further agreement entered into between the parties. It was diffic ult to believe that Ms Carolyn Tan and the Sale Committee would have c hosen not to c onfirm suc h an important agreement in writing. The absenc e of doc umentary evidenc e c ould only have meant that the parties did not in fac t arrive at any suc h further agreement. In my view, the draft supplemental agreement was the offer in writing made by T&A (on behalf of the Sale Committee) to Allgreen to make an additional payment to the majority owners, whic h Ms Jennifer Yeo had averred she requested from Ms Carolyn Tan. Allgreen had not ac c epted this offer and thus no further agreement was formed. As for the lac k of mention of the alleged Further Agreement in subsequent c orrespondenc e between the parties, WTL c laimed that the reason for this was that after YLP had informed the majority owners that unanimous c onsent had been obtained in the letter dated 30 November 2007 (see [23] _supra_ ), the Sale Committee had bec ome disenc hanted with Allgreen and dec ided to seek further advic e from WTL instead (thus leading to the first mention of the alleged Further Agreement in the 19 Dec ember 2007 WTL letter: see [24] _supra_ ). I was not c onvinc ed by this argument. The letter from T&A to YLP on 6 Dec ember 2007 is revealing. It states at para 6: 

 ...[P]lease c onfirm that the Minority Owners have agreed to the apportionment formula for the sale proc eeds and that your c lients have not agreed to pay an additional sum to them. If so, then the additional sums your clients have agreed to pay the Minority Owners must be included in the Sale Price and distributed according to the apportionment formula in the Collective Sale Agreement and the Sale & Purchase Agreement. [emphasis added] 

73     The Sale Committee was not so disenc hanted with Allgreen as to refrain from making the request in the emphasised portion of this quote. Indeed, suc h a request should have been entirely unnec essary if the alleged Further Agreement had indeed been reac hed at the 19 November 2007 meeting. Thus, my c onc lusion was that there was in fac t no suc h further agreement. 

74     In any c ase, even if the alleged Further Agreement had been reac hed at the 19 November 2007 meeting, it was only oral and not made in writing signed by the party to be c harged, and therefore under s 6(d) of the Civil Law Ac t no ac tion c ould be brought on it as it pertained to a c ontrac t for the sale of immovable property. WTL argued that the alleged Further Agreement was a c ollateral agreement not involving the ac quisition of land but rather pertaining only to the making of additional payment, and thus did not have to satisfy s 6(d) of the Civil Law Ac t: _Chitty on Contracts_ at 4-016. 

 [note: 24] 

 [note: 25] 

 [note: 26] 


However, that paragraph from _Chitty on Contracts_ states: 

 If a c ollateral agreement, not involving the ac quisition of land, is entered into at or before the time of making a written contract concerning land , the c ollateral agreement does not have to be evidenc ed in writing. [emphasis added] 

75     In the present c ase, the alleged Further Agreement was not entered into at or before the making of the Sale and Purc hase Agreement and thus it c ould not be c onsidered a c ollateral c ontrac t so as to esc ape the requirements in s 6(d) of the Civil Law Ac t. I ac c epted D&N’s submission that _Tay Joo Sing_ made it c lear that the draft supplemental agreement c ould not c onstitute a note or memorandum of the alleged Further Agreement so as to satisfy s 6(d) of the Civil Law Ac t, bec ause the draft supplemental agreement did not c ontain the key term – the amount to be paid. 

76     For the reasons above, I found that WTL’s arguments on the alleged Further Argument c ould not stand. It was thus unnec essary to c anvass the arguments on unc ertainty, c onsideration and ec onomic duress. At the risk of stating the obvious, it should also be noted that the majority owners c ould rec eive no damages for the repudiation of an alleged Further Agreement that did not in fac t exist. 

**Fraud on the Revenue** 

77     It remains to deal with one last point. WTL submitted that the purc hase of the minority owners’ units would have to be stamped for a sum inc luding the additional payments to the minority owners. To the extent this is not done, Allgreen would be c ommitting fraud on the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”). I ac c epted D&N’s response it is for Allgreen to persuade IRAS that the sale pric e of the property is $34m and that the additional payments rec eived by eac h minority owner are not relevant for the purposes of stamp duty. There is no suggestion that Allgreen will suppress any information from IRAS. It is for IRAS to determine what stamp duty is ultimately payable by Allgreen. 

**Costs** 

78     I ordered the majority owners to pay the c osts of SUM 547/2008 to the minority owners. The c osts of OS 90/2008 (not inc luding SUM 547/2008) and OS 54/2008 were ordered to be paid by the majority owners to Allgreen, to be taxed if not agreed.
