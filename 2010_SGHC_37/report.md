_Civil Procedure_ 

1 February 2010 Judgment reserved. 

**Philip Pillai JC:** 

1       The plaintiff was earlier granted summary judgment on its ac tion in whic h the defendant had filed an original c ounterc laim. The defendant’s applic ation for a stay of exec ution based on its original c ounterc laim was unsuc c essful as it did not raise a plausible c ounterc laim that would merit a stay. 

2       This is an applic ation by the defendant for leave to amend its c ounterc laim. In the event that leave to amend is granted, the defendant has made a further applic ation for the judgment made on 12 January 2010 granting summary judgment to the plaintiff to be varied by an order to stay exec ution on the plaintiff’s summary judgment pending the trial of the defendant’s amended c ounterc laim. 

**Whether to grant leave to amend counterclaim?** 

3       The defenc e c ites para 14/1/11 of _Singapore Court Practice 2009_ (LexisNexis, 2009) (“ _Singapore Court Practice_ ”) in support of its need to amend its c ounterc laim at this preliminary stage: 

 The plaintiff must ensure that all nec essary amendments to his statement of c laim are made prior to filing his applic ation for summary judgment. This princ iple was rec ently reiterated by Woo Bih Li in Lee Hsien Loong, at [26]. Woo J also endorsed Chun Thong Ping v Soh Kok Hong <span class="citation">[2003] 2 SLR 204</span> (‘Chun Thong Ping’) on the point that where the plaintiff makes an applic ation to amend his statement of c laim in the c ourse of the summary judgment hearing prior to its c onc lusion, it will normally be permitted if the defendant is provided with the opportunity to amend his defenc e. 

4       The proposed amendments to the c ounterc laim are to add the c laim of false, untrue or fraudulent representations founded on oral disc ussions between the plaintiff and the defendant in c onnec tion with the Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”). The objec t of these amendments is c onsequentially to persuade the Court afresh that there is now a plausible c ounterc laim for an amount not less than the plaintiff’s c laim within the c irc umstanc es set out in _Singapore Civil Procedure 2007_ (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2007) (“ _Singapore Civil Procedure_ ”) at para 14/4/10 to wit: 


 (3) where there is no defenc e to the c laim but a plausible c ounterc laim of not less than the c laim is set up, judgment should be for the plaintiff on the c laim with c osts, stayed until the trial of the c ounterc laim; 

5       I would state at the outset that this is not a c ase in whic h the defendant’s right to apply for leave to amend its c ounterc laim may not be pursued hereafter under Order 20 Rule 5 of the Rules of Court and for a c ourt to permit suc h amendment as the c ourt may find appropriate under the princ iples enunc iated in _Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd_ [1987] AC 189 whic h were applied in _Wright Norman and anor v OCBC Ltd_ [ _1993_ ] 3 SLR(R) 640, <span class="citation">[1994] 1 SLR 513</span>. 

6       At this preliminary stage of the proc eedings relating to the defendant’s c ounterc laim, I do not see the applic ability of _Singapore Court Practice 2009_ at para 14/1/11 c ited by defenc e c ounsel. 

7       Ac c ordingly I have only to c onsider whether the amendments at this stage are warranted, taking into ac c ount that their c onc eded purpose is to provide the defendant with a stronger additional basis in support of its applic ation for a stay of exec ution. The immediate question before me however is whether to allow the applic ation for leave to amend and only if I were to grant suc h leave, to c onsider whether a stay of exec ution on the plaintiff’s summary judgment ought to be granted. For c ompleteness I should add that I was not minded to grant a stay of exec ution on the original c ounterc laim as it did not appear to me to present a plausible c ase. 

8       I am also mindful that in the event that leave is granted to the defendant to amend the c ounterc laim at this stage, the plaintiff would be entitled to file an amended defenc e to the c ounterc laim. 

9       I have c onsidered _Singapore Civil Procedure 2007_ at para 20/8/26 and _Ismail bin Ibrahim & Ors v Sum Poh Development Sdn Bhd & Anor_ [1988] 3 MLJ 348. I have further c onsidered _International Factors Leasing Ltd v Personal Representative of Tan Hock Kee (deceased) and others_ <span class="citation">[2003] 2 SLR(R) 1</span> and in partic ular _Invar Realty Pte Ltd v Kenzo Tange Urtec Inc_ <span class="citation">[1990] 2 SLR(R) 66</span> per Yong Pung How J: 

 The Court of Appeal in Sheppards v Wilkinson ... rec ognized that a c ounterc laim may be used by a party as a defenc e to a c laim in c ertain instanc es. The c ourt stated that a defendant ought not to be shut out from defending unless it was very c lear indeed that he had no c ase in the ac tion under disc ussion. There might be either a defenc e to the c laim whic h was plausible or there might be a c ounterc laim pure and simple. To shut out suc h a c ounterc laim would be an autoc ratic and violent use of O 14. The c ourt had no power to try suc h a c ounterc laim on suc h an applic ation, but, if they thought it so far plausible that it was not unreasonably possible for it to succeed if brought to trial, it ought not to be excluded. If the c ounterc laim was for a less sum than that c laimed then judgment might be signed, if there was no real defenc e, for so muc h of the amount of the c laim as was not c overed by the c ounterc laim. But if the c ounterc laimed overtopped the c laim and was really plausible, then the rule whic h had been often ac ted upon at c hambers, of allowing the defendants to defend without c onditions was the right one. There were however c irc umstanc es whic h might c all on the c ourt to ac t differently. If it was c lear that the c laim must suc c eed and there was really no defenc e to it, and the plaintiffs would only be put to expense in proving their c laim, then there ought to be judgment on the c laim, but the matter must be so dealt with that the defendants who had a plausible c ounterc laim must not be injured; and that would be done by staying exec ution on the judgment until the c ounterc laim had been tried. 

 [emphasis in bold added] 


10     The original c ounterc laim was founded on implied terms and c onstruc ting a c ontrac t arising out of an admittedly non-legally binding MOU. The amendments whic h are now proposed esc alate the c ounterc laims to inc lude false, untrue and fraudulent representations. 

11     It is not denied that the parties entered into an MOU whic h was not legally binding bec ause a legally binding agreement was premature in the c ontext of how their c ollaboration would eventually materialize. If based on this, it is now sought to enforc e the terms of the MOU by way of representations, it amounts to an indirec t route to legally enforc e what was c onc eded at the outset to be non-legally binding. This approac h has no merit. It is further sought to supplement this approac h by referenc e to oral disc ussions and representations in the c ontext of the c onc lusion of an admittedly non-legally binding MOU. Again this fails to meet the threshold of plausibility and in the c ontext of running these c ounterc laims for the purpose of obtaining a stay on the Plaintiff’s summary judgment. This leads me to my dec ision that a stay is not warranted in any event. 

12     Furthermore, sinc e the proposed amendments lac k partic ulars and quantific ation as to the damages c laimed, it is not possible to establish whether any damages rec overable in a trial would exc eed the amount payable to the Plaintiff under the summary judgment. 

13     In the light of the above, I am not satisfied that the defendant has raised a plausible c ounterc laim relating to false, untrue or fraudulent statements to persuade me to grant leave to amend the c ounterc laim at this stage of the proc eedings. 

14     As I have found that the defendant’s original and proposed amended c ounterc laim did not satisfy the threshold of a plausible c ounterc laim, the further applic ation to vary my original dec ision to allow a stay of exec ution of the Plaintiff’s summary judgment does not arise. 

15     The defendant’s applic ations are therefore denied. Costs of applic ation awarded to plaintiff to be agreed or taxed.
