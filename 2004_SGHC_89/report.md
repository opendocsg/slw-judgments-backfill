**Introduction** 

1       The plaintiff, whom I shall refer to as PAE, is a Singapore c ompany that has, sinc e 1976, been in the business of trading and distributing automotive spare parts, industrial c hemic als and brake fluids. In 1998, PAE wanted to diversify its business and maximise the use of its infrastruc ture and resourc es. In the last quarter of that year, PAE held disc ussions with one Ric hard Lim and the defendant, Chia Wah Siang (also known as Johnny Chia). As a result, in Dec ember 1998, PAE signed an agreement with a Swiss c ompany, Blaser Swisslube AG (“Blaser”), to bec ome the distributor of Blaser’s produc ts in Singapore and Malaysia. At the same time, PAE employed Mr Chia as manager of its newly c reated Industrial Materials & Produc ts Division. His main responsibility was to manage the distribution and sale of Blaser produc ts. 

2       On 26 June 2002, Blaser terminated the distributorship agreement with immediate effec t. On the same day, Mr Chia tendered his letter of resignation to PAE. Subsequently, Mr Chia went to work for a c ompany c alled Blaser Swisslube (S) Pte Ltd (“Blaser Singapore”) that had been inc orporated by Blaser to distribute its produc ts in Singapore and Malaysia. 

3       This ac tion was c ommenc ed in Oc tober 2002. Various c laims against Mr Chia have been made. The first is that he is liable under an indemnity agreement to pay PAE the sum of $23,224. being the amount of its losses for the financ ial year 2001. The sec ond is for the sum of $6,496 being salary in lieu of notic e of termination. The third is for damages quantified at $585,388.70 or alternatively $151,200 or damages as assessed arising out of the alleged breac h by Mr Chia of his duties of good faith and fidelity to PAE. Mr Chia has denied liability for all these c laims and has c ounterc laimed one month’s salary on the basis that PAE has wrongfully failed to pay him his salary for June 2002. 


**The facts** 

**_The formation of the relationship_** 

4       Blaser is a manufac turer of various types of oil used in industrial proc esses. In Singapore and Malaysia, its main business relates to the sale of water misc ible c utting oils (also c alled c oolants) to manufac turers employing prec ision metal c utting mac hines. For many years, the person who was ac tually handling suc h sales in these two territories was Mr Chia, although he was not himself the offic ial distributor appointed by Blaser. Instead, he was employed by Blaser’s offic ial distributor. From 1981 to 1996, the distributor was a c ompany c alled Universal Mac hine Tools Pte Ltd. In 1996, Mr Chia moved to a c ompany c alled Taiyo Kikai (S E Asia) Pte Ltd (“Taiyo Kikai”) and so did the Blaser distributorship. 

5       From 1996, one Hans Niederhäuser was employed by Blaser as its exec utive sales manager in c harge of the sale of Blaser produc ts in the Asia Pac ific region, inc luding Singapore and Malaysia. He testified that some time in the sec ond half of 1998, Blaser was dissatisfied with Taiyo Kikai’s performanc e due to falling sales and for other c ommerc ial reasons. 

6       Sometime in September or Oc tober 1998, Laurent Lee Yong Chong, the direc tor of business development of PAE and the son of PAE’s managing direc tor, Lee Meng Eng, met one Ric hard Lim, a manager of a c ompany assoc iated with Taiyo Kikai. Mr Lim wanted to know whether PAE was interested in bec oming Blaser’s distributor in plac e of Taiyo Kikai. Subsequently, Laurent Lee and his father met Mr Lim and Mr Chia to disc uss the distributorship business in more detail. At this meeting, the PAE representatives were shown a list of Blaser’s c ustomers and the monthly orders of c oolants. They were told that the annual turnover of the business was $1.5m (inc luding direc t sales by Blaser itself of some $200,000) and that the profit margin was between 30% and 40% of the sale pric es of the c oolants. Ac c ording to Mr Laurent Lee, Mr Chia told him that the annual sales revenue for Blaser c oolants c ould be inc reased to $3m within the next five years, as Mr Chia would be ac tively marketing these produc ts to other potential c ustomers in the disk drive industry and would also tap into other industries. It should be noted that in his testimony, Mr Chia denied that he had met PAE’s representatives before 1 Dec ember 1998. Instead, he said that Mr Lim ac ted as the liaison man with PAE and that his own role had been to relay to Blaser the terms PAE wanted as c ommunic ated to him by Mr Lim. Mr Chia also asserted that he himself played no part in Blaser’s dec ision to end its relationship with Taiyo Kikai and to work with PAE instead. 

7       Ac c ording to Mr Lee, it was agreed that both Mr Lim and Mr Chia would be employed by PAE and that PAE would set up an Industrial Materials & Produc ts Division (“the Division”) to handle Blaser produc ts and other produc ts whic h Mr Lim was intending to bring to PAE. It was agreed that Mr Lim and Mr Chia would eac h be paid a salary of $6,000 and eac h of them would also be entitled to 20% of the net profits of the Division. Laurent Lee was to take c harge of the operational ac tivities of the Division and the Division was to bear a portion of the monthly salaries of Mr Lee and his father. Mr Chia was to be responsible for the profitability of the Division and was required to c ome up with plans for the growth of the Division. Laurent Lee would then work with Mr Chia to exec ute the growth plans. Mr Lee also testified that the parties’ agreement on the remuneration terms was not based only on the c urrent annual sales revenue of $1.2m but also on Mr Chia’s projec tions of future sales of up to $3m per year within five years. 

8       In early November 1998, there was a brief meeting between Mr Lee and Mr Niederhäuser at whic h the latter asked about PAE’s financ ial c apability. He also gave PAE a c opy of the standard form Blaser distributorship agreement. During a subsequent meeting, Mr Niederhäuser refused to make any substantial c hanges to the agreement as he stated that it was Blaser’s standard agreement 


worldwide. On 11 November, PAE sent Blaser its first purc hase order for Blaser c oolants. This was for two c ontainer-loads of 160 drums of c oolants worth 112,672.80 Swiss Franc s paid for _via_ a letter of c redit established by PAE on 19 Dec ember 1998. The order was prepared by Mr Chia. 

9       The distribution agreement between PAE and Blaser was signed on 14 Dec ember 1998. It made PAE the sole distributor in Malaysia and Singapore of Blaser c oolants, auxiliary devic es and c ertain spec ified auxiliary produc ts (c ollec tively “Blaser produc ts”). The duration of the agreement was unlimited. Either party was entitled to terminate it by three months’ notic e. Additionally, immediate notic e of termination was permitted if “an extraordinary c irc umstanc e” existed. One suc h extraordinary c irc umstanc e was stated to be if Mr Johnny Chia left the employment of PAE. The agreement c ontained a non-c ompetition c lause (Art 4) that prevented PAE from selling “c ompeting produc ts whic h are identic al with or similar to” the Blaser produc ts. It also provided that if PAE wished to ac t as distributor for other produc ts it would have to inform Blaser of this fac t. 

10     The next day, 15 Dec ember 1998, Blaser served notic e of immediate termination of distributorship on Taiyo Kikai. On the same day, PAE made Mr Chia a written offer of employment. In the letter, the c ommenc ement date of Mr Chia’s employment was stated to be 15 Dec ember but subsequently, at Mr Chia’s request, this date was amended to 1 Dec ember 1998. There was also an indemnity agreement. By this doc ument, Mr Chia agreed to indemnify PAE from various expenses and losses inc urred in relation to the Division. I will disc uss the terms of this doc ument in more detail later. In the offer of employment, it was stated that Mr Chia’s overall job responsibility was to provide sales, marketing and produc t support func tions to the Division in relation to the produc ts that were assigned to his job func tion and territory. He was also to be ac c ountable for the Division’s “profit and loss func tions and long term growth objec tives”. Ac c ording to Mr Chia, he signed the employment c ontrac t on 15 Dec ember itself but only signed the indemnity agreement a week later on 22 Dec ember. It is PAE’s position, however, that the employment c ontrac t and the indemnity agreement were both signed on the same day, around 29 Dec ember 1998. 

11     Ric hard Lim joined PAE at the same time as Mr Chia. He remained with the c ompany for only five months. After he resigned in April 1999, PAE revised Mr Chia’s profit-sharing bonus to 30% of the net profits arising from the sales of Blaser’s c oolants and related equipment ac c essories. Mr Chia benefited from this profit-sharing arrangement in the financ ial years 1999 and 2000. In 1999 he rec eived a profit share of $12,431.61 and in 2000, his share of the profit was $15,104.03. In the financ ial year 2001, however, the Division suffered a net loss of $23,224.44. Mr Lee asked Mr Chia to indemnify PAE against the loss but Mr Chia was not happy about this. After some disc ussion, it was agreed that the loss of the Division was to be brought forward from 2001 to 2002 and that PAE would review the situation subsequently. On 10 January 2002, Mr Chia signed a letter agreeing to c anc el the profit-sharing arrangement. He says PAE required him to do this but PAE asserts that it was his own idea. 

12     At first, the Division func tioned well. Mr Chia generated a sales revenue of $1.081m in 1999 and this figure was c lose to the annual sales revenue of $1.2m that PAE was expec ting. Ac c ording to Mr Lee, however, after 1999, he began to realise that Mr Chia was laid-bac k and did very little marketing to potential c ustomers. When Mr Chia joined PAE he brought with him a c ustomer base of five major ac c ounts eac h of whic h purc hased an average quantity of two drums per month. Mr Chia also had about 45 other c ustomers who ordered muc h smaller quantities that amounted to less than 20% of the total revenue from the Division. During the three and a half years that Mr Chia was in PAE’s employ, the number of major c ustomers remained at five as Mr Chia sec ured only one new major c ustomer and that ac c ount was lost within 11 months. In 2000, sales revenue fell to $883,159.92 and in 2001, it dec lined further to $743,944.59. 


13     Mr Lee’s c omplaints about Mr Chia were that he was ill-disc iplined, unproduc tive and unc ommitted. His work habits were unsatisfac tory. He was habitually late for work and for meetings. He often left the offic e after two or three hours and very seldom returned to the offic e in the afternoon. Sometime in 2000, Mr Lee instituted a daily sales report for Mr Chia to fill up eac h day. Mr Chia was not happy about this requirement. Mr Lee remained unhappy, as to him, the reports showed that Mr Chia was unable to ac c ount for the length of time he spent away from the offic e. Mr Lee c onsidered that the reports c onfirmed his suspic ion that Mr Chia was doing very little to develop new major ac c ounts. 

14     Mr Chia, on the other hand, c onsidered that PAE treated him as a salesman rather than as the manager of the Division. He c omplained that he was not given a personal c omputer and without e-mail c ommunic ation with his c ustomers or others or a c omputer to do his paperwork on, he c ould not func tion properly in his job. As a salesman, his daily work inc luded visiting c ustomers at their premises, answering their queries and overseeing delivery of goods and providing after-sales servic e. He also had to provide Blaser with feedbac k and look after Mr Niederhäuser when the latter was in town. The demands of his job, he said, meant that he c ould not be in the offic e all the time and muc h time needed to be spent with c ustomers outside the offic e. 

**_Working relationship with Blaser_** 

15     Mr Lee asserted that throughout the years, PAE was fully c ommitted to the promotion of Blaser’s produc ts and interests. PAE sent Mr Lee for produc t training at Blaser’s offic e in Switzerland at its own expense. It also partic ipated in important annual trade shows in Singapore and Malaysia in 2000 and 2001. PAE purc hased and implemented a web-based online ordering software solution for Blaser’s produc ts c alled the Virtual Store Management (“VSM”) software. This c ost it $59,008.70. PAE also made plans to open an offic e in Kuala Lumpur and this was due to take plac e in the third quarter of 2002. 

16     In view of PAE’s c ommitment to the Blaser distributorship, it was c onc erned about Art 24.3 of the distributorship agreement whic h made the distributorship subjec t to the c ontinued employment of Mr Chia by PAE. In Dec ember 1999, Laurent Lee asked Mr Niederhäuser to rec onsider Art 24.3. At that stage, Mr Niederhäuser was not willing to delete the artic le as he thought that PAE did not have the tec hnic al resourc es to support Blaser’s c ustomers by itself. As time passed, Mr Lee bec ame more c onc erned about what he viewed as Mr Chia’s lac k of enthusiasm and c ommitment to inc rease Blaser’s sales. In November 2001, he met Mr Niederhäuser and again raised the issue of deleting Art 24.3. Ac c ording to Mr Lee, Mr Niederhäuser asserted that Blaser would not leave PAE high and dry without the distributorship and agreed to look into a modific ation of the artic le at the appropriate time. 

**_The Conoco distributorship_** 

17     From early 2000 onwards, PAE began to explore the possibility of bringing in other produc ts and/or servic es. In July 2000, PAE had disc ussions with one Jason Wong, the sales development manager of a c ompany c alled Conoc o International Inc (“Conoc o”). Conoc o is a manufac turer of industrial lubric ants. Its c ore produc ts are general or maintenanc e lubric ants suc h as greases for heavy vehic les and equipment. These lubric ants, produc ed by a base oil blending tec hnique known as the hydroc rac king proc ess, were touted as being c apable of performing like synthetic lubric ants. Conoc o also produc es a water-misc ible oil known as “Conoc o Soluble Oil”. In 2000, Conoc o had only two distributors, one for its automotive produc ts and the other for its c ommerc ial produc ts. It was looking for a third distributor to market lubric ants for industrial use. 

18     After several meetings, PAE signed a distributorship agreement with Conoc o in November 


2001\. PAE was appointed as distributor for “Conoc o lubric ant produc ts” whic h were defined as being Conoc o’s full range of lubric ant and grease produc ts listed in a spec ific pric e list. PAE was to distribute the produc ts in Singapore, Johor and Batam Island. After the agreement was signed, PAE ordered a c ontainer load of Conoc o produc ts. It was intended that there would be a soft launc h of the Conoc o produc ts in April 2002. In February 2002, PAE employed one James Choo to market Conoc o’s produc ts. 

19     Ac c ording to Mr Lee, PAE’s objec tive in entering into the Conoc o distributorship was to enhanc e its sales by providing c ustomers with a one-stop solution to their lubric ant needs, _ie_ with Blaser’s c oolants and Conoc o’s lubric ants. Conoc o’s c ore produc ts were not used for the same purposes as Blaser’s c oolants and PAE had no intention of selling any produc ts whic h c ompeted with Blaser’s c oolants. Although Conoc o did produc e c oolants these were low-end produc ts whic h c ame in one grade and were not c ompetitors of Blaser produc ts. PAE never sold any of Conoc o’s c oolants although sometime in February 2002, Mr Lee did purc hase some pails of Conoc o c oolants. He did this in order to plac ate Jason Wong for the lac k of ac tion on the launc h of the Conoc o lubric ants. 

20     Ac c ording to Mr Niederhäuser, in Marc h 2002 he disc overed from the envelope of a letter from PAE that PAE was a Conoc o distributor. He was alarmed by this disc overy as Conoc o was a manufac turer of a number of produc ts that were similar to those made by Blaser and he c onsidered Conoc o to be one of Blaser’s c ompetitors. On 20 Marc h 2002, Mr Niederhäuser sent Mr Lee an e-mail asking for details of its engagement with Conoc o. Mr Lee replied two days later and gave details of the Conoc o produc ts PAE was distributing. He assured Mr Niederhäuser that Conoc o produc ts were c omplementary to Blaser’s metalworking fluids and that PAE did not see any c onflic t of interest or c ause for c onfusion for the c ustomers. Mr Niederhäuser was still upset bec ause he c onsidered that one of the produc ts mentioned was a c utting oil whic h fell squarely within Blaser’s distribution agreement. Also this was the first time that PAE had mentioned anything about dealing in new produc ts inc luding Conoc o’s and the explanation was given only upon Mr Niederhäuser’s questioning. PAE had failed to inform Blaser of the distribution agreement with Conoc o before it had been c onc luded. Further c orrespondenc e followed between Mr Niederhäuser and Mr Lee. Mr Niederhäuser informed Mr Lee that sinc e PAE was dealing with c oolants and c utting oils as well as greases for Conoc o, Blaser saw a potential for c onflic t. Mr Lee sought to reassure Blaser by stating that the c oolant was a radiator c oolant and not a metalworking c oolant. Further, as regards the c utting oils, Blaser’s c utting oils were not for export and were not c overed by the distributorship agreement with PAE and therefore not part of the non-c ompetition c lause. Mr Lee stated that PAE had no problems dropping the Conoc o c utting oils if Blaser wanted PAE to distribute Blaser c utting oils. 

21     Mr Niederhäuser’s c onc erns were not assuaged by Mr Lee’s explanations. He c onsidered that disc ipline in the exc lusivity of Blaser’s distributorships had to be maintained in its various markets, espec ially an important one like Singapore. He stated that the management of Blaser c ould not tolerate PAE being given exc lusive rights to distribute Blaser produc ts in the region while at the same time it was distributing produc ts made by c ompetitors. If PAE was not sinc ere about observing this fundamental princ iple while ac ting as Blaser’s distributor, somebody else would be. Blaser’s management dec ided to terminate the distributorship agreement and issued a letter to this effec t on 14 June 2002. This letter was brought to Singapore by Mr Niederhäuser when he arrived here on 25 June 2002. 

22     Ac c ording to Mr Chia, sometime in April 2002, Mr Niederhäuser informed him that the Blaser board had dec ided to end their relationship with PAE. They had also dec ided to start a Blaser branc h in Singapore and to ask Mr Chia to run the new operation. Blaser wanted to serve its c ustomers direc tly as it had found it diffic ult to rely on third parties. Mr Chia knew that his job with PAE would c ome to an end onc e the Blaser distributorship was terminated. If he did not ac c ept Blaser’s offer, he 


would still have to look for another job. Several days later, he ac c epted Blaser’s offer. In early May 2002, Mr Niederhäuser c ame to Singapore to set up the new c ompany. He asked Mr Chia to be the loc al direc tor of Blaser Singapore. The latter agreed. 

23     In the meantime, blissfully ignorant of these developments, PAE had been exploring the possibility of selling Blaser’s neat c utting oils. These were not c overed by the distributorship agreement. In January 2002, Mr Lee was told that Blaser was c oming up with a wider range of neat c utting oils to be sold at c ompetitive pric es. PAE then c onduc ted a survey among c ustomers and disc overed that these pric es were c ompetitive. James Choo talked to prospec tive c lients about the Blaser neat oils and by May/June 2002, he reported to Mr Lee that there was a big market potential for these items. Various c ustomers had agreed to try them out. If the trials were suc c essful, at least 136 drums of oil would be sold. Mr Lee planned to present the demand for neat c utting oils whic h PAE had c reated in the market to Mr Niederhäuser when they next met. On 10 June 2002, Mr Niederhäuser informed PAE that he would be arriving in Singapore on 24 June and would like to have a meeting on 26 June to disc uss various topic s inc luding a review of the first half of 2002, the outlook for the sec ond half of the year and strategies of PAE and Blaser. 

**_Events of 26 June 2002_** 

24     On 26 June, Mr Chia pic ked Mr Niederhäuser up at his hotel and they arrived together at PAE’s offic e at about 9.45am where they met Mr Lee and James Choo. To the c onsternation of Laurent Lee, Mr Niederhäuser announc ed that Blaser was terminating the distributorship agreement and handed the 14 June letter to him. It stated that the distributorship was terminated with immediate effec t based on Art 24 of the agreement. This artic le had been violated and Blaser was terminating the agreement based on “extraordinary c irc umstanc es”. Ac c ording to Mr Lee, Mr Niederhäuser told PAE that the reasons for Blaser’s dec ision were that PAE was not happy working with Mr Chia, the sales were dropping eac h year and PAE was now c arrying Conoc o whic h was Blaser’s c ompetitor. Mr Niederhäuser was adamant about terminating the distributorship and refused to go into further disc ussions. PAE was informed that Blaser was setting up its own Singapore offic e and that Mr Chia would be working for Blaser Singapore. Mr Niederhäuser then asked PAE to return all Blaser stoc k-in-hand to him. He wanted a further meeting in the afternoon to asc ertain the value of the remaining stoc k. At 11.45am, Mr Niederhäuser and Mr Chia left PAE’s offic e together. Before leaving the offic e, Mr Chia handed Mr Lee his letter of resignation dated 26 June 2002. 

25     After they left, Mr Lee c hec ked Blaser’s website and disc overed the distributors for Singapore and Malaysia had been c hanged to a c ompany known as Blaser Swisslube (S) Pte Ltd. He saw that this c ompany had been inc orporated on 9 May 2002 and that Mr Chia and Mr Niederhäuser were its two direc tors. He also found out that various files relating to the sale of Blaser produc ts had been removed from Mr Chia’s c abinet in the offic e. At 4.00pm that afternoon, Mr Chia returned with Mr Niederhäuser. Mr Lee asked Mr Chia to c lear his desk, to return PAE’s mobile phone and pager and to wait downstairs while Mr Lee spoke with Mr Niederhäuser. Mr Niederhäuser was informed that the stoc k would be released to him in exc hange for payment. The release took plac e the next day in the afternoon. 

**The claim** 

26     This ac tion was started in Oc tober 2002. The amended statement of c laim c ontains three disc rete c auses of ac tion. The first arises under the indemnity agreement signed by Mr Chia. It is averred that he is responsible to indemnify PAE in the sum of $23,224.44 being the amount of the net loss inc urred by the Division in the financ ial year from January to Dec ember 2001. The sec ond is for breac h of c l J of Mr Chia’s c ontrac t of employment whic h required him to give four weeks’ notic e of 


termination of employment. The allegation is that he failed to give suc h notic e and, ac c ordingly, is liable to PAE for his salary in lieu of suc h notic e. This c laim is for $6,496. The third c ause of ac tion is the most substantial one. It is asserted that Mr Chia breac hed his express and implied obligations under his c ontrac t of employment inc luding his duty of good faith and fidelity towards PAE and that as a result, PAE has suffered loss and damage and/ or loss of opportunity. 

27     Mr Chia denied that he is liable to PAE as alleged on various grounds. He asserted that the distributorship agreement was terminated bec ause PAE had marketed a c ompetitor’s produc ts without informing Blaser as it was required to do by the agreement. He asserted also, that he had always ac ted in the best interests of PAE. Mr Chia also stated that he had been willing at all times to serve out his notic e period and that he had only stopped work on 26 June 2002 bec ause he had been asked to do so by PAE. He c ounterc laimed for his salary for June 2002 whic h he averred had not been paid by PAE. 

**The issues** 

**_Claim under the indemnity agreement_** 

28     PAE’s c ase is that by the indemnity agreement of 29 Dec ember 1998, Mr Chia agreed to indemnify PAE for all losses and expenses inc urred by PAE in the setting up of, and the ongoing operational c osts and expenses of, the Division for a period of 18 months from 1 Dec ember 1998 in the event that: 

 (a) Mr Chia resigned or had his employment terminated during the 18 months; 

 (b) Blaser terminated the distributor agreement; or 

 (c ) the Division suffered “a loss after operation for a period of 18 months from setting up”. 

PAE maintains that this indemnity was, at the expiry of the first 18 months after the Division was set up, automatic ally extended for a further 18 months and it therefore c overs the loss of $23,224 that the Division sustained in the financ ial year 2001. 

29     Mr Chia’s position is two-fold. First, the c lause that purports to extend the validity period of the indemnity is obsc ure and inc apable of any definite or prec ise meaning. The c ourt c annot attribute to the parties any partic ular c ontrac tual intention or even impute that the c ontrac ting parties had the same intention. The performanc e to be rendered by eac h party was not reasonably c ertain and the indemnity is too vague to be enforc ed. Sec ondly, even if the c ourt was able to sever the meaningless portion of the indemnity from the rest of the doc ument, the indemnity itself would only be valid for a period of 18 months and Mr Chia c ould not be made liable for the losses sustained by the Division in 2001. 

30     The material portions of the indemnity agreement are as follows: 

 ... I, Chia Wah Siang (Singapore NRIC No: S1364376H) hereby AGREE AND WARRANT to PAE that in c onsideration of PAE inc urring suc h sums and c osts in starting up and maintaining the Division (suc h sums inc luding my salary drawn from the Division’s ac c ounts), I shall hold PAE fully indemnified from all losses and expenses inc urred in the setting up, and on-going operational c osts and expenses inc luding but not limited to legal c osts on an indemnity basis, to the Division for a period of 18 months (the said period) from 1st December 1998 (the date of setting up) should the following arise:


 (a) my resignation or termination of my employment servic es from PAE during the said period; 

 (b) the termination or withdrawal of the exc lusive distributorship agreements by the Princ ipals; 

 (c ) the Division and/or overseas subsidiary c ompany(s) suffers a loss after operation for a period of 18 months from setting up. 

 ... 

 I also agree to the interest c osts c harged to the Division for the start-up c osts and monthly overheads inc urred. The agreed interest rate used in the c omputation will be Singapore banks prime rate plus two (2) perc ent. 

 It is further agreed that this indemnity shall take effect from the start up date of the Division and shall automatically be renewed for the similar duration after 18 months unless terminated, varied or extended by both parties in writing. 

 [emphasis added] 

31     The first issue is what the duration of the indemnity agreement is. There are two portions of the doc ument whic h are relevant to this issue. I have emphasised them in the exc erpt quoted above. There is no diffic ulty about the first portion. It is c lear from the wording “I shall hold PAE fully indemnified ... for a period of 18 months ... from 1st Dec ember 1998” that the indemnity was intended to c over the 18-month period from 1 Dec ember 1998 until 31 May 2000. The diffic ulty arises with the sec ond portion, the last paragraph of the exc erpt from the indemnity. This is what has been referred to as the “extension c lause”. Mr Chia c ontends that it is totally vague bec ause on the one hand, it seems to state that the “renewal” of the indemnity is automatic whilst on the other hand, it says that the indemnity is to be extended “by both parties in writing”. Mr Chia said in evidenc e that he was under the impression that for the indemnity to be extended beyond the initial 18 months, suc h extension had to be agreed to by both parties in writing. That evidenc e is not, in my view, relevant to the issue of the interpretation of the agreement. The indemnity agreement was signed by Mr Chia and it was c lear from his testimony that he was aware of the presenc e of the extension c lause. His subjec tive understanding of the c lause is not determinative of the issue. It has long been established that in c onstruing c ontrac tual provisions, the c ourt takes an objec tive view based on the language used and is not guided by the subjec tive understanding of either party unless there is c lear evidenc e that the agreement was to be interpreted in ac c ordanc e with a partic ular subjec tive intention. 

32     PAE’s position is that the extension c lause is c lear. Under the first half of that c lause, the indemnity is to take effec t from the start-up date of the Division for a period of 18 months and under the sec ond portion of the c lause, after 18 months, the indemnity is to be automatic ally renewed for another period of similar duration. The total duration of the indemnity is therefore 36 months. The words “unless [the indemnity is] terminated, varied or extended by both parties in writing” do not c ut down the c ertainty of the c lause. They simply state the obvious _ie_ that the parties may bring to an end any agreement, fixed term or otherwise, by mutual c onsent in writing. PAE sought support from _Parfums Rochas SA v Davidson Singapore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2000] 2 SLR 148</span>. There the question arose as to the duration of a distribution agreement appointing the respondents as distributors for an initial period of three years plus an “automatic renewal for a period of two years”. It was held that the agreement was for a period of five years. Tan Lee Meng J who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, explained (at [40]): 


 Muc h turns on the meaning of “automatic renewal”. The appellants c ontended that the phrase “automatic renewal”, as used in the c orrespondenc e, must be taken as meaning that the distribution agreement would be renewed for a further two-year period if the respondents substantially c omplied with their other c ontrac tual obligations in the first three years. However, the c orrespondenc e does not establish suc h an intention. If the appellants had wanted the c ontrac t to run for only three years unless the respondents fulfilled their obligations in the first three years, they should have made this c lear in their c orrespondenc e with the respondents. In view of this, the appellants’ argument, whic h c ontradic ts the plain meaning of “automatic ”, c annot be c ountenanc ed. It follows that the learned trial judge was c orrec t in assuming that the distribution agreement was for a period of five years. 

PAE argued that in the same way, the phrase “automatic ally be renewed” in the indemnity agreement meant that the ac tual duration of the agreement was 36 months as it operated to ensure that on the expiry of the first 18 months, the agreement c ontinued, without pause and without the need for any ac tion by either party, for a further 18 months. 

33     Whilst the indemnity agreement has not been drafted as well as it c ould have been, I do not think that it is so badly worded as to be meaningless or unintelligible. On the c ontrary, the meaning of the extension c lause is c lear. I ac c ept PAE’s submissions that the agreement was for a duration of 36 months bec ause the automatic renewal provision in the extension c lause had the effec t of extending the initial duration without the need for any further agreement or ac tion by either party. I do not c onsider that the words “unless [the indemnity is] terminated, varied or extended by both parties in writing” c ut down the c ertainty of the c lause. What they mean is that whilst the indemnity is to last for 36 months, the parties are free to terminate it early or to c hange its terms or to even extend its duration beyond the 36th month. In a c ommerc ial situation, the c ourt does its best to give a meaning to the words used by the parties as it endeavours to uphold rather than to c ut down c ommerc ial arrangements. In this c ase, it does not require any straining of the language to give meaning to the extension c lause. 

34     Having found that the agreement was to last 36 months, does this help PAE? That period started on 1 Dec ember 1998 and ended on 30 November 2001. PAE has c laimed the sum of $23,224.44 as being the net loss inc urred by the Division between 1 January 2001 and 31 Dec ember 

2001\. There are two points to be c onsidered here. First, the indemnity does not stretc h beyond 30 November 2001. On the fac e of it therefore, Mr Chia c annot have agreed to indemnify PAE for the full amount of $23,224.44 as some part of this amount must relate to losses inc urred in Dec ember 

2001\. PAE has not given me any figures whic h I c an use to c alc ulate what its loss, if any, was for the first 11 months of 2001. On that basis alone, PAE c annot get judgment for $23,224.44. But it has a bigger problem. 

35     The sec ond issue is whether Mr Chia, in fac t, undertook to indemnify PAE for losses inc urred after the first 18 months. To answer this question, one must go bac k to the beginning of the agreement where his obligations were set out. There, he agreed to hold PAE indemnified from first, “all losses and expenses inc urred in the setting up” of the Division and sec ondly, “on-going operational c osts and expenses” of the Division, if, during the spec ified period, one of three events oc c urred. The first was his resignation from PAE. The sec ond was the termination of the distributor agreement by Blaser. The third was if “the Division ... suffers a loss after operation for a period of 18 months from setting up”. The triggering event in this c ase c an only be the third one. My problem here is that I do not understand the meaning of “suffers a loss after operation for a period of 18 months from setting up”. Does it mean that the Division must suffer a loss for the first 18 months of its operation? Alternatively, does it mean that the loss is only relevant if it was inc urred more than 18 months after the Division was set up? If the first interpretation is given to the provision, then, sinc e the Division 


not only inc urred no losses during its first 18 months but instead made profits for both 1999 and 2000, no c laim is maintainable. It is only if the sec ond interpretation is the c orrec t one that the c laim is maintainable. Sinc e the provision is c apable of being interpreted in two ways, it is ambiguous. The established rule is that where there is an ambiguity in a c ontrac tual provision, it is c onstrued in the manner that is less favourable to the person who drafted it. In this c ase, the provision was drafted by PAE. Giving it the _contra proferentem_ treatment, I c onstrue it as meaning that the losses c laimed for had to be inc urred during the first 18 months of operation. As the loss of $23,224.44 was inc urred during the period that began after the Division had operated profitably for 25 months, in my view, it is not c overed by the indemnity given by Mr Chia. Ac c ordingly, the c laim under the indemnity must be dismissed. 

**_Claim for breaches of duty_** 

36     In its final submission, PAE asserts that Mr Chia was in breac h of the following obligations whic h he owed them: 

 (a) an obligation to grow the business and inc rease revenue; 

 (b) an obligation to work diligently, adhere to working hours and serve PAE exc lusively; and 

 (c ) a fiduc iary duty and a duty to serve PAE faithfully. 

I will c onsider the first two together and then the third. 

_Obligations to grow the business and increase revenue and to work diligently and exclusively for PAE_ 

37     It was an express term of the c ontrac t of employment that Mr Chia would provide sales, marketing and produc t support func tions to the Division in respec t of Blaser produc ts. It was also stated that he was ac c ountable for the Division’s profit and loss func tions and its long-term growth objec tive. In the c ontrac t, Mr Chia’s working hours were stated to be from 8.30am to 5.30pm from Monday to Friday with a one-hour lunc h break and on Saturday from 8.30am to 1.00pm. He was also prohibited from being employed in any c apac ity by any other person, firm, organisation or government department without the prior written approval of PAE. PAE also submitted that it was an implied term of the employment c ontrac t that Mr Chia would work diligently and serve PAE faithfully. 

38     PAE asserted that at the end of 1998, Mr Chia and his ex-c olleague, Ric hard Lim, were unhappy with Taiyo Kikai and made plans to leave together taking with them the Blaser distributorship. In Oc tober 1998, both met Mr Lee and his father, Mr Lee senior, and persuaded them to enter into a business venture by taking up the Blaser distributorship. During that meeting, the remuneration pac kages of Mr Lim and Mr Chia were disc ussed and agreed upon based on the existing c ost of Blaser produc ts and their selling pric es as well as the c urrent and antic ipated business volume. PAE averred that Mr Chia represented to it that at that stage, he c ould ac hieve an annual turnover of $1.5m and that he was working towards inc reasing the turnover to $3m within the next five years. After the meeting, a c ore business plan on the proposed distribution of Blaser c oolants was sent by Mr Lim to PAE. This business plan stated that the 1999 turnover would be $1.6m. Subsequently, during a meeting of the Division held in January 1999, Mr Chia c ommented that the sales performanc e of $130,000 for one month was an average turnover and c ould be improved. This showed that he c onsidered that yearly sales of at least $1.56m ($130,000 x 12) were ac hievable. 

39     PAE further asserted that Mr Chia and Mr Lim had represented that they would work to inc rease revenue by developing major c ustomers. PAE pointed out that it would not have entered the 


venture on the basis of what it believed to be the then c urrent annual turnover alone. This was bec ause an annual turnover of $1.5m would give PAE net annual profits of only $42,000 (a return of 4.3%) bearing in mind the agreed remuneration pac kages of Mr Chia and Mr Lim and the agreed overheads of the Division. Blaser itself also expec ted new c ustomers to be developed onc e PAE took over the distributorship. Mr Niederhäuser indic ated in his letter to PAE that the strategy to be employed to ac hieve its targets would be to c onc entrate on potential c ustomers and enlarge Blaser’s market share in Singapore and Malaysia. However, the development of new c ustomers required substantial marketing efforts to be made. Mr Chia himself admitted this during c ross-examination. PAE c omplained that Mr Chia failed to make diligent efforts to develop new c ustomers. 

40     Mr Chia’s position was that he had not made any representations to PAE. He said that while he was in Taiyo Kikai, he had to report to Mr Lim who was working in a related c ompany. Mr Lim had ac c ess to doc uments relating to the Blaser distributorship. Any representations would have been made by Mr Lim. Mr Lee had himself admitted that during his first meeting with Mr Lim, the latter had mentioned that the distributorship sold 60 to 80 drums of Blaser produc ts per month, that the average sale pric e per drum was $1,300 to $2,000, that the profit margin was 30% to 40% and the turnover was $1.5m. PAE also admitted that the sales forec ast was produc ed by Mr Lim and not by Mr Chia. 

41     Mr Chia asserted that he did not make any representations to PAE. When he met PAE in November 1998, he only disc ussed his remuneration. He had no involvement in the distribution of Blaser produc ts by PAE as he was then only an employee-to-be and the ultimate dec ision had to be made by the management of Blaser. He submitted that PAE had not proven that he had made any of the alleged representations in relation to the volume of Blaser transac tions and the expec ted profit margin. All that had happened was that he had been asked about the pric es of Blaser produc ts and the estimated usage by c ustomers. PAE had indulged its own fantasies by working out the estimated c urrent and future turnover. PAE had admitted that during the meetings in November/Dec ember 1998 with Mr Niederhäuser, it had not disc ussed payment terms, the volume of stoc k to be kept on hand, the purc hase pric e of the produc ts or the estimated sales volume. 

42     Mr Chia also submitted that the evidenc e showed that PAE did not have detailed disc ussions on sales volume or pric es. Had he made the alleged representations and PAE had c onsidered the same important in its dec ision to enter into the distributorship agreement, it would have obtained more information from Mr Niederhäuser. PAE’s explanation for not disc ussing anything substantial with Mr Niederhäuser was not c redible. That explanation was that sinc e it had already obtained an agreement from Mr Lim and Mr Chia that the two of them would indemnify PAE against any loss, PAE did not need to disc uss anything substantial with Mr Niederhäuser. Mr Chia argued that the indemnity agreement was a sec ondary agreement from a sec ondary sourc e and it would be more believable to expec t PAE to be interested in getting the sales figures from Blaser itself than to fall bac k on an indemnity. All this went to show that PAE did not rely on the alleged representations even if the same were made and that PAE had no valid c ause of ac tion against Mr Chia in relation to the representations. 

43     Having c onsidered the evidenc e, I ac c ept PAE’s version rather than Mr Chia’s in respec t of what oc c urred during the preliminary meetings before the distributorship agreement was entered into. In my view, Mr Chia was an ac tive partic ipant in the negotiations with PAE. He was seeking a new distributor for Blaser produc ts and he was not simply a would-be employee who had no say in what was going to be done. It is c lear that, sinc e 1981, Mr Chia had been the person who had distributed Blaser produc ts in the region although the offic ial distributorship had been held by two different c ompanies in suc c ession. Mr Lim did not work for the then c urrent offic ial distributor, Taiyo Kikai. The person who knew Blaser’s c ustomers, Blaser’s pric es, the selling pric es to the c ustomers and the turnover in the region was Mr Chia. Mr Chia lied in his evidenc e about not having met PAE prior to 


November 1998. He was forc ed to admit under c ross-examination that he had met PAE in Oc tober 

1998\. He also had to admit that he had given Mr Lee the average c onsumption of c oolants of eac h major c ustomer and the unit pric es of suc h c oolants. Mr Chia had asserted that it was Mr Lim who c ontac ted him and suggested PAE as the potential replac ement distributor for Blaser produc ts and that his role was only to liaise between Blaser and PAE. In his affidavit, he gave the impression that he knew nothing of the disc ussions between Mr Lim and PAE exc ept what Mr Lim had told him. In c ourt, however, he had to admit that he was present at the meeting at whic h various figures on sales and turnover were given to PAE. He subsequently agreed that at that meeting of 14 Oc tober 1998, PAE had been told that the annual turnover of Blaser produc ts was $1.5m. He also had to admit that even if all the representations had been made by Mr Lim, as he asserted, he had not spoken up to c ontradic t Mr Lim. 

44     I ac c ept, therefore, that when PAE took on the distributorship and employed Mr Lim and Mr Chia, the latter were intended to be more than simple employees. From the beginning, both of them were entitled to a share in the profits of the Division. Onc e Mr Lim left, Mr Chia’s share of profits was inc reased. PAE had gone into the agreement with Blaser on the basis of the figures and projec tions supplied by Mr Chia and Mr Lim. The remuneration pac kages given to eac h of them were also influenc ed by suc h figures. On the other hand, the representations did not bec ome terms of the c ontrac t. There was no express sales target set out in the c ontrac t whic h Mr Chia was supposed to meet. Whilst Mr Chia did not have a duty to ensure a spec ific level of sales, it was an express term of the c ontrac t that he would develop the business of the Division and be ac c ountable for its long-term growth. Therefore, he was under an obligation to make diligent efforts to ac hieve these aims. I also note here that PAE has not framed its c ase as one based on misrepresentation. Ac c ordingly, the finding on the representations does not, in itself, lead direc tly to a finding of damages simply bec ause the forec ast figures were not met. 

45     PAE asserted that Mr Chia had failed to make diligent efforts to develop major new c ustomers. In c ourt, it was evident that Mr Chia was aware that substantial effort was required to obtain new c ustomers bec ause they had to be persuaded to c hange from the existing produc ts used to Blaser produc ts. Mr Chia had explained that in order to develop a new c ustomer, the first step would be to do a presentation to the potential c ustomer to determine whether Blaser’s produc ts were useful in the c ustomer’s business. Onc e that was established, the c ustomer had to be persuaded to give Blaser’s produc t a try. In this c onnec tion, the salesman had to be familiar with the mac hines used by the c ustomer and the manufac turer’s rec ommendation for suc h mac hines. Muc h time therefore had to be spent obtaining this information. For a c ustomer to agree to a trial of a Blaser produc t, the c ustomer would have to be prepared to drain off the c ompetitor’s soluble oil from the mac hines alloc ated for the trial and then fill those mac hines with Blaser c oolant. Personnel would have to be assigned to monitor the trial proc ess. 

46     PAE’s submission was that given the amount of effort that was required to develop new c ustomers, Mr Chia had fallen far short of the standard required. He had not c ome up with sales strategies and growth plans for the Division despite repeated requests from PAE. Further, the daily sales ac tivity reports whic h he had c ompleted from January 2001 onwards showed that he had not approac hed some c ompanies whic h he himself had listed as major potential c ustomers. Further, out of his 315 rec orded visits to c ustomers only six were to potential c lients and these appeared to be halfbaked efforts with no proper follow-up. PAE c omplained that the drop in revenue of the Division was c aused by Mr Chia’s failure to inc rease major c ustomers. In his first year (1999), Mr Chia generated sales revenue of approximately $1.16m from the sale of Blaser’s c oolants. More than 90% of this revenue c ame from five major c ustomers. Revenue dec lined thereafter. In 2000, the gross revenue was $883,159.92 and in 2001, it was $743,944.59. Mr Chia agreed in c ourt that the turnover fell in 2000 and 2001 bec ause no new major c ustomers were added. 


47     There was also a litany of c omplaints about Mr Chia’s working habits. He was said to be laidbac k. He was habitually late for work. He spent only a few hours in the offic e in the morning and even then muc h of his time was spent in the warehouse. He rarely returned to the offic e in the afternoon to c atc h up on paperwork after making his c ustomer visits. He was often distrac ted. He apparently c arried on other business. He often rec eived telephone c alls whic h he would rush out of the offic e to answer. PAE asserts that Mr Chia behaved this way bec ause his ric e bowl was sec ure. He had been the sole Blaser representative for c oolants in Singapore and Malaysia sinc e 1981 and if he left PAE’s employ, the distributorship would be terminated. After he left PAE’s employ, it was disc overed that in breac h of his c ontrac t of employment, Mr Chia had been a shareholder and a direc tor of a c ompany known as Quantum Canary Pte Ltd while still an employee of PAE. 

48     Mr Chia submitted that his behaviour had not fallen below the standard required of a reasonable employee and therefore it c ould not be said that he had breac hed the duty that he owed his employer. His job was to sell metalworking fluids to industrial c ustomers in Singapore and Malaysia and three out of the five major c ustomers he servic ed were in Malaysia. It was a requirement of his job that he visited c ustomers’ fac tories frequently not only to keep in c ontac t with them but also to attend to their queries and any diffic ulties that they might be experienc ing with their mac hines. He had therefore had to make frequent visits to Johor and very often he had only been able to return to Singapore at night due to the evening jam at the Causeway. His job had not allowed him to spend a great deal of time in the offic e. In fac t, less than half his time c ould be spent in the offic e. PAE was taking inc onsistent positions. On the one hand, it stated that it expec ted Mr Chia to make c ustomer visits and to inc rease sales and on the other hand, it went to the extent of timing Mr Chia when he made visits to Malaysian c ustomers. PAE was holding him to too high a standard as it was inherently diffic ult for a person in a sales job to predic t and plan his time as the length of time taken to have meetings and c onversations with c ustomers and to troubleshoot the problems experienc ed by the mac hines was unpredic table. 

49     Mr Chia c ontended that he was not asked spec ific ally to formulate strategies and plans to inc rease the Division’s sales. In January 1999, Mr Lee senior had stated that PAE should foc us on existing c ustomers due to weak market c onditions. Mr Chia also denied being involved in another business in breac h of his c ontrac t of employment. He had been only a nominal shareholder and direc tor of Quantum Canary and had taken these positions at the request of Mr Ric hard Lim who wanted to run a business but c ould not do so openly as he was an undisc harged bankrupt. The c ompany had c eased operations six months after Mr Chia’s name was used and no prejudic e or loss had been c aused to PAE as Mr Chia had not been involved in the operations of Quantum Canary. 

50     As for the earnings of the Division, Mr Chia pointed out that he had made gross profits for the Division of between $417,000 and $260,000 during the years from 1999 to 2001. The ec onomic c onditions in the region were not bright during this period and most firms’ profit margins were adversely affec ted by poor ec onomic c onditions. PAE had not proved that the fall in its profits had been c aused by the alleged misbehaviour of Mr Chia. Whilst PAE c onsistently alleged that Mr Chia had not made suffic ient effort to develop new c ustomers, it had failed to mention that Mr Lee had not assisted Mr Chia in his marketing efforts as he was supposed to have done. Mr Lee had admitted in c ourt that after the first year, his visits to c ustomers fell substantially. This fall affec ted Mr Chia bec ause he then had to attend both to existing c ustomers and do sales presentations without support. 

51     Exc ept in one partic ular instanc e, the evidenc e adduc ed by PAE does not, I think, establish that Mr Chia fell below the reasonable standards of diligenc e whic h an employer c an expec t from an employee. Whilst there were many c omplaints about him being laid-bac k and involved in other matters, I note that muc h of the evidenc e for this c ame from the testimony of James Choo. Mr Choo 


joined the c ompany only in February 2002 and by that time, if I ac c ept PAE’s c ase, Mr Chia was disaffec ted and ac tively planning his exit from PAE. The c omplaints made about his behaviour before that time were not doc umented. The only evidenc e of dissatisfac tion, apart from a c omment in an email that in disc ussions between them, Mr Niederhäuser and Mr Lee had agreed that Mr Chia was not aggressive and lac ked general disc ipline, was the institution of the requirement that Mr Chia fill up the daily ac tivity reports. Mr Chia was not, however, warned that he was ill-disc iplined or that he was required to keep stric tly to offic e hours. There was muc h forc e in Mr Chia’s argument that the nature of his job required him to be out of the offic e for long periods of time and that his marketing efforts required a flexible sc hedule. 

52     The one area where I c onsider PAE has proved its c ase is the area of development of new business. It is c lear from the ac tivity reports filed by Mr Chia that he did not put the effort needed into developing new c lients. He seems to have preferred foc using his efforts on maintaining the relationship he had with the existing c lientele. Mr Chia c ould have divided his efforts more evenly. He also c ould have asked for more help if he required it. He was not aggressive enough. When he entered PAE’s employment, he c ame with a list of potential c ustomers that Blaser itself wanted him to target. Yet, he made little or no effort to develop a relationship with these c ompanies. No doubt it would not be easy to win over any of them to Blaser produc ts, but Mr Chia had an obligation to do his best in that regard and not only did he not do his best, the evidenc e shows that he did hardly anything to disc harge that obligation. That was a signific ant breac h of his duty as an employee. As regards the alleged involvement in other businesses, the only hard evidenc e of that was the searc h report showing that he was an offic er or shareholder of Quantum Canary. There was no evidenc e, however, that he was ac tively involved in that c ompany’s business. It was a breac h of his c ontrac t to be an offic er of that c ompany but, unless suc h involvement c an be shown to have had an adverse impac t on his work for PAE, that breac h would be only a tec hnic al one. 

**_Breach of the employee’s duty of fidelity_** 

53     It was PAE’s c ase that from 2001, a year before he ac tually tendered his resignation, it was Mr Chia’s plan to leave PAE. At that time, PAE was beginning to put pressure on him to perform better. It was c hasing him to produc e market strategies whic h would inc rease revenue. It made him ac c ount for his time by filling up the sales ac tivity reports. He was aware that PAE had, on several oc c asions, tried to persuade Blaser to delete Art 24.3 from the distributorship agreement. Mr Chia must have been unhappy in 2001. This dissatisfac tion c ould only have inc reased when in early 2002 he was refused his request for a thirteenth-month bonus and was informed that PAE wanted him to indemnify it against the loss of $23,224.44 that the Division had sustained in 2001. PAE submitted that Mr Chia had c arefully planned to leave PAE taking the distributorship agreement with him. PAE c onsidered that Mr Chia had persuaded Blaser to leave PAE and to set up its own subsidiary c ompany in Singapore to handle the distribution of its produc ts in the region. In this c onnec tion, Mr Chia had plotted with Blaser so as to keep PAE in the dark until everything was ready for the new c ompany to take over the business. He had been in breac h of his duty of fidelity to PAE by persuading Blaser to move and by planning and implementing the move while he was still working for PAE. 

54     Mr Chia’s position was that PAE had breac hed the distributorship agreement with Blaser by distributing the produc ts of a c ompetitor. That was the c ause of the termination of the Blaser distributorship. He further submitted that PAE had not proved, on the balanc e of probabilities, that it was Mr Chia who planned and engineered the termination in breac h of his duties as an employee. 

55     Mr Chia’s submission is that the evidenc e should be interpreted as follows. The evidenc e was that the distributorship agreement between Blaser and PAE was primarily for the purpose of distributing c oolants or metalworking fluids. In January 2002, PAE had bought a substantial quantity of 


Conoc o’s metalworking fluids. In Marc h 2002, Mr Niederhäuser disc overed that PAE was distributing Conoc o produc ts and demanded that Mr Lee explain why PAE had not informed Blaser of this earlier. He also asked for more details of the Conoc o distribution. When c onfronted, PAE admitted that c utting oils were distributed. Mr Chia submitted that this was c learly a breac h of the distributorship agreement. PAE went on to extend the “trial period” of Conoc o produc ts to the end of 2002 despite Mr Niederhäuser telling Mr Lee on 2 April 2002 that Blaser saw a “potential c onflic t”. While, tec hnic ally, PAE did not need to obtain permission from Blaser to sell produc ts that were not similar to those sold for Blaser, PAE had a c ontrac tual obligation to inform Blaser of the new distributorship so that Blaser c ould make an informed assessment about the relationship. PAE had failed to abide by this term. Further in reply to Mr Niederhäuser’s e-mail of 2 April 2002, Mr Lee stated that PAE would drop the Conoc o produc ts if Blaser would sell its neat oils through PAE but “the dec ision must c ome from Blaser first”. This was c ommerc ial blac kmail. In any event, it was a c hallenge to Blaser and if Blaser did not respond to it appropriately, Blaser would lose its c redibility in relation to PAE. 

56     Mr Chia submitted that the foregoing c onstituted a fundamental breac h of the distributorship agreement whic h Blaser took very seriously. Blaser’s board c ame to a c ollec tive dec ision to terminate the agreement with PAE and to distribute Blaser produc ts through Blaser’s own subsidiary in Singapore and to engage Mr Chia to do this. PAE itself had admitted through the evidenc e of Mr Lee that Mr Niederhäuser had spec ific ally c ited the distribution of Conoc o produc ts as a reason for the termination of the distributorship. 

57     There is no doubt that tec hnic ally PAE was in breac h of the distributorship agreement when, in November 2001, it signed an agreement with Conoc o to distribute Conoc o produc ts even though the produc ts to be distributed did not inc lude Conoc o’s c utting oils. Under Art 4.1 of the Blaser distributorship agreement, PAE undertook not to ac t as a distributor for third parties whic h produc ed or distributed produc ts that were similar or identic al to those made by Blaser. Under Art 4.5, PAE had to inform Blaser if it wanted to ac t as a dealer for other produc ts made by third parties even though suc h produc ts were not similar or identic al to the Blaser produc ts. PAE did not inform Blaser of its intentions prior to signing the Conoc o agreement nor even thereafter. However, it is not c lear from the distributorship agreement that a breac h of Art 4 by PAE would entitle Blaser to terminate the agreement. Artic le 4.4 stated that if there was a violation of the non-c ompetition provisions of Art 4, PAE would owe Blaser liquidated damages. The formula for c alc ulation of liquidated damages was also stated in Art 4.4. As far as termination of the agreement was c onc erned, this was provided for in Arts 23 and 24. Artic le 23 provided for termination by three months’ written notic e to be given at the end of any month. Under Art 24 the agreement c ould be terminated with immediate effec t if what was c alled “an extraordinary c irc umstanc e” existed. Artic les 24.2 and 24.3 defined the situations whic h would be c onsidered to fall within the term “extraordinary c irc umstanc e”. Violation of the nonc ompetition c lause was not one of those c irc umstanc es. Thus, even if there was a breac h of Art 4, Blaser would not be entitled to put an immediate end to the distributorship agreement. Therefore, was the existenc e of the Conoc o distribution agreement merely a pretext for the sudden termination of the distributorship agreement? PAE’s submission was that it was. 

58     First, as PAE pointed out, Mr Niederhäuser admitted in c ross-examination that neither he nor Blaser was aware that PAE had bought Conoc o’s c oolants when Blaser terminated the distributorship on 26 June 2002. This was therefore not the real reason for Blaser’s termination. Mr Niederhäuser’s subsequent explanation to the c ourt that PAE’s distribution of Conoc o produc ts was a “short step” from a breac h of the Blaser distributorship sinc e Conoc o manufac tured c oolants was also untenable given his failure to issue an ultimatum to PAE to drop Conoc o produc ts. PAE had responded promptly to eac h e-mail from Mr Niederhäuser in order to address Blaser’s c onc erns and had indic ated on two oc c asions that it was willing to drop the Conoc o line. Mr Niederhäuser had c laimed in his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief that he had requested PAE to stop distributing Conoc o’s produc ts but during c ross


examination he admitted that he had not made suc h a request. When he was asked how he had responded to what he c alled PAE’s “blac kmail” in stating that it would drop Conoc o’s line if it c ould sell Blaser neat oils at c ompetitive pric es, he was evasive. He said that he c ould not remember whether he mentioned that Blaser c ould not reduc e the pric e of its neat oils. When asked spec ific ally whether he had told Mr Lee that PAE was in the wrong, that it should not give Blaser c onditions, and that it should drop Conoc o, his answer was he had not. 

59     Sec ond, there was Mr Chia’s own c onduc t in relation to Conoc o. It should first be noted that in his affidavit evidenc e, Mr Chia gave the impression that he had very little to do with the Conoc o distributorship. He said that when Conoc o’s representative had c alled him to disc uss the possibility of a working relationship, he had redirec ted Jason Wong to Mr Lee. In April 2001, Mr Lee arranged for a meeting with Jason Wong and requested Mr Chia to attend it. The disc ussion c entred on distributing Conoc o produc ts. Mr Chia was not c omfortable with this proposal as implementing it would be c ontrary to the Blaser distributorship agreement. Mr Lee then asked Mr Chia to do a market survey on the viability of selling Conoc o’s produc ts. About a week later, Mr Chia told Mr Lee that the Conoc o distributorship had little market potential and would lead to trouble with Blaser. Mr Lee brushed aside his c onc erns and Mr Chia heard nothing further about the Conoc o projec t thereafter. It was kept sec ret from him. In November 2001, he learnt for the first time that PAE had c ommenc ed selling Conoc o produc ts and that this was being done by Mr Lee with the assistanc e of James Choo. Mr Chia knew even then that PAE was heading for trouble with Blaser. As an employee who had already told Mr Lee in no unc ertain terms that dealing in Conoc o produc ts was not worth the risk, however, there was nothing more that he c ould do when PAE’s management insisted on selling them. At no point did he tell anyone in Blaser that Conoc o’s produc ts were being sold by PAE as he was aware of the sensitivity of the issue. 

60     PAE’s position, however, was that Mr Lee and Mr Chia had been in disc ussions with Jason Wong from the sec ond quarter of 2000 onwards. PAE wanted to provide a one-stop solution to its existing Blaser c ustomers’ lubric ant needs by distributing Blaser c oolants alongside Conoc o’s lubric ants. Mr Chia was to use his experienc e and goodwill with his existing c ustomers to market Conoc o’s lubric ants. This plan would benefit Blaser by enabling it to c ompete more effec tively with c ompetitors like Castrol who offered a full range of produc ts to their c ustomers. Ac c ording to PAE, in May 2001, Mr Chia arranged for a sales visit by Jason Wong, Mr Lee and himself to one of his existing Blaser c ustomers in order to present Conoc o’s lubric ants to the latter. Mr Chia on his own also promoted Conoc o produc ts to at least three Blaser c ustomers between April 2001 and January 2002. These promotional visits were rec orded in his daily sales ac tivity reports. PAE relied on testimony from Jason Wong to the effec t that Mr Chia not only knew about the Conoc o distributorship but was also seemingly enthusiastic about it and was fully involved in the disc ussions with Conoc o. On balanc e, I prefer the evidenc e of Mr Lee and Mr Wong on this point to that of Mr Chia. If Mr Chia did indeed have reservations about the effec t of the Conoc o distributorship on the relationship with Blaser, he kept them to himself. As far as PAE was c onc erned, he professed to support the idea of doing business with Conoc o even though his marketing efforts proved to be disappointing to PAE. 

61     After Mr Niederhäuser informed PAE that he had found out about its relationship with Conoc o, the parties exc hanged several messages. PAE endeavoured to reassure Mr Niederhäuser that the Conoc o produc ts were c omplementary to Blaser’s produc ts and were not in c ompetition with the latter. This c orrespondenc e went on from April to 6 May 2002. Mr Niederhäuser admitted that at no time during that period did he warn Mr Lee that PAE was in danger of losing the distributorship. When pressed on this matter, Mr Niederhäuser said that Mr Lee had been the one to say that if Blaser was not happy with PAE, it c ould leave. That evidenc e was only given in c ourt. It did not appear in his affidavit and I do not ac c ept it as being true as, if suc h a thing had been said, it would have been trotted out at a muc h earlier stage as further justific ation for the termination of the distributorship. 


Mr Niederhäuser remained silent after PAE offered on 6 May 2002 to drop the Conoc o line altogether and in his e-mail of 20 May 2002, he asked PAE about its sales experienc e in respec t of Conoc o’s hydroc rac ked oil. He then went on to say that Blaser was restruc turing its neat oils, and pric es and leaflets would not be available until the end of June. In the meantime, PAE c ould c arry out its marketing study and report to Blaser on the same. That e-mail c ertainly gave PAE a misleading impression. There was nothing in it to indic ate that Blaser was still upset and was intending to terminate the distributorship. Yet, ac c ording to the testimony Mr Niederhäuser gave me, the board of Blaser had dec ided to take this c ourse around 22 April 2002. Mr Niederhäuser was therefore being c onsc iously insinc ere and misleading in his subsequent message of 20 May 2002. 

62     If Mr Niederhäuser is to be believed, he first spoke to Mr Chia about the Conoc o distributorship only in April 2002. He stated that it was after he c ould not get satisfac tory answers from Mr Lee about Conoc o that he c alled Mr Chia and asked what was going on with Conoc o. Mr Chia told him that Conoc o produc ts were in PAE’s warehouse but that he himself was not in c harge of them and he was simply doing his job in relation to Blaser c oolants. Mr Chia agreed with Mr Niederhäuser that the sale of the Conoc o produc ts was a breac h of the Blaser agreement. He did not explain that the sales were to be of lubric ants (the hydroc rac ked oil) so that PAE c ould provide a one-stop shop to c ustomers of Blaser soluble oil. PAE submitted that Mr Niederhäuser must have spoken to Mr Chia muc h earlier than April 2002. I agree. Mr Niederhäuser’s version that he only found out about Conoc o around 20 Marc h was not plausible. There was no doubt that he and Mr Chia were c lose. They had been in c onstant c ontac t about marketing of Blaser produc ts in the region sinc e 1996. Mr Chia had handled Blaser produc ts sinc e 1981 and Blaser must have relied on him sinc e it followed him from one c ompany to another. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that as soon as Mr Niederhäuser found out about an ac tion that he believed to be in breac h of c ontrac t, he would have immediately c alled Mr Chia. He would not have waited two weeks to disc uss suc h an important matter with the person he relied on. 

63     If Mr Niederhäuser was telling the truth and he did not speak to Mr Chia in Marc h 2002 when he saw the Conoc o name on PAE’s letterhead, it would have been bec ause he was not upset by this. The only reason he would not have been upset was that he already knew about the relationship between Conoc o and PAE and, with Mr Chia, was working on this to effec t a termination of the distributorship. In any c ase, Mr Chia’s ready agreement with Mr Niederhäuser’s assertion that PAE had breac hed the distributorship agreement was in itself a breac h of his own duty of fidelity to PAE. He knew that PAE wished to c omplement Blaser produc ts and did not intend to offer c ompeting produc ts. He should have told this to Mr Niederhäuser. He should also have gone straight bac k to Mr Lee and told him that Blaser c onsidered PAE to be in breac h of c ontrac t. Instead, Mr Chia kept entirely quiet about Blaser’s unhappiness. He ac c epted a job offer from Blaser in April 2002 and worked with Blaser not only to set up the new offic e in Singapore but also to keep PAE under the impression that everything was proc eeding normally and no nasty surprises were in store. In this, he was wholly suc c essful. He even remarked on how happy Mr Laurent Lee was at the beginning of the 26 June 2002 meeting. 

64     PAE submitted that Blaser would not have terminated the distributorship had it not been for Mr Chia asking Mr Niederhäuser to c ause this to happen. Blaser had no real issues with PAE and the c omplaints whic h were put in evidenc e by Mr Chia and Mr Niederhäuser were normal issues that would arise in suc h relationships and were in eac h c ase resolved by PAE who gave in to Blaser. 

65     There was definitely something underhand about the way in whic h the distributorship was terminated. As mentioned above, no hint of the impending disaster was c ontained in the messages sent by Mr Niederhäuser in May 2002. He went out of his way to make everything seem as normal as possible going so far as to suggest (by his e-mail of 10 June 2002) an agenda for the meeting on 26 June whic h inc luded disc ussion of the business outlook for the sec ond half of 2002. 


Mr Niederhäuser knew that no suc h topic would be disc ussed sinc e it was his plan to hand over the termination letter at the meeting. The question is why did Blaser terminate the distributorship in this way? Under the agreement, it c ould terminate PAE’s appointment at any time by giving it three months’ notic e of termination. Alternatively, if Mr Chia wanted to move, he c ould resign from PAE, giving it one month’s notic e and Blaser c ould then invoke the provisions of Art 24.3 of the agreement in order to terminate the distributorship. Instead of taking either of these c ourses, Blaser issued a notic e purporting to effec t an immediate termination based on “extraordinary c irc umstanc es”. PAE’s submission was that Mr Chia worked over a period of time to ac hieve suc h a notic e as he may have been c onc erned that unless PAE was shown to be in breac h of its agreement with Blaser, the Blaser board might not have wanted to c hange distributor again suc h a short time after making the c hange from Taiyo Kikai. 

66     On the evidenc e, it does appear to me that Mr Chia did take steps to bring the distributorship to an end. He was unhappy with PAE. He wanted to move. Perhaps he had reason to believe that Blaser would not be sanguine about following him away from PAE just bec ause of his personal unhappiness there. It is c lear that he c ontributed to the development of the relationship between Conoc o and PAE. Subsequently, he exploited that relationship with Conoc o for his own ends. He did nothing to assuage any c onc ern that Blaser had in relation to it. Mr Chia was the one who was initially marketing Conoc o produc ts. He did not make muc h effort in this regard and at the time Blaser purportedly found out about the relationship, PAE had not sold any Conoc o produc ts. Mr Chia c ould well have told Blaser that and at the same time made it quite c lear to Mr Lee that the Conoc o relationship had to end. He did not do so. His explanation was that his protests had been disregarded onc e and he did not see any purpose in making further protests. I do not believe him. I found Mr Chia to be an unsatisfac tory witness in many respec ts. I believe that he exploited the situation and worked with Mr Niederhäuser in order to bring the Blaser distributorship agreement to an end in suc h a way that PAE c ould be blamed for the termination. It is c lear also that onc e Blaser took the dec ision to leave PAE, Mr Chia ac tively partic ipated in the setting up of its new Singapore subsidiary and the intended transfer of the c ustomers and produc ts from PAE to the new outfit. 

67     Mr Chia submitted that his ac tions during the period from April to June 2002 were not in any way c ontrary to the interests of PAE. During that time, he c ontinued with his duties for PAE by servic ing Blaser’s c ustomers and supplying them with Blaser produc ts. In addition, c ertain ac tions were taken relating to Blaser Singapore. At the most, these ac tions were preparatory in nature and primarily involved setting up the Blaser branc h. Mr Chia did not c ommenc e working for Blaser Singapore before his c omplete departure from PAE. The letters from Blaser Singapore informing Blaser c ustomers of the c hange of distributor were not sent out until the termination of the distributorship agreement and no sale or marketing of produc ts by Blaser Singapore took plac e before 26 June 2002. Therefore, Mr Chia asserted, he did not in any way assist Blaser Singapore to c ompete with PAE whilst he was still in PAE’s employ. 

68     Mr Chia further submitted that an employee who, whilst still in the employment of his employer, merely plans to leave to work for a c ompetitor or to set up business in c ompetition with his employer, is not, in the absenc e of improper c onduc t, in breac h of his duty as an employee. His c ounsel pointed out that in the English c ase of _Laughton v Bapp Industrial Supplies Ltd_ [1986] ICR 634, it was held that employees who wrote to ten of their employer’s suppliers stating that they intended to set up business on their own and asking for pric es and other details of the supplier’s produc ts had not ac ted in breac h of their duty of good faith. It was stated that an intention to c ompete in the future was not a breac h of employee’s duties. On the authority of _Balston Ltd v Headline Filters Ltd_ [1987] FSR 330 and _Metal Salvage Association Inc v Michael Siegel_ 503 NYS 2d 26 (1986), Mr Chia’s c ounsel argued that suc h preparatory steps c ould inc lude inc orporating a c ompany, leasing premises or hiring staff. There would be a breac h only if the 


employee went beyond preparatory steps, for example, by using his name to try and sec ure business for the new c ompany whilst he was still in the employment of the old: see _Universal Westech (S) Pte Ltd v Ng Thiam Kiat_ <span class="citation">[1997] 2 SLR 139</span>. 

69     To summarise Mr Chia’s position, it was that he had not c aused or c ontributed to the termination of the distributorship in any way. Blaser had ac ted as it did solely bec ause of PAE’s breac h of c ontrac t in relation to Conoc o. Mr Chia himself was fac ed with the prospec t of losing his job in PAE and it was reasonable for him to ac c ept the alternative offer from Blaser. After he ac c epted the offer, all he did was to make preparations for his new employment. While working for PAE, he did not do anything that amounted to c ompeting with PAE’s business. He had not been in breac h of any duty to PAE. 

70     I have c arefully c onsidered the arguments made on behalf of Mr Chia. I do not ac c ept, however, that there was no breac h of duty by him in this c ase. His ac tions went far beyond those of the employees involved in the c ases whic h his c ounsel c ited. I have held that he played an ac tive part in the breakdown of the relationship between PAE and Blaser. That in itself was a breac h of duty. Sec ondly, he was aware, at the least, of Mr Niederhäuser’s dissatisfac tion with PAE over the Conoc o issue. His duty then (even if he had not instigated suc h dissatisfac tion) was to draw the issue to PAE’s attention so that PAE c ould try and rec tify the situation. In this respec t, I adopt the following passage from the judgment of Havers J in _Sanders v Parry_ [1967] 2 All ER 803 at 806–807: 

 In my view, there was a duty on the defendant, when Mrs Stanford told him that she was dissatisfied, to have reported that to his princ ipal and so to have given him an opportunity of seeing what he c ould do to meet any c omplaint that Mrs Stanford had, so that she c ould remain with him. ... Instead of forwarding his princ ipal’s interests [the defendant] was c onc erned only in promoting his own. He made this alternative offer to Mrs Stanford whic h she ac c epted and it was as a result of that alone that she left the plaintiff and joined the defendant. That was, in my view, a breac h of c ontrac t ... 

Whilst the fac t situation there was slightly different, the princ iple applic able is identic al. Thirdly, Mr Chia was in breac h bec ause he made no effort to retain Blaser as PAE’s princ ipal. Instead, he ac c epted an offer of employment from Blaser knowing that by doing so, he was assisting Blaser to make a smooth and suc c essful transition of its business from PAE to its new Singapore subsidiary. Again, the observations of Havers J in relation to a similar situation in _Sanders v Parry_ are apposite. He said (at 807–808): 

 In my view, there was a duty at all times during the subsistenc e of that agreement on the defendant to protec t his master’s interests, espec ially to do his best to retain Mr Tully as a c lient of his master ... In ac c epting this offer [to do all Mr Tully’s legal work] the defendant was not protec ting his master’s interests, for he made no effort to try and retain Mr Tully as a c lient of his master. The defendant was plac ing himself in a position in whic h there was a c onflic t of interests between him and his princ ipal, and he was looking after his own interests to the detriment of his master’s interests. ... [I]f Mr Tully had expressed any dissatisfac tion as to the position, the defendant should have found out any grievanc e whic h Mr Tully thought he had and should have gone to the plaintiff, who was the defendant’s princ ipal. ... [I]f the defendant had gone to the plaintiff about this, there might well have been an opportunity for him and Mr Tully to have sorted it out and to have c leared up the misunderstanding. ... It apparently never oc c urred to the defendant that, while he was still employed by the plaintiff, he c ould not disc uss any offer Mr Tully made; he c ould not possibly do that until his agreement with the plaintiff was terminated. I am satisfied that, in ac c epting the offer, by suc h c onduc t the defendant was guilty of breac h of duty ... [to] serve the plaintiff with good faith and fidelity. 


**_Breach of the notice provision_** 

71     The employment c ontrac t between PAE and Mr Chia required the latter to give PAE four weeks’ notic e of his resignation or pay four weeks’ salary in lieu of notic e. On 26 June 2002, Mr Chia handed Mr Lee a letter stating that he was tendering his resignation with effec t from 27 June and that as he had three days’ leave owing to him, his last day of duty would be 23 July. PAE c ontended that despite what the letter stated, Mr Chia had never intended to serve out his notic e and that he was in breac h of the notic e provision. Mr Chia, on the other hand, c laimed that PAE had waived the notic e period by its behaviour on the fatal day and therefore had no basis to c laim breac h on his part. 

72     This issue is c learly a question of fac t and it is whether Mr Chia refused and/or failed to serve out his notic e period. On the fac e of the letter, Mr Chia was willing to work right up to 23 July. It was pointed out on behalf of Mr Chia that he had not said anything to c ontradic t the statements in the letter at the time he served the letter on PAE. In c ourt, Mr Lee had admitted that when the letter was handed over to him, Mr Chia had not said a single word. Further, when Mr Chia returned to PAE’s offic e in the afternoon, PAE had c hanged the pin number of its door, had asked for the return of his pager and handphone and had also asked him to wait outside the premises while Mr Lee talked to Mr Niederhäuser. This behaviour indic ated that PAE did not want Mr Chia to serve his notic e. Whilst PAE had alleged that Mr Niederhäuser had told PAE that Mr Chia would join Blaser Singapore with immediate effec t, Mr Chia and Mr Niederhäuser had denied that any suc h thing had been said. 

73     PAE relied on the following to establish Mr Chia’s intentions: 

 (a) Blaser’s modus operandi was an immediate termination so as to prevent sabotage by a disgruntled ex-distributor and this meant that Mr Chia would have nothing to do in PAE’s offic e during the one month period after his resignation as all the Blaser stoc ks would have been transferred on termination. 

 (b) Mr Chia’s c onduc t during the termination meeting showed his intentions. He c ame and left with Mr Niederhäuser, sat at the latter’s right hand and only handed in his termination letter after the meeting ended around noon. Then, Mr Chia left with Mr Niederhäuser instead of remaining behind in PAE’s offic e. When he returned with Mr Niederhäuser at 4.00pm, he had erased all telephone numbers from the mobile phone supplied by PAE. He returned that instrument to PAE and was observed to be wearing a gleaming new phone on his belt. 

 (c ) PAE noted that all papers, doc uments and files c ontaining quotations, sales invoic es, c ustomer purc hase orders, delivery orders, stoc k inventory lists, c ustomer reports and hard c opies of e-mail c orrespondenc e had been removed from Mr Chia’s c abinet in PAE’s offic e. 

 (d) Mr Niederhäuser made it quite c lear during the meeting of 26 June 2002 that Blaser Singapore would take over the distributorship at onc e and that Mr Chia would join it with immediate effec t. 

 (e) Despite Mr Niederhäuser stating that the plan was for him to look after Blaser Singapore while Mr Chia served out his notic e, Mr Niederhäuser was in Bangkok on 28 June 2002 to meet his wife and return with her to Switzerland. He left Mr Chia to arrange the transfer of stoc ks to Blaser Singapore inc luding those in the Penang warehouse and it was c lear that he had made no plans to stay in Singapore beyond 27 June whic h had been his original departure date as indic ated in his e-mail to PAE on 10 June. 

 (f ) Mr Chia had never made a c laim for one month’s salary in lieu of notic e to be paid by 


 PAE as he would be entitled to do had his employment been summarily terminated by PAE, wrongfully preventing him from working between 27 June and 23 July 2002. His salary c laim in his c ounterc laim is for the month of June 2002. 

74     In my judgment, the evidenc e has established that Mr Chia had no intention of working for PAE after 26 June 2002. Prior to that date, he had taken all the steps nec essary to effec t a transfer of all business and stoc k from PAE to Blaser Singapore upon termination of PAE’s appointment as distributor. He was an essential c omponent of Blaser Singapore. He knew the c lients. He knew their needs. He knew how to organise the taking of orders and the delivery of goods. On 26 June 2002, Blaser Singapore had no employees. The only Singaporean who knew anything about how to do its business was Mr Chia. Mr Niederhäuser had made plans to c ome to Singapore for a short visit and although he asserted in c ourt that he was willing to stay here and c onduc t Blaser Singapore’s business until Mr Chia had served out his notic e period, I do not believe that that was the intended c ourse of ac tion. It was all along antic ipated that Mr Chia would join Blaser Singapore immediately in the same manner as he had immediately joined PAE when it was appointed distributor in plac e of Taiyo Kikai. Whilst Mr Niederhäuser was in c harge of Blaser’s business in this region, he had not worked loc ally and thus had no experienc e of how to get things done on a day-to-day basis. It would have been very diffic ult for Blaser Singapore to c onduc t its business without the assistanc e of Mr Chia. I therefore find for PAE on this issue. 

**_Damages_** 

75     PAE has c laimed damages as c ompensation for the various breac hes by Mr Chia of his fiduc iary duty of good faith and fidelity. Whilst Mr Chia denied that he was liable to PAE at all for any damages, he did not dispute that in princ iple, damages would be the appropriate remedy for any breac h that he had been found to have c ommitted. He did, however, take issue with what would be the appropriate measure of any damages to be awarded. 

76     The 1993 Canadian c ase of _Sure-Grip Fasteners Ltd v Allgrade Bolt & Chain Inc_ (1993) 46 CPR (3d) 443 held that damages for breac h of fiduc iary duty may be measured either by quantifying the profit gained by the wrongdoer and ordering him to ac c ount for it as a trustee, or by quantifying the plaintiff’s loss of profit and awarding damages to c ompensate for it. In this c ase, PAE based part of its damage c alc ulation on a method followed in _Sure-Grip_. It submitted that as a result of Mr Chia’s breac hes it had lost the Blaser distributorship overnight and had suffered loss of opportunity. It quantified its damages as follows: 

 (a ) Lo s s o f o p p o rtu n ity fo r co o la n t s a le s 

 $466,230.00 

 (b ) Lo s s o f o p p o rtu n ity fo r Bla s e r’s n e a t cu ttin g o il s a le s 

 $ 49,950.00 

 (c) Sa la ry in lie u o f n o tice $6,496.00 (d ) C o s t o f VSM $ 59,008.70 Le s s : a p p o rtio n e d s a la ry u p to 26 Ju n e 2002 

 $ 6,960.00 

## $574,724.70 

77     In c alc ulating the loss of opportunity for c oolant sales to be worth $466,230, PAE relied, to 


an extent, on the formula employed in _Sure-Grip_. In that c ase, the defendants were found to have breac hed their fiduc iary duties to their employer by solic iting the latter’s c lients. Damages were c alc ulated by multiplying the plaintiff’s gross revenue by its gross profit margin (ratio of gross profit to sales) and then subtrac ting the plaintiff’s overheads in order to obtain a figure representing the revenue lost by the defendants’ ac tions. The formula requires three figures: gross revenue, gross profit margin and overheads. To get to $466,230, PAE used a gross revenue of $1.5m, multiplied it by 36.65% (the average profit margin enjoyed over three and a half years) and then subtrac ted from the produc t the sum of $83,520 being Mr Chia’s annual remuneration. PAE did not follow the formula stric tly bec ause it did not subtrac t all overheads from the produc t but c hose to use only Mr Chia’s salary. PAE has not, in my opinion, justified its departure from the formula used in _Sure-Grip_. If PAE wanted to use that formula, it should use it c onsistently whic h means that it must deduc t all its overheads and not only Mr Chia’s annual salary. As I do not have the figures for all other overheads that would have been inc urred, I c annot use this formula. 

78     On the other hand, c ounsel for Mr Chia submitted that the method of c alc ulating damages would be to take the average figure derived from the ac tual profit and loss of PAE for the three and a half years of the distributorship and use that to c alc ulate what PAE would have earned as profit over a period of three months. Using figures obtained from the profit and loss ac c ounts of PAE from 1999 to 2002, c ounsel submitted that the average profit per year of the distributorship was $4,633.24 and therefore the profit earned over a three-month period would be $1,158.31. He submitted that this basis of assessing damages was least spec ulative as it was based on the ac tual performanc e of PAE and the fac t that the distributorship c ould have been terminated by three months’ notic e at any time. Sinc e the information of the sales revenue and various expenses inc urred in obtaining that revenue were available, Mr Chia submitted that there was no basis to adopt the c alc ulation put forward by PAE, _ie_ gross profit margin multiplied by gross revenue. He submitted that this method of c alc ulation should only be adopted in situations where the profit and/or the ac tual operating c ost is unc ertain, whic h is not the c ase here. 

79     I do not agree that the average ac tual profit earned by PAE should, by itself, be used as the basis of the assessment of damages. Using the net profit figure alone would mean that one has not taken ac c ount of the amount that had to be expended in order to earn that profit. In order to do business, a c ompany has to inc ur c ertain c osts. To c alc ulate the profit from the business done, one takes the inc ome of the business and subtrac ts the c osts of earning it. When the inc ome of the business is abruptly c ut off, that does not mean that the c osts of earning the inc ome c ease immediately as well. It will take a c ompany some time to readjust its operations so as to trim the c osts relating to the business that has c eased. Following Mr Chia’s formula would mean disregarding expenses that PAE had to meet even though the distributorship had terminated and it would result in under-c ompensating PAE for Mr Chia’s breac h of c ontrac t. 

80     If the distributorship had c ontinued, there would have been inc ome whic h PAE c ould have used to defray its expenses. The operational c osts of the Division (exc luding Mr Chia’s salary) had been fixed at $12,600 a month. Mr Chia himself had agreed to this figure as operational c osts and those c osts had c onsistently, save in 2001, been fully c overed by inc ome from the Division. Onc e the distributorship was terminated, PAE had to bear these expenses while looking for a new sourc e of inc ome. I think that any award of damages to PAE must c over these c osts. The first question is for what period these c osts should be c overed. The distribution agreement was terminable at any time with three months’ notic e. That being the c ase, should the c ompensation be limited to three months? PAE submitted that it should not bec ause Blaser would not have terminated the distributorship had it not been for Mr Chia’s persuading it to do so. I agree that it would not be fair to limit the assessment of loss for a period of three months as the evidenc e pointed strongly to the fac t that in early 2002, Blaser had no intention of terminating the distributorship. In November 2001, the parties had 


disc ussed expansion plans in Malaysia and in February 2002, Blaser was looking forward to rec eiving these plans. At the same time, Blaser stated it was trying to deal with PAE’s c onc erns. That was not the language of a c ompany that was going to give notic e of termination. If Mr Chia had not instigated the move, Blaser might well have stayed with PAE for some time after June 2002. On the other hand, the distributorship agreement did not give PAE muc h sec urity of tenure. Apart from Blaser’s right to terminate on three months’ notic e, it c ould c ome to a quic k end if Mr Chia had resigned. PAE was well aware that Mr Chia was unhappy. It knew from Blaser’s trac k history that Blaser followed Mr Chia wherever he went. Its efforts to have Art 24.3 of the distributorship agreement deleted had been unsuc c essful. PAE was therefore in a situation where it c ould not really depend on the distributorship c ontinuing indefinitely. In those c irc umstanc es, I think that to c ompensate PAE for one year’s loss would be too muc h. PAE would be entitled to some time for it to try and obtain an alternative sourc e of inc ome and, if it was not able to do so, to reduc e its expenses so as to mitigate its loss. In the c irc umstanc es of this c ase, I think it would be fair to c alc ulate PAE’s damages on the basis of a sixmonth period, that length of time being twic e the length of the notic e period required under the agreement. On this basis, in respec t of the c oolant sales, PAE should be awarded $75,600 ($12,600 per month for six months) to c ompensate it for the operational expenses it had to bear as a result of the termination. 

81     The sec ond issue is whether, in addition, PAE should be c ompensated by an award whic h would rec ognise at least some part of the profit that it lost by reason of the termination. In this c onnec tion, it is relevant that Mr Chia had not been diligent. If he had made efforts to promote the produc ts to new c ustomers, he may well have suc c eeded in keeping the Division profitable despite the poor ec onomic times. Before joining PAE, he told it that Blaser had a turnover of approximately $1.2m per year. He never ac hieved that figure but profits were made in 1999 ($41,438.61) and 2000 ($50,466.76). I think that it would be fair to say that had Mr Chia kept up his efforts, he should have been able to earn $45,000 profit a year (that being the approximate average of the profits earned in 1999 and 2000). I therefore award PAE $22,500 as damages for half a year’s loss of profit by reason of Mr Chia’s breac h of duty. 

82     The next c omponent of the damages c laimed is the sum of $49,950 in respec t of the loss of opportunity to sell neat c utting oils. PAE submitted that from Marc h to June 2002, it had, through James Choo, c arried out researc h and prepared the Singapore and Malaysian markets for the sale of Blaser’s neat c utting oils. This bec ame a real opportunity when c ustomers agreed to try out these oils. PAE started ordering neat oils in April and May 2002. It had plac ed orders in June too. Mr Choo’s evidenc e was that Blaser’s neat oils were premium produc ts available at lower pric es. He said that onc e a c ustomer had agreed to a trial, there was a 90% c hanc e of that c ustomer c ommitting its other mac hines to using Blaser neat oils sinc e it was an established and premium brand. PAE c ited the c ase of Stamford Prec ision Tools as an example. That c ustomer had agreed to try Blaser neat oils on one mac hine in May 2002. Subsequently, it had gone on to order this oil for its sec ond mac hine and that sec ond purc hase had been made from Blaser Singapore as, by then, PAE had lost the distributorship. After termination, Blaser c anc elled the May and June orders (24 drums in total). Only five drums were ac tually delivered for the April order and two drums were sold to Stamford Prec ision Tools, one by PAE and one by Blaser Singapore. PAE was unable to follow-up with the c ustomers who had agreed to trials. 

83     PAE submitted that it had lost the opportunity to make the following profits from one year’s sales to the c ustomers spec ified: 

 (a) $17,550 from Innovalues Prec ision Ltd; 

 (b) $5,400 from Wong Engineering Sdn Bhd; 


 (c ) $2,025 from Giken Sakata (S) Ltd; 

 (d) $16,875 from Integrated Prec ision Engineering Ltd; and 

 (e) $8,100 from Yangbum Engineering Pte Ltd. 

It pointed out that those figures were based on Mr Choo’s market researc h and Mr Lee’s c alc ulations worked out on the basis of Blaser’s c osts and pric es. These figures were not spec ulative and had not been c hallenged by Mr Chia. 

84     It was submitted on behalf of Mr Chia that this head of damages was inherently and wholly spec ulative and should be dismissed in its entirety. The fac t was that only two drums of neat oil had been purc hased by Stamford Prec ision Tools. Neat oils had been sold by PAE throughout the Blaser distributorship and the sales figures for neat oils formed part of PAE’s overall profit and loss figures. The sale of two drums would not justify damages quantified at $49,950 whic h was gross profit without deduc ting other expenses. There was no evidenc e that all the listed potential c ustomers had ac tually c onduc ted trials before termination and muc h less how many would buy Blaser neat oils eventually. 

85     It does appear to me from the evidenc e that PAE had suc c eeded in c reating more interest in Blaser neat oils in the market than had existed before Mr Choo c ame on the sc ene. It is very diffic ult, however, to estimate what profits c ould have been made from his efforts as, at the time of termination, only one drum had been bought as a result of his efforts. The other c ustomers had indic ated that they were interested in c onduc ting trials but these had not yet been sc heduled. Whether the trials would have been suc c essful is also spec ulative. PAE’s c alc ulations were based on the c ustomers named ordering one year’s supply of oil for all of their mac hines. There was no evidenc e from these c ustomers that they would have done so. PAE’s c ase was based on the hopes of its staff. Further, as with the c ase of the c utting oils, c onsidering loss on the basis of a one-year period would not be justified. In the c irc umstanc es, I c an only make a general award of $5,000 for loss of opportunity to sell neat oils to the new c ustomers c ultivated by Mr Lee and Mr Choo. 

86     The third item of damages is a spec ial damages c laim. As I have found that Mr Chia had no intention of working out his notic e period, this c laim must suc c eed. 

87     The fourth item of damages is for the c ost of the VSM. It was PAE’s c ase that it spent $59,008.70 investing in the c reation and implementation of this Internet-based online ordering system in a protec ted, enc rypted environment for the c lients of Blaser produc ts. The VSM software enabled existing Blaser c ustomers to make online orders of Blaser produc ts and also updated PAE’s inventory and ac c ounting systems automatic ally. In the later stages of implementation, the VSM would have allowed PAE’s inventory systems to be linked and integrated with the Blaser c entral c omputer to forec ast and replenish stoc k automatic ally. When the distributorship was suddenly terminated, the c ost of the VSM was wasted. The new ac c ounting system whic h was tied-in with the VSM was also rendered redundant as it did not fit into PAE’s other business, as the business model and c ustomer profiles of the other business were c ompletely different from that of the Blaser business. 

88     It was submitted on behalf of Mr Chia that neither he nor Blaser had been told of the implementation of the VSM system or that this software system was brought in for the benefit of Blaser produc ts. It was only after implementation that Mr Chia disc overed its existenc e. Mr Niederhäuser had testified that VSM was not suitable for Blaser produc ts and it had not been implemented by Blaser’s head offic e. He explained that Blaser’s produc ts c ould not be sold by elec tronic means as Blaser salesmen had to visit the c ustomer’s workshop and be familiar with the 


manufac turing side of the c ustomer’s business. Otherwise there was a great danger that the c ustomer would switc h to other produc ts. 

89     In my view, PAE c annot rec over from Mr Chia the c ost of implementing the VSM system. He was not involved in its development or implementation. PAE invested in the system for its own business needs. As a distributor knowing that its tenure was not c ertain, it c hose to take a c alc ulated risk by developing suc h software. As Mr Chia did not enc ourage the development and was not aware of it, I do not think it would be c orrec t to make him bear its c ost. 

**Conclusion** 

90     In the premises, there will be judgment for the plaintiff. The plaintiff is awarded damages in the sum of $102,636 made up as follows: 

 (a) $75,600; 

 (b) $22,500; 

 (c ) $5,000; and 

 (d) $6,496; 

 less: the defendant’s salary for June 2002 of $6,960. 

The c ounterc laim is dismissed. The defendant shall pay the plaintiff’s c osts. There shall be one set of c osts for the c laim and the c ounterc laim.
