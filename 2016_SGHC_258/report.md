**Introduction** 

1       This is an applic ation to admit Mr Toby Thomas Landau QC (“the Applic ant”) under s 15 of the Legal Profession Ac t (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“LPA”) to represent China Mac hine New Energy Corporation (“CMNC”), a c ompany inc orporated under the laws of the People’s Republic of China, in Originating Summons No 185 of 2016 (“OS 185”). OS 185 is CMNC’s applic ation to set aside an arbitral award dated 25 November 2015 (“the Award”). The Award was made in favour of Jaguar Energy Guatemala LLC, a c orporation inc orporated under the laws of Delaware in the United States of Americ a, and AEI Guatemala Jaguar Ltd, a c orporation existing under the laws of the Cayman Islands (c ollec tively referred to as “Jaguar”). The AttorneyGeneral supported the Applic ant’s applic ation for admission while Jaguar and the Law Soc iety of Singapore opposed it. 

2       In OS 185, CMNC seeks to set aside the Award on any or all of the following grounds: [note: 1] 

 (a) That a breac h of the rules of natural justic e oc c urred in c onnec tion with the making of the Award by whic h the rights of CMNC have been prejudic ed, pursuant to s 24( b ) of the International Arbitration Ac t (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”) and Artic le 34(2)( a )(ii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commerc ial Arbitration set out in the First Sc hedule of the IAA (“Model Law”). 

 (b) That the arbitral proc edure in the arbitration was not in ac c ordanc e with the agreement of the parties, pursuant to Artic le 34(2)( a )(iv) of the Model Law. 

 (c ) That the Award is in c onflic t with the public polic y of Singapore, pursuant to Artic le 34(2) ( b )(ii) of the Model Law. 

 (d) That the making of the Award was induc ed by fraud or c orruption, pursuant to s 24( a ) of the IAA. 


3       In support of this applic ation, CMNC has relied on several atypic al arguments it will raise in OS 

185\. One of those arguments, for example, is that Jaguar took steps to hinder its preparation for the arbitration by engaging in “guerrilla tac tic s”, and that the tribunal issued unfair proc edural orders and interventions in the c ourse of the arbitration, as a result of whic h it was unable to present its c ase. This, CMNC argues, c onstituted a breac h of its right to be heard under s 24( _b_ ) of the IAA or Artic le 34(2)( _a_ )(ii) of the Model Law. 

4       In my rec ent dec ision in _Re Wordsworth, Samuel Sherratt QC_ <span class="citation">[2016] 5 SLR 179</span> (“ _Re Wordsworth_ ”), I admitted Mr Wordsworth QC to argue an applic ation to set aside an investor-state arbitration award where the issues were observed (at [3]) to be “predominantly governed by princ iples of public international law”. I added at [22] that if the only issue in that applic ation involved a “fairly straightforward” due proc ess c hallenge, “Mr Wordsworth’s applic ation would not pass muster”. 

5       The princ ipal ground relied on by CMNC in OS 185 is that a breac h of the rules of natural justic e oc c urred. Would suc h a due proc ess c hallenge “pass muster”? Inquiring whether the rules have been breac hed is nec essarily a fac t-sensitive exerc ise. The fac ts giving rise to suc h c hallenges may be fairly straightforward in some c ases and more c omplex in others. But however c omplex the fac ts may be, the princ iples for setting aside an award for breac h of natural justic e are reasonably well-settled. Further, the inquiry will ultimately be based on the events as they have unfolded in the arbitration. That is largely, if not entirely, assisted by reviewing the rec ord of the arbitration. 

6       In addition to the due proc ess c hallenge, CMNC has also raised what in its views are novel arguments, inc luding the issue of whether there is a duty implied in the arbitration agreement to arbitrate in good faith. CMNC asserts that suc h a duty should be implied, a breac h of whic h would justify setting aside the Award on the ground that the arbitral proc edure was not in ac c ordanc e with the agreement of the parties. 

7       It is not unc ommon to raise novel legal arguments in the c ourse of c ourt proc eedings. But novelty _per se_ should not be c onfused with c omplexity. Usually, there must be a fac tual substratum to support any argument, however novel or c omplex it may be. In view of the fac t that this is an admission applic ation and not the underlying applic ation in OS 185, this judgment will examine the appropriate level of sc rutiny that a c ourt should undertake of the “novel” issues in dec iding whether it is reasonable, having regard to all the c irc umstanc es, to admit an applic ant under s 15 of the LPA. 

**Background** 

8       The underlying dispute c onc erned a LumpSum, Turnkey Engineering, Proc urement, and Construc tion Contrac t (“EPC Contrac t”), dated 29 Marc h 2008. Under the EPC Contrac t, CMNC was to c onstruc t a power generation plant in Guatemala for Jaguar for the approximate sum of US$450m. The 

sum was to be paid progressively to CMNC by way of milestone payments. [note: 2] 

9       On 13 November 2009, CMNC and Jaguar amended the EPC Contrac t to allow Jaguar to issue debit notes to CMNC in plac e of the milestone payments whic h would fall due under the EPC Contrac t. On the same day, CMNC and Jaguar entered into a deferred payment sec urity agreement (“DPSA”). This provided that the debit notes would be sec ured by Jaguar granting CMNC sec urity interests over 

its c ollateral assets. [note: 3] Under the DPSA, Jaguar had an obligation to provide evidenc e of the sec urity interests and to perfec t them. Jaguar began issuing debit notes on 15 November 2010 and 

eventually issued a total of 61 debit notes amounting to approximately US$129m. [note: 4] 


10     The EPC Contrac t and the DPSA are both governed by New York law and provide for disputes to be resolved by arbitration ac c ording to the 1988 Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of 

Commerc e (“the ICC Rules”). [note: 5] The seat of arbitration is stated to be Singapore. 

11     I will briefly set out the parties’ legal dispute over the EPC Contrac t and DPSA as well as their c onflic ting ac c ounts of the proc edural history of the arbitration. 

12     Ac c ording to CMNC, Jaguar refused to perfec t c ertain sec urity interests in Oc tober or November 2013, as required by the DPSA. CMNC made a formal demand in Oc tober 2013 for Jaguar to fully evidenc e and perfec t the sec urity interests within 30 days or, in the alternative, pay all the milestone 

payments whic h had ac c rued under the EPC Contrac t. [note: 6] Jaguar did not c omply with this demand. CMNC therefore dec lared an event of default under the DPSA and, pursuant to a letter dated 28 November 2013, took possession of the sec urities granted to it, inc luding Jaguar’s rights under the 

EPC Contrac t and the power generation plant. [note: 7] 

13     CMNC says Jaguar purported to terminate the EPC Contrac t on 14 Dec ember 2013 [note: 8] even though it had no right to do so given that CMNC had taken over its rights under the EPC Contrac t. [note: 9] 

14     CMNC alleges, further, that (a) beginning in Oc tober 2013, Jaguar employed sec urity guards at the projec t site to prevent CMNC employees from removing doc uments and equipment; and (b) in Dec ember 2013, Jaguar evic ted CMNC employees from the living quarters on the projec t site and 

prevented any re-entry with the threat of violenc e. [note: 10] These ac ts show that Jaguar had started impeding CMNC’s preparation for the arbitration even before Jaguar formally c ommenc ed the 

arbitration on 28 January 2014. [note: 11] Jaguar then c ontinued to employ guerrilla tac tic s to impede 

CMNC’s preparation of its c ase throughout the proc edural history of the arbitration. [note: 12] These guerrilla tac tic s inc luded, for example, Jaguar’s proc uring the detention of CMNC’s Chinese employees in Guatemala on the basis that they were illegal immigrants, whic h affec ted CMNC’s ability to prepare its witness statements, and Jaguar’s theft of CMNC’s hard disks c ontaining important projec t doc uments from the employees’ living quarters. 

15     Ac c ording to Jaguar, throughout the first half of 2013, CMNC was c onsistently behind sc hedule 

on the projec t. [note: 13] By 11 Oc tober 2013, it dec ided to put CMNC on notic e that it was not 

fulfilling its obligations under the EPC Contrac t. [note: 14] Jaguar issued a number of notic es of default 

to CMNC. [note: 15] On 14 Dec ember 2013, Jaguar notified CMNC that the EPC Contrac t and the DPSA 

were terminated. [note: 16] 

16     Jaguar alleges that the so-c alled “guerrilla tac tic s” CMNC ac c uses it of were simply steps to ensure the c ompletion of the projec t; they did not and were not intended to affec t the arbitration. [note: 17] Jaguar alleges that it did not forc efully take over the projec t site on 15 Dec ember 2013, and 

that it was in fac t CMNC whic h refused to ac c ept termination of the EPC Contrac t, threatened Jaguar 

with violenc e, and took steps to hinder Jaguar’s c ompletion of the projec t. [note: 18] Jaguar alleges that CMNC engaged in proc edural gamesmanship by repeatedly c hanging its legal and expert teams and repeatedly asking for extensions of time from the arbitral tribunal to meet proc edural deadlines, in 

some c ases even after those deadlines had passed. [note: 19] 

**The arbitration** 


17     Jaguar c ommenc ed arbitration on or about 28 January 2014. This was pursuant to the ICC 

Rules. [note: 20] 

18     Jaguar sought a dec laration that it had validly terminated the EPC Contrac t and damages c omprising, among other things, liquidated damages resulting from delays c aused by CMNC. It also sought a dec laration that the DPSA was terminated, the sec urity interests thereunder were 

extinguished, and the outstanding debit notes were c anc elled. [note: 21] 

19     CMNC sought, among other things, dec larations that Jaguar’s failure to evidenc e and perfec t the sec urity interests c onstituted a material breac h of the DPSA, that Jaguar’s purported termination of the EPC Contrac t and the DPSA was invalid and without legal basis, and that CMNC was entitled to extensions of time for the sc heduled taking-over dates and additional payments as the tribunal 

thought appropriate. [note: 22] 

20     A three-member arbitral tribunal was c onstituted. The arbitration hearings took plac e on various 

dates between April 2014 and July 2015 in London, Singapore, Toronto, Hong Kong, and Dublin. [note: 23] 

21     In the Award rendered on 25 November 2015, the tribunal found in favour of Jaguar. The tribunal held that the DPSA was terminated, that the sec urity interests were extinguished, and that the outstanding debit notes were c anc elled. It also held that Jaguar had validly terminated the EPC Contrac t and awarded it US$129,389,417 in damages for CMNC’s breac hes of c ontrac t, as well as 

interest and c osts. [note: 24] The tribunal substantially rejec ted all of CMNC’s c laims for relief. 

22     CMNC now seeks, in OS 185, to set aside the Award on the grounds listed at [2] above. 

**The present application** 

23     The law governing the _ad hoc_ admission of foreign c ounsel under s 15 of the LPA has been disc ussed on many oc c asions. The most authoritative exposition is the Court of Appeal’s in _Re Beloff Michael Jacob QC_ <span class="citation">[2014] 3 SLR 424</span> (“ _Re Beloff_ ”) at [51]–[65]. 

24     In any applic ation for _ad hoc_ admission, the c ourt must first be satisfied that the applic ant (a) is a Queen’s Counsel or holds an appointment of equivalent distinc tion in any jurisdic tion; (b) does not ordinarily reside in Singapore or Malaysia but has c ome or intends to c ome to Singapore for the purpose of appearing in the c ase; and (c ) has spec ial qualific ations or experienc e for the purpose of the c ase (see ss 15(1)( _a_ )–( _c_ ) of the LPA). These requirements are mandatory. If they are not met, the applic ation must be dismissed. 

25     If the mandatory requirements are satisfied, the c ourt then dec ides whether to exerc ise its disc retion to admit the applic ant, having regard to the four matters set out in paragraph 3 of the Legal Profession (Ad Hoc Admissions) Notific ation 2012 (S 132/2012). These are: (a) the nature of the fac tual and legal issues involved in the c ase; (b) the nec essity for the servic es of a foreign senior c ounsel; (c ) the availability of any loc al Senior Counsel or other advoc ate and solic itor with appropriate experienc e; and (d) whether, having regard to the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, it is reasonable to admit a foreign senior c ounsel for the purpose of the c ase (“Notific ation matters”). 

**Issues in OS 185** 

26     There are two overarc hing c onsiderations of the _ad hoc_ admissions regime: identifying the 


issues in c ontention in the underlying applic ation, and assessing whether there is a need for foreign c ounsel’s assistanc e with referenc e to those issues, “need” for this purpose enc ompassing that of the litigant and the c ourt (see _Re Wordsworth_ at [39]). 

27     I propose to start by desc ribing in some detail the issues to be argued in OS 185. There are a number of them but, for this applic ation, c ounsel for the Applic ant, Mr Paul Tan, c hose to foc us only 

on four. [note: 25] During the hearing before me it bec ame c lear to me that whether or not these four issues were novel and c omplex was the key point of departure between the opposing parties in this applic ation. I shall desc ribe them with referenc e to the grounds of c hallenge of the Award and the fac ts giving rise to the c hallenges. 

28     The first issue is whether a party’s obstruc tive c onduc t before and during an arbitration c an c onstitute an infringement of the other party’s right to be heard, giving rise to a ground to set aside an award under Artic le 34(2) _(a_ )(ii) of the Model Law. CMNC alleges that Jaguar took steps to hinder 

its preparation for the arbitration by, among other things, employing guerrilla tac tic s. [note: 26] For example, it is said that Jaguar denied CMNC ac c ess to doc uments stored on the projec t site and bribed Guatemalan offic ials to detain CMNC staff who had knowledge of the c ase just before submissions were due in the arbitration. 

29     The sec ond issue, linked to the first, is whether suc h obstruc tive c onduc t _also_ amounts to an infringement of an implied duty in the arbitration agreement to arbitrate in good faith and, if so, whether a breac h of this implied duty would justify setting aside the Award on the ground that “the arbitral proc edure was not in ac c ordanc e with the agreement of the parties” (see Artic le 34(2)( _a_ )(iv) of the Model Law). 

30     The third issue is whether the tribunal’s alleged hostility towards CMNC, as manifested in unfair proc edural orders and interventions in the c ourse of its giving evidenc e, meant that CMNC was “unable to present [its] c ase” (see Artic le 34(2)( _a_ )(ii)) of the Model Law). CMNC’s primary c omplaint is over the tribunal’s use of an Attorney’s Eyes Only (“AEO”) order, a proc edural order for safeguarding c onfidential information. CMNC takes issue with the tribunal allowing Jaguar’s applic ation 

to subjec t the disc losure of c ommerc ially-sensitive doc uments to an AEO order. [note: 27] The tribunal also allowed Jaguar to unilaterally designate further doc uments as AEO, whic h meant that only CMNC’s external c ounsel and expert witnesses c ould view them. Had CMNC wanted its employees to have ac c ess to those doc uments, CMNC would have had to first apply to the tribunal for disc losure on 

a doc ument-by-doc ument basis. [note: 28] Jaguar eventually designated more than 18,000 doc uments 

as AEO. [note: 29] Although CMNC’s external c ounsel and expert witnesses had ac c ess to these doc uments, CMNC asserts that its ability to prepare its c ase was nonetheless affec ted. CMNC’s external c ounsel and expert witnesses did not possess suffic ient knowledge of the projec t to properly evaluate the doc uments; only those employees of CMNC who had been involved in the projec t did. [note: 30] CMNC alleges that the tribunal turned a deaf ear to its repeated requests for the AEO order 

to be lifted. However, the AEO order was granted with liberty to CMNC to apply for its witnesses to 

view the doc uments though no suc h applic ation was ever made by CMNC. [note: 31] Furthermore, CMNC did apply to the tribunal to lift the AEO order but dec ided to withdraw the applic ation on the basis that it was in disc ussion with Jaguar to resolve the AEO issue. In any event, the AEO order was eventually lifted by c onsent on 18 Marc h 2015, about four months before the main evidential hearing took plac e in Dublin in July 2015. 

31     The fourth issue is whether enforc ing the Award would be c ontrary to the public polic y of Singapore within the meaning of Artic le 34(2)( _b_ )(ii) of the Model Law. CMNC alleges that the Award is 


in c onflic t with public polic y bec ause it was obtained by Jaguar through guerrilla tac tic s both prior to 

and throughout the arbitration. [note: 32] CMNC also alleges that the Award was c ontrary to public polic y bec ause of c orruption. Jaguar originally had a c laim for “post-termination public relations c osts” amounting to US$2,526,071 but withdrew the c laim after it emerged during the main evidential hearing that a representative of Jaguar, one Ernesto Cordova, had bribed high-ranking offic ials in Guatemala to obtain assistanc e in relation to Jaguar’s dispute with CMNC and the c ompletion of the projec t. [note: 33] The allegations against Cordova affec ted Jaguar’s c laims bec ause it appeared that Jaguar 

had paid those bribes to Guatemalan offic ials through a woman c alled Karen Canc inos, who had allegedly a fic titious public relations c onsultanc y c ontrac t with Jaguar, and whose fees were part of 

the “public relations c osts” c laim whic h Jaguar withdrew. [note: 34] CMNC henc e suggests that part of 

Jaguar’s c laim for the c osts of c ompletion was attributable to the bribes Jaguar had paid. [note: 35] CMNC further alleges that the tribunal had a duty, whic h it failed to disc harge, to investigate the impac t of the c orruption allegations on Jaguar’s c laims, in partic ular, the c laim for c osts to c omplete. [note: 36] An anc illary issue whic h henc e arises is whether an arbitral tribunal has suc h a duty in the 

first plac e. 

**Mandatory requirements** 

32     It is undisputed that the Applic ant satisfies the formal requirements in s 15(1)( _a_ ) and (1)( _b_ ) of 

the LPA. He was appointed Queen’s Counsel in 2008. [note: 37] He resides in the United Kingdom and intends to c ome to Singapore to represent CMNC in OS 185. 

**_Special qualifications and experience_** 

33     As for s 15(1)( _c_ ) of the LPA, c ounsel for Jaguar, Mr Daniel Chia, indic ated in the c ourse of the hearing his willingness to ac c ept, in c ontrast to the position in his written submissions, that the 

Applic ant does possess spec ial qualific ations and experienc e for the purpose of the c ase. [note: 38] 

Only the Law Soc iety maintained that he does not. [note: 39] Its grounds of objec tion were as follows: 

 (a) Regarding the first and third issues, the c ourt’s task is to determine if the spec ific fac ts alleged by CMNC amounted to a breac h of natural justic e. There was no evidenc e that the Applic ant possessed any spec ial qualific ations or experienc e whic h c ould not be found among loc al c ounsel. [note: 40] 

 (b) As regards the sec ond issue, the Applic ant does not have spec ial qualific ations and experienc e bec ause the previous oc c asion on whic h he dealt with the implied duty of good faith was when he sat as an arbitrator in an investor-state arbitration. The present c ase, on the other hand, arose from an international c ommerc ial arbitration. [note: 41] 

 (c ) Finally, as regards the fourth issue, the Law Soc iety submitted that the IAA is a piec e of loc al legislation. Loc al jurisprudenc e would be most relevant when dec iding whether the Award c onflic ts with the public polic y of Singapore. The Applic ant “c annot reasonably be argued to possess the relevant qualific ations and experienc e for this”. [note: 42] 

34     I am not persuaded by these submissions. The Law Soc iety’s first argument seems to imply that loc al c ounsel would be no less well-plac ed to argue OS 185. That is a point whic h goes to the sec ond and third Notific ation matters ( _ie_ , the nec essity of foreign c ounsel and the availability of loc al c ounsel) whic h I will separately examine below. 


35     Its sec ond argument is hardly an objec tion. It appears to be an implic it admission that the Applic ant does have spec ial expertise, sinc e it shows that the Applic ant has in prac tic e c onfronted the issue of the duty of good faith before albeit in a different c apac ity and under a different arbitration regime. 

36     Its third argument is not persuasive either. The c onc ept of “public polic y” under the IAA does not refer to the politic al stanc e that Singapore takes against c orruption. As the Court of Appeal held in _PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA_ <span class="citation">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 597</span> at [59], “public polic y” for the purpose of setting aside an award refers to fundamental princ iples of law and justic e. Corruption, bribery, or fraud would offend suc h fundamental princ iples, whic h would be c ommon to most jurisdic tions adopting the Model Law. Therefore, the c ourt hearing OS 185 is not stric tly c onc erned with loc al legislation “that has no analogue elsewhere” suc h that it would be ordinarily diffic ult to show that foreign c ounsel has spec ial qualific ations or experienc e for the purpose of the c ase (see _Re Beloff_ at [56]). It follows that the c hallenge to an arbitral award based on public polic y is not, as the Law Soc iety appears to suggest, a loc al-c entric one. Granted, the c onc ept of “public polic y” under the IAA c annot be interpreted without referenc e to loc al jurisprudenc e on this point. But the Law Soc iety’s submission that the Applic ant “c annot reasonably be argued to possess the relevant qualific ations and experienc e” simply bec ause loc al jurisprudenc e is involved would imply that no foreign c ounsel c ould ever have suc h qualific ations or experienc e so long as loc al jurisprudenc e is involved. That would be to take an unduly restric tive approac h to the admissions regime. 

37     Apart from that, there is c onsensus that the Applic ant possesses wide-ranging experienc e in arbitration and c ertainly has the requisite expertise to address the four issues identified by Mr Tan. I have no doubt that, for the purpose of s 15(1)( _c_ ), the Applic ant does possess spec ial qualific ations and experienc e that will allow him “to expertly disc harge [his] duties to the c lient and to the c ourt ‘for the purpose’ of the c ase for whic h _ad hoc_ admission is sought” (see _Re Andrews Geraldine Mary QC_ <span class="citation">[2013] 1 SLR 872</span> (“ _Re Andrews_ ”) at [39]). I turn to c onsider, with referenc e to the Notific ation matters, whether I should exerc ise my disc retion to admit him to represent CMNC in OS 185. 

**Notification Matters** 

**_Nature of factual and legal issues in this case_** 

38     The first Notific ation Matter is “direc ted at a qualitative evaluation of the c harac ter of the issues in the c ase”, whic h would c all for an assessment of “whether the issues are c omplex or diffic ult, or novel, or of signific ant prec edential value” (see _Re Beloff_ at [61]). Based on the previous c ases on admission applic ations, it seems to me that there are a number of general princ iples whic h c an guide this qualitative evaluation. 

39     It is useful to ask how likely it is that the stated issues will ac tually arise for determination. Allegedly novel or c omplex points of law may not need to be dealt with if, for example, the other party does not intend to pursue them (see _Re Caplan Jonathan Michael QC_ <span class="citation">[2013] 3 SLR 66</span> (“ _Re Caplan_ ”) at [63]–[64]), or if the c ourt c an say with the benefit of c lear legal authority that they will not arise on the fac ts of the c ase (see _Re Rogers, Heather QC_ <span class="citation">[2015] 4 SLR 1064</span> (“ _Re Rogers_ ”) at [54]). 

40     Having identified the fac tual and legal issues that will arise, the c ourt should give some thought as to how they are likely to be argued. It may also direc t its mind towards the “proc edural or evidential c omplexities whic h will or are likely to arise in the c ourse of the underlying c ase” and whic h will influenc e the resolution of the issues (see _Re Andrews_ at [47]). Suc h an inquiry will vary depending on the nature of the applic ation for whic h admission is sought. 


41     Where disputes of fac t are c onc erned, it is important to look at the nature of the supporting evidenc e. If the evidenc e is doc umentary, one may ask whether it is “so c onvoluted or esoteric as to be beyond the c omprehension of c ompetent loc al c ounsel” ( _Re Caplan_ at [61]). If the evidenc e is largely oral, the c redibility of witnesses will be signific ant and the trial experienc e of foreign c ounsel may be more pertinent to the overall question of “need” (see _Re Andrews_ at [73]). This would be relevant if the applic ant is being sought to be admitted for the trial of the ac tion or where c rossexamination is ordered. This c onsideration does not arise here. 

42     As regards questions of law, the c ourt should sieve out those whic h are already well-settled (see _Re Beloff_ at [80]; _Re Rogers_ at [53]). Suc h questions are unlikely to give rise to any unusual c omplexity or diffic ulty. On the other hand, legal propositions whic h have to be extrac ted from a long line of possibly c onflic ting authorities may justifiably be regarded as more c omplex (see _Re Fordham, Michael QC_ <span class="citation">[2015] 1 SLR 272</span> at [77]). In this regard, it may be relevant to c onsider the breadth and depth of researc h that will have to be undertaken to address any legal issue (see _Re Lord Goldsmith Peter Henry QC_ <span class="citation">[2013] 4 SLR 921</span> (“ _Re Lord Goldsmith_ ”) at [52]). 

43     Besides looking at how the arguments are likely to be presented, it is also relevant to c onsider how the c ourt hearing the c ase is likely to resolve the fac tual and legal issues. To illustrate this point, in the c ontext of applic ations to set aside an arbitral award, there is a differenc e between setting aside an award on jurisdic tion, whic h involves a _de novo_ standard of review and thus a greater possibility of fac tual and legal c omplexity (see _Re Wordsworth_ at [44]), and an applic ation to set aside for breac h of natural justic e, for example, for whic h the sc ope of c urial intervention is far more limited (see [54] below). 

44     However, in c onsidering how the issues are likely to play out, the c ourt should be wary of delving too deeply into the merits of the c ase given that it is not hearing the underlying c ase for whic h admission is sought. Yet it c annot c ompletely ignore either party’s prospec ts of suc c ess. The Court of Appeal in _Re Beloff_ desc ribed the tension in this way (at [79]): 

 In forming an assessment of the c omplexity of the legal issues in a c ase the question arises as to the extent to whic h the c ourt should c onsider the substantive merits of the c ase. Certainly not too muc h, for at the preliminary stage of applying to admit foreign senior c ounsel the parties’ arguments may not yet be fully formed; yet, not too little, for if the substantive merits are unarguably in one party’s favour then it c annot be said that the issues are c omplex. 

45     I am mindful of these c ompeting c onsiderations bec ause Jaguar alleged that two of CMNC’s arguments to set aside the Award – based on the implied duty of good faith and the tribunal’s alleged duty to investigate c orruption – were neither novel nor c omplex but were simply without legal basis. [note: 43] 

46     I think the foc us of the inquiry should not be whether the issues raised in the substantive applic ation are arguable. Even in _Re Beloff_ , where the Court noted that the parties had put forward “fairly developed c ontentions” in support of their positions in the underlying c ase, the Court went no further than to note that on one of the issues, the arguments raised by the party resisting the admission of foreign c ounsel “seemed persuasive” though ac knowledging that this might have stemmed from the absenc e of any riposte from the other side (at [79]). It would not be appropriate for the admission applic ation to develop into a lengthy preliminary c ontest in advanc e of the ac tual c ase for whic h admission is sought. That said, the strength of the support for either party’s c ase, to the extent that it c an be demonstrated, would be something to be borne in mind, not in dec iding who has the better c ase, but as fac tors whic h may impac t on the c ourt’s assessment of the novelty or c omplexity of the issues. It would suffic e to identify the legal issues, the “fairly developed 


c ontentions” whic h will be advanc ed at the substantive hearing and the authorities whic h will be relied upon in support of the c ontentions. If it is shown c onvinc ingly that some of the c ontentions are plainly unarguable or far-fetc hed, then, as noted in _Re Beloff_ , it c annot be said that they will be c omplex. In suc h a c ase, it will hardly be appropriate or nec essary to admit foreign c ounsel to argue those points. 

47     In this c ase, although Jaguar did suggest that a number of CMNC’s arguments in OS 185 might 

be “devoid of any legal or prec edential basis” [note: 44] , they have not quite explained why there is no legal basis beyond pointing to the lac k of judic ial authority. They did, however, put forward a number of loc al authorities showing that the arguments raised by CMNC may not be novel, or at least may be resolved by applying settled princ iples. I will c onsider them in due c ourse. 

48     The salient point in my view is this: the c ourt should not analyse the legal issues in a vac uum. It is important to relate those issues to the fac ts and evidenc e whic h will be relied upon so as to apprec iate the shape the legal arguments will eventually take in the substantive hearing. For present purposes, one thing is c lear. The fac ts and evidenc e presented by the parties in the arbitration c an no longer c hange and have been entirely c hronic led in the rec ord of the arbitration. 

49     With these c onsiderations in mind, I turn to the issues in OS 185. 

_The first issue – obstructive conduct_ 

50     I start with the first issue on obstruc tive c onduc t. Mr Tan submits that: (a) whether obstruc tive c onduc t c an c onstitute a breac h of the other party’s right to be heard is a novel issue; [note: 45] (b) whether a tribunal’s failure to restrain suc h c onduc t c an be a ground for setting aside an 

award is a point on whic h there is c omparatively little disc ussion of in the literature; [note: 46] and (c ) the c ourt’s dec ision on this point will also be of prec edential value bec ause it will set normative 

standards of c onduc t for arbitrating parties whether in Singapore or elsewhere. [note: 47] The 

Attorney-General was in broad agreement. [note: 48] 

51     Jaguar submits that the c ourt will first have to undertake a c omprehensive review of the rec ord of the arbitration to determine if the allegations about Jaguar’s obstruc tive c onduc t are made out. Only then c an it c onsider whether, at law, that c onduc t justifies setting aside the Award as a c onsequenc e of CMNC’s right to be heard being affec ted. Determining that would not be a legally 

c omplex inquiry. [note: 49] 

52     In my judgment, whether Jaguar’s obstruc tive c onduc t would justify setting aside the Award for breac h of natural justic e is not so c omplex or novel a point as to lean in favour of admission. There was general agreement that the legal princ iples on setting aside an award for breac h of natural 

justic e have been c onsidered on many oc c asions by our c ourts. [note: 50] Here, it is the tribunal’s alleged failure to rec ognise or rein in Jaguar’s obstruc tive c onduc t – its guerrilla tac tic s – whic h is said 

to be a breac h of CMNC’s right to be heard. [note: 51] The c onduc t of the tribunal being c hallenged may not spec ific ally have been the subjec t of any previous setting-aside applic ation but the c ruc ial inquiry remains the same, _ie_ , whether there was any c ausal c onnec tion between the tribunal’s alleged failure to respond to suc h obstruc tive c onduc t and the ability of CMNC to present its c ase. The c ourt will nec essarily examine the objec tions, if any, whic h were raised by CMNC in relation to suc h obstruc tive c onduc t during the arbitration and the c onsequential direc tions and orders, if any, made by the tribunal. 


53     It is inc reasingly the c ase that a variety of proc edural dec isions made by tribunals are c hallenged for being in breac h of their duty to give eac h party a fair hearing. As I previously observed, this reflec ts parties’ attempts to expand the boundaries of natural justic e as a ground for setting aside an award (see _Coal & Oil Co LLC v GHCL Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2015] 3 SLR 154</span> at [3]). However, our c ourts have resolved suc h novel c hallenges by applying the settled legal princ iples on when an arbitral award should be set aside for breac h of natural justic e. There is no suggestion that the c ourt hearing OS 185 c annot do likewise. 

54     The dispute will thus foc us on whether the tribunal’s response, or lac k thereof, to Jaguar’s misc onduc t warrants setting aside the Award. This c an be determined by examining the proc edural history of the arbitration whic h has been set out in affidavits filed by CMNC and Jaguar in OS 185. I do not think suc h a review would be partic ularly diffic ult, c omplex, or beyond the range of loc al c ounsel’s c ompetenc e. The review is essentially objec tive in nature and one will have to bear in mind the limited sc ope for c urial intervention where breac hes of natural justic e are alleged given the high threshold that must be c rossed before a c ourt will set aside an award. It is not a c ourt’s task “to rake through the award and the rec ord fastidiously with the view to finding fault with the arbitral proc ess” (see _BLB and another v BLC and others_ <span class="citation">[2013] 4 SLR 1169</span> at [35]). Any alleged breac hes of natural justic e must be “demonstrably c lear on the fac e of the rec ord” (see _TMM Division Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2013] 4 SLR 972</span> at [125]). This means that the fac tual substratum of suc h a c hallenge would be within a reasonably narrow c ompass. In this c onnec tion, it is material to note Mr Chia’s submission that CMNC did bring the guerrilla tac tic s to the attention of the tribunal for the purpose of seeking extensions of time. It is not disputed that the tribunal did grant the extensions 

(though some might have been shorter than what CMNC requested). [note: 52] Henc e, the tribunal would have c onsidered CMNC’s c omplaint as regards the guerrilla tac tic s. 

_Second issue – implied duty of good faith_ 

55     Mr Tan submits that a Singapore c ourt has yet to c onsider the issue of whether there is a duty to arbitrate in good faith. The available c ommentary on this duty is c onfined to examining its operation within the arbitral proc ess and does not address how this duty c an give rise to grounds for 

setting aside an arbitral award. [note: 53] The AttorneyGeneral agrees there has been no loc al judic ial determination on this implied duty to arbitrate in good faith, whic h makes it a novel and c omplex 

issue. [note: 54] 

56     In response, Jaguar submits, as it did with the first issue, that the c ourt must first be satisfied that the ac ts giving rise to the breac h of the implied duty to arbitrate in good faith did oc c ur – the implied duty would not be a live issue otherwise. Even if it were, Jaguar submits that there is simply 

no legal basis for setting aside an arbitral award based on a breac h of suc h an implied duty. [note: 55] The Law Soc iety submits that implying a duty to arbitrate in good faith is a matter of interpreting an 

arbitration agreement. This is a matter our c ourts routinely engage with. [note: 56] 

57     It seems to me that the question of an implied duty to arbitrate in good faith only assumes relevanc e in OS 185 if: (a) suc h a duty is shown to exist; (b) Jaguar breac hed the duty; and (c ) suc h a breac h translates into a ground to set aside the Award. 

58     Whether the duty exists does not appear to me to be an entirely novel question. I was referred to an artic le showing that the duty has been rec ognised in awards and c ases from around the world (see “Arbitrating in Good Faith and Protec ting the Integrity of the Arbitral Proc ess”, The Paris Journal of International Arbitration (2010), Vol 3, p 737). For example, one arbitral tribunal held that it was a breac h of the duty of good faith to obtain evidenc e illegally (in that c ase, by wiretapping) and, in 


response, issued an order ordering the guilty party not to interc ept c ommunic ations. There are also a number of judic ial dec isions to the effec t that a party who has not ac ted in good faith – _eg_ , by being guilty of undue delay – will be estopped from c hallenging the jurisdic tion of the arbitral tribunal. Suc h a duty c an arguably be seen as inherent in an arbitration agreement, or implied by the governing law of the arbitration agreement or the law of the seat of the arbitration. Mr Tan has not explained why it would be nec essary to admit the Applic ant to make the c ase for rec ognising a duty on any of these grounds. In partic ular, so far as the duty is a c ontrac tual one, I agree with the Law Soc iety that the c onc ept of a c ontrac tual duty of good faith is not unfamiliar to our c ourts. 

59     Whether Jaguar breac hed the duty, if suc h a duty exists, is a fac tual inquiry. There is no reason why loc al c ounsel c annot undertake suc h a task. Any novelty at best lies in developing the link between one party’s breac h of its duty of good faith and the failure of the tribunal to c onduc t the arbitration in ac c ordanc e with the agreement of the parties, whic h would be a ground to set aside the Award under Artic le 34(2)( _a_ )(iv) of the Model Law. Ac c ording to Mr Tan, this point has yet to be dec ided by any c ourt. If that is c orrec t, then the Applic ant or suitable loc al c ounsel would both be starting from the same base, _ie_ , arguing from first princ iples. I fail to see why loc al c ounsel would not be able to argue this issue c ompetently. The argument seems to imply that arguing novel issues or ground breaking points of law is outside the c ompetenc e of loc al c ounsel. However, as Jaguar rightly observed, a number of novel princ iples of law in setting-aside applic ations have been argued by loc al 

c ounsel. [note: 57] 

60     I should add that the breac h of an alleged duty to arbitrate in good faith is _solely_ premised on the same guerrilla tac tic s whic h are relied on in support of the alleged breac h of natural justic e. If those underlying fac ts are found in OS 185 to c onstitute a breac h of natural justic e, then there is hardly any utility in dec iding whether it would separately justify setting aside the Award under Artic le 34(2)( _a_ )(iv) of the Model Law. By the same token, if the fac ts do not amount to a breac h of natural justic e, then I have reservations about whether those same fac ts would justify setting aside the Award under Artic le 34(2)( _a_ )(iv) of the Model Law. The short point I wish to make here is simply this: ultimately, whether there is a duty to arbitrate in good faith may be a moot point on the fac ts of this c ase given the dual purpose of the guerrilla tac tic s allegation. However, I do not wish to pre-judge this issue. It is CMNC’s prerogative to argue this issue in OS 185. For now, I will only say that I am not c onvinc ed that the alleged novelty is beyond the c ompetenc e of loc al c ounsel. 

_Third issue – use of AEO orders_ 

61     I do not regard the third issue – whether the tribunal’s use of AEO orders impinged on CMNC’s right to be heard – as suffic iently novel or c omplex to lean in favour of admitting the Applic ant to argue the point. 

62     The AEO order is a proc edural order rooted in US jurisprudenc e. The Applic ant therefore suggests that the c ourt will have to c onsider how the evidential prac tic e in one jurisdic tion (the US) 

c an impinge on another party’s expec tations of due proc ess. [note: 58] In addition, Mr Tan submits that, given the suppressive effec t of AEO orders, a determination on this issue will require a c areful 

examination of first princ iples and a c omparative understanding of due proc ess in arbitration. [note: 59] 

63     I disagree with Mr Tan and ac c ept Jaguar’s submissions on this point. The form of an AEO order may be relatively unfamiliar but the idea of a tribunal managing the disc overy of c onfidential doc uments is not. Whether it is a breac h of the rules of natural justic e for a tribunal to allow one party not to produc e doc uments to the other side in disc overy on the ground of c onfidentiality was c onsidered in the c ase of _Dongwoo Mann+Hummel Co Ltd v Mann+Hummel GmbH_ [2008] 3 SLR(R) 


871\. The imposition of the AEO order is one of a number of proc edural orders imposed by the tribunal 

that CMNC c hallenges. Another order was the tribunal’s dec ision to exc lude an expert report. [note: 60] These orders regulating the taking of evidenc e are part of a tribunal’s c ase management powers. It is not unc ommon to c hallenge the exerc ise of suc h powers as being a breac h of the rules of natural justic e. In _Triulzi Cesare SRL v Xinyi Group (Glass) Co Ltd_ <span class="citation">[2015] 1 SLR 114</span>, for example, it was alleged that the arbitral tribunal had breac hed the rules of natural justic e in ordering the plaintiff to file a report within a short time, and by exc luding an expert report it sought to admit. 

64     Therefore, I do not think this is a novel point of suffic ient c omplexity beyond the c ompetenc e of loc al c ounsel. 

_Fourth issue – duty to investigate corruption_ 

65     CMNC c laims that the tribunal had a duty to investigate the c orruption allegations espec ially in the fac e of Jaguar’s remarkably high c laim for c osts to c omplete and the manner in whic h Jaguar 

withdrew its c laim for the post-termination public relation fees. [note: 61] CMNC says that the tribunal 

should have investigated the allegation of c orruption by, for example, rec alling Mr Cordova. [note: 62] Its failure to do so renders enforc ement of the Award c ontrary to public polic y. 

66     I do not think the existenc e of the duty to investigate c orruption is an exc eptionally novel point. It has been ac c epted as a general princ iple in our jurisprudenc e that an arbitral tribunal has the duty and mandate to investigate matters raised whic h, if proven, would render the award unenforc eable for being c ontrary to public polic y (see _PT Prima International Development v Kempinski Hotels SA and other appeals_ <span class="citation">[2012] 4 SLR 98</span> (“ _Kempinski_ ”)). The Court of Appeal noted at [72] that: 

 ... public polic y is a question of law whic h an arbitrator must take c ognisanc e of if he bec omes aware of it in the c ourse of hearing the evidenc e presented during arbitral proc eedings. 

The Court endorsed the following passage from Gary B Born, _International Commercial Arbitration_ (Kluwer Law International, 2009) at vol 1, p 835: 

 Where the parties’ c ontrac t raises issues of illegality, violations of public polic y or mandatory law, or performanc e of administrative func tions, then the tribunal’s mandate must nec essarily inc lude c onsideration of those issues insofar as they would affec t its dec ision or the enforc eability of its award. 

67     The question is whether the statement of princ iple above is broad enough to c over allegations of c orruption. I do not think the argument that it does will be very diffic ult to make. I note that CMNC has filed an expert opinion in OS 185 from a leading arbitrator, Professor Gabrielle KaufmannKohler, whose view is that the arbitrator’s duty to raise and inquire into issues of c orruption is “well 

established among c ourts, tribunals and sc holars”. [note: 63] Sinc e CMNC’s own expert has ac knowledged that the duty to investigate c orruption is “well established”, CMNC’s loc al c ounsel should be able to develop the argument with referenc e to the relevant authorities identified by CMNC’s expert. 

68     The more diffic ult question will be _how_ a tribunal is expec ted to investigate allegations of c orruption. That is what CMNC seems to imply the tribunal should have done. It is not c lear how a tribunal would disc harge suc h a role. Professor KaufmannKohler suggests that in aid of their investigation, arbitrators may request additional evidenc e or explanations from parties, draw adverse 


inferenc es, or reverse the burden of proof if there is suffic ient evidenc e supporting the c orruption 

allegation. [note: 64] However, at no time after having brought the c orruption allegations to the tribunal’s attention did CMNC ask the tribunal to rec all any witness or seek any additional order from the tribunal in relation to the c orruption allegations. There is no suggestion by CMNC that had the tribunal inquired further into these allegations, it would have unc overed evidenc e to show that the Award was indeed tainted by fraud and/or c orruption. If so, I have diffic ulty with Mr Tan’s submission that the tribunal ought, on its own motion, to have investigated further. In a limited sense, I c an agree that the argument is “novel” in that it has never been attempted before. But it does not follow that it is c omplex beyond the c ompetenc e of loc al c ounsel. 

69     In the final analysis, I am not sure that the question of a tribunal’s investigative powers will oc c upy c entre stage in OS 185. The dispositive issue is whether the Award should be set aside for being in c onflic t with Singapore’s public polic y. That appears to turn on the fac tual question of whether Jaguar’s c laims were indeed tainted by bribery or c orruption. It is important to bear in mind that the tribunal did address its mind to this issue. It found that: (a) the allegations of c orruption had not been established in any c ourt; (b) no _evidence_ was submitted to the tribunal that would enable it to make any judgment or c onc lusion that c ould have any bearing on the matters in issue; and (c ) Jaguar had “quite properly” withdrawn a c laim for the public relations c osts whic h might have been 

affec ted by c orruption. [note: 65] The tribunal did find that there was no reason to doubt that the payments were not illegal. This, as Jaguar submits, is essentially a finding of fac t by the tribunal. [note: 66] Ac c ordingly, there is no question of the tribunal failing in its duty to _consider_ the allegations 

of c orruption. It is c lear that if a tribunal finds _as a fact_ that a c ontrac t is not illegal, a c ourt c annot substitute its own fac tual findings in plac e of that ( _AJU v AJT_ <span class="citation">[2011] 4 SLR 739</span> (“ _AJU_ ”) at [65]); the c ourt does not have the power to examine the fac ts of the c ase afresh ( _AJU_ at [71]). In that sense, as I said with the natural justic e issue (at [54] above), the sc ope for c urial intervention is limited, as is the extent of submissions that c an be made. On the whole, I am not c onvinc ed that there is a need for foreign c ounsel to argue this issue. 

70     That leaves one further argument on the fac tual c omplexity of OS 185 to address. Mr Tan submitted that the 30,000 pages of affidavits that have been filed thus far in OS 185 is testament to the fac tual c omplexity of the c ase. The rec ord of the arbitration itself runs to well over 250, 

pages. [note: 67] But it is not unusual, in modern litigation, for doc umentary evidenc e to run into tens of thousands of pages. That the evidenc e in OS 185 is voluminous is therefore not a fac tor in favour of admission. To hold otherwise might suggest that loc al c ounsel do not have the requisite c ompetenc e to handle a doc ument-intensive c ase. That would be quite unfair to the loc al Bar. Besides, the task of the parties and the c ourt in reviewing the voluminous doc umentary evidenc e in the c ontext of a setting aside applic ation is quite different from the task of a trier of fac t. It is even less demanding as c ompared to an appeal given the very limited grounds for c urial intervention. Findings of fac ts have already been made by the tribunal. The c ourt’s task is instead restric ted to reviewing the doc uments insofar as they are relevant to the limited grounds for setting aside the Award. 

71     I have therefore c ome to the view, having regard primarily to the c riteria of novelty and c omplexity, that none of the four legal issues raised by Mr Tan lean in favour of admitting the Applic ant. That said, it is important to c onsider how the four Notific ation matters relate to or affec t one another ( _Re Beloff_ at [55]). Although the issues are not in my view unduly novel or c omplex, there may still be a need to admit the Applic ant if it is shown that there are few loc al c ounsel able to handle these issues. I turn then to c onsider the sec ond and third Notific ation matters. 

**_Necessity of foreign counsel and availability of local counsel_** 


72     It has been repeatedly undersc ored that the c urrent admissions regime is to be viewed through the prism of “need” (see _Re Beloff_ at [42], _Re Wordsworth_ at [1]). However the question of “need” is nec essarily relative: is there a need to admit the Applic ant “bec ause of a lac k of available and appropriate loc al c ounsel” (see _Re Beloff_ at [44])? 

73     From the c ourt’s perspec tive, there is no signific ant need for foreign c ounsel. It should be c lear from the prec eding paragraphs that there is ample loc al jurisprudenc e on applic ations to set aside arbitral awards. It c an reasonably be assumed that the c ourt would be _au fait_ with this area of law. Although the c ourt hearing OS 185 would c ertainly _benefit_ from having the Applic ant’s formidably wide-ranging experienc e, it does not follow that there is a “ _need_ ” to admit him. Furthermore, settingaside applic ations are brought before our c ourts fairly frequently and loc al c ounsel would have the benefit of familiarity with loc al c ase law and of having argued similar c hallenges in the c ontext of the IAA. 

74     As for the availability of loc al c ounsel, Mr Tan admitted that it would not be beyond the ability of c ompetent loc al Senior Counsel to address the issues _in isolation_. However, bec ause all these c omplex issues arose _together_ in this c ase, that had the effec t of c ompounding the c omplexity of the c ase and “substantially limiting the pool of loc al advoc ates, even in the upper ec helons of the loc al 

Bar.” [note: 68] I have diffic ulty understanding why loc al c ounsel would have the c ompetenc e to handle _each_ of the issues _in isolation_ but somehow not be able to handle them _collectively_. Taking this submission to its logic al c onc lusion may give the wrong impression that loc al c ounsel do not have the ability to handle c ases with multiple c omplex issues. 

75     Furthermore, I note that there is no indic ation from leading loc al c ounsel that suc h issues, viewed together, were indeed beyond their range of c ompetenc e. Mr Tan however submits that, given the c omplexity of the c ase, the normal prac tic e of c onsulting loc al c ounsel to assess whether they 

would take on a c ase is not relevant. [note: 69] I c annot agree with this submission. As noted in _Re Caplan_ at [23], full details of efforts to asc ertain the availability of loc al c ounsel should be set out. The reason for this requirement is c lear. It is essential to establish a lac k of available and appropriate loc al c ounsel to handle the c ase. I was prepared in _Re Wordsworth_ to dispense with this requirement in _exceptional_ c ases (at [64]) and in that regard, I found that the issues in that c ase touc hed on public international law, whic h is not an area of law most loc al lawyers prac tise in. 

76     The present c ase, however, is not suc h an exc eptional one. Challenges to arbitral awards are brought before our c ourts fairly frequently. It is inc umbent on Mr Tan to provide some detail at least of his efforts to asc ertain the availability of loc al c ounsel. He did approac h one Senior Counsel, Mr Lee Eng Beng SC. However, Mr Lee’s reply that the Applic ant would be “more well-plac ed than loc al 

c ounsel” [note: 70] to argue the c ase is an implic it ac knowledgment that the c ase is within the c ompetenc e of loc al c ounsel, but that the Applic ant is _better placed_ to argue it. As aptly observed in _Re Lord Goldsmith_ at [54], the fac t that foreign c ounsel would do “an even better job” than loc al c ounsel “does not really address the question of nec essity”. Furthermore, I do not think it is satisfac tory for Mr Tan to approac h just one senior c ounsel from his own firm and to rely on his response as representative of the views of the loc al Bar. As a result, I do not have the benefit of the rec ord of efforts by CMNC to engage loc al c ounsel and I am not prepared to assume, as I did in _Re Wordsworth_ , that the pool of loc al c ounsel who c an ac t in OS 185 will inevitably be small (or nonexistent) suc h that there would be limited utility in going through this exerc ise. Based on the number of suc h applic ations argued by loc al c ounsel, it appears to me that the c ontrary is true. I note in passing – and this was a point made by the Law Soc iety as well – that CMNC has retained Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP, a leading loc al law firm with an established arbitration prac tic e. It has five senior 

c ounsel within its ranks, eac h with an impressive trac k rec ord in arbitration c ases. [note: 71] 


**_Reasonableness_** 

77     Mr Tan plac ed some weight on the Applic ant’s previous admission to appear in _PT First Media TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK) v Astro Nusantara International BV and others and another appeal_ <span class="citation">[2014] 1 SLR 372</span>, a c ase involving c omplex questions of international 

arbitration law. [note: 72] I do not think this is an espec ially signific ant c onsideration. This applic ation should be assessed on its own merits with referenc e to the issues in the underlying applic ation for whic h the admission is being sought. 

78     On the whole, I c onc lude that this is not an appropriate c ase to admit the Applic ant bec ause the issues in this c ase are not suffic iently novel or c omplex _beyond_ the c ompetenc e of loc al c ounsel suc h that there is a need to admit the Applic ant to represent CMNC in OS 185. 

**Conclusion** 

79     In the c irc umstanc es, the applic ation is dismissed with c osts fixed at $6,000 inc lusive of disbursements. Consistent with the c osts order in _Re Rogers_ (see [66]–[68]), suc h c osts are to be paid by the “true party” who stood to benefit from this applic ation, _ie_ , CMNC and not the Applic ant.
